0,"Okay so basicly we are became friends at the end of elementary school and I caught feelings really fast. She rejected me but said that we can still be friends. So basicly now I'm finishing highschool and I'm kinda fed up with everything. 

We are basicly BFFs, we trust eachother and we tell eachother everything. When we go out it's really fun, I really enjoy spending time with her but there are moments where she's like looking at me in a certain way or she gets a bit sexual. She touches my face or gets really close then laughs and makes distance again. If I try anything it's an absolute NO. I once kissed her and she slapped me. She also has a strip pole in her basement and she keeps giving me these lap dances but if I try something she just cancels me. Like what's the whole deal? Again I'm a bit confused, I have no idea what's she thinking, most of her friends think we're together, they don't know about lap dances but a lot of my friends sais that they sense sexual tension between us. I once asked her why she rejected me and she told me that she doesn't find me attractive - why is she doing this then? 

She asked me today If I want to practice kissing with her and I was like ""idk, if u want we can"", because I actually need practice and same story: she gets close, teases me, If I try anything she stops completely, if I don't she continues. I don't have a crush on her anymore but like I still find her attractive. We are really good friends, she's always there when I need her and I really don't wanna cancel our friendship. Most people said to me that she just wants control and that she loves having me on a leash. What do you guys think?",05Jan2020,3

2,"I moved to Toronto from New Jersey to go to school. I thought I wanted to be a psychologist, which meant physically being on campus for the undergrad degree was super important so that I could try to get exceptional letters of recommendation &amp; research experience for a grad school application. 

I no longer wish to follow this path. I have dual US/CA citizenship, so going to school here just makes sense from a cost stand point ($5k US/year vs $8k US/semester, roughly speaking). However, I'm considering switching to engineering, which means switching schools makes more sense for a whole host of reasons, namely cost of living being obscene, city life being cancerous, the job market is stagnant, the weather is depressing, &amp; the women are significantly less attractive here.

So to my question: given the long term goal of becoming an engineer, how do I maximize my quality of life &amp; work life in the mean time? The resources I have at my disposal are: dual citizenship, \~$25k US, a well maintained 2014 jetta, &amp; looks. 

IDC how ethical the advice is, if it's too far for me I'll just not do it. I just hate the city life, hate my jobs, &amp; don't want to live in poverty for the next 4 years if that can at all be avoided.",05Jan2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

 

I didn't know where to post this so i decided to post it here. Any self-help books, youtube videos, articles etc. would be great source of help!

It always seems like i'm the one that smiles and laughs the least, i am more serious than other people, i have a lot of good friends, but i don't like to talk too much i feel like it's a waste of time a lot of the time and i feel bad for feeling that way. It's not like i do anything better with my time i play game and watch tv series/anime, but i still see this interactions as a waste of time.

People sometimes call me boring and uninteresting, i would love to change that, but i don't know where to start.

I really love being alone, which i don't think is a bad thing, but when you are alone for too long it isn't good and you look at other people going out and having fun and you think to yourself, ''oh that could be me'', but you just couldn't bother to go out and socialize.

I like making friends, but i don't like socializing, it feels very tiring on the brain to think and have a conversation, boring a lot of times too (i know that makes me sound autistic, but i can promise you i'm not).

I talk to a lot of people every day, but i don't make any effort in making friends.

I would love to be a goofball that everyone likes, but i just don't feel like it, but i would love to change that, any help is appreciated.",05Jan2020,1

8,"I want to visit my family every few weeks. I rely on them for money to go study and many of my friends I see when I'm home on weekends. So I won't stop visiting.

But I see my brother as dangerous for me, my parents and other people. I believe he is very unhealthy for all of us psychically but also physically dangerous and I'm worried I might be responsible for debts or damages he might cause.

There are too many things happening, I therefore I will just list some things:

- he steals money from my parents. Uses their credit card, takes their purse. Most of the money we get back (once 3k!) But small payments, my parents don't recognize
- he rarely beats my mother
- threatened me with a knife several years ago
- rarely threatens to kill me in my sleep
- rarely threatens to kill my mother
- always insults my mother (stupid, fat...) possibly being the cause for severe psychological illness (me and my psychologist view this as likely) wherefore my mother isn't able to keep up against him anymore
- constantly tells me and my mother to shut up in different hurtful ways resulting in both of us not really talking a lot at home
- bullies me since I was a child resulting in me having to go to a psychologist and having several problems with social situations
- occasionally doesn't go to school, doesn't care about his future as my parents (especially dad) pays everything when he annoys him enough
- believes for all hard work like cleaning or moving things he can use people from poor countries. Therefore is not accepting to have to work hard at school, during internships and such. (He didn't learn this at home, we very much do some hard work and cleaning ourselves)
- is ungrateful. His 400€ Christmas presents were not enough for him, he shouted for hours at us. He didn't have anyone a present, my dad then took about an hour to talk with him alone and have him be happy again. Didn't care about me being devastated about taking my time for family and then having whole day ruined.
- he drinks moderate amounts of alcohol, maybe up to 3 beer a week and rare excesses. But that with 15!! My dad buys the alcohol for him
- he drives rarely motor bike without drivers license. Often sits on the bike of others who drive quite dangerous. My dad tolerates that

I don't have proof of him threatening any of us. Though I could start recording some of his insults.

Child protective services once visited us, they believed only him, made my parents go through one year of therapy to better care for him and told them to give him more freedom and money.

My parents don't want to send him away. My mother might would, but my dad definitely not. He will finish school this year and then be probably unemployed, maybe will start some apprenticeship but definitely still live at home.",05Jan2020,1

13,"I don’t know the proper name for it but I have a big phobia of needles and I want to stop it.

I’m not one of those people that don’t like vaccines etc but I have a phobia of the actual needle, so for all my life it’s been over 40 minutes to take a blood test, or hour and a half to get an injection at the dentist for a root canal, and it’s really bothering me. Recently I’ve had joint pain in most parts of my body, but recently I’ve had pain in my hands, fingers and wrists and it’s scaring me because I’m only 20. My mum has rheumatoid arthritis so I have been tested for that before (managed to get a blood test a few years ago) and I was told I don’t have it and everything looks good, but I want to go back for a check up and see why Ive been having joint pain. The only problem is that I absolutely can’t stand getting a blood test (last time I had 2 people held my arm while a 3rd took my blood) and I would genuinely rather get cut with a knife to get a blood sample than use a needle.

Recently, he started talking to his crush, and I believe he has told her how he feels about her. I think she responded with something like ‘I’m not sure about all this’ and I don’t think this girl sees him as anything more than a friend.

He texted me earlier today telling me how upset he feels about everything. This might not sound like a big deal but, he gets really upset all the time over girls, and I just don’t know what to tell him anymore.

16,"I’m home from college for winter break and I noticed that my family dog is acting absolutely crazy. She’s been in our family since I was I think 7 or 8 years old, so I know her very well. 

She’s a Bishon Frisée, 12.5 yrs old. Never had any health problems before besides her teeth needing to be pulled. 

Her back end is clearly giving her problems. Her right back leg has arthritis and she is constantly chewing on the area above her butt near the tail, it’s been licked raw. She’s been audibly trying to tell us something, normally when she hurts her paw or something she lets out a yap, but she’s doing some sort of moan I’ve never heard before followed by zooming from one end of the house to the other while having her back legs and tail tucked in.  It hurts me to see her act like that because it’s really strange, and the doctor said she may just be so old that she doesn’t know how to explain her pain. 

Vet basically told us to give her three different kinds of meds, and sent us on our way... Honestly I feel like this may be the end and that the rest of my family is in denial. At what point is her pain just not ethical to treat and we should put her down? She’s miserable. She’s only quiet when we give her anti anxiety medicine.

17,"Over the last few years, some of my friends have been the kind of people who insult each other. One of them will literally go up to you and say things like “you’re cringy” or “i don’t like your haircut” or whatever. Needless to say, they are very direct.

I used to get hurt by these kinds of statements, but I eventually learned to expect it. There are some insults I get over, but some others, that hit my insecurities, hurt more. For example, recently my friend called me cringy, and I decided that this was it and cut him off. He’d hurt me too many times.

When i told him that he was being offensive, like usual, he didn’t want to believe me. He said i was “insulted at nothing” and that i was too sensitive. He straight up said “my words can’t have hurt you”.

Can somebody please help me understand his point of view? Apparently, he gets to decide whether or not his words hurt someone. Or am I actually being too sensitive? Do other groups of friends say things like that to each other that way?

Keep it mind, if would have approached me in a calmer manner i would’ve been open to discussion, but he called me out for being cringeworthy in front of a whole group",05Jan2020,1
19,"So basically this all started when I was in 8th grade last year. My district does this thing where it takes a whole bunch of career paths and makes a program where you can learn a whole lot of stuff for that career path, and it makes it easier for you to get in to a college that teaches you more about that career. So basically, I want to be a firefighter, but I didn’t realize that the public safety program had firefighters. So I just forgot about it and moved on. Fast forward to august and my really good friends are all in the firefighter and police academy. I’m stuck at a school that I don’t like, and I have made friends, but they all want to hang out without me because I’m the new kid to their friend group. On Christmas Eve while with the family I told my mom I wanted to go to the high school that does the firefighter stuff. She’s said that if I can get into shape, I can do. The latest I can join is next year when I’m a sophomore, if I stay at my current school for 1 more year, I can’t go there next year. Unfortunately, I think I should have brought this to her attention before, because the interviews to get in are this Monday, and you have to submit an essay on why you think you should be in the program. Now here’s the part that I need help on. While I do want to be a firefighter, I also just want to go to the high school that the academy is at. The school is very high tech, and they really do put in the effort to help students who struggle a lot when it comes to academics. My current school, however, is a school that only praises the athletes. They pay no mind to other kids in academies. The only students they help is athletes and special education kids. I have an IEP ( integrated education plan ) that states that I may leave the class at anytime if I am feeling uncomfortable and need to let out energy, and I can also request digital copies of homework. Both of those things are ignored by most of my teachers. I am on medication for ADHD and it’s easier for me to do homework on a laptop because writing is something that I really struggle with. The high school that I’m trying to attend is one that acknowledges IEPs and actually watches students with them and makes suggestions on what you can add or remove. I know this because my friends and step sister have told me about this. But, my mom will think that I’m just trying to move in with my dad. She won’t listen to any of my reasons. If I was dying and the only way to save me was for her to hear me out, I would die. My dad knows that I need to be there for my own good, and I know that if I don’t go there, I will most likely fail high school. Any advice on how to get her to listen and how to convince her?

TL;DR
I’m at a bad high school, and I need to get into a good high school that actually acknowledges my IEP ( integrated education plan ) but my mom thinks I’m trying to move in with my dad. Help me get her to hear me out and let me go to the school that will benefit me the most.",05Jan2020,3

Recently my friend has been cheated on, and as much as she tries to act like it doesn't bother her, I can just tell it does.  She's talked to me about how she just can't trust anyone anymore, or open up, especially to men.  She's broken down on me, asking why it has to be this way.  It breaks my heart. 

We were both sexually abused as kids, by the same person, and so we help each other out as much as we can with being their for one another.  Recently, her ex didn't respect her boundaries, broke them, and took advantage of her.  He raped her, and molested her again, and got mad when she told him no.  It's completely set back all the progress she had made, and I just don't know what to do. 

Now she's been cheated on too.  She's been cutting herself off from family as well, and falling into her depression again.  She's asking me why this keeps happening time and time again. She's asking if she should just be with him, because she doesn't think she deserves any better. 

I've been here for her as much as I possibly can and I've mainly just been listening, supporting, and assuring her that none of this is her fault. That she is worth so much more, and that she didn't deserve anything that happened.   The issue is that I don't feel like I'm doing enough.

Im incapable of getting mad, and if I DO get mad I can never be mad for long(it's also rlly rare).
I have this thing were I just silently cry.
It sounds stupid... but I was never really able to express myself growing up and I was always pushed aside.

I am 17 a girl and I'm emotional even if I cant express myself properly.

I have a friend. He lives far.
After a year.
We came to terms that he liked me, I like him.
He asked me out, but we came to the conclusion it just wasnt time yet, and we were both awkward with the thought with the distance, how were things gonna work? What made us exactly 'dating'?
So we stayed friends.
But open about our feelings for one another.
Abt 6mnths later, I brought up
Hey if you like me and I like you, why exactly arent we dating? I really do like him and the distance doesnt bother me especially since we're planning on visiting one another. But this is the twist. He then tells me well he rather have the college experience.
Which what he meant was that he wanted to screw around with a bunch of girls. He didnt like me anymore.
I was hurt. Cried. He apologized. We took some space, and we're still extremely close best friends. 
Ive been trying to not like him, I dont want to get hurt again... im not the type of girl to mess around with anyone. I rather stick to one special person.
I find it so hard to NOT like him...
Its been two months nothings worked.

This is where i want advice.
He kept flirting witb me recently and I was like wtf I tols him multiple times hey bro please stop. He continued. 

And just its fckin weird. Am i being toyed with? Does he like me now? Does he not? He said he use to actually like me, but just... did i do something wrong? Hey maybe its just his preference he just wants to screw around.

But just idk. I feel awkward. And it sucks because I'm having such a hard time getting over him AND WE DIDNT EVEN DATE its just ughhhhh (god i wonder how hurt I'd be if someone actually broke up with me) it's hard being friends with someone i just want to hug and kiss and cuddle and headbang with at concerts.
Just ughhhhhhhhhhh 

THE QUESTION How do I stop liking someone? How do I detach?

I feel stupid. And im nervous for wheb he visits. What if his then like, hey! I like you again after awhile.

Guys have always been like no i dont like you, i like you, nvm, waiitttt i like you again.
And it confuses the hell out of me!!!

And the OTHER fact of the matter we decided when we first admitted we liked eachother that we would go on a date when we met and hung out.
I told him awhile after he said he didnt like me anymore, Hey yknow when we hang we're not gonna date right?We're just gonna hang.(my first attempt to detach was to set boundaries)

His response. He was surprised. Wait, really?
I said really.

And im just WHAT DOES THAT MEAN you said you didnt like me but still wanted to date uhm?????

44,"Backstory : married for 23 years. Husband brings in highest pay in the house - about 600 a week. Our adult kid who lives with us and I make a collective 900 a week. He is a severely emotionally stunted person and essentially has no relationship with any of us. On a good day he ignores us and may lend a hand moving something heavy. On a normal day he will threaten suicide,rant about all the ways life has not been fair to him,plays victim,and refuses to do anything. 

Our lease is ending and it’s time to move. But he is refusing to pick or do anything,he claims I could stop the move if I wanted to and acts like a child. He absolutely refuses to move claiming it is too much work and he will commit suicide if I make us move. Please understand this man loves himself more than anything in the world and these threats are tiresome - 20 years of them. I have two options : move locally,leave him,and get my footing. Our daughter and I both have steady reliable employment and while it will be right it’s doable. OR Move out of state,both jobs transfer although mine will definitely take time to get back to the income I’m used to. This is the dream to move far away but it is so scary. I keep trying to tell myself he isn’t that bad but he is. Any advice or thoughts are welcome,but please do not tell me to get him help or offer theories on his behavior. He is a narcissist and refuses help and I am not responsible for him. What should WE do? 

One more bit of info - the income history and long term credit belongs to him. We only started working in the last year.",05Jan2020,7

It will come as a shock to no one that it didn’t work out with her in the long run, either. Now, to her we had a fling, but I basically put all of my emotional feelings from my long term relationship into that with my coworker, and I became a total wreck. I took my feelings out on her and really did some damage to our friendship, which was a real important thing before we started to sleep together.  In the last month things have gotten better there in the sense that we don’t fight anymore, but it takes a lot of self restraint on my side. We are totally fine at work, but we no longer spend time with each other and it’s left a void in my life. At this point I have no self confidence and feel like I have the reverse Midas touch when it comes to relationships with women. Im sure I’m not the only person who has gone through this, and I tell myself it’ll get better, but I still feel like I am now doomed to being alone lest I ruin another relationship.

Even though I managed to fit in, there are always people that I come across with who would treat me lesser than others. It's even sadder that my own family did it to me which I won't really get into detail with.

I have been called lots of names as a kid, ""Short! Ugly! Poor! Faggot! Abnormal!"" you name it but I still always treated everyone with respect to the point that I'm seen as ""overly nice"" and some even labeled me as a ""people pleaser."" It wasn't noticeable as a kid, but now that I'm an adult, it is more apparent that maybe I'm a highly functional autistic person, and I think maybe that's why people bullied me all the time because they see me as someone different.

I have been struggling for years, that whenever a person says something mean to me, at that moment I would forgive them and say nothing. After that, I would go home and replay in my mind everything that happened in the past, the moments when people treated me like shit and I did nothing about it. 

I just want to break free from these chains, the negativity that others put me through. Part of me believes that I want revenge but couldn't do it, that's why I can't forget about it. I'm afraid I might lose it anytime soon.",05Jan2020,4

63,"My dad has suffered with addiction for a very, very long time. For most of my childhood he was an alcoholic, and after getting sober for a couple of years he started smoking weed more often and its gotten out of hand. I know some people say you can't actually get addicted, but either way when he doesn't have it he goes off the deep end. He got diagnosed with MS roughly 3 years ago and it really hasn't helped. The main issue is that he spends maybe $200-300 on weed a week and is all around an asshole. We tried to send him to stay with family out of state, wanted to set up a system where he's with them half the year and the other half us, but his own flesh and blood couldn't stand him and put up a fight at the 2 month mark, and we've tried to send him back for small periods of time since but they refuse. I think most peoples first response would be to kick him out, which me and all of his other children have advocated for, but my mom has a guilt complex a mile high and since my dad can barely take care of himself she won't do it. We tried to get her to force his family to take him, but she doesn't want to argue with them and thinks they'll get so sick of him that they'll put him in a home somewhere or put him on the streets. Next we said rehab, but the issue with that is that he has to actually stay, but we know from expirience with the alcoholism you can send him to a billion different places and he'll still leave after a day or two and say it isn't for him. We've even tried getting her to just divorce him, but since it'll leave him without insurance and he'll probably end up taking half of everything she won't do it. I'm just at a loss. My mom won't do anything that puts my dad on his own, his mom and sisters won't take him, he won't go to rehab. I hate seeing my mom so stressed and I'm incredibly frustrated.

75,"During dinner, my father (taxi driver) said that a vegetarian passenger only goes to wendy's because of the chicken, which is ""clean"" meat. I questioned whether he was vegetarian or not. Then I got this long lecture about jesus and how people had no option but to eat the ""clean animals"" and that you had to keep your body ""clean"" so God can be inside of you. (which is coming from a smoker). Then he was talking about all this bullsh*t about how the flood started. I then said it was a myth and he told me to go to church and do my research, trying not to be a hypocrite (he quit church years ago.) He even names his children after biblical characters (mine is Jeremiah.) I would have told him that people used to (and still do) capitalize off of your devotion to jesus and how people selected what was publicized, but I held back. He also said something about non-believers getting stabbed and how honorable it is to believe in something you never saw.

In april my class will go to china, and in the next school year they come to us. Each student will live for a week with one chinese student, so in their house. through the day  in china there will be multiple activities with the whole class  buy also with 'your' family alone.

Now im struggling to decide whether i should go.
1. Im introverted, like i deadass need my alone time.
2. Ive had some trouble with homesickness when i was little (last experienced about 4 years ago.)
3. Weve  been informed that the chinese students dont know english as well, (duh whole different alphabet its a lot harder for them) and the parents usually dont know any english at all so thats bothering me a bit for obvious reasons.
5. I will be alone in a house with people i dont know, who might not speak english very well, across the world. Damn. 

But if i dont go ill feel like i missed a chance, to see another culture. This is a once in a lifetime chance.

Dont know if i should mention but as far as i know im one of the few in my class who is doubting. Everyone is saying i should just go but rhinking about it kinda makes me cry. Ill have to let the school know if ill go on jan 6th. Thats tommorow... :')

So basically I feel like i should come out of my comfort zone but it might make me miserable. I can imagine it being awesome and me trying new stuff. Adn i kinda want to just go but i know me and might hate it and be miserable for a week in a country thats across the world. But not going would mean ill always wonder what i couldve missed and i might regret that.

Tldr: im stuck in this loop of going or not going and i cant decide, so im judt asking how do i approach this and what would u do in my situation?  It seems like the cons and pros are  50/50

Ever since I was about 5 I've always wanted to be an actor, like really badly. It's the only job course I've considered doing. I do drama at school and love it, but really want to do more and kick of my career at a young age as it's always better to start earlier that later. There are quite a few clubs/ organisations that teach drama to kids around where I live but they are expensive and I'm really nervous to start at one of them. None of my friends are into acting or drama and wont start with me and I feel like everyone at the drama clubs will already know each other and I will be the odd one out. The clubs near me seem to also mainly focus on musicals, and i'm not interested in them as I can't sing for the life of me. I don't want to do theatre as a career, more TV and Movies, though I do enjoy theatre. Is there another way that I can practice learning drama without being in a club? Does anyone know of ways to get auditions without having an agent or being in a club? If it helps i'm 14F and live in Australia

We talked for a bit, she wasn’t dry, and agreed to hangout sometime. Although that sounds great, I asked her when she was free and this was when she got quieter. I asked, “sounds great:) when are you free?” Then she just replied with “idk”

Me being the idiot I am, I said “idk as in you don’t want to hang, or you actually don’t know lol”
Then she responded with “I just don’t know if I can”. Further on I said if she does, let me know.

My gut is telling me she won’t let me know. But I want her really badly!

It was with an abusive ex, and I’m mostly finished processing that and I’m starting to move on, but the second event was a result of a hookup with someone else gone wrong. He didn’t even kiss me. He just had his hands on me and I was too scared to say no so I just froze up and let everything happen. There was never any PIV penetration but he made me finish and I left as fast as I could. Then the RA on duty laughed when he noticed the guy’s shirt was inside out while he was checking me out of the dorm. 

Before you blame me or say it’s my fault for getting drunk. I know. I shouldn’t have drank irresponsibly. I take medication for bipolar (I didn’t at the time of the first assault) and it makes my tolerance really low now, so I don’t drink anymore. As far as the second event, I should’ve said no.

We have two dogs. One is a American dingo(Carolina ) 1/4 huskie mix and the other is a boxer lab so there not huge. 

My dog named jinx and I have been thought a lot together (lab boxer mix) and she is a total baby. She is scared of lots of things- it will spook her from sudden noises. The only scary thing about her is that she has a very big, deep and loud protective/ playful bark.

Anyway. She comes up to me 2 years back to “be careful that black dog (jinx) could hurt my baby” so I am offended because this lady has never met my feking dog and is now accusing it because it has a big bark and wanted to meet the new puppy. My mom addressed the issue and nothing progressed for a while.

Until I let my dog outside one day and jinx slipped thought the door and bolted to there yard. She picked up there dog and ran inside. I apologize and there friend who was over at the time said that I didn’t need to apologize because that’s what dogs do. Play! So I think nothing of it.

Winter rolls around and we move our dog chain closer to our sliding door and closer to there yard.  Our dogs can barely reach into there yard so no one things anything of it. Well I’m picking up poop and she practically screams at me “you need to move that chain because your dogs are too close to my yard and can hurt my dog”
I ignore her and nothing seems much. She builds a snow wall and I’m like ok you figured out your own problem that wasn’t even a problem. 

Well she bought fencing wrap thing and wrapped it around the tiny part of our separation of our yard. (Around our connecting deck base)

109,"been talking to a guy that i met on tinder. it's been a few weeks and we've texted almost everyday. its super clear we both like each other, and we've talked about what we wanna do when we finally see each other. ('m starting at the same college as him in a few weeks. i wont be able to see him until my move in date) one of the things that inevitably came up is how he wants to listen to music, cuddle, make out, etc. 

this sounds great to me, as i really like the guy, but i've never kissed a guy. i've never had a boyfriend. let alone laid down in the same bed as a guy AND make out with him? 

i'm just worried because getting myself to actually go on a date with him is already a huge step for me romantically/socially since i havent ever been on a date before.

but since we've kinda talked about how we really wanna kiss each other, i feel like he's obviously expecting a kiss. i want to kiss him, but i dont want it to be weird, or have him notice that it seems like my first...

116,"So recently i started self-harming again for the first time in 5 years (minus one slip up a few yrs ago). It just sort of happened in the midst of stress from school, college auditions, and social interactions. But this is fairly recent and I’m managing, so i figure it’s no biggie and something i can deal with myself, as i had before.

But in the past week I’ve been super fatigued. The past 3-4 days I haven’t left the house and I’ve done pretty much nothing except lay in bed. This is super out of the ordinary for me. I even cancelled a date tonight that I was looking forward to for weeks. To make matters worse, these past few days I haven’t been doing any of the work that was previously stressing me out. I feel like a lazy piece of shit— but honestly even when I get up just to practice bass a little my body feels so heavy and exhausted. I feel so tired, but I’ve been sleeping like 12 hrs a day. 

Anyways, I looked up what might cause the fatigue, and it said somewhere that fatigue in combination with “thoughts of self-harm or suicide” solicits a trip to the hospital- but it didn’t elaborate specifically on why. I was just wondering if these two things could be correlated and if it’s something I can or cannot deal with by myself because I quite honestly don’t think I have the energy to come out to someone about all this in real life.

update: i tried to mention to my dad causally that i was feeling down lately and he yelled at me and said some really hurtful things. i ended up cutting a lot. i don’t really know how to deal with this, because if i tell a doctor or school counselor, they’ll notify my parents and if my parents find out, they’ll say much worse things and i don’t think i can handle that. they already think i’m selfish and stupid and am “missing a wire” in my brain and they have absolutely no clue about the self harm. i have no idea what to do. please help",05Jan2020,1

122,"I (27F) am trying to make a life decision.. Should I stay at my miserable job that pays really well or leave for one I‘m passionate about but is part time? I feel like I know the right answer, but I need a bunch of strangers to weigh in before I can. 

I’m currently working at a stressful but cushy job, I have my annual review on Monday, and am expecting a raise (65K). Since I started this job (1yr) the structure of my department has changed 3 times. I recently went from being internal to client facing which causes me a lot of anxiety. I still perform well and am well liked but I‘m not interested in this field for the long term. 

I recently got a job offer from an company that I LOVE, doing work that I‘m passionate about. The catch is, its part time…. 20 hrs a week meaning I’d need to get a second job (bartender etc), pay for my own benefits and lose a lot of my current financial security. There is opportunity for this to become full time or I hope it’ll lead to a similar (full time) job in the future.

My boyfriend applied to graduate school and will hear back in February where he was accepted. He has a really good chance of getting in and I‘m considering moving with him in July.

So there are essentially 3 outcomes
1. Work my miserable stressful job until April or May and save enough money to quit a month or 2 before I move to travel. 

2. Work part time at a job I’m passionate about,  money will be tight but it will help me get a job I love when I move. 

3. Work the part time job I’m passionate about, it turns into a full time position, don’t move.",05Jan2020,1
125,"When I was smaller, I was definitely a lot fatter than I am now, and was not in a good place overall. This was due to a combination of bad food habits and not exercising. Through just growing up and I’ll admit, a lot of rigid food restrictions I placed on myself (including extremely strict calorie counting), I lost a lot of the weight and I’m at a good stage, with a weight well within my BMI range and a pretty good body. 

I don’t know why, but I’m still obsessed with counting calories, even though I don’t care about losing weight anymore. I think an underlying part of me is scared I’m going to get fat again if I stop. Even if I try not to, an unconscious part of me constantly measures the calories of all I ate that day and how much more I can eat. It just makes me sadder and honestly, the reason I lost the weight was that so I could feel good about myself and stop thinking about food all the time. Does anyone have any advice about how I can stop constantly thinking about calories and focus? Or any cool things I can do to focus on instead to stop thinking about food all the time?",05Jan2020,3
126,"I've been taking music pretty seriously and practice guitar at least a few hours per day. My goal is to get into a music school. I'm primarily a guitarist, but I wanted to take up piano again after quitting lessons when I was young. During the Christmas season, I casually mentioned wanting a keyboard a few times. However, I didn't end up putting it on my Christmas list because I didn't expect to actually get one. My parents had told us (me and my siblings) that we weren't going to get as much for Christmas this year because we were going on a trip. I felt that a decent quality keyboard was probably too much to ask for. 

On Christmas, I did end up getting a keyboard from my dad. But it was probably the lowest end of quality you could get for a keyboard. He saw a dusty keyboard in the back of an old folks' home that nobody had touched for years, and he decided to buy me the same model. My mom asked, ""Is it a good one? Because I wasn't sure."" I wasn't mean enough to say that it absolutely wasn't. So I just smiled and said that it was a good quality keyboard. I told myself that there was still a lot I could do with it and decided that I would try to use it to its full potential. I told myself that I would buy a sustain pedal for it, and then it would sound a lot better.

That was until I recently realized that the keyboard doesn't support a sustain pedal at all. There is literally no way to plug in a sustain pedal or apply any sort of sustaining effect. A sustain pedal is pretty necessary for a piano. A lot of songs just sound really shitty without one. After realizing that I won't be able to use a sustain pedal with this keyboard, I just don't think it's going to work out. 

I would like to buy a better keyboard, but then my parents will be hurt that I didn't like the one they bought me. I still live with them because I'm still in high school, so I can't just buy I new one and hide it from them. They are under the impression that I love the keyboard I have now. I don't have the heart to tell them anything different. But I really need an upgrade. I'm completely willing to get a job and pay for it all myself. But my parents are going to be hurt when they find out I thought my keyboard was so bad that I got a job just so I could buy a different one.",05Jan2020,1

130,"When I was 17, I had my first experience with a girl. Only one problem. It was long distance. It wasn’t tough as I had never been in a relationship before then. But after around 7 months, I decided to end things as I wanted to focus on myself. A few months has passed since we needed things, but we still texted all time as friends. Although one day things got a bit heated through text (sexual) but I wasn’t aware of one little thing, she started seeing someone else, whilst we sexted...

I didn’t think much of this at first, but the sexting between me and her continued every day for about a week or so. At this point I started to get really depressed about her seeing someone else and didn’t know what to do. At this point I had just turned 18. It’s complicated, but she had an official relationship with the guy she was seeing on her end, and a secret relationship with me. However, she started to get really weird around things. One day I went to visit her, and yes. We kissed, had sex and everything. So she cheated on this other dude. But it I felt controlled. Like I couldn’t leave. Here’s why... 

She sent me a snapchat one day of her dads gun in her mouth, and told me “if I ever left her she would kill herself, if I ever told anyone we were together she would kill herself and if I told the truth about her cheating she would kill her self and if I ever found another girl she would kill herself. ”. We were both adults at this point. This made me very depressed, I felt like I was imprisoned. This literally went on for a year and a half. She never told me about her life with the other guy, so I pretended it wasn’t happening, when really I knew it was. I began to get really paranoid every time she was away, if she was seeing this other guy or not. She lied to me so many times about her seeing him, and this went on for a year and a half. 

In 2016 I finally was able to wriggle out of the situation. After I left her I felt so relived. I could joe finally get on with my life. But some anxieties never left. 

Every time I date a new girl, I always start getting trust issues, if their seeing any other guys behind my back, if they go on nights out, are they bringing men home etc. For a year and a half, all what was going through my head was severe anxieties about getting cheated on. Honestly if I could go back in time and leave her, I would have done it. It’s just one of those things you can’t explain.

For some additional info: I moved to the city I am currently living in about 3 years ago. I didn't know anybody so I decided to use websites like Meetup to find things to do with the intent of meeting people along the way. One thing I really enjoy doing is playing board games and I have a decent collection of them so I wound up joining one of the groups that did that. The group dissolved after the person who ran it moved but I invited everyone in the group to play board games at my house a few times and a few people ended up coming.

I've expanded the activities into going to see movies, doing escape rooms, and bonfires at my house and people come and seem to enjoy themselves but outside of the activities I don't hear from these people really. Outside of a few Birthday parties I haven't been invited to do anything with these people and it's kind of hard.

I don't have much of a choice about where I live at the moment unless I leave my job, which I would not want to do because I'm happy with my work life.

141,"Hey guys, 
I was born in the United States to two Iranians. It’s very obvious that I’m middle eastern, and when people ask about my background, I tell them I’m Iranian- because I am. 
With recent tensions between the two countries, I’ve noticed a lot of hate towards Iranians. I can’t help myself but to scroll through Trump’s Instagram page and read how harsh they are being to my people.

I say my people because my parents raised me to be proud of my culture and background. They encourage me to mingle with other Iranians at my university and I used to go to Iran every summer when I was younger. Although I was born here, got an education here and was raised “American,” I still feel like Iran is in my heart as well. 

I never thought racist comments, or generally rude comments towards Iranians would get to me. After all, I feel more American because I have gone through the “American” life. Again, I was born here!

I tell myself that I’m better than these people who are being rude: I’m currently perusing a degree in computer science- a feat within itself. I’m a teaching assistant, so people look up to me. I try to give back to my community as much as I can, I approach everybody with a smile no matter who they are.

So why am I letting these people get to me when I’m causing no harm? I’m helping myself and my fellow Americans.  

Sorry if this post is all over the place. I just don’t feel like I cant be myself with rising tensions. I’m scared to talk to my mom in her foreign tongue in public.

At the advice of a therapist, I decided to go no contact with them. I knew in the back of my mind that if I ever did contact them again, I'd be absolutely mocked for not having a house or career or making X amount of income etc. So if it were ever a possibility that I might contact extended family and my immediates hear about me through the grapevine, I need to establish my life first. (I no longer live in Australia.)

The problem is I don't even have highschool yet. This week are the last 2 of my GED exams before I apply to university. I've been so wrapped up in studying it just recently hit me that the whole damn country is on fire. I looked at the map and there's fires where my extended family live. (My aunt lives there who did reach out through email a while back because she was concerned for my well being. But I didn't want to reply because I can't bear to hear my family find out about my situation let alone the fact that I'm still angry that no one has ever asked me for my side of the story. They just seem to agree with my parents and on top of that pretend like nothing ever happened.)

I don't know man. I'm feeling so conflicted. Do I reach out to confirm extended family's status? I haven't talked to or seen these people in over 10 years. I guess there's way more context to this than I could truly sufficiently add to paint the whole picture. I was only ever interested in talking to my one aunt who was the sole individual who seemed to care about me through the whole homelessness situation. She tried to offer me money multiple times but I never took it. And in hindsight in childhood she was always looking out for me by telling me dad off for shit like smoking around me when I had severe asthma.

157,"So my brother lies all the time, every time he wants something he just takes it and even if you say no he’s gonna fight you for it. But outside of the house people push him around and bully him and he’s the stereotypical clown. Recently my dad wanted him to do some math problems to refresh his memory and get him ready for school after a long break. But instead of working on them he just said he can’t do it and when I’m my dad said your not going to sleep until you do it (we all know he can do it) he started crying
My dad can get physical sometimes but he tries really hard not to. I try to be nice and understand what he’s missing but I can’t find it. Each day gets worse and worse. When he was 6 or 7 he used to be obedient. I’m 6 years older than him. I feel like the turning point was when he started going to school. He took some bad examples and now behaves like that in the house. Whenever my brother gets in trouble he just says something like a baby and my dad has a weak spot for it and he just laughs and nothing happens.

162,"26/M. I live in Asia. 
Currently in dilemma on what to do with my life. 
I'll be graduating medicine after 5 months. The first 3 years of medicine was bearable, since it consisted mostly of exams. But the fourth year (junior internship) was hell. I realized how shitty it is to become a doctor in my country. 36 hours of hospital work without rest (if lucky, you can have 2-3 hours sleep in between), dirty politics and non-stop ass sucking of your superiors. I dread coming to work almost every single day. 

After graduation, we're required to take senior internship (1 year) then licensure exam. After that, 4-5 years of residency before you start earning a decent amount of money to support a family. And the hours. You literally work more than 80-100/hours a week, without rest or sleep during your duty. It's like doctors aren't humans. 

I was wondering if I should still continue this, since my entire family and relatives had been expecting me to be the first doctor in the family. 

For financial side of things, I write books and earn around 30-35k USD per year doing it part time (12 hours/week). I have no loans since everything is paid for by my parents. I don't really tell them how much I earn since it's easily 2-3x what they earn in a year. I just tell them I earn some money ""writing stuff"". 

The cost of living here is low. The average income of a low-middle class salaryman is around 500 USD. Resident doctors earn also around that much, while junior consultants (those who graduated residency) earn around 1900-2500 USD per month. 

I'm really torn between being a writer or a doctor. I can have all the freetime I want if I pursue writing, but the sense of fullfillment may not be there (maybe). And I'm afraid of the criticisms since people think that writing won't really bring in much money. And between being a writer and a doctor, the latter sounds more awesome in most people's opinion. 

I want to write and save as much money as possible, invest it and become rich enough to retire on my early/mid thirties. But I dont want to have regrets. And I dont want to look back 10 years later and realize that maybe I should have continued medicine, after all. 

To those of you who turned into full time writing, how was it like? And to the doctors, does it get better over time?",05Jan2020,2
163,"I am one. I know it beyond a shadow of a doubt and can say, with perfect clarity, that I have behaved this way in most of my friendships throughout my life. I am not proud of it. I am also super anxious and have a fragile ego. I cannot handle rejection very well and I'm sensitive. I have a friend who has been my ""best friend"" for a couple years now. We started out inseparable and I felt that I had finally found ""the one"" in terms of friends-- someone who would always be there, who wouldn't fizzle out and grow tired of me, who always included me, was eager to receive my texts and to always speak with me. It felt like the euphoria of a whirlwind romance, but it was just giddiness for the friendship. After all, I had spent my early twenties raising babies and had been so isolated that it felt nice to finally be acknowledged as an adult and to have so much in common with a person. I felt cherished in this friendship and was always ALWAYS laughing. This girl, to this day, makes me laugh like no one else.  When our friendship is good, it's great. When she goes quiet or distant, I question everything about myself. My anxiety is the culprit here for sure... 

My friend and I have since grown a little distant lately, and it hurts. Half of the time, I feel like I'm looking for evidence that she hates me (this is farfetched and is only based in my anxious world and not my reality) and the other half of the time I'm wondering what she's doing, reading into why she doesn't answer or it takes her longer to answer some of my texts, why she's only liking my stuff on social media and not \*loving\* it anymore, reading into her texts without emojis (it seems so tense without an emoji in my opinion) , etc. I feel absolutely like a middle schooler for reacting this way, for wanting to be her favorite, for jumping when she says jump, so to speak. I don't know a middle ground. I want to be a featured player in her life and I get antsy and weird and obsessive when I feel like I'm fading into background noise. I hate this about myself. I just want to be okay with this and not have my feelings hurt when I think about it. To acknowledge that it's entirely normal to move on from friendships, to change relationships with people as your life changes, etc. I've done it myself and have probably affected people the same way this seems to be effecting me. I want to see past my own selfish view of it and see it for what it is. We are changing. Our kids are growing older. She's on a different career path and making some changes in her life, etc. 

To compound my issue,  this person is also someone I work with, someone in a supervisor position. Even if I wanted to distance myself from the friend, it wouldn't help the bit about seeing her day in and day out and my need for her respect and good opinion. I just don't like how ""needy"" I feel. Like I'm a puppy waiting for scraps. I hate it. Any advice on how to snap out of it and put my big girl panties on?",05Jan2020,2

174,"Hello. This is my first post.

I want to introduce myself first. I'm a teenager. 

Throughout my life I was always looked at like a ""smart kid"" that follows the rules and people always liked me. I was blissfully innocent, I didn't care about anything except what was on my line of sight. I just enjoyed life.

But now.. times have changed.

I have been struggling with low self esteem for years. There wasn't any event that triggered it really, just a class about self esteem in 4th grade.

In that class I realized: I wished I had a different life. I considered myself ugly. 

It only got worse. People started to ignore me, and eventually everybody liked me but they still had other things to do.

I was betrayed by many. Screamed at. Looked down upon. People held me in very high standards at school. If I got an ""average"" score, people would act shocked. I was just trying to move on with life.

Then came the weight issues. I was severely underweight. My crush told me that in the face, and I started to work out.

Everything with my body is fine.. Except, another issue came.

**Ego**.

A deadly rival disguised as ""high self esteem"". I had fought for a good self esteem, a day where I woke up and thought positive things about myself. The day came, but it eventually went out of balance.

I was then called arrogant. Annoying. A manipulator.

The very thing I had fought for, became my enemy now. Now I'm called a ""Narcissist "". Because I simply wanted high self esteem.

I have the physique I wanted, but at a high cost: Compromising my social life.

But I still doubt myself sometimes. I compare myself to others constantly. The inferiority complex still lingers. 

I am now facing the two sides of the coin.

I'm arrogant but at the same time I hate myself. 

And my depression.. I am on better days now, but I can still clearly remember it.

The only friend that once believed in me, gave up on trying to help me. She was the beacon that gave me hope. She found other people that clearly made her happier. I couldn't do anything in my favor, anything that could've changed things, anyway.

Now, I'm standing alone, as I once predicted. I feel a conflict inside of me: One part wants to desperately give up, one wants to hold on to life; it hopes that one day, maybe, my life will change in so many wonderful ways, I can not even imagine.

They say that when one suffers, it's because great things are to come. I wonder: When will they come for me?

Once I was a very social kid, but now my friends have moved on, and for the last 7 years of my life, I am now a fully fledged introvert.

I think that, I must leave my peers behind. I sometimes think that I must endure this entire life alone, that everybody will eventually leave me, that it's not worth it to try to make friends, they will leave me. But on the darkest of nights, I admit:

I'm too weak. I can't just endure this alone. I **need** someone. Badly. A best friend.

But I still push through alone. And I expect to do so for the remaining years of my life.

I'm sorry if this post was too long. I tried to seek help by confiding in my friend, but eventually she got tired and now she talks behind my back. She talks to her other friend how I am so annoying.

But I love her, so damn much. I just can't let go. I am deeply connected with her. Every time I speak with her, it's just so wonderful. It kind of makes my pain go away. When I speak to her, I think that maybe I can change her mind. But still, I am nowhere near being her best friend.

179,"Okay so this is my first post and my first time on reddit so don't butcher me if I do something wrong. My sister told me about reddit so I decided to make an account and scroll around until I came across this subreddit so here I go. My whole life I have wanted to have short hair but I never told anyone because I thought they would judge me since it was not normal for a girl to have short hair. So a while ago I decided to google if I was the only girl who wanted to cut my hair short but I was shocked by the amount of girls who were feeling the same way as me. After that I decided to google short hair cuts on girls and scrolled through google photos for a while. I loved how all those girls looked with short hair but then I saw a girl with a buzzed head and I loved it the most out of all the styles. I trust my sister very much and I know that she is very open minded and accepting of everything so I talked to her about it while my parents were away shopping for a while. She was really accepting and cool about it, she told me that it would be really cool and that I would look awesome. I was really happy with her response and it made me want to do it even more. The next day I told my mom that I wanted to buzz all my hair off and she kind of pushed it off and pretended like she didn't hear me say that, I said it again and she asked me why I wanted to do something like that. I told her that I didn't like my hair and I wanted to cut it all off and donate it to someone who would love and appreciate it way more than me. She was confused and said that short hair is only for boys and you would look homeless, I told her that a lot of people are buzzing their heads and that it looks really good on them. She kinda raised her voice at me but she wasn't yelling, she just told me to stop and told me that I was being ridiculous so I just walked out of the room. After about 30 minutes she walked into the living room (which is where I was at at that time) and just pretended like nothing happened and acted normal again. She always does this when me or my sister ask for something kind of out of the ordinary and we find it annoying. Also I don't know why she acted like this because I have been a tomboy my whole life so she should have expected something like this to come up sooner or later. I haven't told my dad about it and I don't know how he will react. I probably should have said this earlier but my mom is pretty religious and my dad is not at all, also they are both really old school and by old school I mean ""eVeRyOne nEEds tO be sTrAiGHt,"" women cook, clean, etc., while men watch TV, and ""oLdEr aGE mEaNs wiSEr miNd."" Also I am worried about what my dad will say because he is kinda sexist, homophobic, and racist but he doesn't admit it. He also goes along with whatever my mom says, you know ""hApPy wIfE HaPPy lIfE."" In a lot of situations where me or my sister ask for something kind of out of the ordinary I feel like my dad would be okay and accepting with our choices but my mom kinda controls him and he goes with whatever she says like I said before. So as you can tell I don't know what to do, I don't know what my dad will say and I don't want my parents to be mad at me. What do I do? How do I convince them? Help me.",05Jan2020,1

182,"Hi guys. I am using a throwaway account because my other account is so obvious that it's me and I don't want my friend to see. 

I (22F) have had trouble navigating this friendship for a while now. I have been friends with my friend (23NB), who we'll call F, for about 6 years now. When I first became friends with F, the people around them didn't seem to like F very much. No one said anything to me, but people just seemed sick of them. Me and F really bonded and became BEST friends. Super close. 

So, as we got further into our friendship, F kept opening up more and more and I got to know that F is very mentally ill. F is severely depressed, suffers with dissociation, they are trans (which I am not categorizing as mental illness but it can be a burden when you are around the wrong people), they also think they have Borderline Personality Disorder ( they have many of the signs/ symptoms). There are probably many more things as well, I won't share them all here. 

For some backstory I will say that I used to have 0 boundaries with this friend. Whenever they dissociated they would call me and I would go where they were. F likes to have physical touch when that happens and it is VERY hard for me to be touched by anyone as I have abuse in my past. It would make me incredibly uncomfortable, to the point of wanting to be violent or ill, but I would still drop everything whenever F asked and be there for them. F used to text me when they were dissociating and say things that scared me a lot. I was 16 and 17 at the time so I was young and didn't know what was happening. They texted me things like ""I feel like I'm not real. I feel like I am floating outside my body"" with typos and weird words in between and it freaked me out. I used to stay up until like 3am almost every night because I was afraid that something would happen to them. One time I stayed the night with F at a house they were house sitting and they kept me all night insisting that I hold their hand while they just shook allllll night. That night felt insincere to me, as did some of the other interactions  we had. I started to feel like these episodes were on purpose, though I didn't say anything. They also used to call me and just lay all their depressive thoughts on me. The amount of negativity in F's head was surprising to me. I tried my best to comfort and point out that things are better than they seem but F would always shut me down hard and tell me to stop. I am not judging for the amount of negative things that F would say, I am just saying that I have never met anyone who thought the way that F did. 

Until very recently they had refused to get help. When I started opening up to my other friends and telling them that I was scared and tired and overwhelmed, everyone said that they had experienced the same thing when they got close with F. They described F as someone who drained everything you had and then would move on to someone else. I am not saying that F is faking, or F is a bad person. Mental illness is hard on everyone, and it affects people you don't intend it to and I understand that.

Anyway, as I grew older I realized that this was unhealthy and I couldn't lose sleep over this anymore. My mental health was declining from being in this friendship. I started pretending that I was asleep when they called or texted. I liked the normal parts of our friendship, I just couldn't take the unhealthy parts anymore. I was sucked dry. I tried to give all I had and eventually I ran out. We have grown apart since then although we are still good friends who talk frequently. I distanced myself so much that I will leave F without a response for days or a week before getting back and then just excusing it with how busy I am. I get the feeling that F thinks I am not a good friend anymore, they sometimes tweet things that seem targeted at me although I can totally just be projecting how I feel. 

Here is my problem: I want to be a good friend to F. I just don't know how. I have tried to avoid the dark stuff and keep our friendship light but that doesn't work. Really, I want to be there for the hard stuff. I just don't know what to do. Everything I have tried seems to be wrong. Whenever I do answer the phone I feel like I am no help and F is unhappy with what I say. I don't know. Does anyone have any advice about how to talk to a friend like this? I have mental illness, by the way. I have depression and can relate to some of the things that F has going on, but this is just something else. I have other mentally ill friends who I support and talk to and it's just not the same. I am not trying to look down on mental illnesses or anything like that. I hope I don't sound like a bad friend or person, I've just been at a loss for so long. Please give your suggestions below! I will be happy to answer any questions. If you got here thank you.",05Jan2020,1
185,"I feel like theres no easy way to describe my scenario so im just gonna write our history together: we met at a club between our colleges and i asked for her snapchat. We didnt really talk just had a streak and would respond to them every so often and we made a few inside jokes. We didnt really start talking until she asked me to her formal a few months later. I went with her and she was drunk off her mind so we had more jokes from that. After that she would text me about random stuff like her sorority, getting blacked out after taking benzos, and a bunch of stuff. The more we talked the more we began to understand each other and found out we have a lot in common (more than anyone ive ever met). Because of this, i friend zoned her because i knew i didnt want to catch feelings for her. She visits me. Nothing really happened just watched tv and made out. Then summer came and we talked a lot more and she wanted me to visit her. I visit her and i had a blast. To this day ive never had more fun with anyone. Just smoking, walking around in the city close to her, ordering food and watching stuff. Nothing sexual but i didnt know if this was because she took my hint of just being friends. The next day after my visit she reveals to me she had a bf. For what ever reason she acted like she hated him when she was with me. She tells me how shitty he treats her (flanking on her a lot, not caring about her, not introducing her to his friends etc.). I tell her if shes unhappy with him they should break up. She told me she had a hard time doing so because they had an on again off again relationship for years and hes an “og.” Eventually she breaks up with him because he crossed the line. At this point were insanely close friends. We visit each other a couple more times (platonic) and still have an awesome time together. This was when i realized i caught feelings for her and i asked for some space to lose them. She then tells me shes had a massive crush on me for months and we talk about dating. We gave it a shot and it ended a month and a half later because she was treating me like shit (ignoring me, lying to me and doing stuff i asked her not to). I didnt really care though because i know i was the best bf shes had and i did a really good job at it. Again, i ask for space to lose my feelings and she doesnt want me to leave. She thought i’d leave her (friendship) because she posted a pic of her nude facing away from the camera the night she broke up with me and i unfollowed her because i didnt want to see her slutting herself up (im not the angry ex bf type, she genuinely was a slut: she “hated” being friends with girls and she lets all her guy friends pipe her). The past couple months after the breakup, she still wanted to visit me and i’d visit her but it sucked. She would still treat me like we were dating and i couldnt lose feelings. I asked her to stop treating me like that after the visit because i wanted to lose feelings and she says she still has feelings for me and wants to date again. We didnt know how to feel about this though and we said we’ll see if we feel the same way after a couple weeks. After we broke up we got into a lot of fights. She would send me pics of her blacked out in a frat house, claim to still love me and treat me shitty. Because of this i kept blocking her because it was unfair to me. She would hit me up on another form of social media (even emailing me) telling me to unblock her and i did every time. When i visited her about a month ago, she still was treating me like we were dating and i was sick of it. But this time she was acting funny. Like she was reallyyy quiet like it would kill her to have a conversation with me. So after the visit i ask her about it and she says she doesnt know why she acted like that and that she’s never acted that way before with anyone. Seeing that this was strange, i told her we shouldnt be friends and i blocked her on everything. Im realizing i left out a lot of important details: her friends loved me, her previous bfs used her for sex, shes bipolar and i have depression, she never changed the ex bfs contact (even when we were dating), she has a drug problem (not like an addiction but she wants to try like every drug at least once), im pretty sure she lied to me about still liking me so i would talk to her again, im a fairly weird person but when i really know someone i get even weirder around them but with her i was the weirdest ive ever seen myself, i was the youngest guy she dated and im the same age as her(...), and im sure theres a bunch more stuff i cant think of. She would tell me a bunch of weird stuff about her past where any normal person would be like “uhhh red flag bye” where as my non-judge mental self accepted her for it because the past is in the past. But i want you to remember we’ve never clicked this well with anyone (how we treated each other over the summer), we have the same taste in everything, and we were each others favorite person. So, what i ask you reddit is if i should unblock her or not? Because i dont know whether to choose happiness or self respect.

186,So I was browsing Reddit when I get a notification from Google Hangouts. This girl started to send me links to random websites. She told me to complete them and send her screen shots. After I did a few (spent my whole afternoon and evening just so I can be nice). She was so stubborn after I did like 5 and each one took like 35-45 minutes. I told enough but she just wouldn't stop. She threatening me to do more or she would've done something bad (that's what she said anyway). I was scared so I did one more. After I did it she freaked out after I told her to screw off so I deleted her conversation and the app and most of the sites were porn sites. Now I have emails coming in non stop and I fixed most of it like deleting history and cutting ties but now I have texts from girls and calls from car dealerships.

187,"Hey guys. I'm in kinda a situation where I don't want to hurt my family, but I think this is getting serious. Also, sorry for the formatting issues. I'm not on mobile, I'm just young. First off, I'll give you guys some backstory. I'm 13 years old (ik very young) and I am growing up in a family of four. My dad, my mom, my sister, and I. And I also have anger issues, which cause me to ""outburst"", as my parents call it. It can get pretty out of hand sometimes, and I don't know how to control it. This causes fights in my family sometimes. I'm also adopted. Also, my parents are recovering alcoholics. They don't drink a lot and only do it on very rare occasions, but when they do it gets really out of control. There was this one time where I and my sister were playing on our old Xbox when my dad came upstairs drunk. The upstairs bathroom is my bathroom since I'm the only one who goes upstairs (our bedrooms are downstairs). I had left some of my money on the sink in the bathroom when I took it out of my pocket before I took a shower. My dad saw this and took my money, and wouldn't give it back because I ""shouldn't have left it there for someone to grab"". I started telling him to give me my money, my sister finally stood up and shouted at my dad to ""GIVE HIM HIS MONEY!"" and so my dad grabbed her, and threw her onto the couch. She had a bruise on her arm for about a week. There was another time (last night as of posting this) where my dad told me to stop hanging around my friends with depression because he thinks it's making me ***think*** that I'm depressed instead of actually having depression. My family is constantly calling me selfish, and a mess. I've also started getting suicidal thoughts, and have started cutting. I know its wrong. I just can't help it. I feel like if I was dead, my family would be better. I know there's more stuff, I just can't think of it right now. I've told one of my trusted friends about this and he says that it is emotional abuse. He's even offered that if this gets even more out of hand, I can stay with him and his parents. What should I do? Is this abuse or am I overreacting? Help?",05Jan2020,20

I’m 16 years old and just an hour ago my cat was put down at 19 years old. I’ve been crying ever since I last saw her. She has been for me for every fucking minute of my life and was the best cat I could’ve ever asked for. How am I supposed to deal with this? Is there any way?

193,"My recent new best friend \[M18\] who has been struggling with suicidal tendencies for most of his life has recently started overdosing on xanax taking like 10-12 pills each time. He has also started smoking a lot with hopes that he will get really sick soon. Ive tried helping him and being on his side and already barely managed to talk him out killing himself once a few days ago. The problem is that he is the last person he is willing to help get better and doesnt want to go to therapy or anything like that. He ran away from his family because they were being verbally abusive and sexually abusive and now he lives alone and i can tell he feels that he is in a dead end quite a lot.  
All this has made my mental health get worse. I have lost all my friends this past year and he is the only one left. But every time we meet i feel it might be the last at this point. My depression has worsened a lot and my suicidal thoughts have gone way up. I get by everyday not knowing if he needs my help, and unfortunately i dont know for how long i'll be able to support him since all this pressure is literally killing me inside.",05Jan2020,1

200,"So my roommate moved in about 8 months ago. I was introduced to her through a mutual friend that belongs to a young adult group I’m a member of. I did not meet her in person prior to her signing the lease as we happened to never go to the same group events. After she moved in it became very obvious from day one that she was on the autism spectrum and has a lot of other physical and mental health issues. I’m more of an introverted person and appreciate having some alone time in my apartment during the week. She is in graduate school and only takes one class per semester because that’s all she can handle. So she only has class on Thursday night for 3 hours. The rest of the time she is home and always has to be in whatever room I am in. If I’m in the living room she will stay on the couch next to me until I finally go to my room for alone time and then she will immediately go to her room. I once tried to sneak back to the living room after about an hour and she heard me and immediately came back to the living room and sat next to me until I went to bed. She doesn’t understand anything about social norms or personal space. She is 25 but never been on a date and asks me questions about sex all the time. When I brought a guy I’d been dating to a friends holiday party, she told him she wouldn’t watch us make out like she did with her last roommate when she would spy on them through the window. When she first moved in I was suspicious that she was going in my room because she made reference to some family photos I had in my room so I locked the door when I left the next morning. When I got home she asked me why I had locked my bedroom door that day. She memorized my license plate the day she moved in and monitors the whereabouts of my car at all times even though I’ve asked her a few times not to do that. She told me once that she got in trouble for stalking a girl she wanted to be friends with in high school. She memorized this girls class schedule and would make sure to be waiting for her after every single class. She also told me her therapist said she has an unhealthy obsession with me and that she projects her fears of abandonment from her mother onto me. Not something you want to hear from your roommate. It really is like living with a small child at times too. I’m not sure how she made it through college. She has a severe lactose intolerance but does nothing to avoid lactose. She gets diarrhea all the time but can’t unclog the toilet so I have to do it. For the first few months I had to unclog the toilet when I woke up, when I got home from work and before going to bed every single day. Once she didn’t make it to the bathroom on time, and when I got home from work that day she handed me a plastic baggy that had her spiked underwear in it because she wasn’t sure what todo with it. She also likes to put on dresses and twirl for hours in front of the fan. It’s very odd behavior. I can’t really talk to her about it because she also suffers from severe anxiety. She rips chunks of hair from her head, slaps herself repeatedly and cries loudly for a long time whenever she thinks she’s done something wrong (she also does this if I’m not paying attention to her). She will find a way to make any social situation awkward. When we went to Friendsgiving she brought a random guy over to me and told him that I wanted to have kids with him. He was as confused as I was and I think he understood there was something wrong with her so it wasn’t a big deal, it was just really awkward. She also ruined an event once by showing up crying with tears and snot running down her face. We all stopped to pay attention to her and figure out what was wrong. She was crying and having an anxiety attack because she isn’t gay and thought everyone was mad at her for not being gay. I once asked her if I could have the apartment to myself for 2 hours on a Sunday. She was planning on studying that day and there is a public library one block away from our apartment that was open. She casually said no but she would stay in her room for 2 hours. That wasn’t really what I wanted as just being in the apartment with her is starting to cause me anxiety despite never having anxiety before in my life but i agreed as I didn’t want to push her. She seemed fine and went into her room then came out 5 minutes later crying and wanting to know what I had said I hated her and wanted her to die. She believes so strongly that I had said that’s why I wanted her to leave for a few hours that I’m genuinely concerned she may suffer from auditory hallucinations. Her mind makes up some very strange scenarios sometimes and she can’t convince herself they aren’t true. Honestly, I think she needs serious professional help and probably should be living in some sort of group halfway house. It wouldn’t be so bad her being around all the time if she didn’t also have a lot of other ticks as well. When she drinks, she always slurps her beverages, when she chews it sounds very slurpy as well, and she will belch for hours every single night but never excuses herself or apologizes. It’s really disgusting.  She also is incredibly manipulative. She told me that she started keeping a list in high school and every morning she writes down everyone that wouldn’t want her to kill herself. After she told me that, if she decided she was mad at me because I didn’t spend enough time with her that day, she would tell me I didn’t make her list that day. Meaning it would be my fault if she killed herself. We are both catholic and both go to church weekly. It seemed like a purposeful attempt to guilt trip me for not hanging out with her every time she wants me too. But honestly I can’t stand being around her and in terms of being a roommate, she can’t take care of herself at all. She has never cleaned and honestly doesn’t know how. When she tries she just makes things worse. It really is like living with a 5 year old at times. I feel really sorry for her because her parents are quite emotionally abusive even though they are highly educated and very well off. Her entire family consists of nothing but doctors, lawyers and federal court judges and she is an only child. She also clutters (different from stuttering) but her parents never once put her in speech therapy because they don’t want their friends to know their daughter had issues. I’ve met her parent several times and the mother is clearly an alcoholic as well. I feel sorry for her but I also don’t feel like it should be my problem. I don’t want her to live with me after the lease is up but I also don’t feel right shoving her out to be the next unsuspecting roommates problem. And I need to tell her soon if I’m going to start looking for a new roommate but I don’t know how Her behavior would be for the five months left on the lease once I tell her. Sometimes her behavior is quite scary and I’m genuinely concerned she would hurt me or herself. I don’t know what to do in this situation or how to approach the conversation.",05Jan2020,1

202,"I'm 17 (guy) and my cousin is 20. During last summer
I was staying at my aunt's house for five days, and during one of the days my cousin slept at her boyfriend's house. Initially I was going to sleep on the couch because my aunt didn't know if my cousin was going to sleep at her boyfriend's house or not. Eventually though it became pretty late and so I realised my cousin wasn't going to come home and had slept at her boyfriend's, so I decided to sleep in her bed. I have slept in her bed before several times, as she usually has her boyfriend (and she is usually not single, at least I think) to sleep over at times, and let me tell you, her bed is extremely comfortable. It also smells good, and is a lot better than my bed. Seriously it felt like heaven when I slept there. Also, all the times before I have slept in her bed, it's been my aunt who's told me to sleep there, not like this time when I did it without asking.

So I never texted my cousin about this (by the time I had decided my cousin wasn't going to come home, I knew she was sleeping because she never stays up very, very late like I do, even if it's a Friday or Saturday). The day after, I was told I had to get up before my cousin came home (as I guess they would've thought she'd have been pissed if she saw me sleeping in her bed without her knowing), so I got up, showered, and then when I was done, I went up and saw my cousin. I, somewhat at least, assume a tiny bit that she had known I slept in her bed, as she smiled at me and asked what I was doing, and she usually doesn't do that. So am I the asshole?

TL;DR Is it embarassing/creepy that I slept in my cousin's bed without telling her? Or was it no big deal?",05Jan2020,1

204,"I'm a 20 year old guy from Canada. For the past 2.5 years, I've studied electrical engineering at a university. However, I didn't do so well this past semester and may be required to  withdraw. If that's the case, I have to wait a year before I can apply for readmission. The policy on readmission isn't very clear and and I'm not sure if I can be readmitted to electrical engineering or must apply to a different faculty. If I'm allowed back into my program, the choice is clear - I'll go back to school in a year. If not, I don't know what I want to do next.

Here's where I need advice. I know I want a degree at some point in my life (physics most likely if I can't go the engineering route), but I have also thought about joining the military for a long time. The thing is, if I join the military I want serve my country as a soldier while I still have the physical ability to do so. My biggest worry is not being accepted into a university program as an older student. I'm also aware of the education program that the Canadian Armed Forces offer (two months of service for every month of tuition-free university education) but I don't Know how it applies to military members who want to go back to school after serving.

If anyone can help me out I would greatly appreciate it. If you're a military member (Canadian or not), have knowledge about university admissions, or have been down a similar road as me, that's even better. Anyone's opinion would be immensely helpful though. If further information or clarification is needed please leave a comment and I'll reply to comments as quickly and in as much detail as possible.

206,"I'm 19F and I met this girl in one of my classes in uni. She is very nice but pretty religious which I am not (I grew up Muslim and now just non-religious). When I was 12 to 14 I had a few friends who would hangout with me by making me go to church with them. The kind of churches that are kind of quirky with a young demographic so there's like live pop Christian music and food and games but also a portion dedicated to religious talk. Every time I'd go I felt uncomfortable. 
This girl is nice and does not constantly talk about religion or anything but always asks me if I want to go to her church with her. I have nothing against Christianity but being in that environment makes me uncomfortable and I don't believe in any of it so it seems like a waste of time. I've told her before I don't care much about church or having a religion and that her church is far from where I live anyway but she keeps insisting.
Furthermore, I know no one but her there and we aren't close close friends we are just acquaintances. 
I don't want to  come off super aggressive and shut her down, but I'm not sure how else to straight up tell her that the church thing is not my scene.  I can't tell if she just wants to convert me (those previous church friends who made me go tried to lowkey) or wants to hangout with me but only at church??

She then told me she’s a distant person, and has trouble showing emotion. I then asked if i have a chance, and she said i do it’s just that it takes time for her to know if she like likes someone. 

She does sometimes seem sad and stuff, so i get a vibe that she’s been hurt badly before, since we talk everyday, i just keep learning more and more about her and the more i do, the more i get into her but i don’t feel like the sakes happening for her.

213,"Hello! I'm a student currently studying law in Europe. For a bit of context my father has been an expat and we've been moving our whole entire lives every 4-5 years. I've had the privilege of being able to go to international schools all of my life bar one country, the one I'm currently studying in, and was bullied and ostracized for the first 2-3 years of living there.

I know the language fluently because of my father and his side of the family. Even with this, at the time I had trouble making friends because I was often excluded for being a foreigner and outsider. It doesn't help either that I was very shy and clashed a lot with the culture. 

Years later I ended up applying for a law course here and it worked out well because it allowed me to take care for my grandmother here whose suffering of dementia + low tuition + knowing the language. I thought that what happened in the past is in the past and that I would have a good time studying and living in this country.

Now that I've been here half a year I'm extremely unhappy. Not only am I not exactly interested in my course, everything reminds me of the time I had no friends and was bullied. It sounds stupid being sad over something that happened such a long time ago but I can't seem to let it go. It not only affects my motivation to make friends and study for my course, but it has ended up in resulting me staying in my room as much as possible and leave only for things like groceries or important classes I need to go to. 

I've spoken to my parents about all of this and I've gotten to the point that I'd much rather be studying political science somewhere with international english courses and I'm in the process of doing so. They're amazing parents and have said that they support me in whatever I need to do to be happy and end up with a university degree. However, it doesn't change the fact that I still have exams coming up for this course and that I'm still most likely going to be living here and paying rent until September. 

What I'm trying to say is, how do I motivate myself to at least continue the course and do decently in my exams and not live like a hermit in my room. It takes so much mental energy just to get out of bed and do something productive and I don't know if I can do this for another half a year. It just saddens me so much that while I have my rent and living costs all paid and don't have to worry about debt or having to work that I'm still discontent with my life currently.",05Jan2020,7

216,"I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for me. I've been working for myself for about the last 4 years. I work from home selling stuff online. I would say my average work day takes up about 2-3 hours of work which include printing, packing, shipping and other small related tasks. I manage to make a living from this.

Before this I've always worked (for small companies). Some jobs I liked more than others but I can't say I loved any one job that much. There were definitely fun parts in some jobs. Nowadays, it's really hard for me to comprehend how I can give up 8-10 hours of my day to a job. I don't feel like it's reasonable, healthy, a quality way to live. Maybe I'm just used to working for myself.

The thing is, I'm alone for most of the day (my gf works regular work hours). I don't really interact with people and my work is pretty simple and straight forward. Same thing every day. I'm also not good with filling my day with hobbies or activities.

The truth is, since I only work about 2-3 hours a day, I could have another job and make more money. However, I haven't invested the time into finding something that suits me. I would prefer something part-time and flexible (I travel back home for about a month at a time two to three times a year). This is something I need to do and wouldn't be ok with limited vacation time. I also don't want to wake up really early.

With that said, I feel like I'm very bored, not contributing to anyone or anything, not taking advantage of earning extra income, not interacting with other people, etc.

I know that the grass is greener and probably once I do start to work somewhere I'll probably hate it. I don't know. I feel like I'm in a bubble and not participating in society. Any thoughts?

217,"This is unusual for me. I keep just about every issue either to myself, and sometimes I let it out to my mom or gf. Asking for advice from people outside of my small circle is very unnatural, but I'd like to hear any opinions you may have.

I have an issue. It isn't medically documented, not yet at least, but I'm sure I have an above average form of anxiety, and small form of depression. My mom is medically bipolar, with many physical illnesses, she too is convinced that I genetically suffer from something.

But, the issue is the effect it has. I'm currently typing this at 4am. I sporadically have sleepless/nights with little sleep. This is due to intense anxiety and stress I feel. I'm a young carer for my mom that I explained earlier. But I'm also mentally fragile. Like, I'm confident. Ngl I look good, a little chubby but good. I'm a 16 year old already breezing through a Computing &amp; Digital Media College Course. Plus I'm good at masking negativity for the benefit of others. But on the inside I feel very fragile. 

Small things get to me. I ""obsess"" over specific insults. I instinctually think of the worst possible scenario in most situations. Sometimes I just have random mood swings with little to no prior warning.

Idk if it plays into my issue. But since being born, my family have never worked. My mom has always been ill, getting worse through time. And all I know from my dad is he used to work as bouncer at a local-ish night club, and used to be a good British amateur boxer/Thai boxer(which I too have learned over the years, it helps with my ""confidence"") but that was before my birth. My dad now though is pretty lazy, argumentative, and from things my mom has told me, he's manipulative and controlling too.

I'm just kind of stuck. I can't say this is lack of sleep is a ""regular occurrence"". It's sporadic, depends on how each day plays out. If something negatively effective happens at like 10pm, then chief it's gonna be the only thing on my mind till 7am, and that's without mentioning the chest pain and body heat following along.

Idk if I explained everything correctly. I'm not entirely comfortable with throwing some of my problems out, I keep stuff to myself for a reason smh. Any suggestions on how to aid this will be greatly appreciated.",05Jan2020,1
218,"first off i am sorry for the title. I did not realize I typed / relationship in the wrong spot instead of after friend ship. And I cannot figure out how to fix that. 


I am not a person who makes friends easily and it is a rare occasion when I do. But at my work I ended up becoming friends with a guy who everyone was convinced he liked me. I always caught him staring at me and smiling. And it was a really cute smile. He always hugs me and stuff. I never thought anything of it, but everyone was freaking out that I may have finally moved on after 2 years being a single woman. But thing is, we aren’t dating, we never even made it apply as such. He was acting really weird. I have been telling people what he’s been doing and they are convinced he likes me. (If anyone happens to read this, and is curious by some of these things he would do, i would be happy to explain to the best of my ability. 

We always shared our snacks and our coffee and stuff too. Like he would always pick the chair next to me no matter what. And we would share our work lunches with each other. But in recent times. Certain people have been talking about my friend like we are together, and it is very awkward for me. I think it is so demeaning to him. He did one nice gesture by helping me carry some heavy items for a minute on Black Friday, when there were no carts Available at the store. And they just replied, wait you never mentioned his name before, do you like him more than friends. I of course replied no, he’s just my friend. They had thier doubt which got me not happy and I made a face. 

People I hate were staying over so I got desperate and wanted to get out of the house and I decided to ask him to just hang out. He said he was down but he would have to reschedule because he was really sick. (Which he was). But instead I ended up hanging out with other coworker that is friends with him as well. And I told her. He is my good friend. But people are getting convinced we are dating and I find it really awkward. Poor him man, and I am pretty sure she told him. Because I have really been standoffish to my friend. I haven’t looked up at him or hugged him much. I don’t talk with emotion in my voice anymore. And his friend was like I see what you mean about what you told me. And today at work they were talking and the coworker said have you noticed anything from what I told you. And he just said yeah I noticed. He hasn’t talked to me much,he hasn’t smiled, just like we were strangers again, 

Also yesterday his coworker informed me of a drama of a past co worker throwing around claims that they used to date. But everyone is doubting it because the kid is really weird and claims a lot of things. My guy friend told me that they went to highschool together he guessed, and like he had some classes with him and he was such a weird kid. I don’t know if he is just being weird with me because of this thing. Or he is just being strange with me but yeah. Can anyone tell me. If I ruined my friendship, and if these people who think we are dating and spreading lies. To the point when I hung out with the other coworker I was questioned if I was hanging out with him and how I don’t need to hide a relationship anymore. I feel like that bridge has been destroyed and I feel like it was all my fault, now I have to see him everywhere at work and he isn’t the same anymore.",05Jan2020,1
219,"Hello reddit, need some help and a small vent. TL;DR- Gonna die soon. How can I cope?

So here is where I need advice, the story is below. I'm an 18 year old young man. I always pictured myself getting married and having children, honestly it's my purpose in life. Problem here is, I'm going to be dead in a few years. Doctor predicted 25 would be a miracle, especially if I'm not a vegetable. I've know for a year, but I tried not to think about it. Imagine being told at 17 that you're going to die, and you'll have an idea on how I feel. Now, I'm thinking more and more and growing more.... depressed. Again, reasons below. Just wondering from an outside perspective, how can I feel joy again? It's been a while.

So here's the story. Thanks for reading. 
I was in a contact martial art. Rather good at it too. I was beating people in competitions in all divisions, bigger and more experienced then me. I was in top of the world until someone threw an illegal kick to the back of my head. I developed epilepsy from the blow, alongside a major concussion. Pretty serious and awful stuff. Well that was a year ago, when I had to do constant brain scans and tests. My parents would often fight with me over stupid things, can't remember what if I'm being honest. But I couldn't drive myself to these appointments and my mom had to drive me to one. This appointment was the one where the doctor told me the news. Basically my brain has grown accustomed to taking more of my bodies resources, like oxygen and is now deteriorating at a faster rate. Alongside a skull fracture and multiple brain bleeds, the doctor (a brain specialist and best we could find) predicted I was not going to survive my mid-twenties. My mom refused to attend the appointment. I love my family and we are close still, but do not have the heart to tell them and ask the doctor to keep it down low. He agreed and put it in my file.

That's the story of what happened, now onto why I feel like crap. 
So, as I said I want a family. Well, I want to be their for my kids. Can't do that if I'm dead. Don't want to leave my wife either. So, that takes away that dream. My future wife can find someone who will be there for her and her family. I'd rather that's oppose to maybe 5 glorious years and then I'm gone. So, that takes away alot of my Hope's for the future, never destined to be married. The point of dating, for me anyways, was to find the right girl and start a life. No point in doing that now either. I feel like so much of myself has been ripped apart. I don't know how to cope with being so alone. I have alot of friends, and I know my family loves me and all of that. I'm scared for what the future has in store. I have begun thinking about suicide more and more, and reached out and got help. Those thoughts whent away but the fact that I'm going to die so soon looms over me...

So reddit, what can I do? Live everyday I can as amazing as I can? Turns out that's an expensive lifestyle, but hey I don't have to save up for retirement! 

My plan is, move away as soon as I can. Far away somewhere nobody wants to go. I'll visit as often as I can and nobody will surprise visit. Then one day, I'll die and no heart break. Me and my dad talked about this, he says loosing a kid would be the worst thing ever... maybe this would spare him? 

Should I tell my family what's going on? Should I try and find a wife anyways but tell her upfront what's going on?

It's getting hard to look at the bright side , but it's thankfully still there. One thing is for sure, I'll miss the WW3 draft so have fun fellas! Goodluck out there reddit, have a good life.",05Jan2020,1
220,"My BF (M, 23) and I (F, 21) have been together for 3 years and 5 months. Long Story short --- we met in high school on a sports team and I was dating someone else at the time, let's call him Bean.  They hated each other DEEPLY and anyone could feel the tension in the room when they were around. I always picked Bean over my BF SO MANY TIMES and I cannot tell you how many times my BF tried to get through my thick skull that Bean was not for me and that I deserved better. In my senior year, Bean and I got accepted to the same out-of-state uni with a full ride scholarship. But when I saw my acceptance letter, I felt so sad. If I accept this, I would have to travel across the country with Bean to a school where I knew no one. The night before graduation, I told Bean that I didn't get accepted and was planning to attend the local community college in our city ( I didn't tell him about my acceptance letter). He was obviously sad but I felt like I made the right decision. I had to let go of this abusive, manipulative, lying, disgusting guy  or I would be trapped. So I did it, I broke up with Bean.  I was hurt by what I did and felt nothing but guiltiness that I broke someone's heart. But I couldn't deal with it anymore! No more lies, no more deceiving, no more excuses, no more missed anniversary celebrations, no more ""video games over GF"", no more abuse!! I was tired of being compared to other girls, I was tired of changing my wardrobe just so he can notice me, and I was DONE with being uncomfortable just to see Bean smile and laugh. I cried endlessly after that call not because I was sad, but it was relief. That I had the strength to overcome my fear of Bean and end it myself! I never felt that free .. and the fact that my BF was there when it all went down made me feel something that night.   
 When I attended college, my BF finally told me that he had feelings for me and understood that I was still hurt of what I did. He told me that he was willing to wait until I was ready to date again and no hard feelings if I didn't like him back. After some time, we dated and it's been love and laughter ever since. He makes me smile, he can finish my sentences, he knows what I like and dislike, my family likes and accepts him, he helps me through my anxiety attacks, he stays up countless hours to calm me down after nightmares, he sings to me when I can't sleep, he buys me my favorite drinks, he answers my calls no matter the hour, he surprises me with little gifts that make my day, and his friends accept me as one of them! We really think that nothing in the world can separate us! ... but I've been thinking lately. 

Do I deserve him?   


After all I did to him. I made fun of him, I bullied him, I lied to him, I made him feel like s\*\*t in high school, I replaced him with someone he was warning me about for so many years, and he loves me? Shouldn't he hate me? Or am I over-thinking all of this and I'm really living a dream? I love my BF very very much and I would marry him on the spot! And I know he would do the same with me. I brought this up once and he said and I quote, ""If it means I have to go through all of that again to be with you forever, I will do it again, as long as I get to be with you in the end and I'm the reason behind your beautiful smile.""  Is he really the one..? It feels too good to be true honestly.",05Jan2020,1
221,"Through most of last year and a bit before I used to smoke weed a few times a month with friends and at concerts and whatnot. I never really planned on stopping except for occasions in which I could potentially be drug tested (job and parents) until I met this girl. When I really started hanging out with this girl, who I had met through a friend, I noticed that I hadn’t really met someone like that before, someone who I felt a *real* connection to. We hung out a lot and eventually began dating after a few months and here I am now almost 6 months later significantly happier than I had been over the past year prior. There’s almost nothing I wouldn’t do for her and that includes having quit smoking weed mainly. Weed hasn’t played a good roll at all in her life so I said I’d quit for her. The last time I smoked was probably over 7 months ago.             
            
**That’s the backstory, now here’s my question:**           
I have a lot of friends who smoke and I always had such a good time chilling with them just smoking and vibing. I want to start smoking again but I’m not gonna do it behind her back or anything so I wanted to know if anybody has any advice on what I should maybe do. I know I could just not do it but I want to at least ask but I don’t know how I could do that without hurting her; I **wouldn’t** choose weed over her any day but the thing is she doesn’t have a problem with me drinking but the effects of that are obviously worse, the thing about weed with her is the bad experience she had with it (not smoking it). Maybe I’m just selfish I don’t know I just want to know what you guys think and if you got any advice.",05Jan2020,1

He asked to see the grades on Canvas, which is a site that shows you your classes and grades. I lied to him about my grades and GPA because, he would not let me continue with life if he saw how bad they were. He keeps asking to see the grades and I've been telling him the system is down. At first I was planning on showing him the grades on my laptop using inspect to change how it looks on my screen, but he wants to see it on his computer. He keeps asking when the site will be back up so he can see the grades. I don't know where to go. I feel so stupid and helpless for putting myself in this situation. Maybe I can create a fake canvas-like website that will make him think it's the real canvas with my fake grades not deserving of a good beating. Something he would be able to log into and look identical to the real website.

I do not know how to make websites or where to start. Or if this is the best course of action in general. That's why I've come here looking for advice. This is my last hope. Failure is not acceptable. I will do what is necessary to trick my father and keep my life.",05Jan2020,1

228,"so i’m currently still in high school and last year i saw a cute guy that caught my eye. being the dumbass i am, i forgot what he looked like. i told my friends about him, and asked if they knew him.  the only thing i could remember was that he had small eyes (yes, i’m asian). i once again saw him when i was walking down the stairs, and he was wearing a white champion hoodie. but once again, i couldn’t remember his face. 

until one day when i was heading to the cafeteria, i saw him again, but this time, he was wearing a sports jersey with his name on it. i quickly went onto instagram and followed him, and soon he followed back. my friends then told me that he followed back everyone who followed him, so i clearly wasn’t special. 

i basically admired him from afar as i was and still am a grade A introvert, and he had friends surrounding him most of the time. i only got the courage a few months ago to dm him on instagram, and i asked if it was okay to be friends. he said sure, and i talked to him everyday that following week. 

after a week of texting, he then requested to follow my private account with his private as well, and i accepted. the whole week was just happiness, and he was a very sweet guy, and we flirted through text. the last day of school was coming very soon, and i asked if he wanted to take a picture together. he agreed, and we took the picture. 

the holidays came and we still talked, and he was sweeter than ever, we texted all the time, and he could never stop calling me pretty, cute and hot (i think i’m not bad looking but not goddess tier either) and it would make my heart race. it was obvious i had developed a crush on him, and it seemed mutual. 

until one day when he suddenly got dry like the sahara and started replying to my messages later and later. it was confusing to me as he had literally flirted with me just yesterday so i stopped putting the effort into talking to him as he didn’t do the same. i soon confronted him about it and told him to tell me to stop if i was bothering him, but he told me that i would never bother him. 

we still texted occasionally, but it was just mostly him replying to my stories on my spam and just a few hahahas and whatnot. he also constantly posted about couple goals and stuff like that. i was confused and sad at the same time. if he was posting stuff like this, why doesn’t he want to talk to me? was it because he had met another girl or something? 

one day when i was feeling productive, i decided to learn a dance that would only take me five minutes to learn (i’m not a super great dancer, but i can pick up choreography pretty quickly if i focus) i posted the dance cover on my story, and i was wearing a crop top and shorts as i was dancing in my room and i didn’t feel the need to wear a lot. my stomach showed a few times in the dance but i didn’t really care as i didn’t have a bloated stomach. after he saw that, he shared a post on his story like this “yes, i’m jealous, i’m not ready to share you” and some other crap. i didn’t know if he was directing that to me, so i didn’t say anything. he soon deleted it and i was so confused. do i talk to him or not? 

so the new school year started and i was happy to see my friends after the long ass holiday. his class was once again placed very close to my class, so we would definitely be seeing each other a lot this year. so you know the thing where people would ask you to tell them something before 2019 ends? yeah. i told him that i wanted to get closer to him as he seemed like a great person. he said of course and that was it. we saw each other and proceed to smile and say hi and went about our day. 

just yesterday, he suddenly replied to my story saying that i was cute, and deleted it a minute later. i told him that i saw it and he said that it wasn’t him. so i asked him who was using his phone, excited to get to talk to him again. then a second later “he” commented on my old post to which he deleted a minute later. he said that it was his family using his phone so i was confused. i texted him to ask if they knew but he didn’t reply for hours, so i deleted it, and now i’m torn if i should give up or not.",05Jan2020,1

230,"I (17 F) am bisexual, and all of my close friends know it. I’ve been teased relentlessly by this guy called Jeremy (17 M): I considered him my friend, until I posted about him here. Many of Redditors opened my eyes, and turns out he’s an actual bully, since he uses my sexuality as a joke, tells me I’m going to die from “gay cancer” and so on.
I wanted to talk to him in person about his behavior, but he said he was busy. I think that was a lie. 
Anyway, I confronted him about it via text, and he told me he called me gay because I complimented him, and that made him uncomfortable. His Uber driver mistook me for his girlfriend once, and that made him uncomfortable. Is it weird that hurt me?
I know that doesn’t make sense, so let me transcript our texts:
Me: “Hey, can we talk about our problem?”
Him: “Sure, what’s up?”
Me; “I think you went overboard with calling me gay every day, and it’s the only thing you ever talked about to me: no “hi, how are you?’s 
Or no “hey, want to hang out?” And that you only talked to me to pick on me.
Him: “I know, I went a little overboard. At first it was just a joke. But you know how my Uber driver thought you were my gf? That made me feel awkward. And you only made it worse when you complimented me, or when you said I was your crush (as a joke: I do that to my friends).
Well, that made me feel awkward, so I started calling you gay so you would get mad and stop giving me compliments. But I’m sorry, really.”
And I forgave him, but I don’t know if I should’ve, since now I feel even more hurt. Why can’t he just tell me he doesn’t like me as a friend?

232,"I need some really good advice and maybe a good recommendation for a lawyer. I also apologise for the extremely long post but I'm at a complete loss in how to defend my rights anymore. 

Recently at my job there has been a lot of conflicts going around. I tolerate a lot, but this is beyond conflict martyrdom. 

I recently offered to move locations to a higher volume store with my manager. I was offered more hours with the move, as well as a pay increase to accommodate my extra travel once officially transferred. After the ASM stepped down I was also offered the position but told to wait until the investigation was over. (Before transfer I can put in for travel costs through a form I just recently found out about). Everything was great. My manager and I are close and I hit the ground running to get the new store back on track to be a great performing store again, something the company hasn't seen in years. I was making my goals here and then some, always 10%+ over what was asked of me to make for the store. My KPIs (key performance indicators) were through the roof. I was the dream employee as quoted by my DM and SM. 
It was a rocky start. My two new coworkers (the 2 out of 4 of us, let's call them co-worker A and B) didn't like things changing (as they never did their jobs anyway) and starting causing problems. 
My manager told me what needed to be done, which was generally a lot and I got right down to it; organizing, cleaning, etc. Co-worker A, didn't like my take charge attitude and started a bunch of drama at the store, saying I was rude to him and bossing him around, even though the only interaction I ever had with him was a polite request to help me move some product around bc I couldn't do it alone. He's a young guy (like early 20s). He also has this huge thug-life personality, draws a lot of gangster art on company supplies, carves into the fixtures when he's bored and has broken several things in the store out of anger. 
I'm encouraged to write a statement per my manager and district manager for the hostile environment I'm experiencing so they can bump it to HR. Fantastic!
At the same time, my manager starts battling against the (now former) assistant manager, co-worker B, as she kept calling off work or coming in late by a few hours. She was asked to step down as an assistant bc of her hours and availability. Completely irrelevant to the fact that she screamed racist comments at another manager from a different store and all the uncalled for outbursts she has thrown. Now co-worker B is pregnant so even though she was asked to step down or change her availability as an assistant manager, she was also informed THREE times that she would lose her pay and benefits bc she could only offer about 15 hours of availability. She agreed to step down and the change was made. Then she changed her mind and cried to HR saying it wasn't clear that she would lose anything if she stepped down. 

Needless to say corporate stepped in and started to investigate the situation. This battle lasted longer than it should have (3 months) and ended thusly as follows:

Co-worker A had a breakdown at work and charged at my manager in front of my district manager in an attempt to attack my manager. He was put on a forced leave of absence until the investigation was over. Not fired, just suspension. This suspension lasted a few weeks before they finally terminated him. Before the attack he was found hanging out in other stores while the only associate on duty, swearing at customers (listen motherfucker, fuck you, you bitch) and making racist remarks about how us white bitches came in and changed everything bc we hate Muslims (which is his faith and also not true, we just wanted him to do the job he was paid to do, it had nothing to do with religion). 

Co-worker B got off free and clear. She got her assistant manager pay back which she rubs in everyone's face every chance she gets, her maternity leave, and full benefits; without any of the responsibility of an ASM. She also still shows up whenever she feels like it, (2 hours late the other day bc she was getting her nails done) and uses company time to park her car (which doesn't take 45 minutes) and set up appointments for her kid's modeling gigs. 

My manager was scolded for this whole incident saying that we could have handled it better 🤷 

I got the shit end of the stick. I am no longer allowed to work with my manager bc it was found that I am too friendly with her. I am not getting my transfer put through. I am not being promoted to assistant manager. I have worked 50+ hours since September every week and I still don't qualify for health insurance bc I haven't worked 40+ for 6 months. I'm losing my hours. I'm being shipped back to a store I was underperforming in, where they are now fully staffed, left with the crumbs of hours. I'm being punished for putting up with a nightmare for 4 months and lost everything from the company I had worked so hard to obtain over the course of the year. 

I also found out that our new hire, the one to replace co-worker A, makes $18/hr as a new employee with no customer service experience while I had to fight to get my $11/hr with 15+ years experience during my hiring.

I'm losing this battle of caring anymore about this place and honestly if I wasn't moving soon, I'd just quit today. I'm tired, overworked, and just feeling disheartened about a company I felt so strongly about the vision they had and the passion I poured into learning my job and being the best. 

So what should I do? Should I contact lawyers? What are my rights in Illinois? Is it even worth the battle?",05Jan2020,1

I leave for work at 3am and I saw her in a car with another guy which I had no problem with since I didn't step up. It still hurted to see her with another guy, that on my days off I would still wake up in the morning and look out my window to maybe catch a glimpse of her and I happen to see her in different cars every night. One night a blue truck, next night a grey sedan and everytime she exits a car she has a blanket over her head and runs to her house, always in the early hours, this tripped me out. Last month, I happen to catch her leaving her house as I was walking from work and my god she looks abused, hoodie on and everything, as she feels guilty with herself but I guess the money is too good to walk away from when you're making little to no income and is lonely with daddy issues and I know for a fact that hundreds of men wouldn't hesitate to pay to take her to a motel/hotel to fuck her.

so i have this friend! best friend actually... we are childhood friends but we became really close again in high school- which is odd because we go to different high schools (went to diff middle schools too). since we don't see each other every day, our relationship exists mainly through texting. i had internet friends in middle school who i preferred to my friends in school for a while, so it was easy for me to get used to this. i just don't really talking to my friends in high school as much as i like talking to my best friend, but i'm starting to wonder if my relationship with my best friend is even real?

our conversations over text are nothing like our conversations in real life. in real life she's much more reserved and our conversations aren't as *easy*. sometimes we have really good conversations but most times its just stressful for some reason. but then we go our separate ways and start texting each other and i put these thoughts aside...

i've had a feeling for a long time now that our relationship would be much different, and even better maybe, if we stopped texting each other and actually spent more time together. we've been friends for so long, but i still don't feel i can be completely comfortable around her- and i think that has to do with this problem. i do really like this friend- we have so much in common it's crazy- but i feel like i'm being used almost?

We experienced a violent sexual assault in my family a few years ago so this isint our first time dealing with this sort of trauma, i’m just not sure how to handle the circumstances that my brother is presenting to us.",05Jan2020,3

244,"So my sister met my brother in law a year or so ago. They quickly got serious and married last summer. Soon after he showed his true colors. He quit his job and has been trying to get welfare, social security, and workers comp for a “bad back” despite numerous doctors telling him there is nothing wrong with him. Then his attempts to garner sympathy from my family failed and he tried claiming depression and had an “episode.” All the while my pregnant sister is working 60 hours a week for little more than minimum wage to support the three of them. I’m not trying to come off as a calloused dick but I’ve seen this a lot before as I’m a firefighter who has been to countless “medical conditions” that were suddenly brought on by similar situations (that are 99.9% of the time just people faking for attention).  I’m suspicious as a lot of symptoms and stuff he “shows” are inconsistent with depression. My sister finds anything negative towards him to be an attack on her (as she realizes that our entire family hates this guy). 

Now to get to the actual problem I deal with on a regular basis. Whenever me and someone else are having a conversation he follows me around like a lost puppy and he always tries to butt into our conversation with his own opinions and anecdotes when honestly the conversation has nothing to do with him. One time after a fire that burned all night members of my department (we are mostly volunteers) met for breakfast in a restaurant. The restaurant was empty other than us and a small amount of staff. We were waiting for our food and in walks my sister and brother in law and they ask what we are doing here and sit at the table next to us. He comes over to our table that is full of hungry, tired, and slightly cranky firefighters who just spent the last seven and a half hours putting out a fire that destroyed an abandoned house and damaged two occupied homes.  He sees that the conversation is not about him and try’s to flex on us about putting out a bush or some shit that was on fire when he was a kid and then talking about a “close buddy” who conveniently isn’t known by anyone is a hotshot for the local federal hotshot crew. He didn’t realize it, but two of the guys at the table are hotshots on that crew and our volunteer chief is a full time firefighter for the same federal agency that has one station in our area. One of the hotshots asks my brother in law the guys name and my brother in law said it and both hotshots chime in that there is no one by that name on their crew or any of the area’s engines or other hand crews. Everyone at the table started busting up laughing and I even saw my sister chuckle out of the corner of my eye. That was until she figured out my true opinion of him and she claims that I’m a complete dick now towards him after that. As if lying about something that small wasn’t enough of a reason to not trust him. 

Another time me and my dad were out back grilling some steaks at my grandma’s house and we were talking about some other thing and he just walks out and says something slightly related to the topic and then goes on a rant about something completely different. We just sit by and wait for him to finish or my sister to look for him.

I’m sick of just having him but into conversations for no reason and trying to not say something that can be considered by my sister is rude is like walking on eggshells. I’m moving away this summer for a firefighting job and don’t think I can keep patience enough to not say anything by then. What are some ways to politely tell him to fuck off when he tries this?",05Jan2020,1

247,"So if I’m being honest, I’m not that good looking and I’m an introvert who hasn’t really had a lot of experiences with females until about 6 months ago when I started working at Walmart ( I know its bad ). Over the months, I’ve met females and people who helped me become more of an extrovert and everything. Now I still occasionally need people to make the first move in a conversation, but I’m wayyyy more confident than I was about a year ago and I have the ability to actually communicate better now. Like I said earlier though, I’m not as attractive as most guys like I have a resting bitch face as a male which is rare as shit. Even my coworkers and customers have asked me whats wrong and wondered why I look so angry. It’s annoying because I could be thinking about Unicorns or some shit and I LOOK angry and I’m not one to make the first move, so all of those things add up. Now with all that being said, I have had so many crushes on females and I’ve never even been confident enough to talk to them. I realized how important first impressions are especially since I had a crush on my coworker when I first started. The only reason why was because I thought she was absolutely gorgeous and she fit the description of my favorite type of females for the most part, but I was very awkward when I first met her and stuttered often ( used to be a bigger issue, now I’m much more confident and don’t care about randomly stuttering ). Obviously nothing really happened and now even though we are cool, that was a relationship I actually wanted to advance but couldn’t. Now fast forward to recently and the new girl arrives, she is absolutely stunning and is super sweet and everything - but thats the problem, I don’t know if she is just sweet and nice because she likes me or if its just me not being able to tell if she is like that to everyone. Some examples of stuff she’s done thats made it hard for me to tell if she has feelings are

- Whenever she’s in my presence, and I’m about to leave to go do something else or my shift is over, she is always saying bye or telling me I should say bye to her (like multiple times a day) 
One time when I was leaving, I said bye and she asked me to come back to here and we basically did the peace sign but our fingers touched... I’ve never heard of a girl doing that because she is nice but I don’t even have enough experience to tell if thats just a thing people do

- She almost always notices me out of pretty much everyone who is on a register or near me. She literally waves to me whenever she sees me or she says hi and I won’t even really be near her. She waved to me when I thought she needed help from a manager and I was completely obviously and she did a laughing facepalm ( I was laughing too )

- I notice her looking in my direction or at me specifically. Happens anytime I arrive and things along those lines.

- She laughs and plays dumb sometimes or says  things super quietly. This pretty much guarantees that she will get me to stay around her. 

These are some of the signs I’ve noticed and I really like her a lot like she gots me in my feels and I honestly feel a connection stronger with her than any other girl I’ve had feelings with before. We actually talk and laugh and everything and I’d love to actually be in a relationship with her, but I’m not very attractive and I truly do not want to make things between us awkward and uncomfortable. She is super sweet but I have the iq of a toaster strudel and I don’t know what the signs of females actually feeling you are.",05Jan2020,5
248,"I have two sisters. One 7 years older than me and one 6 years younger than me. 

My younger sister and I have a more stronger bond since we live together. 

However we tend to stay home a lot. Like a lot. To the point where it’s selfish now. 

My aunt and my sister wanted us to sleep over during winter break while I’m home from college. Soooo, I really wasnt interested . I’m not doing so good mentally. Not even when I came home. So it led me to be quiet and a little responsive to everyone and  I was just very irritated, and i just wanted to be home.  

I also do those things where I hate the idea until it’s put into action. I have fun and forget everything. But I really let my emotions consume me this time when liked going to visit family and stuff.

My big sister has had emotions in the past that she never discussed with us about her being upset about us not wanting to visit her house until it was like months after she went through it. She literally came to the conclusion that we hated her, and we assured her we didn’t.  We are just. Terribly inconsiderate homebodies... from what it sounds like. 

Now I slept over my aunts house yesterday and so did my big sis because the party place is near her house. We all chilled  out a bit. Vented about stuff we can relate about, and helped prepare for my nephews birthday party. I thought it went well.. 

Then today we went to decorate the hall that was rented for my nephews birthday. We didn’t really talk much. (My big sis, little sis, bro in law, me) except when it came to instructions for where to put things. I assume that we were more focused on getting things ready so I didn’t mind the music or the quiet. I was also still emotionally unstable... unable??  so I kept to myself a lot. 

Then the party started. I got really nervous and didn’t want to be around a lot of people nor did I want to talk because I’m an insecure mole rat. So me and my little sis hung out with each other most of the time. Big sisters friend managed to sneak a pic of us and sent it to big sis. (Yes this is a major flaw of mine.. I can’t help it. It was unbearable and I wanted to go somewhere quiet and empty..)

She sent it to me first to Which I responded “LOOOLLLL” cause I didn’t think anything of it. Then she posted it on Snapchat with a caption like “ how much fun my sisters were having lol”. Knowing how she is and with that caption, Big sis took it personally. Then she posted it on fb under my aunt’s comment. 


Im rlly anxious because well, I let this happen. Whatever is happening. And all because I’m a weak person and I let my emotions get to me. I don’t want my big sis to think I don’t like her. 

And my big sis and bro in law are very judgemental people. Like holy shit I couldn’t believe the things that came out of their mouth sometimes. Even when speaking about children. I’m afraid if I talk to my sis about this, she’s just gonna talk to her bro in law and have a parade with our convo. 

Getting off track but, is this something that should be addressed before it gets any worse?",05Jan2020,1

250,"So a little bit of background. I'm a first year university student and have had this one friend since day one. She is one of my, if not, the closest friend in university so far. Let's call her Jane. We get along pretty well, asides from us having different views here and there. I'm that person who tries to give 95% into every relationship because let's be real here, 100% is exhausting. Every time Jane asks me to do something with her I'm in on it. I'm not talking about going out and stuff but things like going for a walk, buying grocery, etc. For context, we live in a dorm so it's not like we have to go to the other person's place or something. So mainly she wants me to be there for the sake of companionship. But at times I feel like I'm not receiving the same thing. 

For example, once I asked her to walk with me to the clinic which would take about half an hour, both ways. Jane refused and I understood, granted it was cold outside. But this other time, I asked her to go with me to the office in the campus which would take literally about 10 minutes. She gave me a BS reason and just straight up said she was lazy. Again, this was a tiny thing and I can completely do it by myself but just the way she said no made me feel a bit hurt. I've recounted many times that when she needs my appearance I'm almost always there like that time she was scared to be alone in her room so I came down to sit there and wait for her to fall asleep. Another time she was in a bad place so I took it as my duty as a friend to look out for her and stayed by her side for hours until she felt safe again. There're few other occasions that make me feel like I'm not receiving the same effort into this friendship that I'm putting into but you get the idea. I've had this feeling for a while but today was really it. 

A new student had just moved in for the winter term a few days ago and she asked Jane if she could go with her to buy grocery. Then Jane asked me if I could also come. We had just gone grocery shopping a few days before so we were a bit hesitant. But then I thought she's new and I'm glad to help out so I agreed to come. Cut to this morning I set an alarm to go and spared myself enough time to have lunch. But I got up and felt really crappy because I didn't get much sleep and my stomach was not happy with the life choices I had made, adding to the fact that I've been sick for a while. I went back to sleep and Jane came to my room to wake me up. I answered the door and she could clearly see that I was in a bad state but she kinda guilted me into coming and I don't like going back against my words so I came anyways. Before we went I told Jane that I had not had lunch and would like to come back as fast as possible so I could have some lunch. She said sure it would take about 2 hours at most and I was ok with that. Cut to the store I really wasn't feeling well so I sat down and had a cup of tea while waiting for them to shop. It took them way too long to just get a few things. Then they told me that they still had to go to 2 other places nearby. I had already told them I was not feeling well and told them to be as quick as they could. They didn't want to carry their grocery around so I was assigned to stay behind and look after them. Another hour went by I was sitting at the store the whole time and people were giving me weird looks. My phone also died conveniently. In total, I lost 3 hours of my time and it would not have made a difference if I weren't there. All I'm saying is if I were Jane, I would have been more considerate and tried to be quicker. 

Am I in the wrong here for expecting more? What should I do to balance the effort we put into this friendship? I don't know if I should tell her to put more effort or I should put less.",05Jan2020,1
251,I’m in high school. I have a friend that I have known and been good friends with since the 6th grade (we are now seniors). My friend has always somewhat hung out with the “popular kids” since all of their parents are friends including my friends parents. However he has always chose to hangout with out friend group rather than the “popular kids” until recently. He got a girlfriend this summer and his girlfriend has always wanted to be friends with the “popular kids” but never has been. She is way out of his league and I am convinced she is only dating him to get in with the “popular kids”. Recently he has barely hung out with us and has even thrown multiple parties and not invited any of us. What do I do?

253,"Hello,

Gay Male here, I'm 25 years old. I have a straight female friend that is 19 years old and we have known each other for about 3 years.

The two of us work together and we are good friends. Ever since we first met, we joke that we are married and everything. We kind of go on ""Friend Dates"". We will get dinner and maybe see a movie or go to the arcade after work. We have a good time. 

I just feel like this is getting a little serious. We have actually sexted a few times and I've sent her photos of me naked and what not. At the end of each hangout, I always feel like there is some kind of sexual tension and romantic feelings between us. 

We always talk about sex and when we have sex with other people, we tell each other and ask for every detail. She will say things to me like :""I need some dick!"" And stuff like that. And I always respond like ""oh yeah... me too haha"" but I always feel we are hinting each other that we want to fuck.

The problem is, I kind of do want to have sex with her and I feel like she feels the same away about me. I feel like she is dropping hints all the time and I keep feeling too scared and awkward to act on them.

Whenever we say good night after hanging out, it is so awkward and feels like we want to do ""more"". We are both too scared to make a move I feel like.

The question is: Am I misreading it or is there actual feelings and sexual tension between us? Also how should I approach this with her?""

255,"Hi everyone,

I am writing this post not to cause any negative opinions or feelings towards the marching band I am in. Again, the band is such a cool and fun experience but I've been having uncertain feelings towards my future in the band. Music is something I have always loved and wanted to keep doing but, I'm not sure if marching band is right for me anymore.

I marched in high school, despite always being more of an orchestra kid. I loved the energy that marching band provided, which was something I didn't get from orchestra and wind ensembles. My high school wasn't the biggest or best, we didn't even compete but I just realized I liked being outside and making music with my friends. Band was always a place where I was accepted for who I was regardless.

This past season was my first collegiate marching season. I marched with a div 1 band. I do not want to identify where as the band has a great reputation and I am just one small experience.

At first, I noticed this was the same high energy. I wanted to give it another try, after all I enjoyed marching in high school. It seems most people in the band really love what they do. If not, they wouldn't march another season. After all band is a huge time commitment. Everyone keeps saying how this band is such a big family or how anyone is accepted. Though during the season though I felt almost shunned or ostracized. Something I NEVER felt in a music group.

Don't get me wrong-- everyone is nice on the exterior. I just felt that I wasn't ""important enough"" to most people in the band. It seemed very hard to make friends as if friend groups within the band were already made and they did not care about welcoming new members- more specifically me. I was new to this. I didn't do DCI (drum corps, a separate marching organization not related to the school that some members of the band do.) or march with any of them before. I felt as if I was the only one not getting invited to extra ""band parties"". Events that the ENTIRE band is usually invited to. I would ask people who threw these parties if I was and I wouldn't even get a response, but others would. Within my own section, it seems that everyone wants to get to know eachother, but the second I try to say something everyone goes quiet.

Some first years jumped in well given they wanted to join TBS or KKPsi the two band service chapters we have. For most people that don't know what it is, basically a frat and sorority strictly about band service. People rush it like any other sororities/frats.  I personally think TBS and KKPsi do many wonderful things for the band, and I can not say anything negative about them aside from the fact is that I feel almost ""left out"" or as if people aren't interested in being my friend because I am not in those service groups. I did not want to rush KKPsi or TBS as this was very new to me and I really go to college for the degree not just band (something that a lot of people fail to remember it seems). It seems that I can't make friends with people because they already have their cliques based on what organization they are in. I feel if I went to be recruited for either of these, then they would reject me given they already don't seem to like me for some strange reason. Honestly, there's always going to be cliques in social settings, I get that but I have never felt so discouraged from being in a band.

Halfway through the season I wouldn't show up some days (as excused absences) because I really didn't enjoy going anymore. I put in SO much time with these people, and if I can go an entire rehearsal without anybody acknowledging my existence or even saying ""hi"", then I figured what's the point. **That was my breaking point**.

I really want to give the band another chance, but I feel as if people in the band just don't like me for some strange reason when I go out of my way to talk to people and make friends. I've been to some social events, but I strangely still feel like people JUST don't like me when I hardly talk to anyone. I'm really not trying to make this a ""nobody likes me post"", but its discouraging when you spend upwards of 50+ hours a week with 300-400 others that don't care you even exist. Especially when the band prides themselves on being a ""family"".

I feel as if anyone from the band found out I am writing this, they would shun me more for ""talking bad about the band"" and nobody I have talked to in the band would feel this way probably. Even if I just mention something small I don't understand about the band everyone gets all defensive and talks about how good the band is. The only person that I've talked to that mentioned similar feelings has a ""bad rap"" from the rest of the band for reasons to me that don't even seem ""bad"". I'm 100% not saying band is bad, if anything I love taking the field SO MUCH. There is no better feeling than being out on that field. I'm just saying it is SO hard socially and it seems that way ONLY for me. Our director is a great guy, he does not care nor probably know about these inside social what seems like politics of this band.

I have internalized this day after day. Is there something I am doing wrong? Am I speaking to people in the band badly? Am I acting badly? I really have tried to diagnose what the issue is over and over and I just feel as if there is something wrong with me that nobody will tell me about.

I would love to give it another chance but I would also want to know how to fix this. I don't understand how 400+ people as it seems already just ""don't like me"" when they don't know me. There is really no better feeling than being on that field EXCEPT being on a field with people that support me and genuinely want to be my friends. I would just like an experience similar to how everyone else feels. I want to love my band as much as everyone else does.

TLDR: Band is something that always made me feel good about myself and accepted. I am no longer enjoying band because of the social aspects of it and I feel as if my peers do not like me for some unspoken reason. I want to enjoy band again.",05Jan2020,1

259,"I’m a freshman in highschool. We’re almost to the end of the first semester and I’m not having a good time.

For a bit of backstory, for the past 6 years I went to school with extremely outstanding teachers. They came up with innovative and extremely fun and engaging lesson plans. Those six years were a blast and I’ve enjoyed school. Let’s say that probably made be a little bit spoiled with education. 

I’m in highschool, and four out of my 7 classes are torture for me. They’re boring, with the same dull, repetitive plans over and over again. Worst of all is my bio class. The only thing my biology teacher has ever done is give us a worksheet and she *literally gives us the answers*, then gives us a test asking about vocabulary a week later. No applied learning, just spitting back out vocabulary. She’s rude to some students. I could go on and on about how boring school is.

260,"tl;dr: Asked the downstairs neighbor to turn her music down, she came to my door and lost it and now I'm concerned for safety/ possible retaliation. Office and police can't/ won't help. Advice? 

We recently moved from a 1b1ba into a 2b1ba apartment. Our old unit was garden level (a sort of half basement) and our current apartment is on the top floor. We are few buildings down from our old Apt. This is important because we had similar issues there with a less aggressive neighbor, and was part of the reason we moved.

At the old Apt, we had a neighbor at the opposite end of the hall that would play music so loud I could hear it clearly in my own unit through my nice gaming headset. This music would also occur after the established quiet hours of the complex (9p-7a). We got the office involved and they said they administered fees and such but the behavior continued from these neighbors. I ended up just calling the non emergency police because it was intolerable for the last few months of our lease.

Now, in our current apt the issue is with the neighbor directly below us. I didnt want to bug the office because I had called them so much about our previous neighbor it felt like I wasn't being taken seriously. I have knocked lightly on their door a couple times and left a note once. They always quieted down and all seemed good for the first couple months.

Fast forward to today. I'm sick, trying to sleep on the couch. The neighbors are playing high base music that is very disturbing to me and clearly audible through my floor/their ceiling. I knock on their door, politely ask them to turn it down, all seemed well.

About 2hrs later I get a knock on my door. I thought it was my boyfriend who was bringing chipotle home and thought he needed help. I checked the peephole and it wasn't him, but a squat Hispanic lady I didnt recognize. I open the door and ask her if she needs something. She completely blows up at me, cursing and calling me a bitch and telling me to fuck myself. She threatened to call the office on us for our ""loud footsteps and late night voices"" and that she never complained about us so we shouldn't have complained about her and her shitty, screaming teenagers who stay up until 2am every night playing games and loud music. I calmly tell her that she should read her lease as it clearly outlines courtesy and rules about noise levels, and that footsteps are not equitable to tacky rap bass or screaming at 2am. She tells me off again and I say ok, that's how its gonna be. She threatens to call the office and police on us for our ""noise"" after I tell her next time I will take it directly to the office and/or police. 

I immediately called the office and requested a callback from the manager to get ahead of the situation, and give the poor operator an earful about the situation and my very aggressive neighbor, but they gave me the same response they always have. Now I'm concerned I'm going to have this crazy Hispanic lady constantly harassing me via police and the office as payback, and that I'm just stuck in this situation until our lease is up.

Anyone have advice or suggestions? I think I can make a case based on a clause for breakage in the lease, but I dont want to have to move again. I just want some damn peace and quiet, and neighbors that aren't rabid nutcases.

Hello lovely people of reddit!

My boyfriend(M15) and I(F15) have been exploring our sexuality in the past six months or so after ten months of dating. First, we started off with touching each other and eventually we got under each other’s clothes. We were terrified of becoming teen parents and never had access to any forms of protection, hence is why we only did fingering and oral sex. It was very enjoyable for us both. A few days ago, he requested to stop everything and go back to only kissing. He is a catholic, but(in his words) has been “slacking off” on going to confession and church. He believes what we are doing is wrong and wants to discontinue. Of course I respect his decision and would do anything to keep him in my life, but I can’t help but feel insecure, upset, and confused. I used to consider myself an Evangelical-Free Christian, but as of the last two years I am questioning everything I was taught growing up. I know I want to be with him for a long time, which is why I don’t understand why we have to stop acting such natural urges(while still being smart and safe about it). With my questioning and insecurities, I feel conflicted. He is my first love and I really don’t want to do anything to fuck up what a special connection we have. How can I be a better girlfriend? Should I further voice my opinions on this to him to try and find a middle ground? Or, would the last option be disrespectful? Kind words of advice are greatly appreciated!",05Jan2020,2

293,"Hi. 


I just moved back in to start another semester of college and 12 hours in I’m sitting in bed already extremely distressed about being back here. I feel like I already have a looming cloud of unhappiness and annoyance forming above my head and I want to try and deal with it because I’ve already decided that I’m not going to transfer schools or take a break or anything. 

These are some reasons why I hate being at school:


• This school is definitely not a fit for me. I used to not take those college commercials where they talk about “finding the school that fits you” seriously but I genuinely feel that I am a complete outcast and I generally have a predisposition to dislike the majority of my peers because many of them are snobby and pretentious and self-righteous. Sometimes I hate being a student of my school because I feel like it automatically categorizes me with them. 


•Despite disliking the majority of my peers, I am lonely sometimes because I don’t have any friends here. Well, I have people who I wave to and make small talk to on occasion but I don’t have people to talk to or spend time with or a social circle. Sometimes people are even rude to me, I assume because they might see me as an intimidating person (despite disliking people around me I don’t think people get that anger/annoyance vibe from me. I’m generally super nice to people and I think people have a neutral opinion of me)


•Living situation. The walls of the dorm that I live in are super thin and the people who live in the room above us are extremely loud sport kids who have parties everyday and literally jump off of their beds sometimes. The loud bangs on the ground (our ceiling) give me lots of anxiety and we’ve made reports about them in the previous semester but they’re still here. Furthermore my roomates aren’t bad people but they don’t seem to clean and I always have to clean and take out the trash but I try to not create conflict but telling them this because they all know each other and I don’t want to seem like the annoying roomate.


These are just the biggest reasons. I’m trying to just bear with it since I’ll only have to be here until June (summer break), but last semester my mental health got really bad to the point where I was suicidal and always sad or angry. I don’t want to be stuck in a cloud of annoyance and sadness like I was last semester where all I could think about is how much I hate everyone around me. What would you do to take your mind off of it when it’s constantly around you?



To/dr: I hate being at my college but I can’t really do anything to change anything so how do you deal with being stuck in a shitty place?",05Jan2020,1
294,"My Dad Wants Me to Lie About a Car Crash

I was in a car accident recently with someone for really stupid reasons, so stupid that I’ve changed the way I drive. We’re both young (early twenties). 

So the guy lied about what happened because we both would’ve been completely screwed if he didn’t, but the story he made up kind of makes it sound like more of my fault than his. I told my dad about it and his first instinct was to tell me to lie and say it was the other guy’s fault. 

I feel so guilty doing this, but I’m on my dad’s insurance and it’s going to raise his rates up so high if the insurance finds it was my fault, even though it wasn’t completely, or even if it’s shared blame I think. I’ve told my dad that I don’t want to lie in a way that will make it be the other guy’s fault because I also drove like an idiot. I feel even more guilty because he’s a young guy like me so how is it fair for me to fuck up his insurance or to possibly get him in trouble for making a false claim? I’m pretty sure the pictures I took could prove that he lied, but I really don’t want to do it. 

I really don’t want to lie in my own favor, but I don’t know how to convince my dad. He’s really pissed off anytime I say I want to go along with the other guy’s story, and him and my step mom keep saying no matter what happened it was his fault because he hit me from behind, which I think is bullshit rationalization so they can keep good insurance rates.  It just makes me mad because what if someone tried doing this to me if it was the other way around? He would be infuriated and think the guy was a scumbag, yet he’s forcing me to be like that (and possibly face legal consequences if this backfires).

So how should I got about this? Lie for my dad to keep his insurance rates fine and possibly ruin this kid’s life? Or go with the kid’s story and hurt my dad’s insurance for years?",05Jan2020,1
295,"This is very long I'm sorry but I don't know how to write about this in a shorter way. Almost 4 years ago now my cousin took her own life, she was 21 at the time. Obviously I was very upset by this, we were close and although I knew she had some struggles with depression I had no idea the extent of it and at first I couldn't believe what had happened. Her roommate was the one that found her and called 911, and after she went to the hospital and passed her mom (my aunt) and my father were the ones that moved her stuff out of her apartment. One of the first things I asked my dad about after I heard the news was if they found a note, and he said he didn't know because my aunt had been there to collect her things a few hours before him and if anyone would have found/collected the note it would have been her. A few days later I asked my dad if he had asked my aunt if she had found any sort of note and he told me that my cousin 100% did not leave a note and when I asked about the possibility that it had been in a place they hadn't cleared out yet or if in the chaos it had gotten lost or gone unnoticed he got very upset and told me he was sure there was no note and to never ask him about it again, and to absolutely never bring it up with my aunt. In the moment I figured he said this because he was in grieving and hearing me bring it up would only make him and my aunt more sad, and that explanation does still make sense but as time went on I began to wonder if there was more going on there then that. 

The only time I ever heard anyone in my family refer to her death as a suicide was the first time I heard about, when my dad called to deliver the news. After that point on everyone just referred to it as an ""accident"". I know it's common to call a suicide this because the word suicide itself can be upsetting, but it's more than that. It's an unspoken rule in the family that you can't talk about the fact that she committed suicide because most of them are very Catholic, and in Catholicism it's believed that suicide is a sin and if you do it you go to hell. I know not all Catholics believe this, but my family members certainly did and of course did not want to imagine that my cousin went to hell, so they just pretend that it wasn't a suicide. This was hard for me because I wanted to be able to talk to my family members about it in order to help deal with my grief but I felt like every time we talked about her death it felt fake and insincere. Their attitude towards her suicide made me begin to wonder if my cousin had left a suicide note but no one was ever told about it because they couldn't accept the fact that it was a suicide. 

I talked with my mom and sister about it and they had both thought it was weird that she hadn't left a note because my cousin was a big writer and wrote a lot of poetry and things like that, so they assumed that she would have wrote something before her death. The fact that was a writer wouldn't alone be enough for me to believe there was a note, but that coupled with my dad's slightly strange reaction to me asking about the note and my family's general denial about her suicide have led me to believe that there is a chance she did write one but it was hidden from the family. As time went on luckily I have been able to slowly overcome my grief and although her death will always be something that saddens me, I'm in the process of letting go and moving on. However, knowing the possibility that she could have left a note but it was hidden from me is something that makes it harder to move on. 

There are a few reasons why I am very hesitant to ask my family about it, though. My aunt is mentally ill and suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder, and after her daughter's death she was obviously destroyed as any mother would be, but it was made worse because of her mental illness. For a year or two after my cousin's death, my aunt was in a residential mental health treatment facility. Her daughter's death is very triggering to her and extremely hard for her to hear or talk about. If I were to go about trying to find out if there was a suicide note, I would probably first talk to my father about it but ultimately she would probably have to be talked to about it at some point, and I don't want to do something to make her mental state worse and upset her anymore than she already is, and I'm worried that talking about my cousin's suicide note would do just that.

 Another thing is that I don't want the rest of my family to have to relive the tragedy of my cousin's death by bringing up something like this. Although they may not suffer from severe mental illness like my aunt, my father and grandparents I'm sure would hate to think about the fact that her death was a suicide and I don't want to put anyone in the family through anymore pain considering we've been through so much already. I know that even if I do ask my father about the suicide note, he will probably tell me to not talk about it like he did last time and insist that my cousin didn't leave one. Even if there was a suicide note and he admits to that, it will have probably either been destroyed or in my aunt's possession, who I doubt would ever let it see the light of day. And of course there's always the possibility that there really was never a suicide note at all. 

I know that bringing this up at all will only hurt members of my family and I probably won't even get to see the note if it does exist, but I can't seem to stop thinking about it. It's been almost 4 years now and I haven't been able to drop this, I don't even know if finding out will give me the closure I want it to but I desperately want to know whether she actually did leave a note. I really have no idea if I should start trying to find out more about the possibility of a note, and I'm not even sure how I would go about it if I did decide to do that. Any advice is really, really appreciated.",05Jan2020,1

Long story short, I moved to my partner's country for the past 6 months, and so far it's been going good. Only thing is I feel like I can't adapt yet. Everything sometimes is too overwhelming, the city, the new lifestyle, the people.
Although my partner's friends and family are very nice with me, I feel like they still treat me like ""the foreign"" girlfriend so they tend to not talk that much other than small chit chat that very quickly is over. I miss my family and friends back home but I don't miss how life was there, quite honestly if they asked me to choose, I would pick where I am now. 
My partner has been (and is) incredibly supportive from the moment I got here, but at times I feel like I can't even tell him how lonely I feel.
Even thou I keep in touch with my friends back home, it's not the same here, and I've found just how hard making new friends can be when you get older.
Yet, being this lonely at times has make me think things through with more detail, and perhaps even become colder when it comes to shut down my emotions  to other people.

300,"Hey guys,

I am just seeking some opinions please. As I'm not sure how I should feel about this. Trying to remove emotion from this matter and just deal with logic and reason.

So I'm 34 years old, and found out a few years back that I was born with hip dysplasia (never had an issue until my late twenties). Long story short, I have the need to have two very major surgeries (both sides are affected).

Despite having health insurance, this has put some serious financial strain on me.

My parents have been very supportive and even came across to Australia after the first of my two surgeries (my family lives in NZ, I live in Australia). In conversation it came out that I was feeling the strain financially and my parents very kindly offered to cover my out-of-pocket costs (which I estimated to be $10K per surgery - which has thus far proved to be pretty accurate albeit perhaps slightly on the light side). In doing so, it was clear that the money related to this surgery and they were helping me as this was something which I was born with and out of my control (and something which my two sisters don't have).

I have recently returned from a brief holiday in NZ during which point in time my younger sister had, in conversation, let slip about how Mum and Dad had helped us on several occasions (think inheritance money) ""... and also how we got the money when you had your surgery"". At this point it became apparent to me that not only had my parents given me the $10,000 for my surgery, but they had matched that payment to my two sisters. My initial reaction was to say ""But that was for my surgery ..."" Meaning to say ""I am surprised you got this money too as you had no need for surgery"". In any case, the conversation dropped off then as it was a bit awkward. 

I have seen families fight over money before,  and I know it has the potential to ruin relationships, and I did not want this to ever be a problem I would experience, hence I pushed this into the back of my mind and it has only just now resurfaced.

I'm a bit confused about how I should feel about this. I think the reason I have felt a bit hurt and perhaps offended is that:

1. The money I was given - and the original motivator for giving that money - related to a surgery over which I had no control and for something that I was born with. The money went directly towards covering the cost of that surgery (side note: my parents have indicated that when I have the 2nd surgery they will pay me an additional $10K - and I am sure will once again match the payment to my sisters). The money that my sisters were given could be spent on anything they want.

and; 

2. Everyone else was in the know about who was receiving what, other than me - I feel like information was withheld   
from me and it would have been my preference to just be told upfront ""by the way, we will be giving this same   
amount of money to your two sisters"". 

  
My thoughts now, are that even if this could have been handled better by my parents, their intentions were good. They have endeavored to treat all their kids the same (at least this is what I think). 

Perhaps what the money is used for is now somewhat irrelevant? Fact of the matter is, I was in financial need, my parents helped me out, for which I am extremely grateful, and they have given an equal amount of money to all siblings. 

This is my current viewpoint. However I am keen  to get anyone's opinion on this please. 

Bottom line, it is up to my parents how they spend their money and as they see fit. I do however have a desire to be treated equally to my siblings, and I'm not sure if this was or wasn't equal treatment.  


Was it the right thing for my parents to give this money to all siblings after deciding to assist me with this condition? Correct me if I am wrong, but I think my initial reaction and feelings were understandable, but perhaps not feelings that I should hold on to ? 

It is after all surely not my parents responsibility to balance out the karma in the universe!

301,"Hello! Hope everyone is doing well.

Basically, in short, I'm in a situation where my exgirlfriend with PTSD ended up being quite damaging to my mental health up until we broke up and even for awhile afterward. We had a club that we both mutually went to. For me, personally, this club is quite an important part of college for me. Now, however, I do not even want to step foot into a meeting or activity. The thought of even seeing her makes me full of anxiety and dread. The club revolves quite heavily around group discussions as well, so that makes it even more terrible. I'm really lost and struggling with what to do. I want to go back to the club because it's important to me, but I'm afraid seeing and interacting with my exgirlfriend would be like tearing off a mental scab, if that makes sense.

Lately, I’ve been feeling frustrated and impatient constantly whenever I’m at my house. I don’t usually feel this when I’m with my friends. My parents both have to work so they just leave the house to me most of the time. I feel kind of this heavy feeling in my chest and it just frustrates me. I wish it’d go away. It has even caused me to fight with my parents. My mom said that I didn’t clean up the house right, and fine, maybe I didn’t like I usually would. But I just snapped at them. I should of just kept my mouth shut, but I didn’t. I felt that it was unfair because my mom would just always say that she’s tired from working all day and I should take care of it on her off days. I understand that, but I still felt that it was unfair? It’s just the way she portrays her ‘tiredness’ to me. She’s always on her phone at home and we almost never talk to each other properly? We have deep conversations rarely, my mom just doesn’t seem to want to talk to me. She would also wake up 6 in the morning to make food, and then complain about it later saying that she had to get up so early in the morning to make food, like it was something she had to do. Mom didn’t have to wake up so early in the morning, especially when she’s sick. I just don’t understand? Personally, I can connect with my dad more than my mom. The thing I didn’t like was how he would say he knows everything about me, like he just knows what I’m thinking. I have my own thoughts and he just always seemed to assume a lot of things. On the most important things he would get wrong, and my dad would always say something along the lines of “So you just want me to praise you on this mess?” Of course not! I wouldn’t know what to respond. But they just doesn’t seem to listen. I don’t know how to explain it properly, and my parents would just think that it was me rebelling or something? I just don’t know how to explain it, and when they say that we should just sit down and explain what I had to say, I would just feel so awkward and never say anything. I don’t know how to explain it to them. I would suddenly want to cry thinking about it. I still feel angry at them even though I shouldn’t? I feel so stuffed in my home and it’s suffocating in a way. All I want to do is just draw or write but that seems to be the cause? When I couldn’t get it right, it would just make me feel frustrated and that heavy feeling would come back. This would also happen whenever I don’t get something and when I can’t find the answer. Even though I practice so much, why is it that I can’t improve? I couldn’t find any interesting thing to write about. My mom yelling at me didn’t improve my mood and I just snapped. Honestly, I just want to punch a wall or something. All I do now is just watching videos on YouTube or anime or something instead because it seems like I’m just bad at those things and it makes me feel awful. It’s frustrating. I don’t want that. My parents don’t like it either. It’s beginning to make me feel even more impatient and I hate it. It’s annoying and just an awful feeling to deal with. 

How do I make the feeling go away? Also, while at it, what’s the best way to avoid procrastination and improve? 

Thanks

P.S. I feel much better after writing all of this out, by the way. It’s not completely off my chest, but it definitely feels lighter. :)",05Jan2020,4
304,"So, daughter (23f) just announced she’s pregnant by unofficial bf, (35m). They have known each other about 4 mths and think it’s great. She can’t care for herself really, is in huge debt, lives at home, has no savings, and has been at her job 7mths (where she met him) and used up all of her sick time. Also, has a dog I primarily care for. I (41f) don’t know what to say to her - told her I need to process so I don’t say anything hurtful (she dropped this bomb w/ her pregnant friend sitting there as a buffer).

Seemed fair to me so i met up with him and took it home and noticed the power cord was fucked up. So i took the xbox to my friends house who had a compatible cable (they switched the cable after the xbox one s came out) and i found out it wouldnt turn on at all for more than a couple seconds. I looked and this dickhead had blocked me on facebook. I found his instgram and im thinking about doing a roast and tagging his fucking ass in it. It was going to be a late christmas present to my girl because shes been trying to take an interest in gaming to spend time with me. Money has been tight lately so i ended up making her a song for christmas. (I rap). Im a very honest person and will continue to be, but i took this shit very personally.

306,"My boyfriend and I have been together for just over two years now. He's from New Zealand and I'm Canadian.

He came to Canada to be with me for two years...that was about a year and a half ago.

Now we have less than a year left and I have to get used to long distance again.

The problem? I don't have anyone this time. I left my family only a month ago as they were very abusive and I completely forgot about the fact that I'd have to learn to live alone. I have really bad mental illnesses and I've never lived on my own. I have no friends or family or anyone to help.

He wants to break up when he leaves because he doesn't think it's fair to me and wants to get me a dog that I'll be able to look after and hopefully train as my service dog eventually.

But what am I supposed to do? 

I'm going to have no one in six months. I can't work because of my health. I won't be able to afford the apartment. I won't be able to afford the dog (if I even end up getting one. I doubt I will because the money). I won't be able to go back to my family. I won't be able to seek out help from friends. I can't even go to the grocery store and in six months I'm expected to live on my own and possibly lose everyone if we decide to go through with breaking up. 

And even if we don't break up, that's 36 hours of travel between me and the only person I have.",05Jan2020,2

310,"So I'm gonna skip a super detailed backstory for now, since I honestly am having a hard time recollecting everything and I don't want to accidentally fill in any blanks or anything because I'm honestly not entirely sure if I'm overreacting about all of this, but if anyone has questions just ask and I can probably give you a good answer.  
Anyways, year ago or so I met this girl in a store near where I live and after around a week she turned up at my door (No clue how she figured out where I live) asking if she could drop in for a bit until the rain stopped, I figured it was a bit strange but not much of an ask (It was a crazy downpour), I let her stay for around 15 minutes before I had to get going myself. It was fine for a bit just while I was getting ready for my day and she was sitting in the living room, but once I was waiting around in the same room before I had to go, she just got weird. I really do blame myself for this because I probably should've asked her to leave right then but for some reason I just thought I could wait the \~10 minutes, I don't know honestly. Then she started grabbing at me and leaning at my face and just being crazy inappropriate- that's when I got her out of my house.   
After a delay from trying to figure out what the hell happened I really had to go and I kinda forgot about it for the day, but when I got home there were two police cars out front and when I turned in and started walking to my door three cops came over and asked me if they could talk for a few minutes, I'm not sure if I looked super pathetic or something but they didn't did just ask random questions about random things for.. not sure like 20 minutes or something. Long story short they took me in because she had gone to the police and said that I had sexually assaulted her. After months of schedule changes and shit that I really don't understand I had a court date. In the end I wasn't charged because of a lack of evidence, or something along those lines, it was a whirlwind.  
I didn't see or hear anything of her until about two months ago, when she started contacting me on what felt like every social platform I was on talking about her missing me and wanting to do more than just see me daily, this fucking broke me and I felt sick thinking about the possibility that she'd been watching me, I had no idea if it was an empty statement or if it's true. But it was enough for me to have a hard time sleeping often and feeling on edge all the time. After this for at least a week straight she stopped.  
Until today, when she again bombed me using new accounts (I blocked all the others) but this time she had included pictures of me in places that I had been recently, with her, along with five different people in the foreground, they aren't all there in every image but there's a total of five different people, other women that seem around her age. I've had a couple moments of panic since I can't get this off my mind and this is my third attempt of making a post here, the last two times I don't know I got paranoid and backed out. I get this might seem stupid since they're six relatively young women (late teens/early twenties), but this is really fucking me up and I don't know what I can do.  
I don't want to go the legal route because I feel like shit could go sideways real fast with the previous issue I had with her, and I've heard some horror stories about false accusations ruining people's lives.

If I'm being unreasonable or overreacting please fucking tell me cause I can't do this

312,"So basically there is this girl who has recently joined my basketball team. The only reason she joined is because of a boy on the boys team. All I am saying is Do something with passion or not at all. If you are not going to play basketball because the fact that every time you go on the court you feel like you know what you are doing and especially for the times when you are out of breath and you need to go out but you can’t because the game makes you so excited and it’s your passion, then leave the team. She has also caused major drama to the team because she doesn’t talk to us only one person on the team. I swear I have never heard this girl talk in practice/ a game. Did I mention that she is terrible..... my coach said go guard the girl with the ball.... tell me why she went the opposite way and guarded some one that has already even guarded. But besides that fact, my team is splitting up l, we used to be rlly close but now it’s her and this one girl then everybody else. I don’t what to do or if I should say anything. It just makes me so upset that she is ruining my team who I love dearly and that makes us not play together and not playing together leads to us losing because we can’t work together.

We ended up breaking up for 3 weeks due to fighting and disagreements on the pregnancy but he came to his senses and we ended up back together and have been doing great since. He is very supportive and excited for the future. However when we got back together he told me he wanted to travel Thailand for a month with his friend because he felt when the baby is here, he won’t get the chance and it is something he has always wanted to do. I agreed because I felt who am I to stop him from doing something he has always wanted to do. Both our lives are going to change so much and I wouldn’t want him having any regrets. I will be 6 months pregnant when he leaves. He’s leaving in 5 weeks and I feel jealous and hurt at the thought of him going now. I was fine about it at the start but as it gets closer I just feel a bit angry. It’s something we have always wanted to do together.

315,"So I posted on a different subreddit asking for some insight, but I didn't get many responses, and now some new things have happened, but ANYWAYS, I am lost. I kinda like this girl, and I THINK she likes me back, but the thing is, is that I'm not sure, and I have no idea what all I should try and pick up on to be sure.  


A girl from work asked for my number, ""because we're buds"" and we started texting pretty frequently. I was getting good morning texts and good night texts, and the conversation was pretty nice. She recently apologized for taking a while to text me back, and I told her not to worry about it and to not feel obligated to text me. She then said that she really enjoyed texting me, which made me feel really great.   


Next, we've been hanging out. Like a lot. I hung out with her for pretty much from afternoon to night two days ago, and today from 6PM to 11PM, and she said she wants to hang out again, but we've never hung out just by ourselves. She's always brought at least one friend with her so far. After we hung out the first time she gave me a hug, which was kinda outta left field, but that could probably because I don't hang out with many people but a close group of friends, which are more often than not dudes. She said today that she would've hugged me but she was in her car dropping me off at mine. Do women normally hug their guy friends after hanging out or nah? Especially after knowing them for less than a month.  The part that mostly confused me is that she always talks about me joining their friend group, or I'll come to understand a certain quirk of hers after being friends with her for a while. Maybe I'm over interpreting things.  


Lastly, she's kinda comfortable around me. Not that that's a bad thing, but after meeting her in the middle of December, and only really talking a bunch now, she's been talking like I've known her for a while now. Just the things she says, I dunno. I dunno if this is notable or not either, but she also touched my head randomly, and told me my hair was soft.  


Hope this wasn't too messy of a post, and sorry for being clueless. I don't think I've ever had a woman interested in me before, and she acts much different than my other female friends do, and I have no idea if it's because she's really out going and nice, or if she's into me. I really appreciate any and all insight I can get. I really don't wanna fuck this up.",05Jan2020,1
316,"Okay hi guys, so I’m 19 years old living at home and I have strict parents, they are so controlling and I can’t even be with my boyfriend of 2 years.

(They want me to be with a guy of my ethnicity) I have a 9PM curfew, can’t go to any parties etc which I don’t care about tbh. I just want the freedom with my boyfriend to travel and stuff with him. Living at home feels like it also detoriates my mental health, I feel like everything I do I do it to please my parents or to make them proud but nothing is ever enough for them. I’ve tried setting boundaries and letting them know this is what I want but nothing works. For example we’re going back home this summer, and I told them I only wanted to come for a week and come back and work the rest of the summer but they are forcing me to go the whole month or else “I’m kicked out of the house” I want to move out so bad but it’s very hard to balance school and jobs, any tips?

How can I get over the loss of all these friends? Evey time they're mentioned by someone else, every time I see them on a mutual friend's Instagram/Snapchat story, and every time I even *think* about my former best friend, it hurts.

I recently told him that I liked him and he said that he already knew that and then he just never said if he liked me back but instead just teased me about liking him and how he knew. So I don’t know wether or not to take his response as a gentle “no I don’t like you back” or as something else??? 

To give some background we have hung out together several times before and we message each other almost every day. We see each other almost everyday since we do a sport together too. He’s said stuff that my friends claim means he’s into me like he asked where I was going when he noticed me getting ready to leave or he asked how my day was or wished me luck on taking a test. (To me this is all just him being nice though). He’s messaged me at 12 AM to go get food with him before and when we do hangout we just crack jokes at each other or play games bc we are competitive.

327,"So I met this guy in college - let’s call him Adam - at the very beginning of our 1st year. At the time I had a boyfriend, who was about a year older than me and soon after we started school he also got a girlfriend - we’ll call her Laura. So Adam and I become very close over the span of a year, best friends even. We told each other almost everything and spent a lot of time together. But it was always platonic, I mean we were both in committed relationships. Laura was always very suspicious of me though. She didn’t like how much time that me and Adam spent together and how close we are. I understand the jealousy and never thought much of it because she was always pretty nice to me and we talked fairly often because of our relations with Adam (like she’s borrowed my clothes for a party before, been to my room several times, etc.). Over the summer, Adam and I got even closer. I broke up with my boyfriend for non relevant reasons and Adam really gave me a lot of emotional support to get through it. There were several points where Laura was obviously annoyed by how much time me and Adam spent alone, but things were always platonic. At the end of the summer, Adam broke up with Laura. 

Now this is the part where things get a little messy. The next month or so after, Adam and I both start developing feelings for each other. It’s almost like it was bound to happen, two best friends who are straight and of the opposite gender and find each other decently physically attractive, right? We end up getting together.

The thing is, I feel a bit terrible. I know nothing that happened was wrong. Adam was never into me while he was with Laura, and I wasn’t into him while dating my ex. I was also not into him while he was dating Laura. The whole thing just kind of happened. 
But I know that Laura doesn’t really like me because of certain actions she’s taken since me and Adam have gotten together like removing us from social media and avoiding us whenever she sees us in public, all while still maintaining contact with some of our other friends. 

I understand why she would feel that way. Her last boyfriend, before Adam, broke up with her and got with his female best friend too...so I’m sure this only damaged her further and reinforced a lot of trust issues. But that was never my intention. I really did like her and I never meant for her to get hurt in any way. And I definitely did not plan to get with Adam this whole time.

I guess I just want to talk to her and make sure she’s okay? Or that she knows that I wasn’t trying to sabotage their relationship? But I’m not sure if that’s a good idea or what to do to be honest.

Got any advice?",05Jan2020,1
328,"So I grew up with the regular Christian shaming tactics and all that Jazz. On top of that I’m pretty introverted (but can be great at faking outgoing-ness). So I’m pretty anxious as a product of my childhood. 

My parents are divorced. My dads side of the family of ultra conservative judgey Christian perfect people. My moms side is cool but still very religious and likely judge my life choices. I have a pretty big family. And a big step family on my dads side. Everyone on my dad and stepmoms side would be very offended if not invited to an event like my wedding. 

My fiancé’s family is also very big. And judgey. Not Christian. But hella judgey and will act out on their judgements one way or another.

Overall we have a lot of narcissism in both our families and no escape. I have over simplified and not said a lot of issues that have occurred over the years cause it would take too long.

Update: im feeling really confused and numb right now. i feel like i definitely could have prevented the entire situation if i was more careful that night, although i know it's not an excuse for his actions i cant help but feel somewhat at blame. i don't plan on going to law enforcement at all, it feels like a night i just want to block out from my memory.",05Jan2020,7

340,"So I typed out this long ass explanation, but my fucking computer decided to delte it. So basically, I am 18 years old and my parents have already made me miss two great opportunities just in the past few months of college and now they are trying to prevent me from taking a trip with my friend. My parents even told me last semester to stop looking for a job in order to keep me poor so I would be reliant on them, as they are paying for my college and everything else. Basically anytime I want to go anywhere and do anything, they veto that shit and tell me no and I am missing many great opportunities in college because of it and after this last time I am getting fed up. Should I just tell my parents to fuck off and I'll do what I want, or just keep the peace? I am chosing between my friend and my parents. Anyway that is the extreme abbreviated version of my long ass story. The trip is next weekend btw.",05Jan2020,1

342,"I'm 23 and I'm planning on going back to school (I'm thinking for physiology). I've completed two years of School so far (mostly gen eds). I'm wondering if it's a good idea to continue working full time or if I should be a full time student. I'm also wondering if I should do an online program /hybrid program / or all in person classes. There are no schools within a daily driving distance so some options may require me to move to a new city / state. 
These issues didn't worry me before straight out of highschool, but now that i work full time at a place that I relatively enjoy, and money is more of a priority, they are harder to face. 
I don't necessarily want money/distance to get in the way of my goals, but I would also like to remain 'realistic.' 
Has anybody had a similar experience that would like to lend me some advice? Thanks in advance :)",05Jan2020,1

Hey reddit. I [17/F] really need some advice. My mom is such a toxic person and I am very sick of everything. My dad told me that my mom has always had this behavior and was prescripted xanax when I was born because she was out of control. She always yells at me, my father or my sister [6/F] when she doesn’t agree with something. She yells at me over the most irrelevant stuff, like not liking my hoodie, not putting my hair in a ponytail when i’m home, talking on the phone with my friends etc. She is also extremely over-protective, she never let me sleep alone, NEVER. I started sleeping alone when I was 15 or 16 and still, i can’t sleep without the lights on. 

But that is not my main problem. The problem is that i really love this guy [22/M]. We’ve been together for a couple of months and we are very in love with eachother, he always takes care of me and makes me feel very loved, special and happy. (he lives 200 km away from me). so today he came here to see me and rented a hotel room so we can hang out and spend the night together. my mom desperately called me and threatened that she will come there and take me home. it was very embarassing but my boyfriend understands and loves me. he had to go home and i felt so bad. i really want this to work and f i try to talk to her i know that she’ll never understand. i lost so many things because of my mom, but not him. please not him. i tried talking to my dad but he doesn’t really give a fuck or takes my mom’s side because he’s afraid of her. please help me, i don’t want to lose this guy i am so in love with him and it’s the best thing that ever happened to me. (btw i’m moving in his city in a year and a half for art school)",05Jan2020,3

346,"I'm writing this 2am sobbing because its traumatizing to literally re-live this. When I was 10, I found a video of my dad having sex with this family friend. She obviously no longer in our lives but I remember where they did it, how my dad was positioned, her fucking face and body. I remember when my mom found out and how ape shit she went and it was so so scary at the time because I had to watch my mom cry herself to sleep. How worthless she felt and fall into her depression.  

And then another time approx 2 years ago my dumbass dad left facebook messages open on our Family computer and again my mom and I found the messages. I don't think this time they met because she was living in another country.

Now I'm on vacation with my dad and brother (mom couldn't come bc of work) and I was hanging out with my dad and I saw a message (very clearly, 100% i read it) of another fucking woman who messaged him ""hello love"" like what the fuck? I asked my dad who she was and he was like his dentist. I asked to read the messages but he erased them and I should've tried to get her name so I can message her but I was just so angry. 

I want my parents to seperate but I know my mom never will. Why does she stay with my dad when he constantly cheats? I don't even want to tell my mom because I don't want to see her hurt. So I'm hurting.

Im sorry if this is a mess but i love my mom so mych u want them to seperate so it doesn't hurt me too but y dad clearly doesn't care about me or my mom 

What should I do? Should I destroy his phone? I literally wanna kill my dad because my mom is the sweetest woman in the whole world and he never deserved her fuck omg",05Jan2020,2
347,"For context, I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 4 years and we’re both in our 20s. My boyfriend’s mother is a 72 year old, very traditional, old fashioned Ashkenazi Jew. She’s from Israel. 

Over the course of my relationship with my boyfriend, I gained about 40 pounds due to PCOS and depression. Now, I’ve lost almost all of it. Well, after my weight loss, his mother started making rude comments to me about EVERYTHING.

Example:

Her: “wow you finally look thin”
Me: “yeah I lost about 35 pounds”
Her: “that’s nice, but you need to keep going”

Wtf? What a backhanded compliment.

Normally I wouldn’t be bothered by these things, however she has made many more jabs at me, and they all seemed to start after I lost the weight and got healthy.

She comments on my hair, how bad it is, my clothes, and even discourages me from pursuing a career in veterinary medicine, a field which I’m very passionate about. She says things like “I can tell you don’t have the drive to do that, and I wouldn’t do it if I were you.” 

It’s getting unbearable. I just had a huge fight with my boyfriend because I’m frustrated he won’t stand up for me when she makes these comments in front of both of us, and he tells me I’m being psychotic and should just let it go. Out of anger I told him she was a huge bitch, to which he completely retaliated and told me I should learn to accept her criticism. I would totally let it go if it were a one-time incident, but it’s not. She makes these comments almost every time I see her. 

I feel like I’ll never be good enough for her or her son, and I know I should learn to live with that fact, but I can’t. I’m in tears right now. Advice?

However, I thought that changed a couple weeks ago. I met this cute girl at a party, and we just really hit it off. We started following each other on all social media platforms, and she started texting me. It was amazing, I didn’t even have to do anything. She was normally the one who initiated the conversations, and we talked literally all day everyday.

It was amazing bc she was different than other girls I’ve been interested in. We also have different personalities, which at first I thought was weird. But I started to like it, it made me think differently on certain matters. Overall she was just a very kind person, and I was happy with it.

I was starting to get very serious about our relationship. And planning out the next steps, when out of the blue she texts me saying that she doesn’t want me to get the wrong impression, and she just really enjoys having me as a friend.

356,"So, I'll (15M) start from the beginning of this: one of my friends and I both met at the start of 9th grade. We'll call her Alex(15F). We started to get fairly close to each other, and since around October of 2018 we've talked to each other almost every night. The first thing that happened took place in October of 2019, when one of her friends told me that Alex wanted me to stop contacting her. I stopped texting Alex for a while, until one night Alex texted me, and I was mildly confused, so I explained what her friend had said to me, and Alex was confused as well. She said that she had never told her friend anything of the sort, and that she was sure it was a misunderstanding. On the last day of school before winter break, she asked me if I had a crush on anyone, and even though I had a crush on her at the time, I said that I liked one of my close friends (15M). After I said that, she just looked at the floor and said ""Okay"". After that, I tried to give her the present that I had bought her for Christmas (even though she told me she didn't want anything, I still got her this one thing that I knew she liked using some of my money from work), but she said she felt bad accepting it. Next, she went to walk home with her friend that I had mentioned earlier. The night before last night, I asked her if she would like to see a movie together sometime, and she agreed, saying that we could go after our exams are over. Yesterday afternoon, I simply texted her asking how her day was going, and I haven't received a response from her since.

She would answer in very short answers and she gave of a not not interested vibe. So I asked her is this a bad to talk and she said “yeah sorry “ so I thinking maybe she’s just at a party.

363,"My boyfriend was letting me look at his reddit and I noticed that in his search engine is the subreddit “degradingholes”. I had never heard of this before and looked it up. I felt very uncomfortable and disturbed at what I saw and that he would get off on watching something that made fun of women’s appearances and talked about their only use to be “gangbanged “ and hurt. I felt awful, that this was demoralizing and disturbing and violent. 
My friend said some people have weird kinks and that doesn’t necessarily indicate who they are as people. But this is finding pleasure in the horrendous treatment of women’s bodies and personhoods.
When I had asked him earlier what he was into he said “vanilla stuff like doctors”.  
Should I confront him about this that it makes me feel uncomfortable and ask why he’s into it? He does make comments about women’s body parts to me sometimes and once called a prostitute in a show a “bitch” and a “two dollar whore” I told him that wasn’t funny and he apologized but I’m noticing a trend. 
He also has depression and I don’t want him to feel ashamed and bad about himself. Should I talk to him about this??",05Jan2020,1
365,"I'm 16 and in 10th grade. I had a best friend whom I had been talking to since nursery grade as we were in the same class. One day, when we reached 7th grade, we got an announcement that kids from other sections will be jumbled up for apparently no good reason. I was in 7th - section C with this guy all these years and suddenly I was put into section B with all these other kids I didn't know. Being a little introverted, I was very uncomfortable. 

My friend and I were both really bummed about this but we'd still hang out during recess and for a few minutes after school. We couldn't always hangout at each others' houses since he lived pretty far away so school was really the only time and it had been shortened. 

I then found him making new friends with these other kids who got shifted to his class. I was initially fine with it but then I realized they were basically assholes. one of them would call me asshole for no reason over and over like a 3 year old kid, trying to provoke me and the rest would laugh at my reaction (just a disgusted look, I gave them) but I never complained to anyone because I knew it wouldn't do anything and they slowly stopped.

then recess was not an option for hanging out because he'd hang out with these chumps while I just sat there in class waiting for the day to end. 

then he started to shift from being this sensitive, really nice guy to a person who only gave a fuck about smoking hookah, hanging out with these chumps and talking about fucking people's mothers.

then hanging out with him would mostly be awkward silence and him being bored as fuck and me uncomfortable so we stopped hanging out even after school.

he wouldn't respond to messages so we wouldn't hang out anywhere else too.

and so I figured that was it, he changed, and I needed to move on. it sucked.

but then in 9th grade, in a new school of the same branch but larger with higher classes in there, I found him in my class. it was really awkward actually but we talked a few times. those few times we talked, I managed to make him laugh like old times by making types of jokes I normally wouldn't make, which made me low key uncomfortable. but then after those few times, I decided to not start conversations with him and he never tried to do the same.

then after I passed 9th grade and got to 10th, I realized he failed the final exams of maths and science and was given a chance for retests but he declined and dropped out of school.

I haven't seen or heard from him since but the thing is

I keep having dreams about hanging out with him just like old times. I've had at least 6-7 dreams the past few months where he was his current self, this same age as of now, but his behavior was just like the old times and we'd talk and laugh as the conversations went naturally and weren't forced at all.

over and over I have these dreams

so... should i try being friends with him again?

369,"So this is going to be a semi-long post so I hope you arent bored reading it.

I (21F) met my friend (lets call him T) (30M),now boss, 3 years ago through my ex-bf. We became friends as my ex worked in the same mall as T did. T owns his own small business in the mall. 

At this point in time we had been friends for about a year and one day I jokingly told him I should work for him as I was complaining of my retail job. He looked at me and it was like a light went off and said ""Why dont you?"" We had a great friendship and trusted each other fairly well. As T was needing a person we thought I would be the perfect fit since I knew how his business works and how he likes his business being run. I shortly after began working for T and it has been an amazing job and our friendship held strong.

Throughout the 3 years I have been working with T, we have gone through so much friendship wise. T went through hardships through relationships, his family, friends, his work, as did I go through my relationship hardships, my depression and anxiety, family etc. and we always talked and gave advice to each other. We laughed, hung out at times and always had each others backs work wise and friendship wise.

Lately, T's business has been very slow and I have been going through a hard depression episode and as a result been late to my few morning shifts. T was very upset for the few late show ups, but never confronted me about it and I talked to him about the depression episode and thought everything was fine. T kept his cool in front of me, but through another person (we will call him AH for A**hole) I do not like very much found out T had been complaining about me and basically sh*t-talking about me behind my back. T got very upset when he heard AH telling me this as AH is not very wise with his mouth. T screamed at him in front of my face to shut up and AH became very quiet as did I. I was just ending my shift and was leaving to go home when all this happened and I panicked and tried to make small talk and the mood semi-lightened up, but I was feeling very hurt.

Now T and I have gone through smaller incidences of different opinions, but our friendship was never truly hurt, just reconciled after some talking and understanding of our differences and how we could both be better, but this really hurt my feelings towards him as a friend and I dont think I can ever trust T again friendship wise and business wise. If he was shaming me behind my back I dont know what else he could have splurged out from our very deep talks we have had throughout the years.

I am going to confront T about this situation, but when he and I are alone. But most importantly I dont think I can be friends with him after this. Should I finish my friendship with T also resulting in me looking for a new job? My current bf and I have discussed this and said I should quit and not give a 2 weeks notice as the trust has vanished between us both, but I dont know why (pride or to prove something) I want to give a 2 weeks notice to just end on a good note, but I dont knkw. Does anybody else have any advice on how to handle this? Id appreciate anything really. 

TL;DR: my close friend/boss after 3 years of friendship and 2 years as being my boss has suddenly began talking behind my back an extreme amount. Should I talk to him to keep my friendship and job or should I can it all and start working elsewhere and drop him as a friend? If I do quit, should I give him a 2 weeks notice or not as the trust is gone and I wouldnt plan on coming back if I do leave.",05Jan2020,1
370,"I've had a circle of friends all part of a group for 2.5 years now. About a year ago, me and a friend in this group got into a big fight (I acknowledge the fight was my fault, I handled it poorly and got quite angry at her and her close friends that I decided to cut contact and avoid them).

She created a new group and invited half the group in. We continued to talk in the main chat and hang out (with the non-cut off people), however, over the next year, she slowly added everyone in, now it's just me left on the outside. She has alot of influence on the group so the group chat has now shifted from the original chat. I still hang out with all of them (except the cut-off peeps, we are neutral now, we just don’t talk).

I spoke to my best friend “L” about this (who recently got added into the group) and told him how uncomfortable this whole thing makes me, that I feel left out, that you could all be talking about me behind my back and I wouldn't know it etc. He understood, but said he doesn't want to get on anyones bad side by adding me in, and the best he can do is vote me in. I told him not to do that it's humiliating.

He proceeds to do the vote anyway, the people who were angry (that I cut off last time) were very opposed to the idea and I only found out through another close friend in the group. One friend that I thought hadn't picked a side, was against me joining as well (and finding that out sucked), because I have been hanging out with her for the past half a year and we have been good friends/laughing etc (call this person M). 

Despite the majority actually liking me, I wasn't added in because of the bad blood that about 4/13 people have in the group. So now I am stuck in limbo. I don't even know what options I have at the moment. Refuse to hang out as a group and see them individually? Cut them all off? Suck it up, this is how it is because of what happened?

I'm upset that I was 'voted on', I'd never do that to anyone else, is this an okay thing to do? I mean, who are they to vote on me? It's demeaning, I am not any lesser than them.  
I'm upset that they expect me to hang out with them as a group, say the past is the past, yet they aren't willing to do the same and willfully choose to exclude me from the chat due to something that happened a year ago. And I'm upset that this was all done behind my back, I feel disrespected.

I've been invited by this best friend “L” and the ""M"" friend and another friend to a get together at for drinks on Monday night, and my initial feeling is to simply ghost them all and move on with my life without explanation. I'm obviously quite disappointed about this, I do care about the majority of the people in there, but, I don't think it's healthy to stick around and that maybe it's time, I have another circle of friends so I'll be okay.

I'm 26 years old and don't really have a lot of knowledge regarding fields of work , a lot of the stuff I do know is self taught because I've actually been on my own for a while trying to figure my life out. That has actually gotten me taken advantage of - but that's another story. 

Right now I am a data entry, which I'm good at, but I get really restless when I'm at my desk. I need more tasks to do than just keyying all day. I like to serve others,  I love moving on my feet and using my hands. I have interests in gardening, cleaning, building, but have no knowledge in those fields. I have more knowledge and experience in data entry, emails, invoicing, clerical and some retail and warehouse experience. 

How do I go about finding a job for me?  

I have little money too, and live in a small town.",05Jan2020,1
378,"It’s either her or nobody. I’d rather be dead than be with another girl. Can’t wait to kms for her. I wish I was good enough for her. I’m looking forward to burning in hell. I hope I don’t wake up tomorrow &amp; die in my sleep. Wishing somebody would come &amp; slit my throat. Suicide is virtue. 

October 2015, I started liking this girl in my 2nd hour Spanish class &amp; my lunch period. I’ve never liked a girl before. So as the weeks went on into Nov., I learned that half of the school(including her) was moving to the school across town bcuz the school district was becoming bankrupt &amp; had to move students, etc. So I was determined to ask her out by the end of the school year. As finals ended/winter break started, I really started missing seeing her. I began posting #wcw pics of her on my ig as I was trying to be sweet. No replies as my account was private, but I guess word got to her that I really liked her. 1st week of January I posted a screenshot of my notes that basically said I need help to ask this girl out(everyone knew who I was referring to) &amp; that I was thinking of either getting her a Chevy Silverado or getting her a puppy &amp; putting a note on its caller asking her to go out with me. Then I realized I really messed up. It was nonstop talk around the school when winter break ended.

 1 of her friends that followed me on ig dm me saying that she thinks that it just wasn’t going to work bcuz she was already talking to someone else. Idk if that was true or not. I asked the friend if she was mad at me, she said na but that she just felt bad. I said ok thanks for letting me know &amp; that I’d lay low for a while. I then got the idea of writing her an apology letter in person. I spent the next 2 weeks writing a 20 page apology letter to her &amp; gave it to her the day before my birthday. I gave it to her in the middle of the school cafeteria &amp; I basically said I’m sorry for what I did to her(embarrassing her on social media) &amp; that I wrote this for you. She said thanks &amp; I said no problem. We had drivers ed class that quarter (from Jan to March) also. She then DM’d me later that day saying that she felt that I was beating myself up too much &amp; that she wasn’t mad/hate me. She also said that she was flattered that I liked her. When I gave her the note, I got a bunch of ig follow requests from her friends so they certainly knew about it. 


The next day, my birthday, I got called in my school counselor office about the note. So either her or her friends told him about it. He was making sure that I wasn’t going to hurt myself. I told him I wasnt &amp; got a phone call home. My mom wasn’t too thrilled with me. The girl I liked(I still do) was worried that while I wasn’t in class(I was @ counselor office), that I did something to myself. A few weeks went by &amp; got the idea if I got her a cat she would wanna go out with me/increase my chances. That didn’t work. A few weeks later, I was going to do a bunny. That didn’t work either. I was just too scared to talk to her in person. So sometime over spring break, a group of acquaintances had a convo on Xbox saying that I was going to shoot up the school in May. When spring break ended 1st week of April, I was interviewed by dean/police &amp; said I didn’t know nothing about it. Apparently a bunch of people got interviewed about it, including the girl I liked supposedly. I felt so sorry for her. I asked a classmate if she liked me &amp; he said she said no but that she feels bad. So I then made plans to kill myself bcuz I figured if I did she’d be happy not to see me again. The day I was going to last see her(if my suicide went through) I bought her a sorry card from Walgreens &amp; a gift card to Olive Garden. Gave it to her after lunch. I said sorry &amp; just left to my next class. Kids said that she couldn’t take the gift card bcuz she said she felt bad about it so she gave it to one of her friends. I posted my plans on Snapchat on that Friday evening in mid April to kill myself &amp; somebody called the cops on me/was sent to a mental hospital for 1.5 weeks. I missed her so much. When I got back from the hospital &amp; to school, a friend told me that she felt bad for me. Lots of her friends told me that she wanted me to go talk to her, but I was too scared to. In early May, the school went on lockdown one day bcuz somebody called the police &amp; school saying that they saw me walk up to the school with a gun. I was pulled out of my classroom &amp; held @ gunpoint with AR-15 by cops &amp; had FBI/news crew on scene. They obviously found nothing on me. By noon, almost everybody went home with their parents. I couldn’t bcuz my mom was @ work. Even the girl left. I felt so sad. The next week, I was forced to stay home bcuz that was the day I was originally rumored to shoot up the school. I was sad I couldn’t see her. 

My lunch table said that I wasn’t allowed to sit with them anymore so they could be “separated from the situation” is what they told me. I ended up starving myself from lunch the entire rest of May. Instead of going to lunch, I hid in my school bathroom stalls so nobody would see me or hear me cutting/crying myself. Nobody ever knew about this. They probably never will. 


The following week, the last full week before finals, I finally worked up the nerve to talk to her. I just asked her how her day was, what’s new, etc. I was so proud of myself &amp; so were some of my friends. The last week of school was so depressing for me personally, bcuz I knew I wouldn’t ever see her again. I almost cried midclass bcuz of that. Once the school yr ended, that’s when I DM’d her asking to hang out sometime over the summer. That’s when she said we’ll see(bcuz she said she had lots going on &amp; that she’d dm me). I never got a dm back &amp; messaged her every 4 weeks asking her how she was etc. nothing was responded to. I decided that November to have another suicide attempt bcuz I missed her so much, &amp; went through all this pain &amp; got no reward for it. I wanted at least 1 chance. I ended up going to my counselor office at school bcuz someone found out about it. I was put in a mental hospital for 2 weeks &amp; was given medication for my depression. I haven’t talked to her since all this happened. I still miss her &amp; always will bcuz I promised myself I would never date a girl ever again. I’m 19, still no girlfriend &amp; never will.",05Jan2020,1

One of them is a fan of the rapper, but one day a shared a meme aboht the rapper to that friend and he got mad saying how i talk about him too much and he blocked me.

There are many great colleges out there, but the only college that fits my image is none other than Full Sail University, located in Winter Park, Florida. That particular university has the main classes I would like to take: Game Art, Game Design, and Game Development. And a month ago, a representative from Full Sail talked to us about its majors.

However, there is only one problem: My father does not approve of Full Sail. Other than the fact that it's out of state, the only reason Dad doesn't want me there is because he thinks I lack the sufficient maturity I need in order to be ready to go. And to make it worst, he thinks I should just go to a college that's close to home (I live in North Carolina, by the way). This really tears me up inside, and it even makes me question my own dreams of being a video game developer. Almost every single time I try to prove my dad wrong, I end up proving him right.

Sorry for format, I'm a bit distressed at the moment. 
I took care of my significant other for 4 years, helped him when he would quit his jobs, sat silent while he spent more time talking to his friends than he ever talked to me, forgave him after he did retaliatory things like when I was hospitalized he hit up my best friend for dinner....my best friend(28F) told me immediately after she received the messages while inpatient so I knew(bless her, she's been my biggest hero in all of this), he lied about sleeping with another woman(he didn't actually sleep with anyone and I had proof he was with his guy friends) to intentionally hurt me after I said I couldn't afford him to drop $200+ on his friends at the bar, and a slew of other things. I remained silent as every time I brought issues up - he'd yell at me and say I'm not doing anything to help the situation as he claimed he knew he was fucking up - but did nothing about it. For a period of time we didn't have sex bc I wasn't interested so at one point he dragged me off the couch and had sex with me while I was asleep and when I woke up...I told him no but he pulled me off harder, took off my pants and did it until I started silently sobbing and he saw...he then backed away whispering he was sorry and didn't know what the fuck he was doing.(we had good times but after everything that happened, it's hard to bring up anything good besides the birth of our daughter)

We eventually lost our apartment and even making $17.00+ an hour WITH overtime I couldn't afford taking care of everything anymore. I moved in with my best friend until he claimed got his shit together.

Fast forward to this past summer. I was hospitalized for the 6th time within the past 4 yrs. I had a mental breakdown that'd been building since I attempted suicide in Dec2018 and was hospitalized then. I could not function at work, going into public got to be too much to handle. After being in the hospital he reached out, told me how he had changed, he had a house and was working with his friend's company. This seemed like something good so I took him up on his offer to move in(he stated this was to make up for everything he did), but unfortunately my bipolar is still an issue and I end up quitting my job, I run out of meds and we're strapped for cash. It's to the point now where I think I need to be in the hospital again. My paranoia is through the roof, I cry almost every day. I cannot go to inpatient though, I get accused of faking my condition despite the years of dr visits and having bipolar I diagnosed on paper from three different psyc drs.

I'm told to get over it, that I need to get a job and that I'm allowing myself to get worse. I just can't with how bad my paranoia and anxiety gets. I don't have insurance and I've never received state help. I don't know where to begin but I know that I was offered help from a case worker but never needed those services. I WANT TO GET BETTER for my family. I am not okay, suicidal thoughts are happening everyday, I've been watching shows about people who've disappeared and fantasizing about just getting the courage to run off into the forested area about a mile from the house because I don't know who would want to put up with ME. I don't want to put up with myself. I can't get a job, I break down crying over the thought of going to the fucking store. When I go out I can hear everyone judging me. My sleep is FUCKED, I can go to bed normally one night then wake up and be up for 24+ hours and that just gets me yelled at more because i end up crashing and not being able to function. This is a terrible cycle but I don't know what to do. I feel like this is all my fault and if I wasn't around his life would be easier and my daughter would be fine. She's such a happy little girl, she doesn't deserve a broken mom. I feel guilty if she sees me upset so I usually just hide when I cry.

Rarely he’ll drink more. These past two weeks he has been off work due to holidays and so has been drinking more than usual. 

Tonight, we went to a friends for a party and he got too drunk. Like stumbling, slurring, knocking things over kind of drunk. The host essentially kicked him out so I called a cab and took us both home. He was upset to say the least. 

He was grabbing me by the arms and screaming in my face. It got so bad I told him I just needed to shower so I could sit in the bathroom and call my sister to come get me. I was able to leave without a problem (although I don’t know that he even knew I left).

They approve of him and always say he’s a good guy and is mature, which I agree with as well. However, whenever he comes over to me and my parent’s home, we are not permitted to go upstairs to my bedroom. Of course I understand why. They probably don’t want us to be having sex and all that. Who would want to be in the house while their daughter is being screwed? So obviously I get that. But the thing I don’t understand is.. I had an ex bf who I let meet my parents as well. They were fond with him and welcomed him to our home. It only took my ex bf 2 months in the relationship with me and him for my parents to let him go upstairs in my room. They knew we had sex. They knew we would sleep together in the room. So I don’t understand why they’re making it so difficult with this one. I come from a Chinese household, whereas my current bf is Arab. Maybe it’s a racist thing? Idk. Cuz my ex was Filipino and they seemed way easier on him than they are on my Arab bf. The sad part is my ex cheated in the worse possible way. So their excuse is they’re trying to prevent me from getting hurt again. But this guy is different.

418,"Cross posting from /r Chicago

Hello! 
I'm sort of combining this post into a rant and question post, but first some background:

I currently am 22 and an electrical engineer working for an MEPS firm in Greenville, SC. I currently live with my parents and am paying my student debt and saving money. My girlfriend lives in Elgin, IL and we have been dating for 4-1/2 years. I make a trip a month to Elgin. So with all of these things, I have planned to move to Illinois, but have been discouraged lately due to my parents. Here's where my issues lie.

My parents use to live in the Pennsylvania for sometime. My father commuted all over the states and has had quite the experience. Both him and my mother have completely discouraged my wanting to move to a big city (Greenville is really small and lacking in any type of big firm job). My father on a daily basis sends me news article after news article about how Chicago (and Illinois for that matter) is going bankrupt and I should not move there.  Also, the high rate of murder that happens there (it happens in every city of course). He talks about how all the people are rude, the snow is miserable, the commute is terrible, and the housing is miserable. They go to the extent of encouraging my girlfriend to come down here and complete her nursing degree...

I do have a lot of questions for anyone who lives here if you have the time. I am just really scared for my future as I want to marry my girlfriend and move there and work in the city...

Can you guys give me some rebuttals to talk with my dad the next time he starts his lovely email chain to me? 

Questions:
How affordable is housing in Chicago/suburb areas?

Which part of the city/suburbs are the best to live in on a salary of 60k?

How is the commute in the city?

Is Chicago the best place to develop a career in engineering?

How bad is the weather realistically?

... these are all I can think of at the moment... 

Thank you for any advice you give!",05Jan2020,1
419,"22M, 6 months ago I got a job at a company I wasn't a fan of, but took it for the pay. I worked at 2 companies within the same industry prior to taking the job and didn't disclose it to my manager, knew they wouldn't hire me if I did. Got the job. Manager forced me to do unethical things such as preparing me for a presentation and putting another coworker who was unprepared on the spot in front of the entire staff, making me look like a superstar and my colleague like a fool. Manager was racist/demeaning about clients behind closed doors. Couldn't take it anymore but I was a nice guy and didn't have the balls to tell him I quit so I made up a story about a family member being in another city that I needed to leave the job for. Manager from city 1 gave a reference to manager in city 2 and when I went he transferred me to another department, leading me to Manager 3. He was cool but I had a gut instinct to decline the job and said I was going back home. Went back home and didn't return to Manager 1 for work. Fast forward 6 months I'm in city 2 again and almost have my life together without the help of any of these past people. My question is, should I call/text/email manager 1 and say I acted without integrity? Its really been eating at me even though its been so long and he probably doesn't care being a narcissist. What do I do? Integrity is one of the most if not the most important character traits for a man to have and this is the only time I've ever intentionally lied for my own personal gain and deeply regret it. Other people have screwed me over this exact same way before yet they feel no remorse even for the massive pain they've caused. Advice is much appreciated, thank you.",05Jan2020,1
420,"I feel stuck in an endless mental loop. I have built myself up and improved a lot over the past year, I have become far more confident and have improved my overall mentality and have been happy in that respect. 
But I also live in a small home (1 bedroom) with 3 other people. I have slept in a living room for years. I have attempted college but always lose steam after a quarter because I have to come home to 0 privacy, and I don’t make enough at work for an apartment. 
My family wants to move but they never get motivated and I need them for most tasks involving fixing up the house to qualify for a bridge loan. But they e been saying this for years to the point that I feel if I leave I’ll be abandoning them.  I have an opportunity to move in with a friend for cheap, but it’s 50 miles away. I would also have to continue my college degree either online or figure out how to transfer credits. But I just feel drained and have no energy. It’s cluttered and small here, I feel like I’m trapped and stuck in what to do about it. Plus I wouldn’t be able to see most of my friends as often. My sister left a year ago, she couldn’t handle it either, makes me wonder if it’s not such a bad idea.
Would it be selfish or bad to just get up and leave to move in with my friend, knowing that my family will struggle a bit more with getting the house ready to sell? I just lost faith in the idea of selling this place.

Ps: I am 24, I have not acted earlier because of bad depression and became a recluse for a bit. (Until a year ago.) meditation and introspection brought me out of it. I am ready to make a move but am kind of feeling overwhelmed.",05Jan2020,1

So I’d have to shower even if I’m going to go out again afterwards. And if I go out I would have to shower when I get home before sleeping. Also when I’m done showering I turn off the water and then I have to open the shower curtains and then place a towel on the floor and then wash my hands with the dripping water from the shower head before stepping out and drying myself.

425,"Sorry for throwaway, but that person knows I use reddit and my regular handle, and I don't want him to know before I tell him anything.

I (28M) met this guy (30M) online through a dating app several years ago (I think it may have been 6 or 7). It was pretty clear from the first few messages that we had 0 romantic interest for each other, but we really clicked as friends through common interests and a similar lingo so we started casually hanging out and soon we became pretty close. We came even closer, I'd say ""best friends"" (although that's something I'd use for childhood friends), after me and my other *actual* best friend (they don't know each other) had a fallout and stopped talking. We'd mostly play games together but also go out for coffee, a weird event, eat macdonald's at 6AM after gaming all night etc.

Best thing is *he'd get me,* you know? I didn't need to express myself eloquently about something, he just knew what I was like so for example if a date was really bad we wouldn't dwell - we'd just have fun doing other shit.

Now this guy is very intelligent and he has proven it time and again. And yet... every time he gets a boyfriend he turns to an obnoxious and dumb bimbo, blind to every social cue who just wants to paint nails with besties and chat about boys. I mean it to the fullest and in the past I was just happy that he'd ""loosen up"" with his partner and just go with the flow, but now it's a hot mess of shit.

Few examples:

* I told him very awkwardly that I knew his (then first date) boyfriend because we had exchanged a few messages on a dating app and he blocked me out of the blue. He didn't even acknowledge what I said so I chalked it off to mutual awkwardness.
* I was telling him how my grandma had a heart attack after having a major fight with another woman and I was spending the night with her outside the ER - ""wish her well, but let me tell you about my boyfriend's dad who died a while ago--"" and he started a lengthy monologue on how his boyfriend is definitely worse off than me. I just left him on ""Seen"".
* I gave him a place in my Spotify Premium Family and he instantly asked me to add his boyfriend too because he's very poor and needs all the help we can give him (I'm unemployed btw while he *works*). At the time, it felt evil to simply deny the request, which I really wanted to, but I let it roll (to the day).
* When I returned from a lengthy absence (due to my postgrad being far away) I told him to go out, and then suddenly along he brings his boyfriend, unannounced. I was very awkward and had nothing to do to hide it while they were exchanging cutesy hugs and gestures.
* He always complains when I come to the city without telling him to go out (guess why) but I always de-escalate by saying I'm very busy and on tight schedules with the train, which is partially true because I only visit for interviews, seeing family members or the occasional date every month or so.
* Eventually I broke and told him ""let's go out sometime for Christmas, see the lights, the city tree etc"" and he's like ""Yea let me ask my boyfriend when he can do"". I let the suggestion run out of steam and just never asked again.
* We've been playing a game together. This game is notorious for its random outcomes. I'm pure unlucky in games so I don't get a lot of stuff in that game. He gets a lot. Every time he gets something valuable he sends me a screenshot along with a comment of the type ""it's sooo boring when the game is so easy and rewarding"". Obviously he doesn't share jack shit but he always asks me to give him stuff when he's too bored to go buy it himself.
* He *will* find a way to mention his boyfriend at any given chance. I eventually reconnected with my old friend and I share most of my thoughts with her, and she came up with a half-joke half-serious system to elicit the response. If I tell him about some minor achievement of mine, or some minor problem/shortcoming, there's always something better or worse that his boyfriend had happen to him. He even managed to shove him in the conversation when I was trying to vent about how hard it was to use a certain technical program at my work - ""Yea and my boyfriend has so much trouble using excel"".

Whew. This really turned into a vent, but I had a lot to say.

Please advise on how to deal with this situation. I don't want to lose him as a friend, but it's like he's two people, and I hate the one that's currently in my contacts.",05Jan2020,1

428,"I don’t know if this is the right sub for this but here goes. I(23F) am diagnosed with anxiety(and other things; ptsd, major depressive disorder, bipolar, and borderline personality) and for most of last I had all of it pretty much under control without medication for the first time in years.

429,"Basically, I have Asian parents, who eventually divorced, but ever since I was a kid, I got the typical really strict teachings that people born in the east typically teach. For example, Americans are stupid, without education your a piece of shit who will end up cleaning toilets, American girls will all become whores and any interaction with them is treasonous, you can't hang with friends because of the chance their parents are all pedophiles. Any other race besides Asian or White was seen as inferior and to be feared

So, throughout elementary school and middle school I was taught all these biases, that didn't make me hateful per se, but really frightened of the society I was part of, because I thought my parents would disown me. I was also religious back then so I constantly thought god/allah would send me to hell.

In highschool I became agnostic though, and I tried to separate myself from them, and became completely different from them. I loved American culture.

But now that I'm in university, I am noticing some issues. I get really twitchy for absolutely no reason when in most social situation, my self esteem completely died and I am constantly judging myself, which leads to more twitching and shaking, I noticed I don't treat girls the same as guys, and it's not voluntary, I completely believe we are equal and shouldn't be treated any different based on gender, and yada yada yada, however I get really shaky when talking to them, or when in a group of friends, I notice I don't talk to them as much, and logically I should treat everyone as people, yet I can't even converse normally, which sucks, I've only had one friend who is a girl. And it's not for any romantic reasons that it's frustrating, it's the fact that I should be able to be friends with whomever and their gender shouldn't matter. 

So I conclusion I just spend all my time in my dorm, studying, barely talking to anyone, and it just sucks, because I try to fix it, I tried going to more social events, but on a psychological level, I can't fix these issues, and it makes me stand out as.. idk. It's like people almost pity me and I hate that.

This really bugged me today, because I went to a little party with my old highschools buds, and I just could feel the judgement, which may or may not have been there. I was shy again, didn't share and make jokes like everyone else, was awkward. I was put on the spotlight in playing some games, and I felt so awful afterwards, not because of the game, but because of just having that much attention, to the point where a friend commented how twitchy I am..

I just need some advice on understanding why this may be happening.. whether my parents teaching affected me to a psychological level maybe.. and what I could do to make myself more comfortable with others, as I'm not creating strong interpersonal relationships.

I had an extremely horrible night shift at my waitressing job. I didn't end up leaving my job until 2 am. I was just so out of it because I only had gotten like 3 hours of sleep that day and I was just super upset with how my night went at work.

My only focus was getting home and going to bed. To top off my horrible night I ended up getting pulled over going 70 in a 45mph Construction Zone. There weren't any construction workers around because it was late at night and I was only one of few on the road. I honestly had no idea how fast I was going. I know it's definitely my fault and I shouldn't have let my emotions take over me while I was driving. I am not trying to make any excuses. 

The cop told me I wasn't going to be arrested (which is a major relief) but that I have a mandatory court date in a couple weeks. 

When I got home I started researching IL Traffic Laws and now I'm straight up panicking. I have been on court supervision before and that was probably a good year ago. I was also going over 25 in a construction zone which makes it even worse. This is my first time offense in a construction zone and I'm scared they are going to take my license away because I definitely have one or two speeding tickets on my record (the most recent one being a year ago). When I was also researching most sites were saying it's best to hire a lawyer. I can't afford that. I'm already stressing how much this fine is going to cost me plus court fees. 

Once again I'm going another night with no sleep because I'm anxious about my finances and if I'm going to lose my driver's license. Which I'm going to need to have to transport myself to my 3 different part time jobs to pay off this darned ticket. 

I was just wondering if anyone has been there or knows anything about this and can help me out. Knowing what's going to happen is definitely going to help ease my mind. I just want to know if I should expect them taking away or suspending my Liscense and if I actually do need a Lawyer? I'm also scared to know how much this fine is going to cost me!

460,"Okay so basically I posted a censored picture of myself onto a sub reddit regarding breast reduction. Everyone was lovely but this one mf direct messaged me and asked for nudes and in exchange he would give me £1000. Im a student and I’m desperate and I NEED this breast reduction which will cost me upwards of £10,000. I was in the mindset of “I hate this tumours on my chest so someone might as well enjoy them and I’ll get paid as well”. He was very professional about it and gave me evidence of his bank account and girls that he had done a similar thing with before. 

I feel so stupid but I trusted him. He wanted me to send the photos over MEGA an app that encrypts links until the sender reveals the code for the link. I had no idea how to use the app, but I kind of understood it and it sounded safe. He asked me to put the photos in a folder and send an encrypted link that only allowed him to see the EXIF data of the photo. Then he said “I’ll need the decryption code to see them, then I’ll pay you, but don’t worry I won’t be able to see them individually until you give me the code for each individual photo”. Me, not understanding how to use the app thought he was telling the truth. He wasn’t. And obviously got the folder of photos and then unfriended me and left the chat. 

So this fucker now has my nudes, my exif data, most lightly including my location, my sort code and account number (which means he has my name, I believe?). 

BUT I did not show my face in the nudes, and they are only photos of my chest. Boobs that hopefully by the end of the year will be gone. There was no personal information on my old reddit where this happened. I used a throwaway email to contact him. I also have two names which is weird I know, so if he did get my name from my bank it is not the name I use on social media or day to day.

I feel so ashamed and guilty. I don’t know what to do. I can’t sleep at night. What will this man do? Blackmail me? Send them through the post to shame me? Harass a poor girl with big tits and the name that I don’t use? Find my parents? Send them to my dads company? I’m panicking. 

I’m hoping this man is an incel neck beard type who just wanted to get his limp dick wet. And even then I feel violated which is stupid cos I know this is all my fault. 

I feel like I need to tell my parents, but I fear they won’t understand all the technology envolved. But then should tell them just in case this fat fucker sends them through the post or something? I don’t know, I wish I knew his motives.

After months of not speaking with each other, I built this idea in my head that she is some sort of all knowing omnipresent being, which I understand is stupid of me. Now that we’re speaking again, I’m reminded that she too, is human. I’m reminded of her hot headed nature. Her complete willingness to blow up at the slightest disapproved decision. I walk on eggshells constantly, I don’t want to fuck up again. And if she gets mad, I always justify it even if irrational, because I cling onto that one time I felt a connection eight months ago. I don’t want to fuck up again. Because somewhere I’m holding onto hope that I’ll feel that feeling again. I’m drowning in the memory of perfection. A perfection that was only perfect for me of course, but I was too bewildered by my newfound joy to see the cracks in my day dream. A childish, inexperienced fantasy. When this fantasy proved to be too good to be true, the pain I felt in my chest was one I had never experienced before. I didn’t know what to do. So I behaved like a child. I was selfish, I had a complete disregard for everyone around me. Not to mention drugs. God I was high. All of the time. I was running from a feeling that I knew was inevitable, and when it caught up to me, I scoffed as if I was bigger than it. As that young, inexperienced man, I held too much pride to accept that I was defeated. Life wacked me over the head and told me to grow up, I yelled “fuck you” and ran as fast as I could.
Of course, I’ve said all of this before. Out loud maybe a handful of times, but in my head the number is uncountable. It seems to be my only valuable thought, and the more I think it, the cheaper it gets.
What happens when it loses its value completely? What happens when I have literally nothing, not even a failed relationship from nearly a year ago, to hold on to?

I don't go out much and I don't have a lot of friends. I live alone and the closest family member is 40 minutes away. I was ""friends"" with this guy that I saw pretty much everyday for seven months until he went to jail. However he pretty much just used me for rides because he didn't have a car. It sounds pathetic because even though I got sick of giving him rides, I guess I liked having someone to talk to. I do work but I work alone and can't meet people. My life is pretty much sleeping, smoking cigarettes, and working. I'm just bored with life and lonely. I haven't been kissed since August 2018 and it was with a guy that just wanted sex (which I wouldn't have with him). He quit talking to me after he got a girlfriend which I knew would happen but it still hurt. I have given blowjobs and have been fingered a couple times.

464,"Hi guys, 

I'm in college. I have anxiety issues and am a little socially awkward, so I don't really have any friends. Last semester, I somehow managed to make my first friend and things were going pretty well. I was gaining more confidence as I started putting myself out there in different areas of my life. 

Basically, I started to develop a crush on my friend and I thought it was mutual, so I decided to tell them by the end of the semester. They're straight, so obviously it wasn't mutual lol. 


Sure, it hurt. It still does but what hurts the most is that I think this ended the friendship. It's not the crush thing that hurts, it's that. I know I likely made them feel uncomfortable, so I doubt they want anything to do with me now, which is fair. 

But how do I move on? They were my first friend in college. 

Many say time and distance helps all but how can it when we'll likely run into each other a lot on campus (I work there too and they'd come into my workplace a lot during the semester)

What's the best thing I can do if we do run into each other? I've thought about a slight head nod if they're not too uncomfortable to acknowledge me (but if they ignore me, I guess I'll do the same but it sure will hurt). 


Please help. Thanks.",05Jan2020,1

467,"So, throwaway account obviously. 

I (23F from a Western European country) have honestly hit a proverbial wall in my life and I really don’t see myself doing what all the other people my age are doing with their lives. Finishing college, working your ass off full time for the next however many years to be able to afford a tiny apartment, have a burnout before 30. 

I’ve been suffering from mental illness since my early tweens and with the chaos inside my head, I can’t do anything full time/dealing with people all day long. I skip class most of the time because of my anxiety and depression, and honestly I’m not sure if I’m going to make it this semester. I’ve worked a 9 to 5  time for about 8 months in the past when I dropped out of college before, but I just can’t. Do it. It’s too much. 

Now when it comes to my views on relationships, I am more on the traditional side. I personally would be extremely happy serving my husband and devoting my life to him (I’ve had relationships like this before and yes, I actually know what I’m wishing for). 

On top of all of that, I currently live with my extremely narcissistic mother and I NEED to get out of here. So yeah, in my eyes an arranged “mail order bride” type marriage seems like one of the only options if I ever want to move out without doing all these things society expects of me that I can’t do. 

Now my question is, how would I go about this? Where would I meet these men? I’ve googled it but nothing’s really come up. (Nothing that doesn’t look shady at least).

Anyone that has experience with this?",05Jan2020,0
468,"Recently, I \[18M\] started watching You on Netflix, and I'm loving the new season of it right now, and it's partly because of Love. Not the emotion, there’s a character in it called Love, and she kind of looks like this girl \[19F\] I used to talk to (let's call her Jess).

Jess is this girl that I met through a mutual friend back in October 2018. We’ve never actually met in person because she lives in a different city, but we used to talk to each other on Snapchat. She’s a really wonderful girl who has a great personality, and she's funny, and kind, and caring, and all the other things you can find in a great woman (sorry I can't name them I'm a bit of an ignoramus) and we have tons of things in common. 

I’m embarrassed to admit it, but I think at some point I actually fell in love with her. We used to talk pretty much every day earlier last year, but we kind of fell off the wagon sometime in the middle of the year, or at least she did. I remember the first night we started talking it went on for hours. It was sometime around 1 a.m. when we finally said goodbye and went to bed. I can’t remember exactly what we talked about – it was more like flirting disguised as pointless chatter if that makes any sense at all) – but I remember one stand out thing that she told me, and it was actually a pretty personal and embarrassing thing that someone really only tells someone who they’re close to: It was about how when she was a little girl she always envisioned herself getting married to someone name either John (fake name) or Geoff (also fake name), and one of those names was the one my parents game me.

I think it was actually after this conversation that I started thinking about her a lot and eventually ended up falling in love. However, by the time school rolled around, she stop replying to my messages and we stopped talking altogether for a couple months. We started again around August sometime, but our conversations weren’t as intense as they used to be. Then some ugly stuff happened with our mutual friend, (He started a rumor about how I said something “inappropriate” and “vulgar” about his sister), and Jess has stopped talking to me since.

Some time passed and I started to come up with theories as to why she stopped talking to me before; she wasn’t bored anymore. She had nothing to do during her summer break (just like me now) and she was just messaging me to entertain herself. This might not be true but it’s the logical response, and my close friend who I sometimes talk to about this agrees, but even after all this mess, I still loved her, so moving on from her completely is going to be hard. I keep telling myself that when I start work or university, I’ll find someone new, and Jess’ll be completely off my mind, but deep down I know that isn’t what’s going to happen. I can find the perfect girlfriend at university, but I know that I’m still going to be thinking about Jess because she’s the one that got away, and you know that the things you can’t have are the things you want the most.

I would really appreciate some advice on this topic, it's kind of driving me nuts thinking about her.

Thanks :)",05Jan2020,1
469," This happened a few years ago... I had been dating this kid (in college) and was at the bar with my sisters best friend/ roommate whom I was also close with at the time. While waiting for bf to get there (let’s call him Dan), sisters best friend (well call her Mary) kept offering to buy me drinks. Of course, I accepted, and thought it was really nice of her to offer to take my phone as well so (in her words) I “didn’t send drunk texts to Dan”. As the night progressed, Dan showed up and so did my sister. At this point I was very drunk, and Dan and I started to argue at the bar. I got upset and ran crying to my sister, who then helped arrange for my friends to get me home and put me to bed. The next day, I find out that after I left, my sister drove Mary and Dan back to Marys/ my sisters house so they could sleep together, and my sister also gave Dan a ride home in the morning. She never planned on telling me. It was only when some other friends said they saw them leave together that it was brought to my attention. Fast forward about five years, my sister invites Mary to constantly stay at our family house (in my room If I’m not there), invites us both places and does not tell me she will be there, and Mary is now a bridesmaid in my sisters upcoming wedding. Aside from what was done to me, Mary makes very terrible choices with her life overall. I get so angry when she is around, but I never say anything since my sister is somewhat of a loose cannon. I especially wouldn’t say anything now with the upcoming wedding. Whenever Mary is around, I act as normal as possible and just try and act like she isn’t there. I interact normally with everyone else, I don’t make comments or (obvious) faces at Mary’s remarks, I just completely ignore her, but her presence stresses me out to no end. I have a new bf now who is amazing, but for me, hating this girl is not only about what she did to me, but the overall person that I know she is, as well as my sister choosing to stay friends with her. My family refuses to even acknowledge the situation. When I tell my dad it makes me uncomfortable having her around he tells me I’m dramatic and that I need to get over it. My other sister plays BFF with Mary whenever she’s around and both sisters act completely annoyed when I don’t acknowledge Mary. I don’t think I’m completely irrational for feeling like this, but I have no idea how to approach any of this. I would want my sister to at least give me a heads up if Mary is going to be around so I have the option to say no. I can do this with any normal situation involving her, but I don’t know how I’m going to stand next to this girl at my sisters wedding and have to look at these pictures for the rest of my life. To me, it’s a huge betrayal that I would never imagine putting one of my sisters through.",05Jan2020,2

Her aunt and uncle have been fighting with each other for a while. This fighting has been mostly verbal, with a couple of physical altercations. These have only been physical on the uncle's part.

Recently these have been getting worse and has started to bleed over to my gf. She has been yelled at regularly and I'm worried that the physical parts may bleed over too. They also have two Tennant's living there who have been noticing the increased hostility.

The aunt is in a fair bit of denial and is currently completely reliant on the uncle as she is bedridden (recent operation, noting to do with the issue)

I'm not sure what I can do. Her other uncle and I are willing to step in physically but that's probably not going to help much permanently. I don't know if police intervention is an option as I think an event has to happen beforehand.

I used to be really sure I loved her but now I’m not as sure and don’t know what I want anymore. I don’t know if I want the small chance of being together throughout all of high school and never dating anyone else or dealing with college and moving away from each other. Not only that but I don’t know if I can leave or not because she was emotionally unstable in her past and sometimes when we fight she says things like “I don’t want to do something I’ll regret” or along those lines.

475,"Pretty much just what the title says. I hated the shift I was on, but realized I had to stay on it so I didn’t complain much. The assistant manger likes me very well and said she would get me moved from midnights to 4-12 because I was improving and she knew I would get the work done. I should mention, when I interviewed I told them I worked at the other store in town before (it’s a company) and that the reason I left was that I was moved to the kitchen and hated waking up in the morning it was so bad and that I would *not* like to work in the kitchen at all. Was told that would be fine and they were glad to have me back. First few weeks were good, not great but I couldn’t really complain, just the usual gripes that everybody has with work. Until I noticed that other workers seemed to get away with more than others. I.e. leaving work unfinished for the next shift and seemingly no repercussions for it. Then it all went downhill. I’ll go back and say, remember how I was told I would be getting took off midnights? Well, I go in this week to find out I’m being moved to the kitchen and that I’ll be working the midnight shift on it. I went to the manager and asked her what was up. She told me everybody was being moved around and that it wouldn’t be permanent and to just go with it pretty much. But here’s the kicker, they hired a new guy (after talking about sales being down and being over staffed to the point of cutting hours hard) for midnights and I had been led to believe that once he was trained I would be taken off the graveyard shift. That didn’t happen, and now the hours are cut to where I’m working 4 hour shifts. And the kitchen manager puts off a lot on her subordinates that she shouldn’t. She left a delivery truck out all day and told me and another new guy to put it up even though we had no idea where most of it went. And the other kitchen employee didn’t finish his weekly cleaning list so I was told on my next shift I would be working with him and was supposed to pretty much take on his punishment with him and help him get a weeks worth of stuff done in one shift even though I wasn’t a kitchen employee when he was supposed to have not done his work. I will go ahead and mention the assistant manger had been bragging me up saying I was doing great and had really improved all week last week so I’m having trouble understanding why it feels like I’m being punished. I’m really at the point of just quitting it’s getting on my nerves so bad. Like no matter how much effort you put in, you’re just gonna get the shaft in the end. What should I do?

481,"I'm desperate for advice about a tutoring job with a former student of mine. The student's mom emailed me asking if I could step in as a home tutor for her 1st year biology class in uni and I accepted today. The semester starts back up on monday next week and now I'm regretting it because  the mom drives me nuts. I'm considering to decline the offer, but I don't want to let down the student or the mom. 

A little backstory, I have been tutoring this student since they were in highschool and have known them for a while. The mom is a total ""Tiger mom"" when it comes to the academics , but still honestly just loves and spoils their kid. When I tutored, the mom would call my home phone and cell phone repeatedly at like 9 or 11pm until I picked up for parenting advice or for help on the kid's assignment (due the night before).She would also ask me to give her my old assignments so they could be ""references"" for their kid's assignment. The mom would also ask me to edit  her kid's assignments on the side as well. This was all outside of regular tutoring hours which I was not paid for. I gave in because the mom would always be so nice to me and would gift me small things.I also gave my all since it was my first time as a tutor. I honestly felt bad when I didn't say yes since the mom was stressed trying to keep their kid's grades up when the kid didn't even care about their own grades. I stopped tutoring her kid after they graduated highschool because I told them I wasn't qualified to help out since they were entering university for an arts degree now. ( I'm in my last years of undergrad in science)

Back to my present dilemma.
 I said yes to coming back to the job since I could use the extra money for school. An hour after replying to her job offer, the mom immediately calls my home phone and cell phone untill I pick up(Its 10pm at night). The mom wanted a copy of my resume and some other documents. The mom needs them to get funding from the government for financial aid. She needs to prove to the school's advisor that I'm qualified. After I send it over, the mom sends me 2 emails telling me to edit my resume so that I look more qualified. I do tutoring as more of a ""side hustle"". She also told me to cut out a lot of things that a resume should include. The mom also ranted about me having used my university email address on my resume, rather than the one I gave her. Saying that "" I don't think you will check that email address so use the one you gave me"". Honestly, the corrections she gave me were kind of insulting and picking on my last nerves. ( I had a job advisor read over my resume before submitting it to her. )

I'm kind of done taking it from the mom, especially since I was underpaid for the 3 years I worked for her. I'm open to any opinions about what I should do. I don't want to come across rude for ditching them last second, but I also don't think I can put up with them for 4 months. Im stressed. Worried. Help.",05Jan2020,2

He asks me where I'm from, what I do etc. The second I mention I'm from Leeds he perks up and asks which area. I tell him, thinking he knows someone down there. 

He does and he hates their guts. Apparently J's father is a corrupt business man who is involved in a lot of sketchy politics/other business. He also tells me he has a couple of gang members under his thumb but someone from a gang in Leeds killed one of them (I don't know the whole story and I don't want to) but now he wants revenge on that gang. He offered me money (in the millions) to lure the boss that i know out to a remote location where his people can kill him. It honestly sounds crazy and I said no.

J drove me home a few hours later. He told me that we shouldn't talk for a bit until things calm down. He told me he'll talk to his father about leaving me out of this. He was genuinely upset and worried. He asked me to text him once a week to make sure I'm ok. Well a couple of days ago I saw a black van parked out near the back of my house. I didn't see anyone but no one in my area owns a black van. I have a few good guesses who it is and I'm probably digging myself into a deeper hole by posting here but I need advice on what to do.",05Jan2020,1

497,"Hi guys,
I have never posted here but have been reading for a while and find the community very helpful. 

I just got news from my mum that she had a biopsy done from a Breast lump and didn’t go well. She has an operation in two weeks. I can’t even bring myself to write down the word. 
I just got the news yesterday after a very long stressful work-related trip. I arrived and I basically was told within 15 minutes of arriving. I know she was just needing to tell me but I was just in such a physically and mentally low state, I just broke down. I cried so much and she just embraced me and told me it was going to be okay. 
I do actually regret reacting like that because she needs people to be strong for her.
The last few years have been hard. My parents have completely depended on us for about 5 years and my dad has been pretty much depressed all this time... so I always need to be the strong one. My sisters are not very supporting financially or emotionally... my relationship with my husband has taken a hit due to so much pressure. We have a small business but things haven’t really turn a point. It’s steady but doesn’t go up too much... 

Man, I was thinking in the way back home how I want to turn my life around so much. How I wanted to get healthier, fitter, quit smoking, learn more skills, to work harder... my parents depend on me financially so, I need really need to make more money. I currently  have two jobs to help me out but the second one I really don’t enjoy.... 
but now I feel like a rug has been pulled from under my feet and I’m so down now.

I grew up incredibly poor, with an alcoholic father and a mentally abusive mother. I was good in school, and had to work through summers since I was twelve. 

Then at fourteen I got a scholarship that had me move 800km away, and I lived with my both mentally and physically abusive uncle for another year before I couldn't take it anymore. I moved out and rented half a room with the money I was making from doing student work on the weekends and dishwashing at night. 

I finished high school, went to university, worked my way through it all and finished an MA as well.

Now I have a stable job, a loving girlfriend and everything is okay for the first time in my life.  

Since i am so used to just having constant money problems, abuse and every other issue on the planet, I think my out of comfort zone is the calm that I have now, and this causes a constant feeling of anxiety and impending doom.

514,"Long story short I already have issues with my mental health and alcohol only makes my inability to regulate my emotions even worse. 


I don’t drink often enough to have put two and two together before this because it’s been a 50/50 occurrence and I guess I also just wanted to think that maybe I could have a normal life. Going out drinking with friends was a part of that “normal life” I imagined. I accept now that I can’t do everything everyone else does or else it leads to situations like this and this can’t happen anymore. 


I am not very close with this friend group but I also have no other friends since I isolate myself from people. On New Years Eve I sent them an emotional drunk text about how I have no friends except their acquaintanceship and how I was alone and depressed. I apologized in the morning but they were also concerned about me and we setup a day to spend time together. 


Cue last night... we are out drinking and dancing but then things turn for the worst when I begin sobbing and hyperventilating as if I just witnessed a family member die. I couldn’t talk to anyone either, so this intense display of emotion came out of nowhere and they had no idea why. Two people in specific tried to comfort me and as I sobered up a bit I realized how uncomfortable everyone was. I could tell they were not happy and when I was leaving one of them didn’t even want to hug me goodbye when she normally would. 


I feel embarrassed and sick to my stomach. I want to hide away and just say nothing. I think I should apologize though. It is also ridiculous that after only 5 days I am apologizing for another emotional break down. That makes me want to say nothing even more because I feel more ashamed and like my apology will be meaningless. 


Last night was a major setback for me emotionally, too. I keep replaying this in my head and I hate myself for it. I don’t want to sink deeper into a depression but I don’t know how to stop dwelling and pick myself back up. I can’t just go for a walk and make this better. I can’t keep living life this way either. I struggle to get close with people and I am so depressed and alone because of it. But then I have people to get close with and this happens. It makes me want to give up even more. I do go to therapy, have a psychiatrist, and medicine but nothing ever helps. I still haven’t managed to calm down enough to sleep after all of this and it’s 7:27am here.",05Jan2020,1

516,"So heres some basic background info about my situation to start. I’m 20, and currently live at home with both of my parents. I should also add that my father has never been physically abusive, and is usually pretty apologetic after an episode of anger. There’s also a lot to this story and I don’t think it’ll be possible to explain everything, but I really need someone to listen and an outsiders opinion.

Anyway, for as long as I can remember my dad has had anger issues, and the smallest things can make him go totally insane sometimes. For example when I was younger and I would forget to put something away, this would be enough to set him off. When he’s this angry he usually yells/swears, walks around the house with more force, and slams everything around him..overall he just makes a big racket. This would happen constantly as a kid. However, when I got into my late teens it occurred a lot less frequently because he ended up seeking help for his mental health and started on some medication. (He has depression, and very recently was also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder). 

Nonetheless, his anger issues are still a problem. And I think a lot of the anxiety, and timidness that I have to this day stems from being yelled at all the time by him. One of my biggest fears that stemmed from this was his footsteps. We’ve always lived in 3 story homes, and in our old house if I was in the floor below him I could always tell is he was upset by the sound of his footsteps upstairs. In our current house, footsteps usually sound loud no matter what just because of how the house is made I guess? And even though I know that, whenever I hear loud footsteps upstairs it still makes me panic. 

Soo..fast forward to yesterday, and the main reason why I’m writing all this. I currently have a really bad cold and I’ve been home all week trying to recover. In addition to this, my mental health was already in the gutter and I spent all of yesterday crying. So I’m sitting in my bedroom feeling awful, and all of a sudden I hear the door slam two stories down in the basement, along with some yelling that I can’t make out. I go downstairs, and my dad is down there screaming and swearing about how I need to “fix the couch cover”. I told him to calm down and to leave, so he did. But that just was the final straw for me. I just got totally overwhelmed, and immediately left the house (I’m staying at my s/o’s house right now). 
After I left my Mom also texted me and told me to “apologize to my Dad because that’s his trigger, and that I promised to keep an eye on the couch cover”

The thing is my Dad is a really sensitive person and I can tell he wants to me closer with me, and I wanted to be closer with him too. But every time I think “hey our relationship is getting on the right track” he goes insane over some small thing, and I no longer want to be around him anymore. 

I know that he often apologizes afterwards, and tells me he loves me. Which is a lot more than what some other people can say about their parents. And I also know that he has some mental health issues which he cannot control. But I’m tired of being yelled at all the time, I’ve dealt with it my entire life and it’s very draining. Maybe certain things “trigger him” but I’m done tip toeing around him all the time because a grown man can’t seem to control his own emotions.",05Jan2020,2

521,"Hi there. I’m really struggling with what to do here so would really appreciate some advice. 

My wedding is about a month away and the RSVPs have now come in (and we’re chasing the last ones, mainly family members who assumed they didn’t need to RSVP)

My sister is one of my fiancee's bridesmaids and when we told her about the date of the wedding and asked if she would be a bridesmaid she asked if she could have a plus one. Of course, we said yes, but she wouldn’t disclose the identity. 

At the time we assumed this was either she wasn’t seeing anyone and wanted it as a safeguard in case she started dating someone before then, or that she was worried I’d be annoying about it (I tend to be a bit overprotective)

Anyway, fast forward to today, and I told her that if she actually wanted this Plus one, she had to rsvp for them. 

We have an online rsvp system so when she submitted it I found out that her plus one is actually her best friend. I was caught off guard, and her best friend and I get on pretty well (although we’re only acquaintances). I don’t handle stress well and tend to be very very agreeable when put on the spot. My family know this unfortunately, so in the moment I kind of just laughed and said oh, that’s fine. My mother thought the whole thing was amusing too. (I come from a somewhat dysfunctional family). 

Fiancee was not there at the time. Now though, the more we think about it, the more annoyed/angry we are. 

Our wedding is deliberately small because we don’t have much of a budget to work with and we only wanted our close friends and family there. Budget wise, we fall below the poverty line and we’re financing the vast majority of the wedding ourselves. We only invited guests’ partners on the invite if we actually know them as well as the guest and said plus one’s only by request.  As an example, my fiancee’s stepmother barely made the list. 

My sister (and mother who was in on the whole thing) let me think that it was someone my sister was romantically involved with, whilst knowing that the best friend wouldn’t have had a chance of being invited otherwise. They refused to tell me who the person was every time I asked. 


My question is, what the hell do we do?

I said yes, and I think i’d be unfair on my sister’s best friend to say the next day, “actually no” even if there is a good reason. 
How can I handle this situation? 

The other is what do I (we) do about my sister and mother? They seem to think this is fine, but with a month until the wedding, I don’t really want to start a family feud (my mother and I have a pretty strained relationship). 

I definitely acknowledge that I did screw up by saying yes, but both my fiancee and I are now just thoroughly pissed off at my sister's actions and 

So yeah, rant over. We would really appreciate any advice on what to do. 
Thank you in advance.

523,"(I’m so sorry for the read, I really only made this account to get this off my chest)

Lately, in fact for quite some time, I’ve felt very alone. For as long as I can remember I’ve been left home alone while both my parents worked (they were split, but at both houses the sitch was the same), and it started bleeding into my friendships. People that I’ve known for years and would consider very close friends just seemingly drifted off and are, to this day, super tight with another girl that had not treated me very nicely up until a short while ago. 

It’s not the loneliness I don’t like about myself, it’s the jealousy that comes from it. I ask myself: what does she have that I don’t? I compare myself to her and am so harsh on myself that I always end up in tears about it. It is so counterproductive, I recognise that even amidst doing it, but somehow can’t help myself. 

And it’s not just in friendships, but in my relationship too... He’ll say that a girl is cute, and it’s not that I think he shouldn’t say that, but that I completely agree and find myself once more comparing us. I find that I believe these girls to be indeed cute, much cuter than I could ever hope to be, and I just go quiet. 

I can’t do this to him, it’s so unfair. He’s allowed to find people cute, I know it doesn’t diminish his love for me in any way, I just want to be happy with him. 

There was also the time he excitedly showed me texts between him and his girl friend that was moving back to where we live, and I tried to be happy for him but it was so faked, and I ended up being passive-aggressive with him anyway. I apologised, and when he said thank you for that, I cried, because I realised how important it was that he felt trusted no matter what, and I wasn’t going to take his friends away. 

I am seeing my psychiatrist next Monday, and I intend to bring this issue up, but can anyone offer any advice on how to better myself in this regard? I do not like this feeling.  

Thank you",05Jan2020,1
524,"Hi there! I'm in a group of friends of fifteen guys (between the age of 23-27) and we do stuff together like all friends do. Including having dinner together at least one time of the week, drinking, watching movies, going on holidays, and also going to festivals. During those activities almost never all fifteen friends are there. That doesn't matter though. We've known each other for about seven years now since we started college. In May or June I'd like to go to a festival with some of my friends of that friends group, however I'm don't really like the idea of going with one particular friend. Before coming to the question whether and how I want to avoid this person, I will elaborate my relation to the group of people and the person himself.

The person in question, I shall refer to the person as Blake, is a close friend of mine and I don't really dislike or hate the guy, but sometimes he can really be pain in the ass. Especially when it comes to group dynamics. For instance my siblings and I went out for a drink two years ago and everything was smooth sailing and nice and then he asked if it was okay if he and his sister could join in. It was a college related ''siblings party'' where everyone could bring his or her siblings and party. So I didn't mind that he and his sister joined the predrinks. I mean I didn't really appreciate it into full extent because my siblings, two sisters and one brother, we're having a good time together and then someone else joined. Saying it ''disturbed the whole group dynamic'' isn't quite true, but I was still thinking: ''it would still have been a nice time if you didn't join in, but whatever you can join.'' So far so good. We were having some laughs, some drinks, and something to eat in between.

Then we set off to the actual party. It was sort of a festival. Everywhere are stands for something to eat, some activities you can take part in, and everybody knows everybody. A nice and good vibe basically; everybody is enjoying the late summer sun shining over the place. Then at one point I decided to get some beers for everybody. It takes a while to get a beer since it's a festival and everybody somehow seems to be so very slow. My brother and I eventually got the beers and came back to my oldest sister crying. I asked: ''what happened?''. Apparently Blake was trying to be funny and was joking about how my brother and she were the ''dumb couple'' in the family and my youngest sister and I the ''smarter folks''. He had just been taunting her with some talk about her and my brother failing some classes, while my youngest sister and I have been passing (most) other classes. I mean: how f'ing stupid can you be to actually make your best friend's sister cry?! I didn't even know how to react. Of course I was mad at him and he apologized and I couldn't get my head around how a person could even do it. Considering the whole situation of letting him share in the activities, having a good time, and then it results in him insulting my family.

Something I have to mention is that he has a form of autism. So sometimes he says degrading/sarcastic things because he thinks that in some way it is funny while it in fact is just a taunting gesture and not a well placed pun like he thinks it is. For example he often says something about how I eat a lot and makes a fatty joke. Or another friend who doesn't sleep well and therefore he leaves quite early at parties and calling him a quitter or something in that sense. To make the joke even worse he often repeats the same kind of joke in almost every other situation you meet him. To the friends group it doesn't really matter that much: we know he sometimes just is a prick, we just shake it off when those things happen. When you talk with him in a smaller group of people you can see he's a reasonable guy. He knows how to debate and have a discussion, he can compliment people on their work or behavior, he can make make actual jokes (whether they're funny ones I sometimes doubt). For example he and I went to the Joker a few months ago and we had a genuine good debate about the movie, it's underlying meaning, and made jokes about some things. He's a good guy, but sometimes he just doesn't know what a prick he is when he makes a stupid sarcastic joke while he's in a group. I do think he's a friend of mine. I can see if some of you might say: ''he's an a hole. Get rid of your the guy as your friend. No friend of anybody let's his or her sister cry.'' But because he did apologize and I know that sometimes he doesn't ''get'' why some jokes aren't funny I still consider him to be my friend.

But to come back to my actual question: I want to go to a festival this May or June with my friends group, but I don't really want the guy to come with us. By not inviting the guy is insulting I think. One way or another he will find out since most of us live in the same city and it would be a very big coincidence if all of us would not be in town at the very date of the festival. I should mention it is a festival we've been going to as a friends group for three years now. And I don't want to lie against my friends either. By do inviting him to the festival means to invite a buzz killer. Is there a good/nice way to saying ''sorry, we don't want you''? Would you invite the guy, and if doing so: what would you further ask from or debate with the guy?

PS: would really appreciate someone's thought about what people think about male-to-male friendships. As a guy it's so easy to get into fight and then to shake it off just the other night with a beer. And I think that is an interesting fact to witness, but in the long run these fights make it complex to judge how your own relationship with that other male friend is actually like.",05Jan2020,0
525," So whenever I start jogging for around like 10-15 minutes I start feeling this pain in the middle of my 2 feet it's hard to describe but it hurt whenever I ""come down to step on it"" I have adequate running shoes that are not even 1 year old and I have arch supports because of my flat feet. Yet I still hurt running half the time. I'm 17 years old by the way. I tried rolling my feet underneath a soft tennis ball but it doesn't really seem to help it. So are there any more exercises or things I can do/try to deal with the pain? It literally stops hurting 2 minutes after running. The running shop where I got the arch supports and shoes believed it's something with the muscle there or something and suggested that ball exercise sadly it doesn't seem to be effective

I originally left NY because I felt that the city life made me stressed out and agitated, but now I also feel like I forced myself to move out of NY without really thinking what was best for me. I moved into a state with lower minimum wage, my living condition isn’t any better than NY (I sleep on a couch for Christ’s sake), and the closest college that has my degree is 50 miles away.

My parents are always open to having me move back home but I’ve resisted going back. After being here a little bit for the holidays I took the time to really think about whether I made the right decision, and I’m ready to talk to my parents about it as well.

Redditors, any advice before I speak to them? Any feedback would be highly appreciated, and thank you for reading this.",05Jan2020,1
527,"We're both almost 30, in a couple months.

We've known each other since Middle School, and dated for the end of the latter, and through half of High School. First of everything together, first love, first kiss, first sex, etc.

We've been talking for a couple months now, and within the last ~three weeks have started talking every day all day through text, and have seen each other about a half a dozen times, half of those times were like 5 hours of just like talking about everything.

Upon seeing each other more and everything, I have basically completely fallen for her again. Her response was that she cares about me, but she's ""not sure if those feelings are romantic"".

So the issue I'm having is that we're existing in this admitted openly grey area right now, yet from our most recent time together I feel like the question of her feelings for me now, and in the future, have been answered.

Basically we were out to dinner last night, and for whatever reason she decides to start telling me about this guy she's been talking to, and that she was planning on going on a date with him. To be fair I guess, she did mention that they really didnt hit it off, and she's probably not going to go on the date, but the point to me is that she is essentially ""actively dating"".

Am I crazy in thinking that her being actively looking for dates, as well as the fact that she decides to just tell me about this openly, also coupled with the fact that her words in relation to what she feels about me are ""I'm not sure if the feeling are romantic yet"", that she definitely doesnt, and will not ever have those types of feelings about me?

To me, just being actively dating and then telling me about it, while knowing how I am feeling about her, kinda just says it all.

Am I just being stupid about this? Naive? Reading into it too much?",05Jan2020,1
528,"How do you get rid of ”good girl-syndrome”?

Like the title says, please give me some advice how to get rid of good girl-syndrome! 

I’ve been a perfectionist and overachiever my whole life and I feel like the stress that comes with it is literally going to be the death of me one day. 

I am currently writing my first university thesis and for the last 2 days I haven’t been able to sleep because this essay is all I think about. The worst thing is that I can’t even finish it because I constantly go back and re-edit unnecessary stuff because I feel like it’s not perfect enough. Right now I sort of feel like it would be good for me to get an F just so I would understand that it’s not the end of the world, but to help me de-stress from it I just need some guidance.

529,"Where to begin... I’ll state the issue and go from there. (Apologies for poor formatting)

tldr at the bottom

So my mum is struggling like never before to the point I’m worried for her safety. She’s a single 54 woman who live in an overpriced rented house. She has 3 dogs she used to compete with in sport though they now create constant noise, mess and can’t be left for more than a few hours. Her morning job just about sustains the bills with the help of her ex husband and dad. About a month ago she was diagnosed by a friend (psychologist) with mental breakdown and due to no one showing any care she’s since gotten worse. 

She believes now that nobody cares about her and it’s hard to prove otherwise. She values family over all else and has been let down by some of them, to the point that she doesn’t even confide in me or her dad (two closest to her). 

How can I help her? She’s seeing a therapist but I’m not sure what good it will do. The money situation is really bad and I don’t want to find her dead somewhere if I’m truly honest. 

tldr; Mum has bad mental health with no one caring and a poor quality of life, how do I help her?",05Jan2020,1
530,"So, this is a long one.

Back in August, I (22F) hit a really low spot in my life.  Panic attacks and depression basically. I went to a new Dr (after my previous one brushed off these symptoms as a chest infection) and ended up being prescribed with low dose SSRI's and recommended that I go to CBT.  Both of which I've been following rigidly and I'm in a really good place now.  Probably the best I've ever been. 

But basically, almost two weeks ago my uncle (dad's brother) died quite suddenly.  Of course we were all heartbroken but more shocked than anything else.
I felt myself, I was dealing with it all really well based on my previous reactions when family pass on. 

I live at home with my brothers - one (24) was close to this uncle, the other not so much.
So, my brother who was close, took it quite tough when he died. But he seemed to be ok. Everything this Christmas was very different, we'd family over that wouldn't normally be over, the funeral was the day after Christmas Day.  Everything seemed to just be passing in a slight blur.

On New Years Eve, my mum and I went to her brothers house for the new years.  Whilst we were there my brother was texting/calling my mam every few minutes to check if everything was OK and when she was coming home. 
This gradually got worse, to the point now where he's dumping his feelings onto my family as a whole, freaking out over things.  He won't let my mum leave the house. 

For example, yesterday, she and my dad left to walk our dogs, she rang me after a few minutes (probably only 20 minutes after she'd left) on my dad's phone (she's left her phone at home) to see what was going on because my brother was ringing my dad's  phone constantly.  Whilst they were gone, my brother was in my bedroom pacing up and down the entire time.  My parents came back shortly after that and it turned out my mum had over 20 missed calls from him too.

He went to the doctor on Friday and she prescribed him xanex, but they're literally having no effect on him at all.  None of us really know what's going on with him at all.  My dad, who is a psychiatric nurse, has said himself he's never seen anything like it before. 

He's not exactly helping himself either, it seems he's not dealing with his feelings properly and instead of doing things that make him feel good, he's just pacing around my house and allowing himself be that way..

Having him dumping his stuff on me and even just seeing him this way is triggering me and things I've spent almost 4 months working on being able to deal with are now setting me off again.  I feel like I'm beginning to lose control of myself again.  My entire family now know I'm on meds and going to therapy, whereas before it was just my mum who knew, because she told him that I was on them and he told everyone in my house.

I've tried leaving my house but I also don't want to go because I don't want my mum to be alone with him.  I know she's being set off by the way he's acting too, but is putting up a front that it's not affecting her. 

I'm not sure if anyone has any experience of this happening before or if anyone has any help for me to get back to being in control? I'm just at my wits end with everything right now.",05Jan2020,1
532,"I just turned 19 and I graduated high school in 2019. I went to a local technical school for the fall semester this year but I quickly realized it wasn’t for me. Now, I’m unemployed and don’t have any money to go to school with (unless I take out loans) 
I still live at home with my parents and I feel so useless. What am I even doing if I don’t have a job and aren’t going to school? 
I’m not even 100% sure what I want to do with my life yet, but I feel like I have to figure it out soon. I’ve been so stressed out and anxious that I’ve been sleeping through the day, which makes me MORE anxious because I haven’t been doing anything progressive.

534,"Hi, I’m 21 years old and at this point in my life for all things considered I have a well paying job. I dropped out of college and started working and I get paid about $16.20 an hour which is pretty good for someone without a degree. I want to leave my job badly because it’s pretty mentally draining and I’m tired of working outside in sub zero temperatures (I live in Anchorage, AK) The downside is I know if I get a different job it will most likely be in the $10-$14 range. I have rent, a car payment, a student loan, and some credit card payments and it would take much longer to pay all that off if I got a lower paying job. I’ve been wanting to quit for months but the money is the only thing keeping me and I don’t want to come off as unprofessional because I’ve only been working at my job for a year and a half.

He would smille and look at me constantly, gave me things, bought things for me, did nice things for me, encouraged me to do better. I mean this guy went above and beyond for me. And so I fell for him. He would give me mixed signals though constantly but I just thought since he was new to this sort of thing, a virgin, he just didn’t know what he was doing. Then two nights ago I told him how I felt. So Friday night we worked together, and I asked him to come over and he was acting like he didn’t want to but came anyways. I think deep down he knew I was going to confess to him. I tried to do it the night before but I chickened out. He said I thought you may want to tell me that. In the end, he told me he didn’t like me and that we should stay friends, and said, “that’s what you thought? That I liked you?” And I think out of everything that hurt the most, and I just am left feeling stupid, depressed, wanting to isolate. I didn’t speak to him all day yesterday even though I would text him everyday before this. He sent me a text late last night saying “hope you’re doing ok” and I’m just left feeling confused and unsure what to do.

His parents passed away well we were dating. Crazy ex being an asshole to him. I see him as my little baby because he relies on me. He's obviously submissive in the relationship, and I'm more dominant. I have a class type of job, and he doesn't work.

Well, too bad because he refuses to drive because he's paranoid he'll crash my car, (it's my dream car).

550," So, I (28M) met this girl (30F) through an online dating app around a week ago. We hit it off pretty well, talked for hours and met for our first date yesterday. It went on for 12hours, from lunch to 1 A.M. Things escalated pretty quickly and soon after lunch we were at her place where we shared our first kiss. She had some experience in kissing but for me it was a first. (we are both virgins too) At first i was clueless on what to do xD but quickly i caught on and started having a good time with it.

Now here is the thing, I was having fun while the excitement of discovery was going on. After a while, it felt kind of bland. Like i was disconnected or something. Just going through the motions. As things heated up and she started to grind and dry straddle me I thought i would start to get aroused but I didn't. My buddy who lives downstairs was unresponsive. I didn't feel nervous or anxious, I think. I just expected it to happen and when it didn't it kind of ruined the night for me :/It got even worse when, towards the end of the night she invited me to fondle and taste her breasts and I gladly did, still... no reaction downstairs, even as I watched her have pleasure from it. And me enjoying giving it to her...I felt nothing on my end...I even faked moans of my own to help her have her enjoyment....

Is something wrong with me? She is not a magazine cover model but then again neither am I, I was seduced by her personality and her intelligence not exactly her body but it feels like i should at least be feeling SOMETHING... anything!

I have massive libido on my own, and I just thought it would translate immediately once I finally got it on with a woman instead of on my own, even if it was not her physique that drew me to her in the first place.

Now here i am, barely 12 hours after the fact, feeling like trash because I might be leading this girl on, and will surelly end up breaking her heart if this goes on like this. She was super into just cuddling and soft kissing while listening to these disney princess romance songs on her spotify but to me that was just....well...boring as hell. And i kind of hate myself for it. Its a dream of hers i guess. And I was making it reality.

I waited 28 years of my life and my first 1 on 1 experience with a woman ends up like this... Me unmotivated and unaroused and her, in a bliss of misdirection of my making. Sometime in the middle she asked if this meant we are now BF and GF to which i answered yes. I just couldn't bring myself to ruin her moment. I really hope this is something i can fix. I don't want to let this wonderfull woman slip through my fingers but I don't want to lead her on if this is headed nowhere. She deserves better than that.

When i got home yesterday night, as i was laying in bed, I recalled those more intense moments we had and i did get aroused on my own. Hence this conflict. Was it just me putting high expectations on my first time or is there really nothing there? x.x

What do I do? Should I keep trying? It was just one date after all. I am so lost on what to do...

553,"Scenario. Your partner introduces a tradition of bringing in the new year by going out the back door and ringing the front door, holding a piece of bread (represent food), a twig (no idea, coal (heat), and a coin (wealth), they insist on doing it each year meaning they spend new year outside, you don’t really like it but you go with it because it’s not that big of a deal. Well this year they get ready to do it and I comment about their sister always phoning dead on midnight and that they will be outside, they say oh I’ll just take the phone with me, I say ‘please don’t ring the door on the phone to someone else’, I don’t mind you doing your thing and me needing to let you in with the new year but please don’t be chatting to someone else while supposedly bringing the new year into the house for us. Was told they would just hang up and call back once they were inside. 
Answered the door and surprise surprise they were on the phone to the sister trying to wish me a happy new year wondering why I was cross and was told to stop over reacting. 

It wasn’t what they were doing specifically (even though rude) it was the fact I had literally asked for that exact situation to not happen 5 minutes before hand but was ignored.

What would you think? 
Also, I know there will be people out there will see this as just silly and that they wouldn’t be bothered by it, which I agree it is silly, it’s the fact I asked them to please not do something I would find annoying and them agreeing with it, that’s what I am annoyed at. 

Also another note, we’ve been married for 20 years if that makes a difference.

554,"I don’t know if this is the community for this one, however I’m a newbie here, so please bear with me. 

My father - a kind, sensitive primary school principal - jumped in front of a train last week. It was a complete shock to everyone - he had no history of mental illness or depression, and had been happily married to my mum for 32 years. I’m the eldest of his four children, and he was probably the person we each relied upon the most. He loved that - he enjoyed being needed, and always new exactly what do say or do in any given moment to make us feel safe, loved and secure. 

It all started ten days before he died. I was on the way home from the gym, and I noticed that I had a missed call from Dad. I grabbed a coffee downstairs, and immediately called him back as I let myself into my apartment. Instantly, I knew something was up.

‘What are you up to this afternoon?’ he mumbled into the phone. As the ultimate primary school teacher, he was usually calm and cheerful (in a non-annoying way) and this version of him was way off. 

‘I need you to come home now. Mum and I have something we need to talk to the four of you about.’ My immediate thought was cancer. He was sick, and he wanted us all to be together when we heard it. My parent’s relationship was stronger than anyone else’s that I’d ever met, so the prospect of divorce didn’t even cross my mind. 

‘You can’t just leave it like that!’ I said. ‘I need to know if you’re okay.’ ‘It’s nothing like that’ he said. ‘No one’s sick.’ There was a long pause. ‘I’ve done something with money’. 

I fumbled for a moment and said, ‘well, whatever it is, it doesn’t matter! We’ll sort it out’. He started to cry, which made me cry, and he just kept telling me how much he loved me. I immediately ran downstairs to my car, and cried the entire 40 minute drive to my parents house. 

It turned out that my Dad has been embezzling money from his school. Nothing huge - it started out with him temporarily taking money from an account when he fell short (i.e. $500) and then paying it back when his next pay came in. As time went on, he would pay back 90% of the amount, but keep the last 10%. Eventually, this became 20%, 30%, etc. 

Over three years this amounted to $30k. He never intended for it to get this far, but I do understand how a small mistake can eventually snowball into a big one, specially under enough pressure to hide it. Sometimes life gets away from you, and you do things that you’re not proud of. 

The education office had informed him a few months earlier that they would be doing an audit of the accounts. They didn’t know anything was missing from the account he oversaw, however he’d been spiralling ever since. He opened and closed multiple versions of the account, moving money around in the hope that the auditors would lose track amongst the paper trail. Ultimately it became too much, and he confided in my Mum. She supported him 100%, but told him that he had to come forward. 

He did, and was immediately placed on indefinite ‘sick leave’ until they could work out where we stood. That was the day before the phone call, and by then, he knew he was out of a job. My parents still had a mortgage, school fees to pay and now, the prospect of huge legal fees and the loss of the family home. The education office had also made it clear that this was going to become a police matter, and jail time would be on the table. My Dad was also explicitly told not to talk to anyone within the system during this period - a big call seeing that most of his best friends were also school principals and teachers. This left him with even less support. 
 
The next week was hell. My Dad wasn’t really listening to us, and just didn’t seem to be in there anymore. He just kept telling us that he’d ‘ruined our lives’ and that my mum ‘needed to cut him loose’ and find someone else. Which was ridiculous. We loved him, and would never let him down like that.  By this point, it had kind of ceased to be about money. It was about shame, and his all encompassing panic about his colleagues, staff, students and school community finding out what he’d done.

I kept going to work for most of this time - I was conscious that some financial responsibility might fall to me, so I didn’t want to compromise the new job I’d just started. On the Tuesday evening, the school put out a notice to parents confirming that he’d stepped down for ‘personal reasons’. He was immediately inundated with hundreds of calls and texts, none of which he could reply to. It almost became a siege mentality - he couldn’t even go to the supermarket in case he was spotted by someone associated with the school (likely, considering that there were 1000 kids/families there at any one time and our area is fairly small and insular). 

The next morning, on the Wednesday, he kissed my mum goodbye, and dropped my sister at the gym at 6.45am. He then drove a few kilometres up the road, and at 7.33am, stood in front of a high speed train. 

My entire family were either at school or work, so no one was home when the police came to the door. Falling back to the next best option, they called his school, which was listed on the business card still in his wallet. Instead of trying to contact the family - who still hadn’t been informed 5 hours after his death - the school released another notice to parents informing them of the incident. This was before we could all come together as a family and tell his mother (my grandmother). 

So, in short, I don’t know what do to. How do people survive things like this? The stigma is huge, and people can barely look at us. 

Considering how close I was with my Dad, I’m feeling surprisingly little. I’m kind of numb, but not in the shellshocked, useless way that you’d expect. Is this normal to not feel immediate, visceral pain? Will it come? 

Does anyone have any advice?",05Jan2020,2

559,"My mind has been eating itself these past few weeks since it was revealed that the two girls living with my dad have claimed that he is sexually abusive. Things have gotten out of control to where me and my father have moved out and divorce is imminent. My stepmother threw my stuff out even though I was not involved and my father has claimed innocent. They made the young girl, who is the only one I care for because we had a close bond, take a rape kit and I am not well about it. This feels like a death that is just too horrible for me to understand. Police and child services are involved and even if the rape kit comes out inconclusive there is a matter of a text that my father sent the other girl for pictures. 

Stepmother has cut communications with us ( me for not agreeing with her assesment of the situation) and the boy that was living with my father reached out to me last night. We have a long talk where I attempt to get closure and tell him how much I love him and will miss him. I ask him if he could get his sister so that I can talk to her and do the same.

I just want closure to the situation and I am sick to my stomach that she wont talk to me and that this might be true. I will hold a hatred for my father because he hurt the only relationship I ever truely appreciated. 

Is it obvious that she has been told not to talk to us? I just want to talk to her. I know my stepmother will not allow it, but I seen this girl grow up into this beautiful young adult and I dont think its fair to me that i cant even conversate with her.

561,"Employee has been rude and disrespectful every interaction he and I have. Luckily, no one at work even knows what Reddit is.

Had a meeting for the holiday shifts and he agreed to work both Christmas and NYE because we have seasoned employees who have had to work them for several years.

Christmas comes and he says that he planned a surprise birthday for his dad and can't work. I said we already discussed it and he is going to work because he agreed to it. Then, he tries to say that it's his baby's first christmas and he can't miss it. I repeat myself. He tells me he will but he will not work NYE. I compromised and gave it off to him (which I should not have done as it showed my weakness).

He had a request off for three days with no reason, the same as a seasoned employee who had put it in first with a reason. I would have had no employees to work all of the shifts, so I put him to work the first day and be off the last two days. Other employee agreed to cover the last two days as long as they had off the first day. Perfect, right?

Fucking wrong. Dude throws a fit about how he's going out of state and not showing up on top of trying to insult me (which idgaf about the insults, but the fact that he went low and was completely rude and unprofessional). I told him show up or write up. He said he ain't comin and he won't sign the write up and now he's going to call my higher ups (boohoo, I'm so scared). I had already given all evidence of our conversation to HR and my boss before he tried to threaten me by tattling on me. Like, I'm not that fuckin dumb and I know to cover my ass.

I decide to cover the shift because we have new policies for this shift, so I might as well learn them. I get to work and my employee is surprised and is like ""uhh where is X?"" I told him he called out because he was going out of state. I start getting the shift ready and my employee comes up to me with his phone on Facebook and shows me that X is, in fact, chilling at his house drinking Crown.

I have a Facebook, but don't use it. I pulled mine up and started seeing *alllllllll* this shit, about how he's blasting (inappropriate) music in the lobby, smoking blunts at work, having people come up to work, staying at work without authorization, etc. All of these things are enough to fire him immediately, but he unfortunately posted them over a month ago. I have taken screen shots and luckily Facebook puts the time and date stamped right on there. 

I have also noticed his work ethic is tanking since I got here: paperwork is missing, work areas are a mess, you can see that his job is not getting done properly.

We are an at will employment state. I can manage without him fine until I can find someone to fill his shoes. 

My question is: Should I just go ahead and let this dude go or speak to them about their behavior? I'm leaning towards just letting him go.


Just a suggestion, make your profiles private. Employers look at that stuff. Unfortunately, the last boss didn't because I *never* would have hired this dude.",05Jan2020,3

567,"••••I apologize in advance for how deep, dark, or lengthy this may get. My boyfriend and I (soph in college) have been together for about a year and a half. He is under the assumption that we lost our virginities to each other, and in a sense, I still consider myself having lost mine to him because he was the first person I had sexual intercourse with, with true consent.                   
             
••••But the truth is, my virginity was ripped away from me, before I was even 18. I myself am uncertain on what to call it. Was I raped? Was I sexually assaulted? Taken advantage of? Or just overreacting? I don’t mean to be insensitive to anyone that has gone through this, I respect what you went through. I think I was just so mentally and emotionally manipulated by my perpetrator that I am questioning my own sanity (a form of gaslighting) 
                                                                        
••••What happened: I was in highschool and met a college guy at a store I frequented. We start messaging each other for awhile and he suggests a date. I get picked up by him, but instead of taking me out, he takes me to his house claiming he needs a nap. He immediately leads me to his bedroom, and I’m just awkwardly standing at the edge of the bed as we watch a show on tv. After some convincing, I sit on the edge of the bed. He pauses the show so that we can talk, and I’m falling for him now because of all of our similarities. He made me feel comfortable. I then felt okay to lay next to him as we watch the show, fully clothed, the covers underneath us rather than over us. Eventually it led to him finding out I was a virgin and him trying to convince me to let him be the first. He would say things like “just the tip” or “I’ll be gentle” and all the sweet nothings to coerce me into having sex.          

•••••I felt like he took away my ability to say no. I felt scared to disappoint him because I was afraid of him hating me. I believed that we could be more, a fairytale that I was dreaming of. I never said yes, I kept saying I was afraid. But he took my silence as an invitation. Me closing my legs tight together  and screaming in pain, nearly in tears wasn’t enough for him to stop. I begged him to stop multiple times but he said that it’ll only hurt more if we try again later. I didn’t want to try again, I didn’t want it all but I was so afraid of losing him even though this was our first date, my feelings for him were so strong and I thought he felt the same. 
It was painful the entire time, I don’t think I was even lubricated. I felt so ashamed, and I kept wishing that I never even met him. A few weeks later when he stopped talking to me and I finally pressed the block button, I would get panic attacks at the mere suggestion of going to the mall (where he worked), because I was afraid of seeing him. It took so many months until I was finally okay to pass that store again without wanting to burst into tears. I thought I was heartbroken, which I was, but thinking back perhaps it was more than that. It was trauma. To this day, I have not told a soul about this because I blamed the situation as my fault. I was afraid that other people would judge and say things like “no, he’s not a predator that preys on young vulnerable girls that never had sex, you were just a slut.” I was afraid, so I never spoke out even though it was such a traumatic and painful experience that took years for me to move past.


What should I do? Should I confess to my boyfriend about this and that he wasn’t the one that took my virginity? Was it rape? Sexual assault? Being taken advantage of? Thank you for anyone that gives me advice on this, I appreciate your time and response",05Jan2020,2
568,"Ok. I am not looking for advice on whether or not we should have a third child per say - I’ve read literally every comment out there about “pros” and “cons”... it’s more how do I come to my own conclusion?!? 

Background:
I have 2 children, both girls, 3 &amp; 1. They are the best kids ever and so far it has felt like an absolute breeze. They sleep well, no health concerns, they eat well, they are kind to people around them and they are a joy to be around. They also get along with one another SO well.

I come from a family of 3 but I am 30, sister 24 and brother 10... it really felt like we had three sets of only children with our age gaps and although we are all close and love each other I never felt that sibling bond that I see in other siblings... I always felt like I missed out on that.

My husband comes from a family of 3 boys, 2 years apart and all very close but from time to time we do deal with little bits of drama of someone feeling left out of something.

My husband feels like we won the child lottery and doesn’t want to tempt fate. I also feel like we won the child lottery but I feel like there is one more person out there meant for us that we haven’t met yet. Like we have one missing puzzle piece.

We are financially very stable, I’m a stay at home mom, we have the room in our house and vehicle.

I have also had two miscarriages (one during Christmas - still dealing with the after effects of it). When I found out I was pregnant I had a moment of panic which I did not expect at all. Out of nowhere I felt like I was taking away from my girls - my time, family trips, extra curricular activities. It hit me hard and I can’t shake the fact that I felt that way. But I also can’t shake the feeling that I always expected to have one more addition to our family. 

my husband and I have always loved to travel. Canadians who have gone to Thailand and Australia and around US and Caribbean, etc. And we have big dreams of showing our family the world - but feel like we can’t logistically do it with 3... at least not for a few years (with 2 we feel ready now)

My husband wants to make a decision and be done with having this discussion over and over so I’m feeling the pressure to decide now. This would also be the age gap I would hope for between the three if I was to do this. 


Basically i know nobody can decide this but my husband and myself - but I’d love to hear any stories of somebody who has been through or felt like I have and get advice on how the heck you ever decided!!",05Jan2020,2
569,"So I've had a so-far pretty chill highschool life. Until I got to my 2nd year and everything went to shit. I wanted to get a haircut, a pixie because it was way too hot here in \* country. It wasn't bad. But my country was pretty narrow-minded I guess? It was like pixie = lesbian or even transgender - something which was completely taboo. At first, I didn't mind people calling me those two things, because I didn't think of them as insults until it got worse. I then realised I was being bullied. I became scared of going to school and eventually just outside. The insults got worse and more messed up and I had a breaking point and started hurting myself to cope. I thought I was stronger than that and that I could handle some assholes being assholes.

Eventually, my acne got a bit worse and since I wasn't part of the ''popular kids'' I didn't really do much than just use regular facewash but then a popular girl from my class accidentally bumped into me and she touched a bit of my face. She yelled. ""Ew! Oil!"" jokingly and her large clique started laughing at me. Now I feel like everywhere I go and everything I do, I'll be made fun of.

I hate it. I want to be like how I used to be. It hurts to go to school, enter class and interact with anyone. I don't want to die, I have dreams and goals but it's so hard.

570,"Hi everyone,

I’m 23 yrs old Male and currently live at home with my parents. I’ve graduated university, but really unsure about what I want to do with myself.

I’ve lived away from home before for study and work and have enjoyed the experience. My debate is when I’m at home it’s a good environment for me, I have friends in the area, have a good relationship with my family and it’s familiar and comfortable. It also means I can save more money. As much as I enjoy living at home, I feel moving out is also a good option. The added freedom and experience will help me grow as a person, but it concerns me that I won’t have anyone around me and will have less financial freedom. 

I’m not sure of my career path and I’m really undecided what to do.

572,"Almost a year ago my partner left me (m 25) and I have never fully recovered. In the months before the breakup I was traveling so we didn't see each other at all. During this time I idealized the relationship in my head to the point where I became slightly obsessive over her and the relationship. 

Although I am no longer obsessing over her I feel myself craving companionship and consistently thinking about when I will find someone else. This thought process dominates my headspace so much that i think it is causing insomnia and low productivity in my work. 

I would consider myself fairly confident with my identity and I have no trouble asking people on dates. I have been on dates with lots of people since the breakup, but I never seem to fully click with anyone.

I don't want my relationship status to play such an commanding role in my life. I would rather just focus on my friendships, my work, and myself. If I happen to meet someone in the process then that would be awesome, but I don't want it to dominate my thought process and conversations with my friends.

I just graduated this past December. I have some volunteer experience at an assisted living home and a local library. I have worked retail before.

596,"Throw away because my main account is literally my name.

Sometime in the last 36 hours my cars were stolen. My wife, kids, and I were shopping and got back at about 730 at night. Got the kids to bed, wife and I stayed up until about 2 AM watching The Witcher, went to bed. Everyone slept in, we got up to go play board games at our friends house. At 1230 we step outside and our driveway is just empty. My wife and I turn to each other and ask if we moved the cars or parked in the garage...Nope! They're just gone.

We called the cops and they took a report. The officer confided that while they often find cars, most of them aren't in any condition to be driven anymore. He thinks this is especially the case for our cars as they were hybrids (an '08 Tahoe Hybrid and an '06 Prius). None of our neighbors saw anything and it doesn't seem like any of them have cameras set up. They were all pretty freaked out as our neighborhood is considered fairly nice. Our neighbor across the street confessed that she keeps her cars and house unlocked(but wouldn't be anymore). One person did post on the Next Door app a video of some kid in a hoodie trying to break into their car around 4am - you couldn't see any of his features.

I'm not going to say I don't care about the Prius being gone, it was my daily driver and great on gas, but we bought it in cash for cheap and I didn't keep anything valuable in it. I will say, stupidly, I kept the key for that vehicle in the car. Just that key though, not the key to our house or the Tahoe.

The Tahoe on the other hand had our kids car seats, several kids movies for long rides, our diaper bag with cloth diapers and a $50 dollar bill from my wifes grandma, and a couple of my kids 2ds games among other miscellaneous stuff. We're also still a little more than $5000 under on this thing. We have our insurance claim in but from what we understand, it can take Geico a month or longer to pay out the claim and the Gap insurance even longer than that. Those will eventually pay it off, but in the mean time we will have to keep paying on it and look to purchase a new family vehicle.

I'm not sure how we're going to afford that. People are acting like we're just getting free money from the insurance claims, but that money has to go to pay the Tahoe off, not a new shiny car. I make a decent amount of money, but not enough to afford to keep paying on the tahoe, a new car payment, and my mortgage.

I'm just looking for points of view I might not be seeing or options or programs I can look into for help...We are military if that helps. I'm trying to look on the bright side. My family is safe and that's what matters most. Gotta say my wife and I don't feel safe though. We've been keeping a brave face on for the kids but privately my wife is feeling violated and scared and I'm financially scared and enraged.

Anyway...thanks.

And these last years ive made massive inprovments, im much more confident, much more talkative and outgoing, ive also improved my body image a ton,
Ive been working out daily for more than a year and i think i actually look pretty good now, ive actually finished a fitness trainer course in the army and it is currently my job.
But i cant get a girlfriend, it just doesnt happen, i havent tried a ton of times to hit on girls but when i did i hot rejected and it rekt me, i just dont think i can do this much longer, im also going to alot of parties and trying there, and ive tried dating apps, for the matches i do get i mostly never get replies.
Honestly, is there something fucking wrong with me?",05Jan2020,1
609,"Recently I find myself criticising and being unnecessarily harsh to the people I love. I think I'm becoming toxic. 

For example, my sister was telling me off and rightfully so, for not following a diet we were doing together and not doing my uni work, and I got all defensive about it. I've been feeling very low about my weight and the amount of uni work that I haven't been doing. I also lashed out at my brother because he didn't like my sister's boyfriend and I accused him of being controlling. I also lashed out at my other sister just because she asked me to make a bagel. People annoy me more easily and I have been overly critical to people in non-constructive ways.

I constantly find myself angry or depressed and I don't like how this is making me. I've never had problems with my temper before, and usually I'm the one de-escalating bad situations but now I'm the one causing them. I don't know why my temperament is turning this way. What's causing this? What techniques should I try for control over my emotions? What can I do to stop feeling this way?",05Jan2020,1
610,"WWYD?

Hubby and I had a huge fight at the weekend. Mostly from a culmination of a frustration related to his job (he works for his dad, who is an asshole, and who owed him 22 WEEKS of pay! But that’s a whole other issue and not the point of this post) 

So, I booked myself into a hotel to catch a break from him. He is not abusive. I have no concerns for my safety, I just needed a break (yes, I work and make a decent salary). 

I booked in Friday night to today (Sunday). Yesterday, as I was napping because I literally did not sleep Friday night, I am woken up by my room door opening. I hadn’t deadbolted or put on the secondary lock. I thought it might be housekeeping by accident even though the “do not Disturb” and “no need for housekeeping” signs were on the door. 

It was my husband. He had managed to get a key by saying he’d lost his. They looked up our last name and gave him my room number and a key. His name is not on the register and the room is booked for 1 person with my name. 

Now, I didn’t specifically tell the front desk but to allow him access. In fact I didn’t tell them any reason why I was checking in. But what if I had been checking in to escape an abusive situation? 

Now, here’s where it gets a teeny bit complicated. I work for the hotel brand in security. Not this location, but another one locally.  I’m here using my associate’s discount. I can’t threaten my job by making too big a stink but I have to say SOMETHING!

they claim it’s all been an accident but how do you accidentally find all that information about someone unless you’re really digging... what makes it worse is they are refusing to share any information about themselves, even their real name, to make it a even playing field. I feel like an idiot tbh. I feel like I’m too trusting and I should have cut them out the second They found my address but I wanted to believe they were telling me the truth.

I came to ask some advice to trust her completely. Because I am overthinking things, even the smallest ones. For example atm she is watching netflix series that her ex also likes. I set myself an image of them both watching it alone because she answers my snaps in a weird way with long delay and my best friend said that he will come play games online with me and my friend after he gets out of the shower. Well after 4 hours he didn't come yet. So that's how my problem looks like. Even though both of them told me that they won't take each other back. He actually asked her once long time ago that would she take an 3rd chance and she said yes but it was too late. And I still manage to be scared of them doing something. Another example: we were drinking yesterday and I was quite drunk but still got an idea on what was going on, my happiness dropped after I heard that she and her ex are going for a smoke OR she asked him to take her home because she wasn't in a condition to drive.

630,"I'm graduating High School in a couple months. For the past six years, I have lived and breathed school. I have the grades to show for it, but I feel like I've lost out on much. I don't really have an idea of who I am as a person outside of school. I don't have much hobbies, I don't spend much time being social or interacting with my local community. My life is mostly just school and being online.

Obviously, I need some space to figure myself out (and to prevent a burnout). So, despite an extreme sense of FOMO, I've decided to take a gap year — I think. So far, I've planned on doing some tutoring. I could earn a bit of money and it would be a nice way to fill up some of my time. Besides, I genuinely love learning, and I enjoy teaching and helping others. I also have a tendency to get an overwhelming sense of boredom and sadness, feeling like my existence is utterly meaningless, whenever I'm on summer vacation and spend too much time away from school. I need to be using my brain for something to be happy. That seems like a nice way to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

**But I still have a lot of other things to figure out, which is why I'm here. I would greatly appreciate advice on any of these things:**

* Any ideas on how do I go about ""getting to know myself"" or developing some hobbies? 
* I'd appreciate insights as to how I could spend my gap year.
* How should I spend my year to best prepare for university?
* I'm scared that I'll lose my momentum/drive/motivation during my gap year. Any ideas on how I can make sure it's still there when I go to university?
* **Should I even do a gap year?** I know what I want to study. I know where I want to study. I don't need time to figure that out. School is my whole life, and I get incredibly bored and sad when I spend too much time away from it. This is especially apparent during the summer. However, I tend to get extremely overwhelmed when I return after summer is over. Readjusting from vacation-mode to full-on student mode is harsh. I'm just very worried that taking a prolonged break coupled with the transition to university life will result in me having some sort of breakdown. On the other hand, I feel like going straight to uni will entail me burning out. 

&amp;#x200B;

**For context:** F19 living in Norway (we graduate around age 19 here, but I still feel ""behind"" my international peers, which stresses me out a little bit, which is partly why it's a bit hard for me to do a gap year). I don't have a driver's license (thanks to my whole ""nothing can distract me from school"" approach to life), which limits my options. Higher education is free, though I still need to pay for living expenses and equipment. Thus, I am not too stressed about having to earn a lot of money (although it wouldn't hurt), but I also don't want to spend frivolously.",05Jan2020,1

633,"Trigger warning: suicide

The title pretty much says it all here. I’ve completed my bachelor’s of architecture and am due to start a two year master’s degree in under two months. The thought of having to go through another two years of study gives me anxiety attacks every time I think about it and is making me think about killing myself just to not have to do it.

I had a really tough time during my bachelor’s, even though a lot of it came from relationship struggles. I suffered greatly from anxiety during every critique/exam period and by the end of it I was burned out and depressed. I wanted to quit constantly but my parents always told me to just finish the degree.

I went straight into work afterwards at the architecture firm I had been interning at. I was actually quite good at my job and enjoyed it for the most part, but then ended up really hating work because I got stuck on a project that went badly with a fellow student who made work an unpleasant place to be. I ended up losing my job half way through the year because of financial struggles at the firm. After this I went on a two month overseas trip that I booked earlier in the year, and I was so happy to be 100% cut off from doing architecture work.

Currently I’m jobless and am about to start my studies. I hate the idea of finding another architecture job because I’m worried that I’ll hate the job no matter where I work. I want to vomit every time I open my portfolio to apply for something. I feel intense dread at having to go through the stress of another two years of study. Pretty much the only reason why I do want to go back to uni is so I can study abroad. 

I just don’t know what else to do except to keep going because I’ve come so far and spent so much money on uni fees. I don’t want to let down everyone around me who thinks I’m a good student who is going to be a successful architect. I don’t want to be seen as a failure for quitting. I’m just so scared I’m messing up my future and that I might end up kill my self during my degree.

Over time we started talking and during those 3 months we got really close and decided to become a couple. Initially A was supportive but over time this changed. To give some background her behavior with him before we became a couple was one as if they were dating, they'd be really touchy and would call/face time often, he's told me that at one point she said that she wanted to have kids with him at 25 if they were both single. As my relationship with him progressed he stopped this behavior but she did not, she continued to cling on to him and I wasn't bothered by it initially. The day that he brought it up to me was when she started flat out flirting and being overbearing. I mentioned to her that we have talked about getting married young, she was not supportive and said it was a bad idea. To him though, she told him that she couldn't wait for the proposal and wedding. Now she's had similar hypocritical behavior over time and we've slowly distanced ourselves, she began to get bothered by the fact that he told me more things than what he'd tell her. she gets bothered when I hang out with him alone and has said to our other friends that she thinks we hang out together too much.

640,"so i found out through a mutual friend of all parties involved that my boyfriend is into some messed up things. i asked what kind of stuff and they sent me some pornhub links to some videos. i was scared as to what might show up. they sent me 2 links. each link was between 1-4 hours long and focused on a different young women doing her job (a teacher, and a swimming instructor).  

the first link was 4 hours of following this young female teacher and her day. it starts with her going to a students house to check on him and she finds that he takes pictures of her in class. it escalates later in the video to 3 extremely graphic rape scenes and a consensual sex scene at the end. (full penetration, it's essentially a porn)

i didn't watch the second link but i skimmed through it and it had the same structure. it's important to note that it was all acting (it's obvious is you ever watch it, but i suggest you don't). 

I asked mutual friend how they know this and they said that my bf and another friend sent them to him saying they were the 'best things to jerk off too if you go to these time stamps' (and a list of time stamps).

 I'm disgusted. I know 'non con-con' or 'dubious consent' is a big thing online but this is full on rape scenes. it's like jerking off to the rape scene in irreversible (the french film). It's gross. And it's not like the women ends up enjoying it (like in a lot of non-con con films) the women is crying and screaming throughout. 

My bf isn't home yet and I don't know how to bring this up to him. I don't feel comfortable with him. I know it's not a real home made video but it's still gross.

642,"Hi. First of all, I'm not native English speaker so please, be kind.

Me and my fiancée (soon wife) want to move to New Zealand. A bit about us:

We are from Poland and we are 24 (25 this year). We are both finshing our Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science soon (aprox. 3 months). I want to mention that it's not very theoretical - in fact, I'd say it's closer to software development. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we are getting married in 2 months (in legal way - we'll also have church wedding in May). 

We've decided that we don't really want to live in Poland. We feel like our country has many problems and it's getting worse and we just want to live in peace, start family, have a decent living. We belive New Zealand will be perfect for us, because it's very remote and we are... a bit old fashioned? By that I mean, we don't really care about being very successful in work or having a lot of money or partying like a lot young people do. We just want to have steady jobs that don't require us to stay long hours (and we've heard live-work balance is great in NZ), settle in and have kids. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've made plans how to get there. First of all, we want to prepare everything we can for visas. We are aiming for  Essential Skills Work Visa. We want to get all papers besides job offer first. Next thing, we want to look for a job - I want to be Android Developer and my better half wants to become Software Tester. That's one of problems we found. A lot of employers want visa first, but it's impossible to get Essential Skills Visa without job offer. We hope having everything prepared in advance will mitigate that issue, but that's just guessing. Also, I should probably mention that our qualifications puts us on Skill Shortage List so employer doesn't have to prove that he didn't find NZ citizen for that spot. 

When we get a job offer, we want to take first plane we can, get an airbnb and start working while looking for more permanent housing solution. 

&amp;#x200B;

I need a little bit of advice about a job I'm pursuing. 

Two Mondays ago (so tomorrow will be 2 weeks) I had a job interview. The place wasn't particularly hiring but I reached out because I really like the place, and they interviewed me. The interview went *very* great, and I was basically promised a position. The owner said that there's a lot of college students working there during their winter break and that things have been crazy with the holidays, so he needs to figure out what positions he needs to fill and that he'd contact me soon. He also said to send a follow-up email so that he's reminded to contact me. I sent an email that afternoon, thanking him and following up. 

Well, it's been almost 2 weeks and I've heard nothing. The holidays *just* ended and college students haven't gone back to school yet, so I suppose that's the reason.

I know if someone hurts themselves by cutting it's very serious but he literally took a video of his cuts and sent it to one of my friends who showed us. Like tf?? He never mentioned them once after. Once again I'm not sure but might be for attention. Sometimes in our group chat, he would just randomly say how s##t his life is and when we ask what's wrong he just leaves us on read. Last year we took some group photos of ourselves at our formal, we were all happy and enjoying our time there. Fast-forward to a few days ago, he scrunches them all up and trashes them. Idk why, but here is the problem once again: He freaking recorded himself doing it like wtf. I mean come one why would you do that???? He can't even hold a relationship as well, obviously now is not the time for him yet last year he has broken up with a total of 7 GF's, now he is on his 8th gf. He's got some shady friends aswell, does drugs and alcohol with them, we've told him countless times both in-person and online to stop but FFS he doesn't listen. 

He has done all of this. We have tried to help, we ask him if anything's wrong and one of my mates even alerted the school counseller and they met (he has gone to the psychiatrist). Yet he doesn't acknowledge us. And IDK what I should do.

I hate to say it but after all this, I don't really consider him a friend anymore \`and IDK what to do.",05Jan2020,1
649,"A bit of a rant... I'm sorry.

I'm 31, and After a few career changes, alot of jobs and then moving to a new city. I thought I finally found a job/career in a industry that I liked, with a company that suited me and with people I love. And I thought I would be happy. 

I have worked so hard this year with my stable income i was able to pay off debt, save an emergency fund, and this year I was planning to start investing in the stock market. I thought i was finally going to get my shit together. 

Recently i got sick not super serious but I was bed ridden for 2-3 weeks, and it some how killed my motivation to go back to work. I feel so sad and confused and lost. My perception shifted and  noticed alot of things about my job that I really don't like. And I feel the need to just leave and I don't know how to explain it. Before this job, I have previously worked in really toxic workplaces and had no other option to quit. But this is different and it's something i can't explain. 

The past few weeks, i have developed a frightfully strong urge to quit everything and go travelling for a few months to get some clarity. 

I have worked so hard to try to financially stabilize myself and I feel like I'm just going to blow it all on this trip because I just feel lost. 

I had to start from zero when I changed careers, I had to start from zero when I moved to a new city. And now I am about quit my job to travel and start again from zero and I don't know when this will stop. I just want to be settled and be happy. And i Just dont know what success looks like and I don't know how to succeed in life and be happy. Any advice?

Tl;dr I'm about to quit all my shit and spend all my savings to go travelling because I am sad. Any advice?",05Jan2020,1
650,"Hello! My (F29) mother (56) was diagnosed with COPD a couple years back and 7 months ago, moved in with my husband and I after being released from a 3 week hospital stay. Upon moving in, I told my mom that she needed to quit her job, focus on her health and try to start the process of getting on disability. Since moving in, my mom has continued to work, only changing her hours to part time, she continues to smoke cigarettes and buy/abuse pain pills and she has yet to file for disability. This is starting to take a toll on my marriage and life in general. I’ve been taking care of my mom financially since I was around 17 and I’m turning 30 in less than 2 months. My husband and I want to start a family and start living for ourselves, but my mother is getting in the way. 
I feel with the research I’ve done on COPD and SSI, she should be getting something at this point; 7 months later. Apparently, COPD gets automatic approval for SSI and if she started the process over half a year ago, I don’t see why she wouldn’t at least be receiving mail or phone calls on the status of her claim. 
I love my mom but I’m tired of being taken advantage of. In my mind, she’s only continuing to work to support her drug habit and unless she’s forced to change, she’s totally fine dying a slow death at my expense and totally fine with letting me take care of her. 
It’s difficult to talk to her about these things; every question is considered to be a personal attack. I recently saw a text about her buying pills and despite the proof being there in black and white, she continued to deny her involvement. She’s manipulative, never happy and selfish. 
Sorry this post is all over the place; I’m just emotionally exhausted. My main question is if someone with COPD can start collecting on SSI within 7 months of applying, if it’s considered a disease that receives automatic approval and if so, how I can push my mother to quit screwing around and apply.

(Bubbly Tone of voice as I said) and then she said ‘ ok well do you know how to conduct yourself on an interview"" while looking at me assertively , (see I’m very shy and  quiet) I said ‘yes’ she went on to say ""ok, well don't forget, shirt pants and shoes....make sure you cut you're nails make sure you get a shave...and make sure you do you're hair up all nice and that"" then she paused a bit looking at her computer and said ""and make sure you put some aftershave on as well, for the girls make sure it's men's"" then she burst out laughing, she said it nicely but probably was thinking sinister but Idk. i was hurt about it but smiled  along with her quiet as I am. i wasn't near clean shaven at the time of the appointment tbh) she sent me an email the next day about it saying about what I need to take with me to the interview and at the bottom it had underlined ‘please dress smartly’ and ‘good luck’

655,"So it finally happened and I didn’t want it to end this way. My friend and I finally had for end our friendship of 7th months. We did admit that we never thought of us as friends. He said that we can’t be friends and being friends wouldn’t work out. I understood that cuz he was right. I didn’t want him to leave. 
I did ask him did he want to be fwb. And he was like “Uh why, uh ok, uh ig” then he kept asking why did I ask that so I said why. Since we are sexting buddies we should be come fwb. He seemed very taken aback from my request. And I said since we can’t be fwb and fuck buddies then we will just remain as sexting buddies and he’s like “i guess” I told him he sounds uncertain what does he want to be. So he said then only thing we can be is fwb if I want to. So I said we could date and he told me I’m not his type. 
So I told him the crush I had on him for 7 months. And I asked him dues he want to be fwb or not. Long story short he said at the same time he does but doenst and he told me “Aight but honestly I don’t think e would be good friends, we don’t talk in person, and ik that’s on me. ik you want to be friends but I don’t think that’ll work and I’m so sorry for waiting your time these months” honestly idk what to feel. My head is killing me so badly every time I think about it. I know he will never contact me and I will be struggling to not do it. 
He seemed conflicted he was going back and fourth between saying we can talk like once or maybe later. Then he started saying we can’t talk. He said “I’m sorry but we can’t be friends” 
Then I talked to him about me thinking he used me for sexting which he said he didn’t. And we started talking about trumpets and I feel that he was trying to make me feel like shit for choosing it because of him. 

So then I said I was gonna go to bed and he’s like “So I guess this is where the journey ends” and I was saying “You deadass? I don’t want it tot end like this” and he’s like “oh” and i added a sad face emoji. He said back “I’m sorry but maybe we could be friends in the future see ya” so I asked him “So we done some?” And he said “ig” and I said see ya. Then he said “Sorry but this wouldn’t work” and I said it’s gonna be weird seeing him and he’s like eh not really. And I texted back and he blocked me. 

In conclusion, I’m verryyy shocked. I was having the same dream over and over again about (it’s weird) me Pickong up a card saying the words “lost, lonely” 
My head hurts so bad. I think it’s because I’m so stressed out. Idk who ima text now because he was the only person I texted. It’s so weird waking up and realizing i can’t talk to him. I can’t believe that. I’m sure it was hard for him to let go. What can I do?",05Jan2020,1
656,"For context I have what they’re seeing as a plethora of heart conditions (SVT/Sinus/PVC), but since nothing has been officially diagnosed, every doctor under the sun has deemed it as just Tachycardia. I run at 110 to 120 beats per minute on my day to day. It’s also been two years since I was taken off of Suicide Watch (I tried attempting 4-5 times), someone close to me killed themselves that day so suicidal thoughts ever since has never been much of an issue anymore. 

I was diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism about 5 months ago and this last month has been excruciating. Surgery is January 16th and the surgeon is apparently getting a special Anesthesiologist that knows how to monitor individuals with heart conditions.

Anyway What I saw back then I keep seeing flash backs of it and I can’t figure out what it is called so I have gone to refit to see if you people could help me. So for almost the past year I’ve seen little flash backs of the scene that I watched and it’s nothing bad or anything I would just like to know what it is so here we go: i think it was a teenager on a third  lvl car park where you can see the sky so there isn’t any roof I know that for sure. So it’s was around 5 teens picking on 1 person up there grabbing his bag and all that but then another teen  comes and stops them from picking on him but they decide to pick on the new  teen that try’s to help. The person that was originally getting picked on ran away to leave the person that helped him alone so they got into a brawl and 1 of the 5 around teens pulled out a knife and stabbed multiple times then a lady which I think might have been his mother screamed at them so they ran down a flight of stairs jumping stair case to stair case doing parkour then the mother went back to the teen that was laying there in blood and died in the mother’s hands.  that all I can remember and lately I have thought there might be a 360 song in it I don’t know I just have a feeling when she is looking at the sky crying with him in her arms there was a beat that I can hear but can’t hear enough of it to recognise it soo yeah 
but lately I have been really disturbed by the fact I don’t know what this thing is.

662,"When I was 14, I told my mom I was molested. She replied “oh, that happened to me too” and then changed the subject. She acted like I told her the temperature outside. I was shocked and confused and didn’t say anything further. Later that year, I had a anxiety attack in my room at night. In the midst of it, I screamed out “somebody touched me” and my dad said nothing while my mom just said “I know.” They went back to bed once I stopped screaming.

They never asked who it was. When it happened. Who did it. Nothing. They just didn’t care.

I don’t really know how to feel. I don’t really feel anything. Idk if it hurts too much or what but I don’t feel anything. I don’t know how I should feel. I know I feel very distant from my parents. They’ve kind of always been that way. When my brother got murdered when I was 7 years old, sometimes I would cry about it and my mom would tell me “oh, whatever.” or just be dismissive. I don’t really ever remember her comforting me about those sorts of things. I can remember maybe once or twice that she has comforted me in my life. 

When I was 18, I begun to experience EXTREME anxiety. Constant panic attacks nightly. Sometimes twice a day. There would be some nights I didn’t sleep because of the restlessness and fear. My mom didn’t bat an eyelash. Didn’t really bother her. She didn’t check up on me. When I asked her why she didn’t care she said “I’m not a therapist. I’m just your mom.”  She wouldn’t really talk to me unless she wanted me to pay bills.

Later that year, I developed OCD. I told her and she didn’t seem to care. She didn’t question it or even seem phased that I was now battling a debilitating, chronic mental illness. It was almost unbearable and every day was a living hell when I first developed it. She would help when it was convenient for her (when I would call and ask for reassurance for my intrusive thoughts she would give it to me) but it didn’t seem like a big deal to her.  

I don’t really know how to treat our relationship going forward. I’m turning 20 soon and plan to move out with my boyfriend (who is a huge support to me) and I’m not sure if I’m overreacting (I’m a sensitive person) and I shouldn’t be upset or if I should. My boyfriend tells me that he believes her actions to be unforgivable, but it’s my mom. idk.

Tl;dr my mom has been dismissive and uncaring about my molestation as a child and my development of anxiety and OCD as a teen/adult.",05Jan2020,1

664,"I never thought I would even type these words. 

Just to preface, I just got out of a very messy breakup and have been feeling very confused and lonely as of late. I havent been able to think about girls at all and have just been doubling down on my studies and friends. 

I have been at home with my parents during the holiday season as I'm study in a different country and dont see them much. After new years my family were hosting a huge get together, a family reunion of sorts, with people from all over which I helped organize and host. 

During this reunion i (M20) met a very removed cousin (F22) of mine (3rd cousin)  we had never met prior but she was one of the only people my age at this 'party' and seemed nice so we struck off. As the day went on we were having ongoing conversations about all sorts of things and shared a very pleasant atmosphere. 

It also turned we had both just gotten out of nasty relationships so it was nice to have someone to talk to. As the night went on we all started drinking and that's when things started happening. 

It was very subtle but we both realised that we were hitting on one another but neither of us really put a stop to it. Nearing the end of the party I went outside for a cigarette and we nearly kissed but both stopped ourselves also in case of anyone else seeing. 

Anyway, after the party ended she invited me to see her (turns out she studies in a city nearby mine) at her place and nodded at following through with what had nesrly happened earlier that night. 

I am super conflicted about this all. On one hand I do find her attractive and a casual fling would help a ton after my breakup, on the other hand, no matter how distant she is from me, she is still a cousin. 

People will probably think I'm trolling or comment sweet home Alabama, but I would genuinely appreciate some outside advice because I am super conflicted and am way too embarrassed to ask my friends about this.

668,"Hello all! Sorry for the amount of text.

Last year I started a job outside of my skillset that sounded fantastic. I couldn't believe my luck when I walked in for my ' interview ' and got the job instantly (note quotation marks) I now understand that I was incredibly naive and not having a proper interview Is a major red flag.

It seemed great initially, staff were welcoming, patient and kept it relatively professional whilst promoting a laid back atmosphere. On my first week I had to work off-site with my manager which involved driving several hours away on the motorway. Whilst driving he drank almost a litre of vodka there and back, having me pour his drinks. The work involved being on tall ladders whilst needing to trust the other individual (I had not recieved any training or information relevant to this and was simply thrown in). Needless to say this was not a good experience but I pushed on through, ignored the stink of booze, his attitude and decided to let it go. I also (by his request) promised him that I wouldn't tell anyone about his behaviours. After this I struggled to respect him as an individual. I even brought it up to him in the van and stated that a family member was killed due to drink driving, his response was to justify his actions because he can ' handle his drink '. I laughed inside and moved on.

During my first month or so I started to notice sexist and racist comments/vocabulary being made, nothing that would be categorized as extreme but nonetheless, it's unacceptable on any level in my book and I'm certainly not interested in being around narrow mindedness one bit, especially in the workplace. I did the washing up once and was told by the owner ' you shouldn't be washing up, that's a woman's job '.

I soon discovered from a member of staff that the girl I had replaced left due to the owner, manager and supervisor talking to her like crap. They have been led to believe that she simply left to work with her family.

The office ' culture ' quickly began to bubble up from it's obvious suppression and I was suddenly doing much more than what I initially signed up for, training was promised but in reality after the first couple of weeks I was winging it. I was told that I ' need to ask more questions ' but when I did ask, I was ignored, looked at like a fool or told to hang on more times than I'm willing to swallow my pride. This started to breed a lack of communication amongst other things (maybe I should have swallowed my pride more, but I'm happy I didn't)

I believe I use the right term when I say micro management was an issue. When I made a mistake they would jump at the opportunity to show me ' their way '.. does good leadership not involve taking a preemptive approach to so called training? It felt like their assistance was more so driven by ego and frustration over actually wanting me to succeed and just an opportunity to show their boss how good they are.. yeah yeah I understand business is business but humans are humans too.

The manager was late on many occasions and I was told that they're not absolutely strict on timekeeping. I continued to arrive on time (sometimes being left standing outside 5-10 minutes over my start time) but the influence of the example that had been set  took over and I became more lax with it. I was then told that I need to start being on time. Double standards are rife, though i do understand that long time servants of a company deserve privileges, if contradictions are involved I personally find it difficult to compromise.

I had some personal issues related to my family that were ongoing, and one day had to leave early. I was told as I was leaving that I need to keep my personal life out of work. This is fine, but the amount of times the rest of the staff have brought their personal life into work far exceeds mine. This includes the owner himself. 

The owner regularly requests members of staff fetch him cigarettes, alcohol and the like from the store. This alcohol is consumed on premises and though I personally have no issue with alcohol and enjoy drugs myself, I believe the workplace should be clean of substance use to promote professionalism.

The working environment is simply downright toxic.

Favouritism is not exempt from the owners and managers book of tricks and I know that trying to resolve these issues would be downright futile as it starts from the very top.

I have now decided to leave and don't really have enough respect for the company to even let them know, though I think I will. 

I am making this post to request an outside perspective, as I have had my confidence knocked by this place and keep doubting myself and my decision. Thankyou all!

I would also like to add that due to the nature of this company my previously resolved anxiety issues have risen back to the surface which has led to my refusal to continue. Every day I was there I felt stupid. I do believe that in an acceptable environment I would have flourished, which is a shame.",05Jan2020,1
669,"Okay, demon is not really the word to use. Let me start by saying I have been friends with this girl for 6+ years, and she had her son when she was 16 (we are both now 20). She moved a bit away but I will still get to see her from time to time and we use to talk almost every day if not every other. Due to her living far she will come visit for maybe a weekend but will try to get a sitter for him so it’s just us. I don’t mind her son being with us so I always encourage her to bring him, but sometimes I won’t see him for months. 
This past time she came to visit she wanted to go to the mall and I was excited to see her and her son and my boyfriend came with us. When we got there everything seemed to be going fine but as time went on it got worse. First, any store we walked into she let him walk free so he would grab things and start throwing them or dropping them. I’m a little anxious in public so this was making it worse and my boyfriend is both trying to chase this kid and calm me down because my friend isn’t doing anything. This went on the entire time we were there. He would grab things and try running out of the stores with them or start opening things, it was a mess. My breaking point was when he started crawling under dressing rooms while people were in them and then while we were in the bathroom he crawled under the stalls (not ours). She smacked his butt ONCE because I asked if she ever punishes him, but the behavior got worse. I was exhausted by the end of the day and she could tell. I drove her to her car, she went home and I have basically avoided her messages since. I’m not a mom, I know nothing about being a parent. But I love my friend and I want to tell her why I’m avoiding her without sounding like a bitch.

And he said “Yea that’s what I was thinking lmao” and I said “Then why didn’t you just say so?”  He said “Cause your the only one that has done that” and I said “I’m sure I have” and he said “Cause idk” then he started asking me “so now are you into trumpet?” And I said “yeah” and he said ok. Then I said “I’m happy to say I’m a  trumpet player now” and he said “Hmmmm” and I’m like what? And he said “nothing lol” and I said tell me. He said “I’m deadass but why trumpet.” (Here he goes again) I said “Bruh I already told you” the reason why is because of him. And he said “I understand that but why.” 
And he started saying he didn’t expect me to play trumpet and he said “Idk it be weird for a person that I talked to went to play trumpet” I just realized what he meant by that.
And then I start to realize he’s trying to make me change my mind about doing the stands in marching band cuz he’s in it too.

Phoenix,AZ (tempe, mesa, ect..)

Ive applied to a few places, when I get responses its usually telling me I cant be considered for the position unless im out there ready to work. understandable 

***THE QUESTION:***

I feel as though, financially and career wise, id be in a good spot moving. Is this correct? if so im right to assume the only reason why i dont make this happen is a mental hurdle i just need to get past?",05Jan2020,1

677," I have been with this person of a different nationality for about 3 years now. After going through a year of language and communication barrier, a toxic ex best friend to me and hypocrite cousin sister at who's he has to live for him manipulating the fuck out of him to cut ties with me because I cut ties with her after handling her toxic ass for 2 whole years, breaking up thrice in another year, all the suffering equaling the happiness, I have come to the point of understanding that if we are to stay together whatever the situation we'll eventually end up being together and if not I'll be taking away only the good which is what I have learned from this relationship. However, the inevitable time has come where the two of us are in two different country. A year ago, when I was out of the country for 2 weeks, we didn't communicate until I came back. So, I broke up with him because we wouldn't be able to last the long distance when I'll be moving to another country for about 5 years. Sooner to break apart than later, I thought since we're sure to live in different countries for a long time and the communication is bad enough that if one of us die, the other wouldn't know until eventually. However, we did end up getting back. Right now, he's gone back to his country for a month, we havent talked since the day he left which was about 2 weeks ago. It's not that we dont try to talk, the timing is just horrible. He will be back after the month ends and will again leave some months after that and has no plans on coming back while I am leaving at the end of this year to another country than he will be in, later than planned because things came up with the prior schedule. I don't think we can go through the long distance but he is optimistic on it. I'd love to sit back and see what happens but that seems to only do more damage considering with zero communication, we'll be clueless about whats happening with each other, more importantly us (?).

I don't know whether to wipe the photos or keep them on. On the one hand, seeing them upsets me because I never really got closure for the breakup, but then again I don't want to pretend that whole year of my life never existed.

686,"Hi all,

I'm new to the community. I don't usually post on any forums or share my problems but I've been feeling more and more anxious &amp; I don't know how to escape this mind set. 

I'm in my early 30s. I have a stable job as a manager of a start up education firm (I'm only managing, I do not own any shares) and enough in my saving account. I am not in a relationship nor do I have any kids. Overall, I am quite comfortable with my life.

However, lately (in the past 1.5 years or so) I have been gradually feeling nervous &amp; anxious. As I took more responsibilities at work, I started becoming afraid that I would make a huge mistake. I know that I could find a new job, but I don't want to fail my students or my colleagues or my boss. Any time I make any mistake, I beat myself up real hard and kept thinking about the error all the time. I usually read fictions as a way of escaping reality &amp; regain energy, but they have somewhat lost their appeal.

Recently I thought I have gotten peak anxiety. I  found myself thinking about the problems at work all the time, I could not concentrate on my reading, my stress-eating got worse. I got irritated easy which clouded my judgement. I feel  exhausted &amp; angry all the time. Even good results do not seem good enough for me. This may sound dramatic but sometimes, I fantasized about car accident or even death to get myself off the responsibility. I really do. I don't think I would harm myself but I really want to escape my life now.

On the one hand, I kept thinking that I would be much happier if I work a 9-5 desk job with little attachment instead of this one so I can have more time for my hobbies. On the other hand, because this is a start up, I know that it  would be horribly irresponsible of me if I quit. Moreover, this job pays really well and I want to be able to take care of my parents when they get old (really, my parents don't want to live in a home so I want to live with them when they get old &amp; take care of them) I know taking care of old people will take a lot of money so I'm trying so save up to prepare for the future. But I feel desperate even though my life's going well.

Can you give me some advice on how I could balance my life?",05Jan2020,1

692,"**TLDR: I need to decide a major asap. Chemistry is good because I enjoy it and provides a unique (but limited) perspective on medicine. Neuroscience is good because it fits my intended career trajectory best. Informatics is good because I like numbers and might be very helpful in academia.**

As a second-year student at my college, I have to commit to a major within the next two weeks. This is crucial because I would like to graduate on time, and committing now is the only way to accomplish that. I ultimately want to go to medical school and value my education a lot, so my grades thus far are very good. As a result, I would consider myself very driven and think I would probably be able to succeed in any of the following majors (although I'm not too sure about informatics given that I have 0 experience with it). Here are my options and the pros and cons that I've thought of –– any advice would be helpful!

**Chemistry**

**pros:** this is my best subject based on performance in general and organic chemistry so far, I enjoy the conceptual aspects of science which chemistry caters well to, great faculty in the department, will be easier major after the beginning of senior year (meaning I'll have less stress during med school application season), I believe could provide me a unique perspective on some aspects of medicine such as pharmacology or drug-interactions with the body that other med students won't have

**cons:** not as applicable to my future preferred profession as neuroscience, will be the harder major until the beginning of senior year (meaning less time to study for MCAT)

**Neuroscience**

**pros:** major fits my application for med school really well, has easy classes until the beginning of senior year (means more time to study for the MCAT), has great faculty in the department, probably fits what I want to do as a physician (neurology, psychiatry –– obviously subject to change though), will give me practice as learning to better memorize stuff for med school (I'm good at conceptual stuff, but not very good at memorizing)

**cons:** hella hard classes after the beginning of senior year (when I will be stressed about applying to med school), doesn't really set me apart from other med students (in the sense that everyone is capable of memorizing biological facts, but not everyone has the same perspective as someone with a degree in chemistry or informatics might)

**Informatics**

**pros:** I really enjoy working with numbers, is a pretty conceptual subject, will probably be super helpful and valuable if I end up going into academics as a physician (which I am strongly considering)

**cons:** I literally have no experience with computer science (I'm just guessing that I'd be good at informatics because I've always been good at and enjoy working with numbers, especially statistics) so I'm guessing it will be pretty hard for the rest of college, bad faculty at my school",05Jan2020,1

To make a long story short, we live in different cities and matched online while he was in town visiting his sister in September. We never ended up meeting up while he was here, but after flirting over instagram, texting, and facetiming he decided to meet me in Miami while I was there for a work trip a few months back. It was an incredibly risky decision( he’s older than me, a pretty big guy, and could have been anything from a catfish to just insane) that luckily worked out, but I couldn’t bring myself to admit it to my family. Now that we’re getting serious and he’s moving to my city in April, I know I’ll eventually need to own up to it, but I don’t know how to bring it up—especially because I know how much my parents hate lying by omission.",05Jan2020,1

703,"I currently work a small Chinese buffet restaurant. Business is pretty good and a lot of customers love the food and cheap price. Food is always fresh from what I’m seeing because as soon as a pan of food gets put on display, customers would empty it in less than 2 hour.  Then the kitchen staff would cook it again and put it on display. 

Last week, a customer came and ate a large amount of food before giving us his praises and went on his way.  

Yesterday he came in angrily and said we were in big trouble. He said he got a really bad case of food poisoning from our restaurant and what we were going to do about it. Then he demanded we pay his hospital bill. He did show us hospital papers and looking over it, I did see nausea and diarrhea on the symptoms list.  The date was the day after he ate at our restaurant so he may be right in accusing us. 

He didn’t give us a hospital bill but he said that he would call the hospital right now and they would give him the price and we would need to pay him immediately or he would call 911.

Another customer stood up for us and said he was extorting from us and not to listen to him. They got into a huge argument before he left saying we will be hearing from him again.

I just saw the owner dropping off large amounts of food (lots of veggies and packaged food, so I suspect the ladies live there and have seen one of them cooking with a little portable stove top outside on occasion) and goods (like rubbing alcohol, baby oil, toiletries etc) Many of my art studio members have noticed one of the ladies never leaves the premises, one of them does have a car. Supposedly another of our members once saw multiple scantily clad women just peeking out one random morning.

The biggest reason I suspect a nefarious operation is that the damn parlor is listed on Rub Maps and the only clients are men. Now, I really don't care personally about the guys getting their rocks off, but it is hurting my business.

I was on a second date yesterday with a guy who i find very attractive. On the first date he was incredibly sweet, telling me Im beautiful,etc. On the second date i was kinda having a bad hair day, not really looking my best (in my opinion). We were at his place after dinner and he made a comment that I'm not the most beautiful woman on the planet. He said he said that because i was trying to find out how important having sex right away is to him (cause he had been trying). He said he said that to make me understand that the physical isn't as important to him as having a bond with someone. This all being said, i am a very good looking girl and know it and was sorta not expecting that. I also didn't think it was necessary to say to me even if its something he thinks. I ended up crying, cause to be honest, it hurt my feelings. I was feeling really into him and he had told me previously how nice i am to look at. I almost left, but calmed down. I didn't want to overreact. We ended up drinking too much and i slept w him. I am now feeling a ton of self loathing and wishing i had left like my original instinct. I understand i may not be the prettiest woman(even though thats probably objective) on the PLANET, Im not delusional. I just wish he hadn't made the remark. Now i honestly don't know if i even wanna see him again. Am i overreacting? Was it super unkind what he said or normal? I just need an outside perspective.

708,"Hello! There’s this guy(22M) who’s gained quite a bit of social media fans on his (I know some of u may gag but I’m trying to bring awareness to this) TikTok. He is abusing that he is getting followers who are young girls. He’s been harassing and manipulating underage girls into sending him illicit pictures. HES 22! This is considered child pornography and he’s taking advantage by preying on girls who are young enough to not necessarily know better. THERE ARE MULTIPLE GIRLS ALL WITH PROOF. One is 15!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

He is also a bully. These girls are coming out and he’s sending all his fans to attack them and take their posts down so they can’t speak up on it. His brother DM’d me for being in contact with a girl, attacking me for showing support. (I know them personally through a friend) 

They have a best friend who WENT TO JAIL for being with a MINOR as well. (THIS IS THE PERSON I MET THEM THROUGH) Obviously they have not learned and he deserves to have his platform taken away from him. Him and his brother are toxic and disgusting. I posted a video on my Instagram to get people to help report him. The girl had more videos including evidence that HE got taken down. If you view his account it’s all sexual content. Constantly shirtless, grinding, doesn’t wear underwear so you can see his dick through his pants, posting pictures in a towel showing his dick more, etc. ITS DISGUSTING. 

I think one of the messages that has resonated with me the most was him telling a 16 year old girl to “ride his cock”. Then continued to beg her for nudes using every trick he could use. 

I just wanted to know if the police would do anything about this. He lives in Texas, I live in Mississippi so I can’t personally go kick his fucking ass for this. Please help.

710,"About 4 years ago it came to light that my brother in law likely had a pretty bad gambling problem and had been fabricating a bunch of lies so he could take money from both sides of the family. Not only this but straight out stealing my mother's jewelry while he and my sister and their child stayed with my parents (after presumably getting kicked out for not paying their rent).

I wasn't very happy with the resolution at the time, he ran off after being accused of stealing and there wasn't an apology. Really it was just all swept under the carpet and my sister has carried on almost like nothing happened.

The state on play now is that everyone on my side of the family gets together, their children, my children, my parents, everyone except him. As the children are getting older it's getting pretty awkward as he is always missing and not really discussed.

Half of me thinks it would be nice to have a proper extended family and it would be nice to try and bring people together again and resolve the rift. The other half thinks that he never got help and is probably still at it, is 4 years enough time to get over all the (very bad) lies and stealing that he never admitted. 

I'm not sure how to even begin dealing with it when my sister refuses to discuss it. I feel like she must be in some kind of mentally abusive relationship, and facing the truth is too much for her.

Unfortunately I've never been very close with my sister or maybe this would have been easier. I tried talking to her about it at the time but she stopped replying and I started getting messages from him which was creepy. Thanks for reading!",05Jan2020,1

I worry I’ll become too attached to him during this hard time and I don’t want that. I don’t vent all my issues to him but he’s aware of them and his company makes me feel so much better when we’re together. 

I feel like my world is small and enclosed. I know this is my anxiety but still. I feel ashamed for living home practically doing nothing with my life right now because my mental state is not good at all. I need to change. 

I know what I need to do that’s good for me but I can’t seem to find the motivation to do it. Looking back, I really wish I was just my old self who had anxiety, not the person I am now: moderately depressed, anxious, miserable, and lonely.",05Jan2020,1

720,"My mother and I aren't the closest and it may be why we have such a complicated relationship. To make matters worse, she's been away for 3 months and is returning in 2 days. 

Before she left, she said some fucked up things to me about how she never felt love or warmth in our household and wonders why she's even in it. She told me that before she married my father, she had an affair with a man for 9 years but when it came to marriage, he dumped her since he wasn't ready. She told her parents that she was ready to be married off wherever she wanted and didn't have a preference. She said that my father never wanted children. He forced her to abort the first one, the second one was a miscarriage and the third is well, me. She told me that she tried to get a divorce with him in the past but he wasn't willing to take responsibility for it, so they just let it pass. She said she's considering it again. 

Since she was away, she missed their 25th Anniversary as well as my birthday. Now that she's coming back, I don't really know what to make of it. Whenever she calls she says something minute and condescending that may not seem like much but really impacts me. Today when we talked over the phone, she did it again and I started tearing up. As soon as the call ended, I started breaking down and I was an utter mess. It's when I realized that this isn't normal and I'm so scared, so so scared for when she's going to get back and I just well up each time I think about it. 

I don't know what to even believe in at this point or who to talk to about this since it's so personal and complex. I don't know if I should shut her off as usual or maybe I can try to change and be a better child for her? I'm so lost and I'm dreading it so much so any advice would be appreciated",05Jan2020,1
721,"I got a floor mat from Staples a few months ago to protect my floor from my wheelie chair. Ironically, the mat has now scratched the floor. The edge of it, where it would dig into a carpeted floor, is apparently pretty sharp to the point where it has scratched the floor. I know it is the floor mat's fault because all the scratches I can see now are exactly where the floor mat's edge was, in a nice line too.

The scratches aren't deep, but still deeper than you'd expect from a floor mat that was supposed to protect the floor!

723,"So maybe last month I got food poisoning. I have emetophobia so this has been really hard on me. I already have a really bad relationship with food but it's gotten worse.
I'm now only really eating spaghettios, apple sauce, bananas, and saltines. I got a bit lenient with this and ate some junk food. I have a really sensitive digestive system I guess so this made me really nauseous and I've been recovering for the past 2 days. Now I'm back to the diet I've described. 
I saw these ensure drinks, they're meal replacement drinks and I think they're used in feeding tubes. That's good, it means I could live off of them, I think. I would really like to just rely on those right now. I have a really bad appetite and it's so hard to eat anything, it would be so much easier if I could drink instead. I think that the ensure drinks would be a good substitute of food, but maybe I'm wrong. But even so, I think it would be better than spaghettios apple sauce bananas and saltines. Probably has more nutrients in it. I guess the advice I'm looking for is if it's a good idea to get these drinks. Idk. Sorry. I'm having a really hard time right now.",05Jan2020,1
724,"I am so sorry to have to open this post. I am truly heartbroken. My best friend who is also my cousin was sexually assaulted today. Her older sisters fiance got her drunk to the point she doesn't remember almost anything. She doesn't remember how she got to bed or anything else. She remembers some sexual acts and she  remembers waking up naked in his bed.  He said ""Nothing happened between us, just don't mention this to your sister"". She wont seek out legal action. I tried but our country's legal system is so fucked up that he 99% wouldn't get any punishment since she was drunk and alone with him. And our uncle is into some shady stuff so if he were to find out he would definitely kill the guy and go to prison for life. She is in the guilty mentality now. She keeps saying ""How could I do this to my sister ?"" She also wants to believe  that nothing happened even though she remembers some stuff happening. I keep telling her she has no fault. It doesn't matter if she was drinking. It doesn't matter if she couldn't say no because she was so drunk. She just cant shake the feeling that she is guilty to her sister. Her sister knows btw. She is kinda acting like its her(my friends) fault too. She acts like her sister wasn't raped. I understand she is hurting but she should be there for her sister.  They live in a different city. She has already tried to commit suicide. They just got back from the hospital. Only thing I can do is to call her and talk to her. I don't wanna say anything that will hurt her more. I just want to be there for her as much as she needs. How can I do that? What things I should refrain from saying that are not so obvious to someone who is not a sexual assault survivor?

728,"I've been in a relationship with the most amazing girl for just past a year now but I think I might have ruined it.  Before her I would always feel empty, lonely and felt like life was pointless.  When I met her that all changed, like a light came into the darkness and showed me the world I had been missing. Literally the greatest year of my life cause I made so man good memories with her.

We had a pretty bad fight and she asked for a break.  She called me obsessive cause I'm always texting her or always with her.  She even implied I was always following her or stalking her but that's a misunderstanding.  I go to a gym literally two minutes from her house or I tend to follow a walking route into town which bypasses her workplace so I've ran into her a few other times when we weren't talking. I did go to her house to see if I could talk with her but she wouldn't, then I went to her work cause I couldn't find any other to talk to her which I know was too far.

I've always had up and down moods, like really down depressed kind of moods that last for days.  The down moods are mainly when I'm away from her but sometimes when I'm with her too and she's saw this. She wanted me to see someone. I saw my GP but all he did was get me some tablets.  My job at the time was me being locked away packing for 12 hours without sunlight so I don't think that helped at all with my moods. I quit it not long after and stopped the tablets and my moods sort of improved for a while but it was like the darkness was fading but always coming back slowly.

So after she asked for the break it put me in such a dark place. I literally lost interest in everything, I don't want to go to the gym, I don't want to eat, watch TV or do anything. I sit in work crying for hours on end it's that bad.  I'm going to see someone, a Councillor, cause she thinks that there's actually someone not right in my head like being bipolar or something like that. But I'm just back to feeling how I was when she was never in my life.  I just want to know what's wrong with me.",05Jan2020,1
729,"Hopefully this isn’t too long.

About 4 months ago me and my friend moved to a city 2 hours away from our parents as we both wanted to take our post-secondary here since it’s overall a better university. We’re both enrolled into engineering and the workload and course material overall is difficult and time consuming. Because of this it’s difficult to handle uni on top of financial issues and an SO. Fortunately I have had saved up a fair bit and can handle myself financially and I don’t plan on any relationships till I feel ready which just leaves me with the workloads from uni. Now unfortunately my friend is completely opposite. He has been juggling around with his workload, financial planning and an SO.

Now that we have the background story let’s continue with the problem. Recently over Christmas break his parents actually called me over when my friend wasn’t home and attempted to figure out if he told me anything that they wouldn’t have been told or known of. Fortunately he hadn’t kept anything secret from his parents, but I was informed by them that not only has he been clinically depressed and takes antidepressants since summer in 2019, but he’s stopped taking them 2 months ago. His parents believe he would be fine financially if he were to just stay back at home and I agree. We both believe that the fact that his SO is in this university makes him want to stay there instead of going back home. 

Unfortunately he’s been spiraling out of control from all this. He can’t handle his workload and financial troubles at the same time, currently has failed the first term of uni. His SO has considered breaking up half way through the first term due to university work, but got back together. He’s lost his idea of where he wants to go and I believe he will resort to alcoholism due to what he’s said and his family’s history of alcoholism.

Overall I know I can’t do much until he himself can open up to me, but I just don’t know what to do and I don’t want him to feel like he doesn’t have a shoulder to lean on. I want to help him, but I can’t since only his parents have been feeding me their story.

Tl;dr

Friend’s parents informed me he’s stop taking his meds for his depression and he is continuing to spiral into depression. I want to help, but not sure how I can if he isn’t willing to open up to me.",05Jan2020,1

731,"Hey reddit, 
I had a bit of an off discussion with my wife last night (who is 9 months pregnant, baby is due in at least 2 weeks) where she discussed a concern she had about our daughters future. Basically, my friends threw me a d&amp;d themed pamper party for me where there was a class reveal for my daughter. The options were cleric, fighter, magic-user and thief (she got cleric!) My wife had gone with me and it seemed she had fun and really enjoyed the whole celebration. But last night she told me how it concerned her that “thief” bothered her as an option to describe our daughter. I told her it’s simply a game and there’s nothing to worry about. 

Now, to be clear, my wife and I are both Christian but our practices are very different. She is very superstitious and against concepts like Halloween, Harry Potter etc. I grew up on that stuff and have no issues with it at all. The ironic thing about it all is my family are the ones responsible for teaching the doctrine that influenced my wife to start thinking like that. In fact anytime I’ve mentioned dressing up with my daughter for comic con, getting her into theater and reading her lord of the rings at some point has caused my family to act repulsed that is even consider it. Being told it will make her a “little monster”. 

I wasn’t raised by my dad and his side of the family and have only known them the past 5 years out of the 25 years I’ve been alive. So their practices still confuse me but I love them all the same. I just don’t want my daughter to live in superstitious fear just because her grandparents think most things are tied to the devil. I fully believe that she should have the right to choose what she enjoys as much as what she believes. I just hate the idea of my family accusing me of teaching her about the devil and influencing her to the point where she’ll be another closed minded person before she’s even old enough to enjoy what the rest of the world has to offer.

TLDR; My family are religious zealots and think I’m dooming my unborn child into damnation because a play dungeons and dragons.

732,"(I'm posting for my girlfriend, Lily because she does not have Reddit)

  
Some background on Lily: She lives with her grandparents, who have custody over her as well as her sister. Lily's parents are divorced. Lily has a drug-addict mother who was deemed unfit to be a parent by CPS, and she has a semi-stable father. However, the father can be just as bad as the grandparents at times. Lily has diagnosed anxiety and depression and is currently on medication. She went to a psych ward for a week a couple of months back due to being suicidal.

We wonder if her grandparents actually being abusive, and we've come to Reddit for advice on what to do about them. Some of the things the grandparents have done include:

* Taking phone/google passwords
* The grandmother denying her diagnosed anxiety and depression, and further pressing that her issues are more important
* The grandparents get upset if Lily doesn't do what they say, threatening her if she doesn't listen
* The grandparents (mostly the grandmother) indirectly insult Lily about her body, implying she is a whore
* The grandparents don't let Lily close her bedroom door
* The grandparents always assume Lily is lying, despite her telling the truth
* The grandparents consistently invade Lily's privacy

738,"Soo here's the thing.
About two months ago I started dating my current boyfriend (M23, I'm F19 - we're in the same class in art school). Before that I wasn't single for more than a few months, after my previous 4 year long relationship ended.

My boyfriend is the sweetest guy you could possibly imagine and honestly everyone's dream bf. He's charming, romantic, kind and very much in love with me. 
And I feel so horrible because I honestly thought I'd have feelings by now, but I just... don't. We only went on two dates before we officially got together, and it honestly just happened way too fast for me - I guess his feelings were a lot stronger from the start, and I assumed that over time I'd catch feelings for him, too.

But I honestly just feel trapped in this relationship. Am I a terrible person? I know his feelings are sincere. Last night we went on a dinner date, he gave me a rose and chocolates, and this morning he made breakfast for me like a gentleman. He's so sweet, and I feel all the worse for it, because the closer he tries to get, the more trapped I feel.
I've tried to communicate this a few weeks ago, that I need more space, and he took it very well and backed off. But I still don't feel well. It's like I'm leading him on and acting the ""happy girlfriend"" when all I really want is to be alone and not spend time with him.

I don't want to lead him on. I've been hoping that I'll fall in love over time, but I feel so awful in this relationship. Maybe I wasn't single for long enough after my last breakup, because I constantly seem to see my abusive Ex in him.

I genuinely wish him a girlfriend who can appreciate him and love him. Should I just end the relationship? I don't really know how, it'll hurt him a lot. He doesn't know that anything is wrong. And he's been so happy.
I certainly won't find anyone like him again any time soon. I think I might regret it someday if I throw this away now. But I don't feel good right now, and that's a fact.

Any advice would be appreciated :/",05Jan2020,1

I regret being so angry all of these years and not trying to reestablish a more positive role with my dads side of the family. My step mom caused me a lot of pain and emotional abuse while I was growing up but has since become more loving and a great mom to her 2 teenage daughters (my half sisters). She was the only real mother I did have for years. 

I have mental health issues like anxiety and depression that I’ve managed to push forward with on my own for years without help. But I’ve been slowly spiralling throughout December as the holidays came closer. On NYE I hit a low point and over the past few days I’ve hit a low that I’ve never experienced before. 

I was informed via text that my step moms cancer spread. I’ve never experienced a close loss in my life (27F) and this rattled me. I cried for hours on my couch before asking my bf if I could come see him to hopefully feel less alone and distract myself. I get there and he says we need to take a break. 

I continue to go downhill in my mental state. I’ve made plans to see my family in hopes to make amends during this time and create happier memories. But currently I’m physically ill from the anxiety and I can’t keep on like this... i feel so alone and broken down.

I’ve heard some bad things from past students who’ve done extern and it makes me kind of nervous.

I worked side by side with this same person for over a year and never once has she smelled. She’s a very big girl but multiple times she tried to correct the problem the coordinator had but it was something new every time so we knew it had to do with her size.

For starters, I haven’t talked to her in about 8 years. And I was never a bad person. People have always liked me, for my warm and welcoming personality. She was always jealous of that. Guys she crushed on would rather talk to me and be friends with me, simply because I would be welcoming to them (And I had no romantic interest in them). She resented me for that. Well now, it looks like she is trying to ruin my life. I never tweeted anything bad when I was younger (15-17). Sure, I maybe laughed at jokes that aren’t appropriate now, but let’s chalk that up to teenage immaturity. I’m not sure how to handle this. My ex friend seems to think I am the same person I was 8 years ago, because she obviously still is. I’m worried as to what she may have, as far as messages and all that goes, because we were best friends that confided in each other in a lot of teenage shit. 

Tldr/ my ex best friend from high school says she has evidence that can ruin my career, I’m worried as to what that evidence may be (possibly super personal stuff)",05Jan2020,1
755,"I'm being real. I really really want to live a rich lifestyle.

A little bit about myself. I'm a 23 year old Asian guy. 5'11. Decent looking...? I can't make a living with looks for sure though. I can learn things fast, I love competition, I will do anything to beat someone in anything I do. 

I did Software Engineering in school, currently taking a break and working because I have no motivation to continue. I am planning on going back to University to study if nothing else comes up, still have 3 years left. 

I feel like I'm wasting time studying though. I see Twitch streamers making millions playing video games. I see girls on Twitter selling nudes and making a shit ton.. really? I see Youtubers selling merch and making so much. I see so many people achieve these things and I tell myself, what's the point of working hard? I can't help but feel envious. 

How do I get there myself? 

I don't give Twitch streamer/Youtubers to find the easiest road to success. I really don't mind working hard. I am willing to work 16 hours a day and give up everything else to succeed. I just find it unfair and unlikely to reach my goals by simply working hard.",05Jan2020,1

757,"Over the past few months I completely transferred friend groups, it wasn’t a sudden thing but all of my old friends are out of my life now for various reasons. I love the people in this new group and they are some of the best friends I’ve had, but I constantly feel like I’m the person they have to include but don’t like. 

Now I was already super close friends with one of the people, think best friends since elementary school close, so it’s not like I’m a total outsider. I’ve also been with this new group for about 4-5 months. But I still feel like I’m the one who they don’t invite out because “it’s nice to have the original group back”  or something like that. 

I don’t want to tell any of them this because it would be such a shitty thing to do, and I know it’s in my head. I have had problems like this in the past and am actively working on dealing with this. But god it just feels so shitty when I get sent pics of them all hanging out or sit with them and have to hear about what they did without me. 

So how the fuck do I deal with this? I feel so stupid for feeling this way but at the same time I can’t just snap my fingers and change it.

759,"
Ill try to keep it short, 2 weeks ago my friend told this girl that I liked her without me knowing. She quickly dismissed it saying shes currently talking to someone and wants to be friends. The guy shes talking is out of state for a few months but they were kinda close.

Recently we hanged out at a club with friends and got drunk. I didnt found out till later but my drunk friend told her that we ""should get together and he has a big dick"". She was laughing and wouldnt tell me why but she turned to me and said that she does like me but currently seeing someone. She then wanted me to give her my number

She then started asking me questions out of nowhere like ""How many relationships you had?"" and such.

Also, when we normally dance together we keep distance between us. This time she asked me ""how do you like to dance?"" and then for the first time she got up close and wrapped her arms around my shoulders.

She did this all while being drunk so I am unsure if she was actually interested or it was the liqueur talking since this is the first time I seen her drunk.",05Jan2020,1

765,"I'm at a career crossroads after recovering from a mental breakdown. I need to start making money again, though I'm not in the most dire of straits.

I've worked in TV production in NYC since graduating from college - so 5 years. On my last show, I had a mental breakdown due to undiagnosed bipolar disorder and was hospitalized. I took 3 months off of work and am ready to return. In which field I'm not sure.... I wonder: did the TV industry and nature of that work help trigger the breakdown, or was it just me? The only lead for work I've had so far is an interview for another production TV job. I've always been more passionate about music... my longterm goal is to work in music, not TV. However, most of my contacts are in the TV world.

These are the options that I'm weighing:

1) I take the production film/tv job. Not my passion. But it's very good money. It's very stressful and it's long hours, but my psychiatrist says he can try to submit a letter of accommodation limiting my hours to 10 hours a day instead of the usual 12 hours a day (no idea how that will go over... the TV industry is a little different than a usual 9-5 because it's contracted work. I might become a stress anxiety ball again and let the job take over my life. I might have another meltdown like I did on my last TV show.

2) I hold out and keep trying to network my way into the music industry. Lower/no wages, less guarantees. Having little luck with my network of contacts to make any promising connections to the industry. It might eventually be similar hours to TV. I have no clue what working in the industry is like. But it's ultimately what I see my future in - and I just want a damn shot at it! A&amp;R, music publishing, synch, music supervision, talent management, tour scheduling.... something, just a taste!

3) Start pursuing an easier film/tv job - in a different department (Accounting, or in charge of the Stages). Working closer to a 9a-6p than a 9a-9p. Not what I want to be doing longterm, but I haven't even tried it yet so who knows. Something to at least get started in, after the traumatic mental breakdown.

I’m a naturally outgoing and cool person, understanding too. I only had one problem with her.  She has so difficult to contact. I would often text her maybe once every 2 weeks to maybe hang out and catch up. But often she would take a week to respond. I think she used a lot of fake excuses. Anyway at some point last year i was kinda over this cheese. Because I know she isn’t off her phone for that long. She’s also on Instagram liking and commenting everywhere so I call it bullshit on it. So I told her like I’m done with this late reply stuff and it’s really not that hard to respond and say I can’t make it or I’m busy sorry. Often we would set up a day in person and she wouldn’t respond to the follow up text the day before. So then she calls me rude and stuff because I want to make clear what’s going on. Like no need to waste each other’s time right? So she calls me rude and blames her lack of time on her autistic brother. Which I get would be a hard thing to take care of him.

We were talking on the couch, flirting, and getting along, and the way she spoke made so much sense to how she was acting in real life. For an explanation: She always used to playfully insult me, show me her things, tell me what she was doing, etc. But she had her own friend group so we didn’t talk that much. We still don’t. I even brought her 2 pounds of gummy bears and she ate it all. Back to the dream though, I was going to put on a movie in the dream, but then suddenly — I awoke! I remember feeling super sad about it. When I woke up. I feel like it pretty much confirmed that I liked this girl, and I was suppressing it all along. This makes me scared because, I’ve always been used to rejecting people (had to reject 2 girls so far), and not liking anyone. Now I actually like this girl, and I’m scared on what to do. Not only that, but I’m asking myself: is this really worth it? I say this because, my friend thinks it’s a bad idea if I tell her. I guess this makes sense, because what if she tells her friends?

I'll make this as short as I can so hopefully it's easier to read, but that will leave out some details for sure.  
  
Part 1: To begin, my son has been sick off and on since moving to this apartment. My MIL bought a mold spot test kit, one of the tests came back positive. I have not sent this test to the lab yet because it costs money I don't really have at the moment. When I rented this place, they showed me one apartment, said this would be the one I rented, and then switched it to a different one when I got my keys(same layout etc.). This apartment has a LOT of water damage, and the back wall bows out slightly. I noted all of this extensively in my walkthrough, I needed a place to live and was not in a position to really turn it down with everything I found. I also have film footage of my walkthrough backing all of my notes. I have not told management about the mold test yet, as I want to be more knowledgeable about what to do and expect before they try and screw me again.  
  
Part 2: I have a new set of neighbors for the past month and a half. They have thrown trash in my backyard. I hear them daily verbally abuse their kids calling them ""f* retards"", and the like. I have had to call the police twice in the past week over noise complaints, and I have complained to management multiple times about them. I dont know what to do with this one, and I certainly dont want to be forced to live out my lease with this being a daily event.  I dont want to start a whole I call CPS, you call CPS scenario. I just want peace not a war. Even if I do it anonymously they might assume it is me due to my constant complaining about their noise already. I hate hearing those kids treated like that and I hate that my kids have to hear it too.

I really didn’t even want to make this post, but I honesty feel like I’m going insane, I’ve had feelings for her for about 6 months now, I’m in a very committed relationship myself,  Ive been with my current girlfriend for 4 years, the thing is I know I love her but I just can’t shake this infatuation I have with my friends girl, it all started because we used to all go to festivals together, basically I shared a pretty intense moment with her while we were both on mdma, and ever since then the feelings just don’t stop, we’ve gotten a lot closer recently and sometimes I think she shares the same feelings, but the thing is she’s just a very flirtatious person and I think she sees it all as innocent banter. I’ve tried to isolate myself from her but I just can’t, I know these feelings are completely wrong but I just can’t stop feeling them, I’ve tried speaking to her about stopping with the flirting but it just doesn’t stop.

779,"Summary at bottom. 

I've been living in a house my cousin owns for several years paying dirt cheap rent. She wants me to buy it or get out. It's an old house, probably at least 1940's or older. It ""needs"" a lot of work like having the carpet taken out and replaced, and the trim and doors and cabinets etc are all super dated. I put quotes on needs . . . since I'm just a bachelor living alone and have ignored that kind of crap for the last like 4 or 5 years I've lived here. 

It's really not that bad, it was painted and cleaned up a bit before I moved in. It has new windows and pretty good insulation for some reason, it stays shockingly cool in the summer and warm in the winter. It's just dated looking when you see the old school trim and needs the 1960's carpet torn out and burned in a fire for being carpet. It could use new tile in the kitchen, and the cabinets are pretty 1980's / 1990's looking etc. Not *that* bad to a single guy living alone who grunts and says ""good enough for me""

She wants $55 thousand for, which is pretty cheap even for my area. I live in a small town, but even most of the houses in my area are still 70-100+ thousand. There are some in the same price range but they are dumps that are like 1 or 2 bedroom and half the size. 

I make $24k a year before taxes which is pretty average for my area. I've got about 5K in savings and another 4-5K in my checking account. I obviously don't want to like completely drain myself to the point where I don't have a penny to my name if something happens, so I'm not sure how much I'd need to put down, if any 

Summary

Me 

* 27
* Single with zero plans to ever have kids
* Paid off car
* 24K a year job

Pro's of House

* 3 Bedroom, 1  bath
* 2 Stories with a full basement (unfinished) 
* Cheap, only $55k
* Good location, it's right in the middle of town. I could walk or bike to anywhere in town in under 10 minutes max

Cons

* Old, like 1940's or older
* Needs a fair bit of work. Carpet, walls, doors, trim etc are all very dated
* Could use new siding

781,"As the title says I am married (7 yrs) and have two children. I figured before I ask for advice I would provide a little back story (sorry). Two years ago we decided to purchase a home. We have had our fair share of issues but nothing we couldn't work out until last year. Four months after we moved into our new home I was notified from my employer that we were going to have a 3 month lay-off, wasn't a big deal because I still get paid while laid off but it's at 80% my base rate. My wife and I had a talk about her getting a job during my lay-off just to help out (she was a stay at home mom up to that point) she agreed and found work pretty quickly since the holidays were coming up.

This is where everything starts to go downhill. About a month after she started working her sister was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver and she was traumatized. I did everything in my power to help her through this dark time but she just kept pushing me further and further away. Every time I tried to do something to help take her mind off things she would bring up her sister and my plans would fail. We sat down and talked and she just said she wanted space so I gave it to her. Within a few weeks she seemed happier and I tried to ease my way back in but she once again told me she needed more time.

As you can imagine all of this took a huge toll on our once very healthy sex life. I figured she was still upset about her sister so I didn't push. We had talked a few times about couples therapy but she would never commit to going. Then one day a good friend had called me and said we needed to talk but it had to be in person, I agreed and met him the next day. He started off by telling me that my wife was having an affair with someone she worked with. When I asked how he knew about it he told me that he knew who it was and had seen my wife in their Snapchat stories. I didn't really believe it at first and then my wife's schedule completely changed. She started going in early and having to stay late. She started getting really dressed up when she went to work and would get extremely upset when I complimented her appearance.

Then one night she didn't come home until 4 am and I started to get suspicious so I asked what she had been doing. She got upset and said she was just hanging out with some friends from work and lost track of time and that I needed to relax. Over the next few weeks she would completely change. I didn't ever see my wife anymore. So one night I sat her down and confronted her about my suspicion and she completely lost it. She told me that I only suspected her of cheating because we weren't having sex (it had been 9 months at this point) and went to bed and told me to sleep somewhere else. I laid on the couch for a bit as I couldn't sleep and my thoughts were consuming me and I needed to know. I got up and went to the bathroom and on my way I noticed her phone on the night stand and couldn't resist taking a look (her phone is normally under her pillow I normally never do this) 

I take her phone into the bathroom and my heart drops. This whole time I thought my wife was having an affair with a man, no she was having a full blown relationship with a woman that she worked with (no I'm not against same sex relationships) I seen all the messages and pictures they took. I put her phone back and went into the living room and just stared at the wall. I didn't know what to do. The next day I confronted her again and she admitted to everything. I told her I wanted a divorce and called my lawyer. When the papers arrived for her to sign she refused and told me she didn't want to throw everything away over a fling. I told her I would only consider if we did counseling and she agreed. For 3 months we did counseling twice a week and things seemed better but our intimacy never returned and we have only done the deed once since all this began and it was lackluster at best. She did not seem to enjoy any part of it and I haven't even had the urge to try again because of it.

I'm pretty much lost at this point. I'm not happy and want to leave but I think about my kids and I get scared and talk myself out of it. All my friends tell me to leave and make it sound so easy to just pack up and go but I just don't know what to do anymore.

782,"Trigger warning mention of suicide and sexual assault. 
So I need so advice. I've never asked for advice here before but I've seen others do it and they have received some great advice. So a few days before xmas my mother and I had a huge argument and at the end of the argument so told me to leave so I left. I guess that she didnt think that I would actually leave since she's told me to leave before and I didnt. I just did because I was sick and tired of her verbal and emotional (sometimes even physical) abuse. Keep in mind that I'm a 20 year old college student who's unemployed and I'm a 100% dependent on my parents financially(i was employed before but my mother convinced me that I should resign because it was going to interfere with school). I didnt have a plan when I left but I just knew that I couldn't stay there anymore because it was affecting my mental health so much that I've begun to contemplate taking my own life. I'm someone who has suffered with depression and suicidal tendencies since being sexually assaulted 2 years ago. I just feel like Ive suffered so much but I've also grown so much that i refuse to let anything or anyone bring me back to such a dark place in my life. So since then I've been staying with my aunt. She's willing to let me stay with her but she says that she cannot help me any other way meaing that I have to find money to buy groceries and get ready for school(which is starting next week). So I've gotten a job to help pay for school but my first pay check doesn't come in till the end of January. With all that in mind I dont know if I made the right choice to leave. Added to that my grandma called me today to say that I'm ungrateful and I shouldn't expect my mother to pay my tuition or help me with school because I'm ungrateful. And she said good luck because sooner or later my aunt's gonna kick me out. Then my mother called to say that I should've known that she didnt mean it because she has told me to leave before but she didnt throw me out and I'm ungrateful and I dont care about her.
I dont know what I'm gonna do or where I'm gonna live if my aunt does ask me to leave but I feel a sense of relief since leaving even though I have no idea where my next meal is coming from or how I'm gonna get to work. My question to you guys is do you think I made the right call?",05Jan2020,1
783,"I’m 21F. Last month I was studying alone in my apartment for finals at night when I heard a knock at the door, and some guy in his twenties who looked kinda fratty said he was here for the party at this apartment.

I told him he must have gotten the wrong apartment number - there was no party here. I was dressed up in sweats with a messy top bun and glasses on, the apartment was dead silent - no music, no conversation, no TV on. It should have been clear there was no social event going down at my apartment that night.

He insisted several times I was mistaken and tried to push past me and get into my apartment. I kept blocking his way in. When I told him to leave and pushed the door closed, he pushed back on the door and tried to get in. I got really angry and body slammed the door closed with all my might and locked it.

When I told the apartment complex the next day, they told me that the guy just made an “honest mistake” and I was being a silly emotional girl.

But this doesn’t make sense to me. Put yourself in his place. If you went to the wrong person’s apartment, and it was an honest mistake, would you **ever** try to force your way in, even if you thought the host was lying to you? How is that a “misunderstanding”?

Anyway, I just wanted your opinions on what went on. I’m thinking about breaking my lease with this apartment if they’re this cavalier about my safety.",05Jan2020,1
784,"My friend, she is in a situation where she was going to university for computer science with her friends and it was good, happy. Now let me just bring something up, no one really teaches you how to do life things (move out, control finances, apply for work/study, etc.) Keeping that in mind she relied on her mom to help her and for her second semester, her mom didn't do what she needed to in order for my friend to stay at her uni. She is now getting kicked out until the next reapply point. She is starting to panic and have anxiety. She believes these are her options: 

 1. Move home back into her parents and just wait until the next point.

2. Temporarily go to Canada with her boyfriend and a few friends who live there and wait.

3. Stay in Boston (where her uni is) and find an apartment with others and get a job and wait.

She says #3 would make her happiest out of the options. She really doesn't want to go home because she feels her parents don't care for her as much as she thought they did. She knows she wants to go back to school but its also hard watching all of her friends move forward when she can't. She is depressed and scared because she's still a kid and doesn't know how to do anything and she feels if she communicates with adults they'll think she's crazy.

786,"Am I being ridiculously insecure or am I onto something? 

In my past relationship ( first relationship ) at 24 my ex was clearly still hung up on his ex but would deny it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and in the end when we broke up he finally admitted I was there to fill a void. I was basically second best. 

This still angers me especially as I lost my virginity to him. To be honest I still haven’t forgiven myself for that. But alas I learnt a lot from that relationship about what I want. 

My current boyfriend that I met 2 years ago is great. He’s a lovely guy who has been serious with me from day one. The only thing is early on in our relationships when we spoke about our pasts he mentioned he’s had 2 girlfriends. 

He regrets the last one but his first girlfriend that he was with when he was younger - around 22  ( 4 years long ) he said that they were just too young at the time and that nothing went wrong. It fizzled out and that if they met when they were older things could have been different. That he was her first everything ( clearly something men seem to like ). Now I’d be lying if it didn’t bother me. It makes me actually wonder - am I second best, am I a place holder - what if she came back now that they are older &amp; more mature. To be honest these insecurities have been bothering me and I’m putting less and less effort into the relationship. 

I have brought this up to him and he’s said that he’s happy with me, and that if he wanted to stay at the time he would have stayed with her that he doesn’t think about his exes. But I’m not sure. My ex said the same things.

I’ve made very very clear being with someone that has regrets and what ifs about breaking up with this ex makes me uncomfortable and he needs to find a reason to break up with me if this is the case. I’ve said it’s a huge deal breaker for me. Obviously he hasn’t broken up with me but this might be because he knows he can’t get back with her or that she’s irreplaceable anyhow. 
He actually called me an hour ago saying that he wants us to start viewing some properties but for some reason I’m still insecure over this ex.

We can't do any physical activities either, since he recently had a knee operation. We both feel like we've wasted our free time, but can't come up with anything we could do.

i’ve been suicidal for a number of years just don’t have the courage to do anything about it. i’m not hurting myself and stopped doing so a whole back.

the job i work has been short staffed for a few months and because i strive to be a wonderful employee no matter where i go, i’ve taken extra shifts, come in HOURS before i’m supposed to, and have stayed way past my time to help keep my boss from overloading *herself* more than she already has. 

one night i was called in by another employee (not my boss) to come in early because she was supposedly sick. i cried for the last 3 hours of the shift because i had no sleep and was. ready to drop. going into work the next night, i contemplated driving my car into a ditch along the highway and hoping it’d kill me.

792,"Hey guys, recently I sold my old car for $400. It just kept breaking and I put 500 a month into repairs till the transmission started to go and i finally said screw this and sold it for parts. Now I am looking at buying. The problem is I only recently established my credit so most places are offering a 20% interest rate which I would never accept. So I am building my credit and saving close to 1000 a month for a new car. 

I found a used charger with less than 40k miles. It's my dream car. I have always wanted one. It's a 2018 RT for 22k. The only thing is I don't know how practical it is. My worry is if I dont get this car now I never will. It's not really a family car and I want a family some day. 

I have also been looking at a 2018 mazda 3 and a 2019 Camry. These two are more practical and significantly cheaper than the charger but I dont think they would be as fun to drive. 

I still love with my parents and my only bill is my school tuition. I make 15 and hour as an intern for the government in an IT department. However the internship is ongoing and I can stay for another 4 to 5 years. Or I can leave and get a job paying closer to 25 an hour but it wouldn't work as well with school.

I feel like the charger payments wouldn't be bad if I saved for a while longer on a good down payment.

793,"So for context, my wife has had a medical issue with her tubes for awhile now. Scarring is the biggest part of it, but there’s also an issue with them being twisted up and other stuff. The combination of it all gives her stabbing pain pretty much year round, worse on her time of month. It’s an issue she’s had for a long time, we knew at some point there would have to be something done.

The only reason this wasn’t taken care of sooner was because doctors flat out didn’t believe her. The first few, quote on quote, “checked” and found nothing. However their idea of checking was just looking at her records, calling her a liar and sending her away. 

After that one actually bothered to take a look at it, and that’s when they found all the scarring. They told us that it 

1. Would make her ability to get pregnant non-existent, and 

2. They refused to operate on it cause to do so, they would have to remove her tubes, and “despite the lack of likeliness of pregnancy, removing them completely would take that away from your future husband”. So basically she was told she couldn’t have the surgery cause some guy down the road might disagree about a surgery to do with her body. 

Fast forward... about 4-5 years. Me and my wife are married now, we were dating for awhile and were considered a “young married couple” due to our age. But we’re happy. On top of that, we were very happy cause after getting married and moving out acrossed the country, we FINALLY found a doctor who not only believed her and was willing to listen, but was also willing to do the surgery if it came to that. (For reference, we still had a couple doctors refuse her due to “you two might change your minds” excuses).

So surgery was on schedule, we were getting stuff done, then major roadblock 1. Her surgery, due to the amount of issues and the severity of it, is making her doctor nervous. She isn’t backing out, thank a god, but she is bringing a second doctor who’s a very experienced person in this field. To that regard though, the price of pre-op also shot up to about $1,600. Issue 2 came just a week or so ago, with my wife’s period never came.

Turns out, she can get pregnant. It’s just life threatening since with all her issues, there’s no way for her to carry or birth the baby safely. We don’t really know how it happened as we’ve always tried to be careful, but just goes to show what they say I suppose, “all it takes is one slip up”. Anyway, we weren’t sure what to think at first, but it doesn’t really matter because she physically cannot safely do this. Absolute best case scenario still has extreme risks of her dying in childbirth or worse. Worst case, the way the tubes are scarred and knotted means that the fetus gets stuck inside of them, taking the situation from dangerous to immediate-care-needed-yesterday levels of bad.

All of it’s gonna cost money. We were find when we just had to pay for the surgery. We were nervous when we learned the pre-op price. Now she’s in full panic mode and I’m trying to keep it together for her but I don’t know what to do either.

799,"Dear Reddit, 

Recently, I've been feeling horrible about myself. All I've done this winter break was think. And by now you must've guessed that these were not nice thoughts either. I really could use some help.

I'm just a teen (turning 17), but I already feel like I'm struggling with mental problems. I come from an unstable family, that I wouldn't really even call family. It's full of conflict, there is no real bond between anyone, it is miserable. My parents fight all the time, I have a little brother (3yo) who is wreaking havoc non-stop, so there is not a single minute of silence at home. It drives me insane. My other relatives have never really tried to connect with me (except for one of my grandmas). They kept harassing me over my weight, they kept comparing me to other kids in the family... I was never good enough for them.

The only person who I really could connect with was my mother. She meant stability to me. She was always cheerful, she cared about me, she was wonderful. But then, my grandpa was diagnosed with cancer, and he died a year later. This trauma completely changed my mother. She went from happy-go-lucky to depressed in an instant. 12 year old me couldn't handle it. Nothing I did would cheer her up. She completely became indifferent. Then something even worse happened. She became pregnant in hopes of that fixing her broken relationship with my father. You can guess how well that turned out. :(

After this experience, I completely shut myself off from the outside world, and I was actually doing just fine. I didn't care about anyone or anything. But then, highschool rolled around and I actually managed to surround myself with friends that I really care about. I also got in a relationship. After a while though, I managed to notice some old fears resurfacing. I started becoming terribly afraid of losing them, of driving them away because I was not good enough. I became very insecure again. Old wounds were torn open.

Now, if people leave me on read for a while, if they disappear for a while, or if they start acting in a slightly different way, I start to panic. I've become completely emotionally dependant on them, especially on my girlfriend. It's not only this though, it's spread to other parts of my life. I can no longer go outside my comfort zone without being anxious. I'm scared of new things to the point of avoiding new movies or shows, starting something new legitimately frightens me.

I know that this cannot go on. I will inevitably start being toxic to my loved ones, and believe me, I really don't want to hurt them. I feel trapped and I don't know what to do. How can I get over these insecurities?",05Jan2020,1

801,"My grandma has always been a sucky person. She's super controlling of other women, angry, selfish, short-tempered, and is abusive to her daughters/granddaughters. She respects men though, and loves her sons.

About 5 years ago, she started developing dementia. Last year, my grandpa decided to change his will and power of attorney docs to appoint me, a 22 year old, as the power of attorney for both of my grandparents. At first, I didn't think it was a big deal. However, now my grandpa is dying and I resent being appointed my grandma's POA.  


I think the dementia is making her especially angry and unreasonable. She won't listen to women who are trying to help her, especially not younger ones. She has recently become urine incontinent after my grandpa got sick, and she's probably gonna deteriorate even quicker once he passes. My grandpa has explicitly stated that he doesn't want her put in a nursing home, and I feel the need to honour his wishes. My uncles are expecting me to move in with my grandma and care for her (along with 24/7 home care). My uncles both have great jobs and families, but they live in the US, and my grandpa prefers that my grandma not be sent there due to their healthcare system.  


I'm extremely bitter about this. I don't believe home care is gonna be adequate in properly caring for my grandma, especially once she deteriorates. But, I want to honour his wishes of not putting her in a nursing home. I'm also very bitter about being expected to move in with my grandma, as I have a very demanding career (16h days) which I love, and I'm planning on getting married this year (my family doesn't respect my marriage plans because my fiance is white). I can't even refuse POA, as the secondary POA is our financial management company who would definitely put her in a nursing home. I have no idea why my grandpa decided to change his POA to completely exclude his sons/daughter, as now I'm trapped.  


It'd be different if my grandma was once a nice person, but she's always been horrible. I'm so sick of living with abusive people (my immediate family is nuts), and I crave the opportunity to move on and start a life with my fiance. I think a nursing home is the best place for her, but my grandpa was firmly against it. I don't know what to do.",05Jan2020,1

808,"I am very difficult to connect with, cause I am quite weary of people, so I build walls around myself to protect myself from them. I am lucky in a way, cause I still have a decent amount of good friends, despite my personality. I guess I was lucky, since a couple of good friends I made years ago keep introducing me to new people. I am part of a big and exciting group of friends that keeps introducing me to new people. I am never alone on holidays and usually not on weekends, either. I travel and usually have people to join me whenever I really want to try something new. 

That being said, not being alone does not mean I don’t feel lonely all the time. I am so weary of people that I keep some kind of emotional distance even from my closest friends. I am quiet and awkward even with people I’ve hung out with for the last 8 years. I feel so lonely. 

The only times I connect easily with people is when they are being vulnerable. When someone opens up to me about something they’re struggling with is when I start trusting and feeling comfortable with them. Not only do I feel like people are not threatening when they’re vulnerable, but I can also relate to them. Most people I meet are pretty happy, confident and outgoing in comparison to me, and I somehow find it threatening, as if they will start judging me or getting bored of me for not being as happy as they are at some point. That’s the stupid idea I have about people. I know it’s stupid but I can’t help unconsciously believing it. When people are vulnerable is when we can be unhappy together, and when we can feel comfortable with each other.

About a year ago, she had convinced a close friend of hers (let’s call her Amy) to join the studio with her. Amy and Gina have been relatively close friends since high school. Amy has bipolar disorder and has always been very reserved to my knowledge. Gina has been there for Amy on numerous occasions and had it not been for Gina, Amy wouldn’t have been introduced and integrated into her relatively large friend group. I even knew Amy relatively well during high school because of Gina, to the point where Amy and I became relatively close friends as well.

Gina, who naturally hates conflict between any of her friends, naturally decided to confront her on my behalf to get a sense as to what her reasoning was. 

The answers Amy kept giving were very unclear and changed every time, to the point where Gina basically told her that she doesn’t even need to be friends with me, but that Amy owes me an explanation at the very least. Furthermore, Gina also added that if Amy had any intention to save the friendship she and Gina have, that she would at least talk to me. 

Eventually, Amy decided to block Gina from social media as well. 

Now, here’s where it gets interesting. Remember how Gina invited Amy to join the tae kwon doe studio? Well, Amy still goes to the studio on a regular basis. Gina has been very uncomfortable with this recently because every time she goes to the studio she feels on edge knowing that Amy is there. They sometimes get paired up to do stretches, drills, and sparring. It makes it a very awkward and anxious environment for Gina, to the point where she’s been discouraged to go to classes. 

Since the two aren’t friends anymore, I kind of find it weird that Amy is still attending the studio. Normally, if you have a beef with someone you’d want to stay away from that person, but Amy hasn’t done that. Amy is also the one that has cut out Gina in the first place. 

So, I have no idea what to do. I’ve been considering emailing Amy to ask her not to come to the studio anymore and respect Gina’s space, but I don’t know if I’m in the right doing that. I’ve also considered sending her an email basically telling her that we desperately need to talk but considering how stubborn she’s been she might not even read it. Hell, this is all while assuming that she hasn’t blocked my email as well. 

A few things to note: 
 - The three of us are not in high school anymore. We’re all in our junior year of college, and have been friends since high school. 
 - Gina has been recently diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder. Seeing Amy at the studio always causes her to to be even more reluctant to attend. 
 - I have no idea how to deal with someone with bipolar disorder so if anyone as insight on that it would be a huge plus.

I called out one day last week to look after her before she was diagnosed. It was short notice, so I told my supervisor that I had a bad migraine (stupid).

She still isn't feeling too great today, so I plan on notifying my supervisor that I won't be in tomorrow.

816,"I need advice. I was at party two nights ago, was with a couple of buds and we had went for drinks and just to be around people. After a while of drinking I was buzzed and not thinking clearly. a gay man at the party we will call him ""D"" comes up to me and sees I am drunk and offers me food and water I accept being overwhelmed with joy that I now have food to munch on. Before we go any further I feel it is important to mention I am a straight white man I do not like men. Never in my life have I felt that way about another man. 

&amp;#x200B;

We begin talking he is seemingly nice guy we talk about music and some other mutual friends and our fun experiences with them. He compliments me on my appearance and says I am cute. I let him know I am thankful for the comment but do not swing that way. He then says something about how its a shame he ""bets I was good in bed"" I become uncomfortable at this point and get up to leave letting him know I do not appreciate that. He tries to grab my arm and pull me back saying he was ""just joking and meant nothing by it"" I tell him its whatever dont worry about it decide against my better judgement to sit back down and continue the conversation. I tell him I am tired and am gonna close my eyes and let him know don't be mad if I doze off. He lets me know there is a bed upstairs I can sleep on until my friends come up and get me to go back to our house. 

&amp;#x200B;

After some convincing I have him help me up and help me get to the room. We get to the room he lays me down and sits beside me as I am laying down kind of in the position of an ""I"" if that makes sense. He starts talking about how he enjoyed our talking this is where I just kind of doze off and sleep. I was more or less drunk at this point and was just overall very tired. I woke up which must have been about 5-10 minutes later to my pants off and him blowing me. I had never been in this position before I was scared, drunk and confused I started screaming for him to ""get off of me"" he tried to shush me as to not be heard. I pull my jeans and boxers up. At this point I was mad more mad then I had ever been in my life. Before I knew it I was on top of him punching him in the face. Hard. like as hard as I fucking could. After this I walk downstairs crying blood on my fists.

&amp;#x200B;

People were freaking out I told my friends what happened and that I was just sexually assaulted. Mostly everyone else runs out of the room and to the room he was in. He had told them a different story about how he thought him coming upstairs with me meant that is what I wanted. They told me to leave and that it wasn't right what I did to a gay man. I WAS THE ONE IN THE FUCKING WRONG. THIS MAN SEXUALLY ASSAULTS ME AND I AM WRONG BECAUSE HE IS GAY AND I APPARENTLY SENT MIXED SIGNALS? I TOLD HIM I DID NOT GO THAT WAY. Someone please help me. I can't fucking deal with myself. Why did this happen to me. Is this actually my fault? Was I in the wrong for doing what I did? Please someone just help me.",05Jan2020,1

818,"I've known my friend ever since third grade, we've stayed so close through all these years despite us going to different high schools and universities. 

We live in the same suburb neighborhood, however in June 2019 she moved into an apartment with her two friends from Uni. Due to this, she and I have not been hanging out as frequently, but we still make time to see each other at least once a month. 

We all went to a spa just after she moved in with her friends, and it was a really good time. For context, my friend has always been curvy but never ever overweight. She just put on weight more around the booty, thighs etc. It was never a ""fat"" appearance though. 

After that spa day in June, I did not get to see her until September of 2019, several months later. My sister and I planned to go to the movies with her. When she came to meet us at the movies....I was shocked. She had lost a dramatic amount of weight since we last saw her only 3 months previously. Her butt, legs and arms were almost half their normal size (she has maintained the same body size her whole life/never dieted etc). Both my sister and I commented on how different she looked later that night and we were both shocked. 

Since it has been the Christmas break, we have been hanging out more. I saw her two times this past week &amp; a half and I'm beginning to pick up on some concerning behaviors:

1. She is open about her weight loss. One day we went shopping and we were looking in a store mirror and she said ""all I did was literally cut out chocolate and sweets. My parent's home had so many sweets in it that I'd always eat and now that I live alone I haven't been eating them"". I just was like ""wow yeah, you look good!"".
2. She is eating way healthier and doesn't finish meals. For example: if we go out for food, she won't finish it or ask for it to be packed up to take home. If we make a trip to the store to get fun snacks, I will go to grab some popcorn or chips, but she will gravitate to ""Veggie Crisps"" or Dried mangos. (Very unlike her, we always used to love to get fun junk food when we'd hangout). I choose not to comment on this and just let her choose what she wants. Maybe she's trying to just eat better???
3. This is the most concerning. She makes frequent trips to the bathroom, often using other excuses for disappearing for a few minutes. For example, when we go out for food, she will say she has to go to the washroom and will excuse herself before she finishes her food. Last night she was over at our place, and we were eating dinner in the basement watching Netflix. She stops halfway through her dinner and says she ""has to go get her charger"" from my bedroom. She runs up to the top floor.....but is up there for about 5-10 minutes. She is 2 floors above so we can't really hear what is going on. Eventually I heard a toilet flush and she came down after with her starbucks coffee she left in my room and says that she could not find her charger but forgot her coffee was up there. Once she came back to her food she was like ""anyone want this? I think I feel full already because I drank so much coffee"". My sister and I picked at some of her food to help her finish.

We went to bed around midnight that night. I was almost asleep when I heard her get up and leave the room around 2:00 am, again she was gone for a few minutes. I heard the toilet flush but it was the toilet downstairs, not the one outside of our bedrooms. She woke me up when she came back and said ""oh sorry if I woke you, I just went downstairs because I didn't want to wake you guys up with the toilet flushing"". I said no worries and went back to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

Is any of this behaviour concerning? Or is it just me reading too much into it? I'm worried that her frequent bathroom trips are to puke up any food. If this is the case do I address my concern with her?

I worry that shes afraid to put weight back on now that she's lost so many pounds, and as a result turns to purging to feel better about not putting weight back on??",05Jan2020,1
819,"Hey so.. I really don't know what to do lately.. I feel like I'm falling back into depression again and I hate myself for that even more, I'm ashamed of even saying this. Something that really bothers me is my relationship if you can still call it that. We are both the problem, he has anger issues and can't control himself and he did a lot of shit that scared me. I threatened him 3 times to break up because he didn't change like he said he will. But it's like there's a war in my head, the side that says I should leave him it would better for me and the other side that says If I lose him I will be completly alone again. I'm also no good in making friends, I don't know how and it hurts me that I'm so alone, also I feel like I don't want anyone for any kind of relationship, I even lost almost every intererest in sex. I feel like I have to protect myself and I feel so bad after sex. I've even noticed lately that it hurts so much I try to have sex, like it feels like I lose my virginty again over and over, but with much more pain, as if my body doesn't want it. 

Now, I also stayed at my boyfriends house on New Years Evening but next morning we hook up a bit and cuddled but I didn't want more and after I told him he got up quickly and left the room, almost slamed the door. After I started crying he finally realized he was wrong. I said I wanted to go home and left much more early than planned. I also asked to go to the train alone. After that I feel so goddamn bad. It hurts me so so much on the inside. I don't feel like I can see him again.

But I have no one, I don't want to be alone again, I don't even know If I still love him. This Experience scared me, more than everything else he ever did or said. I wish I could just disappear from here and leave all these problems.

825,"I have been with my girlfriend for over a year now and today was the day that we broke up. I am extremely devastated because I loved her a a lot and did everything she wanted. I knew when I first started dating her that we would eventually break up, but when I spent more time  with her I fell deeper and deeper in love. As time went on we had a drop off in communication after our 3 months of dating. Sensing this I tried my absolute best to keep her happy. For months she would she would slowly lose interest in talking to me and our conversations became very dry. I have not had a girlfriend in my 20 years of living so her being my first made me afraid to lose her. So when she told me she did not like me having friends girls, I would drop them. When she told me to come pick her up I would. When she needed some money I would give her some.

Everyday I was constantly thinking to myself if she is happy or not and whether there is something I could do about it. As the time passes, I recognize that she has been talking to this one guy for months now and she claims that he is her friend. Well 5 months pass after knowing this, she ended up cheating with this guy. I was shocked up I also felt guilty as to somehow I led her to cheat on me. So feeling guilty I would forgive her and still love her. At this point I have now more stress with family issues, constant nightmares every night, and afraid that she would do it again. More time passes and I realize that she started to lie to me about where she was and where she has been. I find out again that she was still seeing the same guy. I at this point was angry so I yelled and cried, hoping she would feel sorry for me. This was not the case as she nonchalantly just brushed is off. I was desperate to keep her from leaving my life so I desperately begged her to stay. 

More time passes of me constantly obeying her orders and she tells me that she is moving away for college. When she went to college my communications with her went to zero. The occasional ""Hello"" or ""WYD"" text, and if I am lucky I get a call from her. She sounded happy, but I could help but feel like something was off. Recently when she came back from her break, I found out that she had cheated on me 5 more times with different people. This was the turning point. Every time I would confront her about why she is doing this or how she feels, she always says ""I don't know."" So I told her to think about it. When I came back to see her after I left to take her sister somewhere, she was talking to some other guy and completely ignoring me. So I left to find out that she has blocked me on all social media and messages. I did drive her up to a corner and she had enough. I can't help but feel like this is my fault. I now feel lost. I gave up everything for her and made her my priority. I blame myself sexually as well as it may have been a cause of her relations with other men. I don't know what else to do with my life. I feel like I have nothing left. Did I make a mistake? Was it completely my fault? What should have I do so that this never happens to me again?

827,"(Throwaway) I work for a large organization with a weird culture where people tend to be open about their health issues. If someone emails in sick, they usually mention symptoms, like they have a fever and cough. Or someone will say ""I'll be out at a gastroenterology appointment this afternoon"" as if anyone needs to know. I *hate* talking about medical stuff at work. I'm basically a healthy, athletic guy but I have a couple of ""invisible"" chronic conditions that have cropped up in my 40s. They don't affect my job performance but a few times a year I have to take sick days or a couple of hours for doctors' appointments (all entitled paid time). It's not frequent and I use my days off for appointments when possible. But after I get back from the doc, my manager will often ask ""How did it go?"" Or she'll indirectly try to find out why I took a sick day, like ""Did you have that cold that's going around?"" I have no idea how to deflect those questions from her and others, given the culture. If I'm evasive or say something about it being nobody's business, she'll probably think I'm rude or seriously ill. In the past I've said my doc appointment was ""Fine, thanks"" but I hate that because it's nobody's business whether it's fine or not. I think the way I look arouses curiosity, like what could be wrong with this healthy strong looking guy and why doesn't he spill his guts about his symptoms like everyone else.

828,"I'm 22, the girl's 25 and her stepbrother's(further on written as sb) 33, they both live together with their parents under the same roof. Few years ago I met the sb for the first time, even though he was older than our group we'd still be able to get along with him as one of our own. During the years, he'd help me out during troubles, as so would I for him. Yet the more I knew him, the more strange of a person he looked like. Being 33 he still lives with his mum, most of his salary is being wasted on slot machines, he has a child with an ex that he used to  beat up, his weekends are mostly either getting drunk or lurking around the city for some drunk chicks. Even though I knew all of it, I still considered him a friend. The issue arose when I started chatting with his stepsister, thanks to a fb game we both played. Considering she was a bit older, real beauty with a gorgeous figure, I always thought she wouldn't be willing to date me, so I just kept the chatter on a friendly level. It was all just fun n laughs, till the new years eve, when she texted me out of nowhere. It got me thinking, maybe she actualy likes me and that's why I straight up asked her. To my surprise her answer was positive, after chatting for a bit I just went to bed. The two following days after that, she'd always text me first,  she'd ask all these random questions trying to get to know me etc. Eventualy, she straight up invited me out to the movies and while at it to play some arcade games and a couple pints of beers which she paid for. It was a lovely night, as so the next evening we met again. During our second date we just walked around the park and enjoyed each others company, yet she had to work the next day, so I took her home early. The moment I got close to her place, her sb saw us. He was acting really weird and wouldn't even say hi to me. An hour later, the girl starts texting me in an odd fashion ""come pick me up, I want you"", ""I want to be with you tonight"" etc. Eventualy I realised it was her sb, and I called him out on it. To my surprise, he didn't back down, but straight up said he's been fucking the girl for years and I should just back the fuck down. Apparently, the only reason she went out with me, was to get him jealous and I'm no friend of his after going out with her. It left me in shock. I couldn't get the full story, since the sb had both of their phones in possesion. So I just layed in my bed the entire night without batting an eye, just thinking about all of it. At the evening of the next day, the girl was going out with a friend of hers and a bit later on I received a text from her, which included only her number. We started chatting the old fashioned way and eventualy she told me all about it. That they've been at it for a few years, at first it was fun, and joyous, but when she decided to stop it, the sb didn't take it lightly. He started choking, slapping, beating and eventualy raping her. Since that day, sb considered her his property. She isn't allowed to see anyone, has to ""borrow"" him money whenever he wants to, has to fuck him whenever he bats an eye, if she tries to resist, he beats her up and still rapes her. Her father is an alcoholic, that wouldn't dare to say a fuckin word. Her mother lives a few hours of drive away, yet if I understood correctly, her stepfather ain't better than her sb... She said she had considered going to the cops, but wasn't sure they'd believe her. If he doesn't get imprisoned and they have to keep living under the same roof, it will be the end of her. She's been begging of me, not to give up on her, to take a day off work on wednesday to meet her and talk it all out, while the sb is at work. If she's ever caught again going out somewhere, she's deffinitely going to suffer. I really want to help her, but don't know if there's even anything that I can do..

and has a barcode with the following numbers under it : ""041689483609""

again this info i am providing, can be found on a printed sticker on the outside of the box.

it is a matte dark blue lighter, has ""F"" and ""14"" at its base and the design is as follows: 

on side it has a picture covering about 90% of the surface 

the picture is the ""BACKWOODS"" logo, a picture of an old ship's steering wheel behind it (behind B and A of ""BACKWOODS"") and the phrase ""CRUISING AROUND THE WORLD"" beneath the company's logo. The background is a beige colour.

On the back side, there's an old ship with sails, still following the brown beige paper background.

Any information about where this lighter comes from, if it is worth anything and if it is an actual ""BACKWOODS"" product or just a personalized custom ZIPPO.

He started getting into general conspiracy theories and now spends hours every day looking at news and videos that confirm his views.

8 years ago he was alt-left, and 4 years ago he held libertarian views. He’s held views all over the political spectrum. He likes his black sister-in-law and a jewish family friend and he doesn’t know any muslims or gay people.

**My role**

So far I’ve been avoiding confrontations, mostly because my other brother (who has a black wife and kids) has confronted him and has broken off all contact, which I understand but I feel like isolating him is the worst thing we could do. Recently his views have gotten much more extreme and I don’t feel comfortable inviting him to family events. My parents are very mild and don’t know how to handle the situation. I’m sitting down with him soon, so I’m looking for ways to help.

**Strategies to help him**

I’ve been analysing why people choose to become racist and there seem to be 3 common factors: a lack of exposure to the group they hate, a sense of loneliness and/or a trauma. I think the first 2 factors are definitely present, I don’t know about the third. As such here’s what I’ve come up with:

\- Of course I want him to go to a psychiatrist / psychologist, but I don’t think he’s open to it and we can’t exactly force him.

\- I’m going to suggest he and I meet with people at the local mosque and synagogue, so he can meet and hopefully be inspired by muslims and jewish people, since he bases all his views on negative publicity.

\- I want to share articles of former alt-righters that have analysed why they were so hateful. Usually this comes down to “I was frustrated with life”.

\- I’m going to reach out to his mentor and suggest that my brother should probably find some healthy real-life friendships and work on a plan for that. Maybe go to a church since he preaches “christian” views.

\- Debating the actual views at hand usually doesn’t end well, as mentioned he spends almost all his free time viewing racist news and theories, any example or point I can make is usually countered by 15 of his.

I’d love some more input on this, and other suggestions on what to bring up during our talks. Thanks!",05Jan2020,1

OK so, I've known this girl for 6 years since high school. We ve been through every emotion ever, but nothing ever happened because we didn't know what was in each others heads. At the last year of school, before uni, she entered in a relationship with a guy (4 years older) and also mentioned he has alot in common with me. 

After that and being the lone wolf I was in my life so far (introvert of course) I decided there is nothing left for me in my town, I had enough and wanted to see more so I left and went across the other side of the EU to study.

After a year of not talking (except birthday messages) when I returned for this Christmas holidays, I took her out on a Friendly night out, eventually she made a move and expressed she always wanted me but didn't know what to say since I wouldn't do the first move, and she kissed me . I was so deeply exited I showed all the passion I was holding in so long. We justified it as I would be there for 2 weeks, we wanted to feel it atleast once, and we would never get a chance to be together in the same place to have a proper relationship as we would want. that's why it would be reasonable to keep the other guy (with whom she was in a break, short of). We both wanted it bad. Eventually she invited me home and came 'too close'. She said she wanted her to be my  first but we didn't go all the way due to stress, over excitement and lack of time. She then said she wasn't feeling well playing double game and even though she likes me as I like her, we should calm down because of the situation we were,it wouldn't be fair. We went on a very 'quiet', though, romantic movie date and we realised this wouldn't work no matter how bad we wanted it because of the obvious reason of distance.

I'm leaving in 4 days. I'll be back in a few months for next holidays and I'll see her one last time the night before,for a casual night at a pub.

It's the first time in my life I felt love/loved (outside of family) , heartbroken, suicidal and empty with an ever ending desire to get what I only got a taste of. Also the first time I questioned my decision to leave in the first place.

All I'm seeking is some words, advices and/or thoughts about all that.

847,"I recently graduated college (undergraduate), and in order to do so, I had to do a independent capstone project during my final semester. All of those projects get to be uploaded online to a publicly available database hosted by the university, so if people look up my name, chances are that my project report will appear along with it. I was bit overwhelmed with all of my other classwork that semester, and didn't get anywhere as close to what I considered a complete project by the end of the semester. As a result, I've always felt self-conscious about this and even embarrassed with the progress I presented at the end of the semester. Regardless, they still accepted it and I was able to get by.

Since graduating, I've been working more on the project and have finally reached a state where I would consider it complete. I'm considering to reach out to the university to include an addendum to my report detailing my progress since graduating for the database. I want to be fair to my peers who also had to do their projects, so I'm being transparent about what was done while I was still in school versus what wasn't, so my original submission should remain untouched, and all of my updates in the addendum. 

I've been having some doubts on whether or not this is worth it, though. I don't think anybody else has submitted an update before, and I feel that submitting an update is almost like a cover up of my own ignorance. Although I'm being clear what I did before and after the original submission, I'm not sure if I'm being selfish for wanting to post an update. Would submitting an update for my project be selfish and unfair to my peers?",05Jan2020,1

857,"this might seem stupid but i literally don’t have anyone to talk to about this. 

so basically i’m the oldest of 6 and this sister is the third child. she began acting violently at a very young age. not just normal wrestling like kids do. i have multiple memories of running away terrified because she was chasing me with a knife. obviously i tried telling me parents but i was a parentified child and it only made them mad at me. she would often beat up the smaller kids and throw things at them and i would get in trouble when i pulled her off of them. i never knew what to do because on one hand i knew i’d be blamed if she seriously injured someone (and i would feel horrible about letting it happen) or i would be punished for “ganging up on her”.

throughout our childhood her relationship with everyone has been very rocky. she was never punished for the things she did and the second oldest child and i was always vilified as the evil siblings causing her to behave like this. the only parenting that ever came was my parents telling us to stay away from her if we couldn’t get along. and i’d say that’s what everyone did. (well tried to do as she’d follow us and antagonize us.)

i do feel guilty because i’m sure she was lonely but i’m only four years older than her and had no power over her and yet was expected to raise 5 happy and healthy kids and i honestly did my best.

now i’m 21 and she is 17. she no longer chases me and the others with knives but now she’s really cruel with her words. she’s a very angry person and it’s hard to be around her because you never know what is going to set her off. you really just have to let her say and do whatever she wants and hope nothing escalates too far. 

i have a lot of examples but my most recent problem is that she keeps making horrible remarks about me being unemployed and missing a lot of my classes. i already feel like crap about these things and she just really pushes me to the edge. and the thing is she’s fully aware those things are because i have a chronic illness that caused me to be hospitalized very frequently from october to decemeber when i had a surgery redone to try and help the issue. (i’ve been applying to jobs and trying to work with professors to make up work and have last semester not be an expensive waste so like i’m doing my best.) 

so this is all to say i think she needs help. i don’t know what to do. my parents won’t try and correct her behavior so i’m concerned she’ll never have the motivation to change it. she’s had trouble making friends her whole life (because you can only be a doormat for so long id assume). she also expects everyone to listen to all her problems but gets mad and flips out if you try and vent to her. she also appears to lack empathy but i don’t think she’s a sociopath. i’d like to believe it’s just somewhere very deep inside her and with the proper help she can realize how her actions impact other people. 

i know i can leave the situation but that won’t help her. i’m really worried she’s never going to act any different and she’s going to have a very lonely adult life. our parents are only going to be around so long and obviously all us siblings are going to have our own lives. i’ll always be there for her because she’s my sister and i love her but i don’t know how to make sure she has people around her when she’s an adult

858,"Hey,

I am working at my current company as a customer support agent since almost 3 years now. During November of last year however, I've been given a great opportunity and started a 2-month long internship position in the marketing department (during this time I worked both with FB/Google ad campaigns, but mostly did CRM). The time is almost over and I know that the lead of the department intend me to stay at a junior position.

Point is, that a couple of weeks ago I've also had an interview for a junior live producer position and last Friday I've been told that the position is mine if I want it.

Honestly I have no clue what to do. I'm interested in both (I have a working knowledge of marketing campaigns and doing CRM allowed me to do some creative work with coding email templates which I loved) but in the long run I believe that the LP position might benefit me more in expanding my career prospects.

Financially speaking, the LP role comes with a substantial raise (50% of what I make now monthly), but is definitely more nerve-wracking, stressful and would demand me to be on call practically 24h a day should anything in the assigned projects went to shit. 
In the marketing position would not give me any additional money until I reach a ""regular"" position which usually requires up to ~2 years of work and, most importantly, it's quite (albeit not completely) stress free.

861,"I'm one of those fat people with a million excuses why not to lose weight. I hate it. I really hate my body right now. I can't buy any clothes I think are cute &amp; I feel gross so much of the time.

Pretty much, up through 5th grade I was more on the underweight side. Middle to high school I was at a great weight but dealing with a mom who shoved her toxic views on bodies onto me and made me think I was this 500 pound beast when in reality I was like 130 lb and very healthy. She bought me clothes smaller than my actual size and very vocally wished I was a size 0, and yeah overall super unhealthy attitudes. I'm sure she'd cry of joy if I developed anorexia. Now I'm actually overweight because in middle/high school I started getting this perception of ""I'm already fat and gross, there's nothing I can do, so I'll just eat/not exercise."" 

Problem? Literally every exercise ever is just... BLAGH I hate it. I can't stand organized sports. Anything with a ball I CANNOT do because I have a fear of concussions and I refuse to injure myself diving for a ball or something. I've tried throughout my life: soccer, tennis, volleyball, badminton. I cannot do ball sports. I'm a student &amp; can't afford a gym membership, but I also can't get over my fear of going to the campus gym (free) because my stamina is currently incredibly low and I hate the thought of all these tiny, fit peers seeing me enter, maybe get on the treadmill for 5 mins, then leave sweating &amp; panting. I've tried just following some youtube videos &amp; doing yoga since a yoga mat &amp; a couple weights are inexpensive, but the yoga mat hurts my joints and getting up/down is difficult. 

The sport I AM good at and love doing is lap swimming, however I'm in California and so all pools are pretty much all outside, and I cannot stand bugs and hate the idea of just completely submerging myself in dirty filthy water. I also won't go to pools where young kids use it for this same reason since I spent my childhood going to the public pool that was closed CONSTANTLY due to needing to re-sanitize the water from some baby shitting in it. I also hate the idea of anyone I know seeing me in a swimsuit and I hate my body and don't want to wear a swimsuit in front of people. I see all the time people calling fat people in swimming suits whales... :( So, currently for ideal exercising conditions, I'd need a private lap pool indoors where no one else can go. For clear reasons, this is impossible. 

I just... I need to exercise but every option is impossible to me. I just don't know how to get past these hurdles of excuses. I really hate my body and want to change it and get healthy. 

Note: I already eat pretty healthy for a college student. Not as much when I'm home from college, but at college I usually eat fairly healthy and drink plenty of water. So healthy diet is down. Main problem is I have a sweet tooth lol but not too bad. Main issue is I need to get up &amp; moving more often.",05Jan2020,1

868,"I met a girl out of the blue through a university sports club two years ago and eventually we got together a couple of times. I had no idea of her relationship status other than what she was telling me: that she had broken up with her ex-boyfriend, who we'll call Tom, somewhat recently and that they were on bad terms. The whole thing fizzled out between us pretty quickly after it became clear she was not in the right position to begin a new relationship which is completely fair, no problem.

It just so happens that Tom is a good friend of one of my good friends, who we'll call Oscar. There was actually a time one night where we all ended up being on a night out together with some and Tom and I agreed to squash any animosity between us (not that I had any!). I thought that'd be the end of it. I'm not aware of the inner workings of Tom and the girl's relationship since then but they have since got back together again.

There were no problems until the start of this year of university when Tom and Oscar started living in a house together and now I am essentially banned from visiting their house, ever. Tom is obviously slighted at the relationship (if you can call it that) that I had with his (now again) girlfriend... TWO years ago. It is just a shame because I am blacklisted from any occasions or parties at their house, which happens to be literally across the road from mine. I was really excited at the start of this year of living so close to these guys because I thought I'd be able to go round all the time or whatever.

I basically got uninvited from the birthday party of another one of the housemates (who I'm also good friends with, we'll call Josh) after Tom said he wouldn't be comfortable with it. If it makes a difference Tom's girlfriend was meant to be there. Wouldn't make a difference to me, I'd steer clear of both of them anyway. Oscar and the Josh were fighting in my corner but there was no swaying Tom apparently. They promised that it would just be this one time and any more events they host I won't be banned from. Well I hear they're having another party to celebrate end of exams and this time I'm not even invited! (I'm quite sure I would be invited if not for this situation).

I need another perspective on this. I get it, it's also Tom's house and he definitely has a say who should be allowed in, but on the other hand I have been friends with Oscar and Josh for over three years now, and I feel I have a right to see them and celebrate with them. It's a bit of a joke that two of my friendships are taking a toll over something that happened two years ago and meant nothing... it seems so petty. To me at least. It just kind of makes me resent Oscar and Josh a little bit because this dude is clearly making such a big deal out of nothing... That is just my perspective at least, that's why I'm asking for your perspectives. It's basically high school drama, I know, any advice? I want to know how to broach it with Oscar and Josh because they said this wouldn't happen again, you know? I've offered to have an honest conversation with Tom about it (which had to be communicated by my friends) but apparently there's no reasoning with him, he seems to quite hate me.

idk if she sent him something for sure because she told me she told she'll deny to the day she days and i asked just in case if she found nude sending as cheating because maybe she didn't or maybe im a dumbass who cant see the obvious and they both said nothing happened. he also said he could show me proof if she added him on snapchat again but she wouldnt because he would just harass her. i also don't think my girlfriend would ask for proof and shit and even say how long we were dating for is he previously didn't know and before this when we were together we went on his instagram live together and made fun of him and she even said do you remember me its ( insert my gf names)",05Jan2020,1

879,"  Alright, does anyone possibly have medical advice before I go to a doctor? Here's the scoop;
I overheat really easily - 70 degrees makes me red and sweaty, and activities like tying my shoe can make me feel like fainting sometimes cos I get so hot (don't get me started on physical labour).
  
I thought at first it was due to me getting used to the environment. I moved to ""the deep South"" from Northwestern Germany -- but that was many years ago. I'm an otherwise completely healthy, young (19M) person.",05Jan2020,1

I feel like I've fucked up. Because I didn't study as much as I should have. I pretty much wasted a lot of time because I was just finding my new life hard. 

Now I'm 2 days away from my exams of the first semester and I'm most likely going to do terribly in the exams. 
I don't understand why I have fucked this up so badly. 

I came here with a lot of hopes but nothing seems to be going as planned. 
I'm panicking now and really stressed about the future. 
I would like to fix my life and get better at it.

881,"So i was with this guy (m22) for 2 years in a long distance relationship. I did everything for him. I bought the flights always, saved all my money( i was workin, he studied and his parents payed). I took all my time I had to be there for him. If he was sad or he felt lonely I was there. I destroyed my sleeping times to talk in the nights to him. I waited for his texts every day. Cause I loved him. 
In the first months everything was beautiful. He was there for me, I was there for him. It was awesome. Then he went to visit his parents in summer and he changed 180 degrees. He became cold and sad. The last time I visited him (october) was so weird. He wasnt talkactive and as lovely as before. We were fighting a lot of useless stuff. The last night he started crying and told me that he's scared that I will leave him. And that he cant imagine a live without me. .. 

2 months later I'm here single. I broke up with him 1 month ago. He didn't talked to me. He didn't tell me I love u. Since I came home he changed his behavior. We called one time in a month... I wrote him I cant do this anymore  and he meant a call is not important. 

Well on this day he wrote me he still loves me. Then we didn't talked for a week. After this week I came and asked him if he's good and stuff. Then he told me the reasons why he changed. He said he lost much feelings for me cause of my behavior( I wanted to talk to him and be a part of his life and I guess this was to much for him?). Ofcourse I was so mad at him and realized that he lied to me since months. Well and then I became pathetic. I told him that I was pregnant but I did an abortion. (He didn't want to talk to me before I broke up so he couldn't know if it's true or not) I lied to him. I still dont know why I did this. Maybe because I was so much hurt and I want to give him the same feeling as I got from him. .. . And after i told him this he said some very toxic words and blocked me everywhere. And I'm not stupid. I can understand him very good. But I'm sad that he believed me this so easy. I would never kill a baby. I was just so hurt. but  I'm about to forgive myself for this lie, and I just wish that he will do it, too.
So it's one month ago since this happened and I'm asking myself how shall he know the truth if I can't tell him. Do u guys think he will talk to me one day? All I want it to clarify this lie. I asked my friend to text him that this was a lie but he sayed he dont believe this...

Haven't done much since high school aside from working part-time and taking a bit of community classes for a year. Two years ago we (myself, parents) moved from a home into a condo. My mom owns an IT recruitment business but she hasn't worked whatsoever since we moved, and has $12,000+ in credit card debt. My dad is a mortgage banker and he's been paying for essentially everything since we moved. 

I don't have much of a relationship with him and he often verbally abuses my mom/I over things that are very insignificant (Ex: he's called me a prick over asking when he was starting dinner) and he also never apologizes for anything. Recently he's threatened to abandon us if things don't change. On one hand I wouldn't mind never seeing him again due to how he treats us, but if he did follow through with it my mom and I would be homeless. 

I just don't know how to make myself more confident and like myself more so I can move on with my life and prevent this from potentially happening.",05Jan2020,1

893,"I've viewed multiple posts on the internet and videos and never thought I'd be making one of my own, but here I am. So I am a teenager living in New York. I'm not sure if New York City is the only city to do this but when one goes to high school, you choose a high school instead of other places where you just have a zoned school. Anyways I am personally very competitive and try to live to expectations of my parents who have thought of me as the smartest one in the family. For long I enjoyed this attention and it made me choose a highschool that had a good reputation, but what I thought would not be a hard highschool. ( Two applications made, one for ""regular highschool"" and one for specialized which is basically where you have to take an exam to get into one of the 9 specialized schools ) I chose the ""regular high school"" which is supposed to be one of the best ""regular"" high schools. I also chose it because it was closer to my home. 

I have now realized what I big mistake I made in choosing this and I feel overwhelmed by work. (It is worth mentioning that I play a lot of videogames, we are talking hours on end). I feel like I play too much and prevents me from doing my work, but games are what link me to my friends and is one of my few sources of happiness. Its like when people wanna live their ""high school/college"" life and party and hang out etc. That is my version of it. I feel like I can't play and keep up with work at the same time. I have had some personal issues just come up in 2019 as well and I feel like its stressing me out too much. I've had mood swings which have caused me to miss out on a total of 10 days of school already and I am wayy behind work as well because of it. 

I wanna ask my parents to transfer schools into a school even closer to me and I also know some people that I like there. In my current school, there is no one I trust or have made close friends with. I feel isolated and lonely at that school and I don't think I will be able to handle it. I have seriously considered if I have depression but I have been telling myself I don't and that all these emotions will go away, but they haven't. I feel like my parents might allow me to transfer but I've always been a shy/timid person and feel like they won't let me and will be ashamed of me if they do let me.

I really wanna switch schools because I feel like it is the main source of all my stress. I also use gaming to relieve all my stress as it makes me happy and I think that it may be one of the reasons I'm addicted and can't get anything else done. It's an endless cycle in which I am the only one suffering. As I type this I have a paper to write, chemistry homework, and other large amounts of homework that I have not done and it is just stressing me out even more. I feel like I should just stop trying and do nothing because that's how hopeless I feel. I have more emotions and things to say but I can't even express in words at the moment so I think that will be the end of this.

My final question is if I should just ask my parents for a transfer because again, I feel like school is the main source of my stress and possible depression. I don't really expect many to read/ see this but if anyone does thanks for reading. I am that type of person that always keeps to themselves and has trouble talking to others of my problems so just by typing this, I feel slightly more relieved.",05Jan2020,1

Past 2 nights they have been staying at friends/family and not in this property. I have tried to go no contact for this period and so did not respond to a good morning message today. 

They have now contacted my family whom they are not on good terms with, have been liking various posts about causing exes physical harm (as part of a Twitter joke format) and violent film synopsis, there is one instance of physical harm being inflicted upon me in the past (though, they iterate as a learned trauma response of a past relationship to stop me from restraining them (holding wrists) when they were causing themselves harm.)

They said they were worried about me and I replied I'm okay, the next thing I know my Mom calls to tell me they've been asking for my Mom's number from my brother - I have 3 missed calls from them, I get a message asking what they've done, that they feel scared to come home because I didn't respond, that they think I just want to paint them as an abuser now because I cheated on them (I haven't mentioned this to anyone) &amp; (this is hard because slightly true in part, I have not cheated, just fallen for someone else and broke off the relationship immediately when I realised this.)

I mentioned that I felt scared too and they just said ""Wow okay"" kind of thing, that I'm not willing to work on my own issues of ""infidelity"", that we should get a divorce counsellor (this is just a veiled attempt at getting me to go to couples therapy with them, I have absolutely zero desire to stay in this relationship), and I honestly feel scared about what they'll do or attempt to do.

Legally they have very little they can push against me with as contracts were all signed and they have (with evidence) been in breach of them on multiple occasions, but I am mostly scared of potential trauma I'll have to go through. I've done nothing wrong in any way, fully receipted, even down to emotional factors, so I'm not concerned about the outcome of anything there either.

I'm just scared of going through such a messy and tough break when it really needn't be. They're taking our animals when they go and that's hard enough.

Any way I can start to prepare for the worst to ease my worries? Or relief from this thought pattern?

900,"I have loved doing theatre/drama ever since I was little, so naturally the first thing I did in high school was audition for a show. Well, I ended up getting the lead, the show went great, etc. However, since rehearsal start ending later and later as opening night gets closer (for straight shows during tech week rehearsals can go til seven, and for musicals during tech week rehearsals can go til nine) my grades started to drop. While not too significantly, it definitely caused stress.

My school only does 3 shows per school year, and I was unable to do the second one because I had prior obligations to another show I was doing outside of school. Well now it's time for the third and final show of the year, which is always a musical. I weren't thrilled with the title that was chosen, but I still auditioned (auditions were in mid November). I got cast in the chorus, which wasn't too upsetting, I've done my fair share of chorus work throughout the years. Because I know what it's like being in the chorus, I immediately started stressing over the workload that comes with being in the chorus in a production this big. In the chorus, you have to learn almost all of the songs, usually you have to learn harmonies which I find much more difficult than learning melodies, and there's a *lot* of choreography involved in the chorus. Leads don't face these problems, they usually only have 3-5 songs, sing melodies almost exclusively and don't have to do much dancing. I do regret accepting the role but at the time it was something I thought I could handle. Turns out, it's not.

Now it's January and the show is about a month away. We're supposed to be off-book (know all of our lines and music) by tomorrow when we return to school. Usually I'm really good about this stuff, but I've just been so unmotivated to learn any of my songs, though I do have them vaguely memorized. I discussed wanting to drop the show with my parents in December, my dad supports whatever decision I make, but my mom, who's done plenty of theatre in her day, thinks that I need to stick with it, because if I drop the show, my director will think that I either can't handle being in the chorus and therefore can't handle a lead role ever again, or will just think that I'm butthurt about not getting a lead and I'm not a team player. The truth is, I just really don't want to do the show. It's a huge source of stress and I don't think that I'm in the right headspace to do a show this big right now. The only reason I would stick with the show is because I want to get cast in the future and I want to be able to hang out with my friends, though they've said they'd rather me be content at home than miserable with them. I also know that there are going to be a few others dropping the show, for similar reasons and also because there are a lot of first-timers here and our director is kind of an asshole that no one really likes and they're starting to figure that out.

901,"My (19M) gf (17F) is scared of her dad, as he has been getting more and more verbally violent with her as of late, including  an instance where he implied he was going to hit her if she continued to misbehave. Now, the misbehaviour includes doing stuff such as laughing at a funny joke, making comments/having opinions about topics which are different than his, and having been a victim of sexual assault (hes. He blames her over getting sexually assaulted).

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend feels like she is walking on eggshells around him, and is afraid of either being hit, kicked out, or both. He makes her feel like she's the biggest problem in his life, shows no love towards her, and seemingly regrets having her. My girlfriend wrote this to add to this post, which might help clarify the situation:

&amp;#x200B;

""I feel unsafe in my own home because my dad hates me and yells at me over small things. I believe he is capable of hurting me because he has done so to my brothers in the past. I don't know who to reach out to or talk to, because if my dad figures out I talked about this behind his back he might kick me out. I want to be able to leave my house when it's legally possible, but I don't think I have the resources to do so.""

&amp;#x200B;

What we need help with is to know who to contact regarding this situation. Due to the sexual assault, my girlfriend is already talking to a counsellor, as well as on route to getting specialized therapy. She will bring this up to them. We want to know if there are any phone numbers, emails, or places she can go to. I have already recommended talking with the police.

&amp;#x200B;

She has been previously threatened with being kicked out, and she has been told to her face that she and one of her three brothers are the least loved ones in the family by her dad. I am writing this post myself, as she is terrified over the idea of her dad reading through her phone and finding this, which is something he also threatens to do.

They are pretty upset that I'm not fond of the idea of bringing her to their houses on graduation day. I asked for a week at home by ourselves to enjoy our baby and new family, and set our own routines.


Additionally, it's her first winter, there's nasty bugs going around, and despite being strong, she's still only 2 weeks old and wasn't meant to be born for another 5 weeks! I'm particularly cautious about her thrust into tons of new germs at once at their houses (with cats and dogs), or public places.

Due to recent write ups I will look undesirable to other stores when they view my profile which prevents me from a transfer. I don't have a back up plan in regards to lining up work.   


I know financially how much I'll need to make per month to maintain bills. I personally don't know what my options are other than to quit my current one when It comes closer to an official move date and job search upon arrival.   


Is there away to land a job in another state prior to moving?",05Jan2020,1
916,"I’m a guy. I realize this is profoundly dumb, but I sent nudes to someone I met on tinder after only a few days of talking. We were swapping nudes and the “girl” kept pushing for me to include my face. I eventually sent her a mirror pic of my naked body with my face and now I’m scared. Using reverse image searching I found that the nudes the person was sending me was of a random girl and not actually them. Therefore, I’m 99% sure that the person I was sending those pictures to was a dude. This happened months ago and I have reverse searched the nudes I sent and have found nothing, but the fear of those pictures being posted somewhere is eating away at me, not to mention the guilt and shame of it.

But I'm also young (I only just turned 15 last year November) and I know I can still turn my life around before this has any longer lasting effects. (Or at least that's what I hope.) But here's my problem.

I could help myself get better, but I don't think I can do it. I have tried many different things for years and I'm still persisting but I can't help but feel that I'm only getting worse. So, I'm thinking I should get help. Like actual real professional help. But I can't do that, mostly because of my parents. I also keep up a happy/positive/optimistic facade at school and I'm really altruistic and everyone buys it and I'm at the very least liked by all who know me. And I just don't have anyone or the ""will"" to talk about it to any of my friends either out of losing that facade or them or maybe it's out of some other personal fears. So a thought that frequently comes to mind is to just try and make things or just let my mental state get worse to the point where it's apparent I \*need\* help to these people and I'll finally get it.

920,"Hello, I have posted about this from a legal advice angle but am now looking just for personal advice. 

I have an ex of years ago now who has attempted to follow my close personal (and not as close) friends on forms of social media recently, going so far as to contact their phones with text messages (I have copies) asking to be put in touch with me. This text thread begging to be put in touch with me was some months ago, and now this person has followed someone else close to me on instagram again today, all clearly in an attempt to find me, but done in a way that appears to be only legal but annoying. All attempts were blocked with the exception of one, who told him to buzz off. 

I know the ""best advice"" portion is to not reply, have everyone click block, and move on. Obviously, this person will keep trying, and I do fear escalation. What should I do to feel safer? Has anyone here been in a similar situation, and do you have any advice for how to live in the world without this crippling fear, or if there's anything you or your loved ones have done in a dicey situation like this?

922,"I hope this fits here. I’m 23F, and I’ve been with my wonderful BF (28M) for 3 years. I love him so much, he’s my best friend and we communicate and support each other and all that very well. We’ve talked about marriage before of course, but as a thing like “in the future.” We both agreed like a year in that we were ultimately looking for a life partner, and not just dating for the heck of it. 

The other day his mother mentioned to me how he’s been shopping for engagement rings. And it makes me feel panicky, and I don’t really know why. 

I think part of the reason is my parents went through a rough divorce. For as far back as I can remember they didn’t have a good relationship and finally separated when I was ~14. They still never speak to each other. It was pretty hard on my siblings and I. 

Another part of the reason may be that I feel really young still. I moved out when I was 18 into my own place and supported myself completely on my own and put myself through college, but I’ve been having a rough period the past few months and am back living with my mom (she’s charging me a HEFTY rent) while I try to find a good job in what I went to school for. She belittles me a lot for having to move back in with her and not having a job for what I got my degree in yet (despite me working full-time doing contract work and freelance on the side). My BF is amazing, and has a bachelors degree but doesn’t make that much money in his profession, so he can’t support both of us. 

I thought by the time I got married, I’d have my life together. I thought I would have traveled more, and would have a good job and a nice place of my own. I thought I’d know who I was more. 

Thanks for listening, reddit. I don’t really know what I want, I guess just to know if anyone has any advice or has ever felt similarly. I feel like I should feel excited and lucky to have found a such a great guy who wants to propose to me, but I just feel confused and lost and panicky right now. 

And yes, I am going to talk about this with my bf. I just don’t want him to think it’s because I don’t want to be with him. I do want to be with him and no one else, I just don’t feel ready for marriage at all and I don’t know why. The thought just scares me.",05Jan2020,1

I lay in bed all day, doing absolutely nothing. I go to school and recently joined the gym, but I never go out and don’t know how to make friends.

Does anyone have any tips for how I can build friendships with people? Whether it be at school/online/gym. I severely lack social skills, when people talk to me my response most of the time is to giggle (even when it’s in appropriate, trying to stop) or smile cause I have no clue what to say or how to keep the conversation going.

so lately i've been struggling quite a bit with anxiety and also some panic attacks and i'm afraid i might suffer from an anxiety disorder or something like that.

i still live with my parents and don't work so i don't really want to go to a therapist if it's not really necessary.

so my question is: would it make sense if i went ti my family doctor to see what they say about thr attacks and how i've been feeling lately, or would it be useless cause maybe they can't diagnose this sort of things?

929,"I need some advise on whether or not I should seek someone to talk to about this. At the moment I feel like my own mind might be making this all up to trick me, and I am not sure why.

I don't know how cohesive this might be, as all I did was write down the things I am experiencing that other people might not find normal.

I am a 23 year old female btw.

So I'm just going to copy/paste what I wrote:

When I am in public I am afraid of someone listening to my thoughts. At times when I believe I have spotted the person who can read my mind, I will spend a majority of that time ‘talking’ to them, trying to get them to leave me alone, and apologising for any thoughts they might have been disgusted by.  I have had this recurring since about 15/16. Sometimes I am suspicious of my friends being able to read my thoughts, but I usually try and talk to them in my head telling them to just tell me if they can.  This causes a lot of anxiety, fear, and guilt.

I believe if I look close enough at my surroundings I am able to make out the shapes of other dimensional beings.  I believe they do exist, and have since I was about 17/18.

I believe sometimes when I dream that they aren’t really dreams, and have a hard time sometimes distinguishing between being awake and dreaming, and vice versa.  Deja vu happens a lot to me, and this also doesn’t help this belief and reinforces this idea.  This used to happen to me when I was younger, and it has been happening a lot in the past year and a half.

I sometimes ‘see’ blocks of static in the air, for about 2 seconds at most, and I feel like that is something to do with the other dimensional beings. This began when I was around 18.

I have been hearing things I know aren’t there, mainly computer noises or phone sounds, and sometimes chickens (yeah idk either).  I frequently hear people say random words very loudly before I try to sleep.

I take 250mg effexor for major depressive disorder, and the last two times my depression worsened I felt belief in these things stronger, and they all negatively effected my depression. Each depressive episode lasted for about four months, and were about 8 months apart.

I have never really spoken to anyone about these things, as I feel people would think I am joking, lying, exaggerating, or crazy.

People know about my depression, and it gets really bad sometimes.  My last depressive episode, I could barely function I would end up on the floor sobbing because everything was so painful, like a terrible grief as if everyone I knew had died.

The reason I am getting concerned and think I might need help is because the other week I was just browsing the internet, and saw a sentence in an article that I felt was targeted directly at me - as in it was written as code for me to decipher, like a secret message. But I know that cannot be true because it was written by a stranger and on the internet for literally anyone to read.

I am worried if things like that begin happening more often, that my next depressive episode will be result in death because I won't be able to be able to tell what reality is.

But I am also incredibly worried that whoever I see will tell me I am making this up, and tell me I’m lying.

What should I do?",05Jan2020,1

931," I got into a car accident and got written 3 tickets for my first ever Accident(no previous bad driving record). The 3 tickets include using a dealer tag for personal use, no proof of insurance and failure to yield. The first thing I want to point out is that there is a bunch of false information in the police report like the posted speed of the road, the sketch of the accident etc. another thing is that the other driver was speeding because the road is 30 mph and the police officer put in the report that the other driver was going 40 which is a traffic ticket. I am also on a furnished auto insurance which means I can indeed use any car in inventory as a personal vehicle because I pay for that privilege. The police officer blamed me for the accident when the other driver proved to be speeding. What should I do when I go to court? 

(This all happened in florida) 

&amp;#x200B;

Also specifics on the accident itself. It was in December at 5:40 pm with overcast weather. I was attempting to make a left turn on a road with a total of 2 lanes when a car coming out of nowhere strikes me in the fender. I did have a stop sign and I did stop and look at both sides of the road multiple times before going on but failed to see the car due to the fact that the other driver had no headlights on and every other car did which caused me to not see the car due to the intensity of all the other headlights in the road.",05Jan2020,1
932,"Little background, I don’t have any family, have two people that I hang out with on nights out and occasion, but aren’t there when I need them they don’t want to hang out with me other than to have a drinking buddy, which I can’t be anymore, because I’ve given up drinking. I have no hobbies or interests. 

My world literally revolves around this one person. Unhealthy, I know, I’ve been told plenty of times before, I’ve been to counselling for four years but they tried to get me to love myself rather bashing myself for only liking one person at a time, so they didn’t really help with this side of the situation, they told me someone will love me for the way I am one day. 

The person that my world revolves around is my boyfriend, and my life hasn’t always revolved around him, I’ve been very happy single, capable of feeling confident on my good days, but seems that when I get into a relationship my focus points to the person I’m with, once again I know this is awful and unhealthy. I can’t distract myself, I just want to work on our connection every second and build a stronger bond every minute and I want to spend all my time with them, but I feel as if that’s maybe because it’s the only real thing I have. 

It’s hard waiting around when he’s doing his own thing, I try wait and distract myself from checking for a text, but I always go check. 

Has anyone been in this situation? And if so, how can this be reversed, I don’t want to be this way, it’s tiring and hurtful, and if this relationship is lost I know I’m going to feel so alone. 

Can anyone help please? I know this is unhealthy so please don’t dig at me, I’m looking to better myself.",05Jan2020,1
934,"Not sure exactly how to word this, but here goes. 

In the last few months, I've been trying to stop myself from falling into the 'incel' mindset. This is essentially guys blaming women for them being unable to get laid, or being unable to get a gf. My lack of success with women is starting to really bother me, and while I know it's no one's fault but my own, I'm having to fight off thoughts about it not being more and more. 

At the start, I would just dismiss them, and put it down to me not having much luck, and being on a bad run that'll end soon. It happens. However, the longer it goes, I'm having to stop myself justifying these feelings, which I know are wrong. 

It all stems from being rejected pretty hard, purely based on looks. We got very close over about 9 months, and when I got the courage to ask her on a proper date, was told along the lines of 'you're my best friend, but I'm simply not attracted to your hair colour.' This hurt quite badly, as it felt so insignificant to me, how can you turn someone down based on hair colour? People can be attracted to what they want, but it's getting harder for me to accept this and not blame her for something I perceive as minor. 

Moving on, I see good looking guys in clubs be arseholes to girls in bars and clubs, and not suffer any consequences for it. Even typing that makes me feel horrible as it's the 'chad' mindset that incels have that I laughed at for years, but am slowly starting to feel myself. 

Just a few days ago, and the reason that kind of made me make this post, a friend and his gf had organised a trip which would be them 2, me and my one of his gfs friends. It would have hopefully been a good way to break the ice by having other people there, and see what could happen. However, when it came to getting a date set for the trip, she just kept bringing up excuses, despite saying she was free all weekend the day before. It just feels like another smack in the face that I could have done nothing about, and I'm desperately trying to not let it get to me and move on, but I'm struggling. 

Again, I know these thoughts are wrong, and I'm trying to work on myself to help. I'm going to the gym, I'm starting the big next step in my career in a week by studying a new qualification. I've got back into a sport I used to play, and I'm trying to get myself to the level I used to be at it. I'm just worried these thoughts are going to consume me before I can snap myself out of it, and the idea of becoming an incel frankly terrifies me.

I go to school in Virginia, and my parents are worried that some redneck is going to murder me.

I regularly groom and I wear my beard very short, so while I do look Persian, I sure as hell don't look like a stereotypical terrorist.

She tells me I need a permit but wont get me the books to study. And I can't go there and get them because it's a 30 minute drive from here.   


My parents are stopping me from doing anything I need to. I can't get my bank account set up because I can't get to the bank.

More details below but you don't have to read

Most nights I feel so unmotivated I can't bring myself to do any of my hobbies, let alone my homework. It's jacking my life up bad and I just need a change. 

It's so hard to bring myself to do helpful ""self-care"" things such as exercising, doing what I like to do, talking to people, etc. It's like I go through a phase every day where I get so tired I turn into a vegetable.

I was diagnosed with depression around 2-3 years ago and I got over it for a bit but now, even though I cry less I feel like I'm mentally at one of my lowest points. I don't think all the specifics are super relevant but if you want me to elaborate I can.

One example, just to give you an idea, is that a lot of nights when I look at the clock I either cry or get really sad. No matter what I do with my time it feels like a waste.

I don't know, I've tried a lot already and it eventually got me out of my ""first wave"" of depression (talked to people, started new hobbies, talked to 3 doctors, exercised, etcetcetc) but this time it doesn't feel so simple.

I'm just in this stupid rut- I've lost most of my high school years to this, I don't want to lose my college years too. If you know something that might help please let me know.",05Jan2020,1

966,"I’ve been a good student in school, and I’ve never gotten into trouble before. I usually hang around the weeb anime kids or the nerds. We usually play around and are really close with each other. One day this kid who I’ve known for 3 years now,  takes my chips(he was in one of my friend group) so I took his pen and we play wrestle or whatever for this back. (This was before class and the teacher saw this, not thinking too much of it.) For some reason, the next day this kid tells me that he snitched on me. 5 minutes before, i go up to my “friend” and try to greet him how we normally do. By necking the other person. He knows this is our friend group ritual, has done this to me many times, yet grabs me and kicks me in the stomach, and it didn’t hurt at all. I walk away from the situation, and leave him alone. Later, the AP calls me and another friend (Guttu who had nothing to do with it). She asked us what happened before we went to her office, and we both say no.(we don’t know what the fuck is going on.) She takes him in first, and gives him ISS for the rest of the day. I go in next and she asks me about the incident. I told her my friend had a video and that she could watch to see I didn’t hurt him. (The whole time I was calm, because I figured I didn’t do anything wrong) She literally sees him laughing in the fucking video! She says that the other student said that I “hurt” him and gave me a three day suspension on the grounds of “potentially causing an injury”.I told her about the hallway incident and she said she’d “investigate” it. I told my mom about this, and she felt like the suspension was overkill, knowing my nature m, and the fact that I’ve never gotten in trouble before. The day I return, my mom goes into the office to view the video, and separately, I go in the period after that’s finished. The AP and her colleague say that my mom wasn’t happy. (Pretty vague I know). She doesn’t tell me anything about the video, and just says that I have another suspension for harassment. I figured he must’ve gotten fucking expelled then for literally fucking kicking me. Later that day, my mom says I’ve become a “bully” and tells me that I was never kicked. I was shocked, and told Guttu what happened. He said The AP and the kid who kicked me were very close, and that the whole situation was biased. That made sense, and I remembered all the times they talked. The whole 9th grade saw the kid as a snitch and a liar. I’m ISS everybody was suspended until the end of the week, even a kid who called the AP a bitch to her face. 

TLDR I got suspended for a week for “activity that could cause bodily harm, even though he laughed in the video, and harassment.” The other kid wasn’t suspended even though he kicked me in the stomach. The AP is friends with the kid who kicked me.",05Jan2020,1

968,"Throwaway, because reasons.

TLDR: How do I confront my boss, who is preventing my promotion because he feels threatened?


Longer version:
I work in retail and was promised a promotion as soon as I could train my replacement and receive training for the new position.  This new position would make me an equal with my current location's manager.  The promotion decision was made by people several levels up, but the finer details were left to our store manager.

At the same time, the store manager has been quickly declining in quality of work.  Due to a corporate-wide management shortage, he's pretty safe no matter what he does and he knows it.  The slack is being picked up by the employees who are motivated enough to make sure things run smoothly for everyone else.  It's getting bad enough, that they have begun to complain about him to his superiors.  To cover for this, he's been giving the most competent employees fewer hours, and employees that were near firing have been given close to full time hours, so that when things are left undone it's less clear who's at fault.  

Which leads to the promotion.  He purposely didn't schedule the person I was training as my replacement on the same shifts as me.  With shift swapping we made it work anyway, and on top of completing our normal duties that training was successfully completed months ago.  

Now scheduling my training (which is a months long process) is purposely being delayed.  The excuses given seem legit at a glance ""due to frequent call-outs, we can't spare anyone to go to training"" ""We need to cross-train people first""; but not at a closer look (the call-outs all arranged coverage for their shifts, the people he wants to cross-train are barely functional in the simplest positions, while he ignores requests from people who can and WANT to cross-train).  

It's been suggested that he's feeling threatened that I will take over his job.  He's unaware that I was going to be sent to another location.  However his own actions are making the directors rethink sending me away.  Basically he's creating what he's trying to avoid.

I'm not sure what to do, or how to approach him about this.  I've continued to be polite, defer to him and his decisions respectfully, and tried to smooth things over between him and my coworkers.  I'm a very non-confrontational person to begin with, and he's passive-aggressive and great at playing the victim.  I just want to get this training scheduled.  Any suggestions?",05Jan2020,1

I’ve started liking him as more than a friend over the past little bit and took an interest in him when I first met him (but dismissed it at the time). 

I’ve been thinking about telling him I like him but I don’t want to  ruin our friendship in the process. Am I reading into it?

Being gay is completely fine but it's grating to be called regardless. I hear whispers in the hallway about me. I've got very few friends and most are acquaintances. I moved schools last year mostly for fun but also to avoid some bullies. I know it sounds empty-headed to move schools for fun but I thought it would be fine. Since then I have lost friends, performed significantly worse in school regardless of trying my best, become socially awkward,  realized I have several learning disabilities, only one of which is diagnosed and I don't know how to tell my teachers. I think I started suffering from stress induced-hair loss because my hair is coming out at a troubling pace and my Mom refuses to bring me to a physician. I'm moving cross-state this year to a private school. I'm confident they'll kick me out for my poor academic performance, and I don't know how to navigate through this. I constantly feel an overwhelming sensation with every simple task I do,  I'm always afraid of new people I meet and I feel like I'm going to vomit when I go to school. I don't know what to do and I hope I can be given guidance here. I know it may appear as though I'm being petty, but I am so, so anxious all the time and can't help it.

973,"Two years back I used to talk to a girl (15 now)from my weekly scouts as a friend and ended up liking her and got the courage to tell her how I felt a year ago, she replied with “I don’t know if I do, that doesn’t mean I don’t” (and other stuff I forgot).

After that I wanted to forget about that and just carry on talking as friends. We used to send memes back and forth but it turned into mostly me sending them. And one day I asked her a simple “hows life” and got left on delivered, I got pissed off from that so I gave up trying entirely.

Quite recently (two months ago) before going out with a group of friends(including her.) her sister (17) told me in person that (the girl) wanted to talk again, I was fine with it since I wanted the same thing.

976,"A bit of background: In my apt building there is a woman who has a rescue dog; it seems the dog may have had a troubled past because she can be very aggressive, she’s also big and strong. The dog has gotten so much better over the years; but when she first arrived it was to the point where you couldn’t even pass her in the stairwell, her owner would have to hold her back and the dog would bark and try to lunge at you, and you’d just have to rush past. She even once bit my partner, a small bite, but STILL. That was like, 3 years ago? Like I said, the dog has gotten better over the years, less reactive and less hostile. She hates my dog, however, so there is always some trouble when we pass her, but nowadays if it’s just me passing her there’s no problem. 

Today my partner and I were walking our dog and we saw the dog from our building and her owner leaving the apt building. (What I sometimes do when we’re about to pass each other is I sneak to the road and walk alongside the cars, if its quiet, obviously). The dog didn’t notice us, and my partner and I were like, “wow, she really has gotten so much better!” 

Cut to: a woman across the street SCREAMING. The dog from our building had somehow gotten loose and attacked a woman and her dog. All I could see over the cars parked alongside the other side of road was this woman trying to run away, and then her going down and then all I could hear was wailing. 

I stayed with my dog, on the opposite side of the sidewalk, and my partner rushed over to see if they needed help. It looked to him more like the woman was just really shaken up, he didn’t see any blood, and the owner had the dog back in her control. We didn’t stick around or hover as it seemed the woman who was attacked was more scared than hurt and we wanted to get our pup safe inside, so I am not sure what happened in the end with the woman who was attacked. 

I’m not sure what apt the dog in question lives in, but I know she’s the floor above. Do I say something to the landlord? Do I leave it for now? Do I wait until I pass the owner without my dog, and ask her what her plan is? I’m torn because I can see that this dog has gotten so much better and that her owner is really trying; but at the same time I feel worried for the safety of myself and others. Any advice on what I could do would be really helpful.",05Jan2020,1
977,"Hi all,

Just got back from being overseas where I met a girl and we’ve been talking non-stop on fb messenger. 

From what I have learnt about her, she is literally my dream girl. If I could find someone like her in my country then that would be great of course, but I just can’t stop thinking about her. 

We are not in a relationship but I clicked with her personality so well, she is literally who I have been searching for, and I am trying my hardest not to put her on a pedestal! 

How do I manage this? I can’t keep on like I am right now, talking to her is so good during this honeymoon phase. There is little chance I’d be able to develop this into a relationship, and to be honest, being LDR would suck so I’d be hesitant to even do so.

980,"I've (M 21) been with my girlfriend (20) for a little over a year now and she's recently described the almost textbook grooming of her when she was just 15/16 years old by a guy who was in his mid 40s. He is one of her mum's friends, and he is still in contact with my girlfriends family to this day. They are totally unaware of the full story between the two of them, and my girlfriend is extremely adamant about keeping this from her parents.

She had mentioned she had had an older male friend a while ago, but only in passing so I didn't really clock at the time that there was anything malevolent going on. However just recently we were talking about it and she started going into details of their relationship. She told me they would spend hours at a time talking to each other at his flat, and would tell her that she special and was different from girls her age. She told me that they seemed to have so many things in common (I still don't understand how a 15 yo girl and a man in his mid-40s can have a lot in common). They would hangout a lot, drink together, smoke together, and take drugs. She told me she felt like it was exciting doing cool things with him and that he seemed like a really interesting person who was mature and I guess had life experience.

They ended up getting drunk when she was 16 and he fingered her in his flat, and he performed oral sex on her. She said that they didn't have PIV sex, but I honestly don't know if she was just saying that because she could see that I was getting visibly upset. If I had to bet I'd say that they did in fact have sex.

After this they continued to see each other, but it was the first and last time that anything sexual happened, and she continued to do drugs with him.

I guess she had some sort of realisation because she cut contact with him not a long while after, blocked him, and gave her younger sister a sharp warning not to go near him.

I know I mentioned I'd seemed visibly upset, however it wasn't like I was angry with her about it, it was more likely the forlorn look on my face that made her feel guilty about telling me. I've told her, very candidly that she was groomed and she says she understands it was wrong, but not that this guy is a literal sick  predator who should quite frankly be in prison (In my opinion hanged but I'm biased).

Ever since this conversation (about a week ago) I have moments of extreme sadness. I feel like I've failed as a partner sometimes, that I should have been there to protect here (bearing mind this is impossible since we are from different countries and met at university). I feel intense rage when I imagine him manipulating her, and said that if I ever meet him I will kill him (I was serious at the time, I've calmed down a bit since but I still feel anger). I just want to beat the shit out of this slimy fuck who inflicted this onto her.

If this isn't the appropriate sub for this kind of questions, can you please lead me to subs that is convenient? Thank you for your time.


English is not my main language so if there are things I wasn't able to properly explain, please tell.


I had a depressed childhood because of some mental issues, I frequently visited various psychologues pretty much all my life and it turned out I have some low level autism, very high iq, repeating intrusive thoughts and constantly changing, temporary fixations on subjects. My family praised my iq so highly that I subconciously put all my self worth in my intelligence and became avoidant of harder, commitment heavy pursuits as failure meant I might not be so intelligent after all and my mind went into hardcore ego preservation mode.


I was a fat know it all that repelled everyone around him all throughout the elementary school. In first year of highschool I went through a period of epiphany thanks to my psychologue. I've lost 30kgs, learnt French and English, started acting in a theater group, went to tournets abroad, read religiously and found my first and only girlfriend in the span of 4 years and I felt literally invincible to be honest. Then everything went to shit once again.


My then gf went to USA to study college which was financially impossible for me, I was able to get into a mediocre college to study mechanical engineering in my own country and I felt hollow inside thinking I've wasted my potential away. I tried to continue acting in theater and to find a new gf in first year of college but instead I've met heroin, spent all my time either high or ruminating alone in my room and dropped out of college, became fat again. I pushed everyone around me away during those 3 years, lied to my family, stole from them and almost came to the point of being disowned. 


Then later I went through another period of self correction. Got clean though a mix of therapy, meditation and reading, fixed my relationship with my family, re-enrolled in college, got 4gpa first year and transferred to a far better school, lost weight, tried another shot in theater but stopped going half way through because I became eligible to Erasmus exchange program and lived the last year abroad. Worst thing by far is how calm my mind was on heroin and how I now feel like I have to subdue my thoughts on a daily basis. And I feel worthless tbh, I feel like if I get close to people, let them learn about my past they will just realize how fucked up I am and will run away from me. 5 years age gap between me and my classmates doesn't help either so I cant relate to them most of the time.

(he doesnt have one of those so idk why i dreamt of that). but we ended up talking and i had some sort of thing that could help the bike move faster or something? it would be placed around the wheels and it had a chain on it or something. anyways, we were getting along and he was trying out the doo-hickies i had. the last thing i said to him before waking up was ""practice makes perfect, come by anytime if you want to try these out again"" and then he drove away. does anyone know wtf this means?
tl:dr: had a dream about helping out my crush with something, what does this mean?",05Jan2020,1
998,"So my sister is trying to put herself through college and has money problems and has been struggled to embrace her body as she isn't slim. I saw this program on Facebook where they pay you to lose weight. Should I recommend it to her? And if yes, then in what ways should I do it so that she won't be more self conscious and get mad at me?",05Jan2020,1
999,"
A few years ago I was going through some very bad issues with my mental state, I was depressed, completely alone and devastated. So I decided to look for online friends, just people to talk to. And basically by accident I met a person online and we instantly clicked. It was like a strong connection and bond that appeared out of nowhere. Before long, I realized that I am falling in love, and, well, it was mutual. Thing was, I wasn’t in the right place mentally to start a relationship, nor the circumstances of our meeting were right. We basically met thanks to one of those anonymous message boards of sorts where you post a message and look for friends or something like that. And that was initially my intention, I just wanted to meet someone for a casual chat because I was very lonely and nothing else, I also wanted to remain as anonymous as possible (I was telling things truthfully but I avoided giving away any exact details or ways of reaching me irl). Thing is, we are from the same city originally but I’ve been living abroad for a big chunk of my life so I also freaked out when I started thinking of how to make it possible without putting them off. What started happening was overboard for me to handle with the mental state I was in, I was not prepared to open up out of insane mind boggling fear, but I was just as scared of losing them because the moments when I wasn’t that scared were amazing.

Eventually as our relationship progressed, we met in person and everything worked out great. It was long distance, yes, but we made time to see each other once in a while. I started opening up more and everything seemed perfect. However not long into everything, we started having issues. Many of them came from my own insecurities. The anxiety that I experienced at first quadrupled, and some things that this person would say or do would trigger a crazy emotional reaction in me that would bring me enormous pain (while I am not sure they did it to hurt me or if it’s my own issues that caused it). I tried addressing these things to the best of my ability but it didn’t seem to work and things just started getting worse and worse. Eventually I decided to break it off, as it was unbearable for me to deal with. However despite that it wasn’t final. We would stop talking for a couple of months but then they would appear in my life again and we would try to sort things. And the scenario would repeat itself several times. We talk again, it’s great, issues, we break it off, we talk again. 

Last time I decided to break it off for real because I knew that I can’t be there for them and I could see that whatever is going on is putting them in distress, and I saw how my own behavior and our issues were bringing them down. I felt that what was going on was unhealthy. So I started acting like a total asshole then. I would say rude things, criticize everything they would suggest and in general being a fucking douche. It was horrible of me.  I thought that this attitude would turn them away from me for good and that if we separate for real it might help me and them as they also couldn’t let go. 

But, it didn’t work. Not only this “last time” made me realize how badly I miss them, how I hated myself for being this awful asshole, and that I might as well have lost the only person in the world who cared about me, I also finally saw how badly I hurt them. It broke my heart to see that. I didn’t want to bring them any more pain so I decided to stop saying anything altogether, so whatever we had passes. 

A couple of months went by and they sent me one last message saying that whatever “this” was is over now, as they want to move on and met someone else. I didn’t expect to be affected by this revelation so deeply. So basically what I thought would be the best for everyone ended up being a horrible thing to me. I genuinely want them to be happy and I expressed that in my final farewell too, but I just can’t let go of the fact that I single handedly ruined what was likely my only shot at being with someone who was there for me all this time despite all the difficulties. 

I realize that it’s impossible to bring things back to the way they were before, nor I want to put them through more whining and talks about it, especially not interfere with their new relationship no matter how I feel. I am a broken person and I wouldn’t want to ruin anything else for them. I know that the best thing for me is to try to move on, but I just can’t help but feel the worst kind of pain I’ve ever known.  I messed up really badly and now I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s like I had a whole bunch of chances to try to put whatever was haunting me behind, take a step forward, stop being such a douche and have this talk with them truthfully and not write my long story here, but I wasted all of them. Any advice on how I can move on and sort it out would be greatly appreciated. Thanks and sorry for my rant.",05Jan2020,1
