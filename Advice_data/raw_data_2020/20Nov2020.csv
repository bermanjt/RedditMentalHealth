I could hear everything through the walls like her saying no you have a girlfriend we can’t do this and then heard them making out in the corridor and saying they’ll do stuff later.

1,"i might go to college, might not. If I do it'll be for art. My school was too cheap/lazy to have more than the bare minimum of classes for online students. I'm in 7th grade and I just wanna get as much credits done early as I can, that way in highschool I can spend as much of my time on more important things, like getting a job or starting my own small buisiness. Problem is I'm from a low income household. mainly just living off of social security. We ain't got the money for the extra courses. How do I get the credits without having to spend the money? I'm normally an A's and B's student, maybe a few C's. This semester I'm super behind, but I'll be able to catch up before the deadline. how do I get the extra credits? I'm in oklahoma if that helps.",20Nov2020,1
2,"For background information, I (17F) am a high school student, so I still live with my mom. Also, I have a few medical issues that put me under the high-risk category for COVID, and I'm in the US in one of the states where COVID cases are rapidly increasing. At the beginning of quarantine, my mom was super careful about going places, letting people visit, etc., but at the months went by, she became more lenient about allowing my sister to go places and hang out with her friends and having people over at our house. Because of my school situation, I don't have any classmates that live near me, so I've barely stepped foot outside of my house since March (even if I had friends near me I wouldn't hang out with them because I know how dangerous COVID is). 

So here's the problem. Recently, she's been letting people into our house, even if they haven't been properly quarantining/social distancing. In the near future, she's throwing my sister a birthday party at our house with around 15 or so of her friends. She says that they're going to be mostly outside, so it's not that big of a risk, but I think that it would be best for nobody to come over period. I've tried to talk to her about letting people over and why I don't think it's a good idea, but each time I mention it to her she tells me to shut up and avoids the situation, telling me that she's the adult and I'm the child, so I have to listen to her. I have no idea what I should do. It's obviously really frustrating for me to be in a situation like this with no say in what's happening, especially since I'm the most at risk in our household because of medical problems. Additionally, I've tried pointing out to her how she's critical of people who aren't social distancing and keep continuing to party, but then she turns around and does the exact same thing. She gets mad at me when I mention that too. 

Any advice on this would be appreciated, as I really just feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.",20Nov2020,1
3,"My boyfriend recently approached me about the possibility of his mother moving in with us. This immediately put me on edge because even though I don't dislike the woman, I can't imagine actually living with her. 

Now, to put things into perspective, my boyfriend has an older sister who lives alone in the same city, but does not want to take in the mother because it would drive her bonkers. My boyfriend to a degree much worse than his sister, has major issues with his mother that has resulted in him moving entire towns away to get away from her throughout his life. Basically, the mother was an absentee parent while he was growing up, and when she decided to be a parent, he was resentful of her attempts since he was an adult and didn't need that sort of thing anymore. He has never been the type to spend more than a few hours with his mom at a time, because he gets seriously annoyed with her. 

However, with his sister not wanting to take in his mother, he is considering letting her move in with us. Like I said, I don't dislike the woman, but I never have been able to relax around her ever. Being around her puts me on edge. She has this ability to make someone question all their decisions and actions and undermine what they say/do/decide for themselves. Often times, she speaks down to people. Once, when she visited our house and saw my collection of books, she looked at me and laughed, saying ""You need to stop buying books. No one needs that many."" She is also very religious. I am far from religious, closer to a pagan, and worry that her incessant god-fearing wall decor will end up making it into our home. She's also a huge party-thrower, and I again fear that her constant parties and seasonal get-togethers will invade our home. 

She's never been downright rude to me, but she can be very nosy. She'll ask questions that she has no business asking, to the point of making me uncomfortable and my boyfriend having to step in to tell her to stop asking things. With all of these things, I'm just worried about how she will affect my daily life in my own home. I'm afraid I'll be unable to relax or do what I want to do with her around. Am I being unreasonable for not wanting her to live with us? I just feel that his sister should consider a little more flexibility since she actually lives alone whereas we are a couple living together and honestly would have to make a lot of changes for her to live with us.",20Nov2020,1
4,"But he’s head over heals for me. He’s a really good guy but growing up no one ever pushed him to do good things. he smokes weed all the time, drinks all the time, and doesn’t do any school work. I just don’t see him going anywhere in life, and i want to be with someone who will go places. And I’m okay with people drinking and smoking, but it’s the fact it’s everyday, even at work. I also don’t see myself with him when I’m older. I’ve been having these thoughts that it would be best if we broke up. I see other guys and think that maybe i would be happier with them, then my actual boyfriend. I know he deserves better, and to be with someone who’s also in love with him. But when i think about that it gets me so sad. I don’t want to do life without him. But i think i could be with someone better, someone i click with, someone I’m actually in love with.

My biggest issue is that both of my sisters emotionally batter me and it affects me very greatly. I’ve never gotten along with my older sister, she despises my personality, and always nitpicks my actions. My little sister looks up to her, and often follows suit. My parents turn a blind eye because they don’t like that their kids are fighting.  I am not going to change my personality, but it is hard to cope with the negativity.

10,"TL;DR need to reply to a TF about a deadline I exceeded by TWO WEEKS and never informed them

Hello!

I dropped out last semester due to a severe mental health episode. I'm doing well now except I still have trouble writing papers. The academic office is well aware of my situation. I also communicated to all my professors during the first week -- save for one class which I joined quite late so never got around to it. As irony will have it, this is the only class I messed up BIG time. I exceeded the deadline for the first paper by five days and never wrote to them but they were kind enough to give me a mild penalty as I briefly explained my situation and promised to not repeat it. 

HERE'S MY PROBLEM:
For my second paper, I again exceeded the deadline by two days, emailed my professor for an extension; he gave me three days. I then slipped into a cycle of oblivion &amp; denial lying to myself everyday that I'll finish the paper and now it's been TWO WEEKS and I still haven't submitted it. I again failed to write to them because it makes me feel so ashamed and vulnerable I just sit mum. 

My TF emailed me yesterday. I'm very close and need just 1 more day. But I have to respond and I'm so crippled by shame at this point I don't know what to write. So any suggestions on how I can approach the email will be much appreciated.",20Nov2020,1
11,"I suffer with manic depression but am mainly ok so it doesn’t affect me as much as it does other ,so not complaining but I was recently dating this girl (20) me (18) she had heard stuff about me from her relatives friends that they heard in school years back , mainly just saying that I was somehow a serial “womaniser” to quote them , I have never been someone like that , she asked me about this before we started dating and I told her it wasn’t true and not to worry ,she believed me and it was fine I stayed in her house a lot and she stayed in mine it seemed all fine , she had been fine with me then randomly the next morning she had removed me on everything ,not blocked but removed from followers and she sent me a text saying please don’t contact me again . I guess she heard that stuff again as she also said to my friends girlfriend to stay away from him who stuff was also said about , it was a brief relationship so I’m not devastated or upset but I feel confused by the whole thing I was never anything but nice to her and although I could ask her by text or phone call I’ve chosen not to out of respect for myself , I feel like she didn’t have the respect to ask me about the situation or lack there of . I’m worried about her mental health and I hope shes doing well , but even if she works this stuff out I don’t think I can date her again based on lost trust because she obviously didn’t respect me . Even more confusing is hours before that she had been texting a friend of mine saying how much she loved me and shit like that . I’m very confused but not upset so I’m just going to let it go , my problem really is I’ve had a kind of anxious feeling since like terrible guilt despite me knowing 100% I couldn’t of done anything like cheat or say anything bad about her (especially in lockdown). It’s only been w couple days since and after the first three days the seemingly everlasting anxiety about the situation eased but then began in spurts whenever I thought about it I’d start hyperventilating and having what I think is panic attacks (despite me never having anything significant in that manor before) it’s eased again but I still feel guilt . But I also 100% know I treated her as well as I could .

I’m also really scared of getting myself involved in something that will result in me being in pain.

We went out and I broke up with them (months ago) but we seem to have developed a closer bond since then and I’ve been regretting it more because I feel so in love. They are all I think about and they hint to wanting to be with me too but I can’t fully tell.
Part of me wants to go for it and the other part wants to keep my walls up and just leave it.
I’ve had such a horrible year with family deaths and world problems (u all know those ones) so I don’t know if I should even think about romance but god dammit I think this person is the most beautiful thing to walk the planet even if we do argue and annoy each other.

I wanted to tell her - which is to late to say now ofc - how much i cared about the friendship, and that hooking up was dumb af since we so good friends, and i was the 2nd guy ever... so a bf type of thing is all she know of. 

She is probably one of the funniest and most badass girls i know... but after she broke up with her bf, a whole new side of her was shown. I had no clue she could take a Full 180 turn and be suddensly so sugar sweet, shy and Way to clingy lol. Litterally the last week we spent as fwb she both wanted me to eat with her mom and gave really passionate kisses the middle of the Day etc. Just super touchy. i knew the friendship was absolutely fucked. It was to much really, and not what i agreed to.  She just agreed to ‘my terms’, of being fwb with no feelings, which she couldn’t.

I remember thinking ‘This is not gonna end well’ at the end, and it didn’t. Rn i’m thinking; sure we’re gonna talk to each other again... but wondering when this Will go back to normal, if ever? And should i let her be the first to contact? She have dm’ed me tho, since. if we’d parties we were both invited to and she had asked me where i’d been, since i have went to other parties.

Hi,  


About a year ago, I started developing an impulse to just pull out my hair. I didn't do it in order to hurt myself, or because I wanted to feel pain, or because I hated my hair or something; I did it because it felt kind of good almost. Like, scratching an itch or picking at a scab or something like that. And I just couldn't and cannot stop. It could be individual strands or small clumps and as a result I have a few bald spots that are fortunately growing in.  


Why am I doing this? Why did it start? What can I do about it?

Okay so I need your honest opinions. Am I an asshole for making my mother-in-law and teenage sister-in-law get out of my house even though my MIL seems to be struggling and we're in a pandemic? 

So about 2 years ago, my MIL's lease was up in her apartment. She was super stressed and said she didn't want to sign another lease because those apartments were expensive and she would rather get a house to accommodate her dog. But, she was running out of time and had no where to go. I live in a 3 bedroom house (tiny, but perfect for just my husband, daughter and I) so my husband brought up the idea of having them live with us and having her help with some bills while she was able to save up money and find the perfect place for her, my SIL and the dog. 

Well, about 3 months in, she stopped helping with any bills or  paying any sort of money whatsoever. I didn't care much then because I knew she wanted to save up money for a new place. Well, then I started realizing the dirty dishes always left on the stove. And the clumps of dog hair and muddy dog prints left all over my floor. It felt like I was always cleaning up after them. Not to mention, the shower in their bathroom was leaking, they didn't say anything for who knows how long and one day I found it spewing water and my dad had to come rip out the wall. They didn't pay for anything. We payed for all the materials to get everything fixed. They didn't even help clean up any of the mess after my dad fixed everything. I'm not saying they needed to be maids or anything, but I work 12+ hours a day. At least fucking help a bit and sweep the floor.  Or take out the trash! 

Also, we had had originally planned to have my SIL and daughter share my daughter's room. My dad even refinished her ENTIRE bedroom set so it was cute and they could redecorate together. Yeah, shortly afterwards, she slowly started pushing my daughter out of her own room and now she sleeps with us and my SIL has the room all to herself. Going as far and decorating it the way she wants it. I even bought my daughter cute fairy lights only to have my SIL take them down about a week later. I didn't wanna be a bitch so I just kept my mouth shut. I hate confrontation. 

So this entire time my MIL was only working part time. She was always complaining that she didn't have money for anything and couldn't save up. 
Then COVID happened. She was working very little. And I was laid off for about 3 months. I never asked for money. We were fortunate enough to have some savings scraped together. 


This has put a huge strain on my marriage and I don't even like leaving my room on my days off. I avoid them whenever I can. It just started bothering me that we had 3 peoples stuff shoved into a room and I didn't even feel like it was my house anymore. So I told my husband in September that they needed to get out. 

He kept pushing the dates back. First he said they'd be out in the beginning of October. Then on Halloween. Then middle of  November. Now they said they supposedly signed a lease. (ironically, the same apartment complex they used to live in that they said was too expensive) 

I know my MIL doesn't have any money saved up and can't afford that apartment. 

So, am I an asshole for making them get out knowing the situation and seeing how were in a pandemic??",20Nov2020,1

37,"My roommate and I are both on the same dating apps. She’s constantly making connections and going out on dates. While none of them have turned into a boyfriend yet, she usually has a good time and i see it’s definitely boosting her confidence.

When I go on the apps, I get matches and messages, but the conversations either get so dry where I feel like I’m the only one putting in the effort, or the guy just keeps talking to me without ever asking me out. I don’t get the point of being on the app if you’re not trying to go out on a date or at least a virtual one. I considered asking them myself but I don’t want to seem desperate and my roommate never has to do that .

I’m 19F and my Bf is 20M (we’ve been dating 4 months) I’m the first girlfriend he has ever had plus the first girl he has ever kissed and I know he’s so insecure about that but he hides it well he’s such a good bf though like he loves spending time with me often gets me little gifts if I’m a bit unwell plus always there for me as well when we had sex for the first time he as he put it “knew he probably wasn’t gonna last long” so he did other stuff till I was satisfied and then stuck it in 

I’m decent looking maybe 8/10 the only problem is I’m freakishly tall bieng 6 feet(180cm)  my bf is 6”3 (188cm) and being such a tall girl always made me insecure like I’m taller than a lot of guys but he loves that I’m so tall and even calls me “long legs” 

But I’m afraid he can do better and now that he actually knows how to kiss/please/flirt a girl like he’s really smart funny and has a well defined body

As well I keep screwing up and I’m afraid I don’t deserve him cause if that like a couple weeks ago we were sleeping in the his bed together in his dorm room and when I woke I realized that I had bleed into his sheets plus there was some on him i remember basically crying and apologizing and he was so comforting like he he just hugged me while I had my breakdown then he gave he some of his cloths and towel and let me take a shower and also asked me what brand of tampons to get me while I showered 

Even worse yesterday we went to a party and I got a bit too drunk puked all over him when he carried me to his dorm room washed me and went to sleep with me I puked over him again so he washed me put me sheets on his bed and went to sleep again now when I just woke up he didn’t seem mad at all  he seemed his usual self just a bis hungover too

I can't deal with it anymore and I'm so tired of it. I just want to be better. I promise I'm really trying :( I've been on Prozac, Remeron, Cymbalta, Welbutrin 150mg, Welbutrin 300mg, Welbutrin with Zoloft, Welbutrin with Cymbalta, and now I have to take Welbutrin 100mg twice a day with Trintellix. I've forced myself to get out of bed, I got a job, I've cleaned my room, I've tried to journal, I've talked about how I feel, I don't talk poorly about myself anymore, yet I still feel so horrible. I feel guilty like I've chosen this; like I'm just lazy and I'm making up excuses. But I really just want to get my work done and be happy. I told my psychiatrist and therapist I've considered being committed because I just can't handle this anymore. They're monitoring me for PTSD at the moment, but I'm unsure of if I have it.

No one even checks up on me and all the girls I've ever liked have not once started a conversation with me unlessthey needed something from me. I found someone who was truly amazing, we got super close in such a short time and I thought I had finally found my ""person"". I was wrong.

However, this really made me realise that there's truly no one out there for me, I'll never find 'the one"". I never felt this way about someone before despite my many previous attempts and I know I will never feel that way about someone again and even if I did it would be pointless because I am not lovable.

It seems no one likes a person like me, I'm just there with no purpose at all. The worst part is that I won't be able to forget this girl.

I took her shirt off and was messing with her boobs when she unzipped my jeans and stared to touch my penis. I told her I wasn’t ready to have sex yet and she said ok but wanted to make out more. We did and eventually she took my hand and put it on her vulva and asked me to finger her. I did for a couple of seconds until she said stopped and she wasn’t ready. 

I said sorry and asked if I did anything wrong. She said no she thought she was ready and it was ok. I put my shirt back in and zipped my jeans and she did the same. She said she wouldn’t say anything she she made the first move. I did ok kissed her goodbye and told
Her I’d see her tomorrow in biology class. Well after I thought about it I realized I shouldn’t have gone that far and regretted it.

53,"As context, I grew up in an environment where relationships weren’t even acknowledged as a subject, and expressing to your family that you had any feelings towards a guy was unheard of etc.. Paired with parents who were also very strict in the general sense (never going out places etc, being driven around literally everywhere and only being out for a few hours at a time, no sleepovers and such) I had zero experience romantically and sexually. Furthest I got was talking to some guy who ended up asking me out to which I explained how it wasn’t possible because of my strict parents.. two days later he posted a photo with his new girlfriend. 

So last year I started college and my best guy friend that I met there was confiding in me that his relationship was basically over (they discussed breaking up before college started but he suggested they give it one last try). Fast forward a month lol or so and he tells me he likes me. When he said that I realised that I’d had unaddressed feelings for him too. One thing led to another and we ended up having sex. It happened so fast (my first kiss was with some other guy literally the week before) and I was overwhelmed with guilt, but also extremely confused since he was my closest friend there. I immediately told him I regretted it and that I will cut any contact with him because it’s not fair to his girlfriend and I don’t feel comfortable with my horrible actions. He kept messaging me and told me he wanted to break up with his girlfriend, that he really likes me etc. and I don’t know how I was so stupid but I started seeing him again. He broke up with his girlfriend a couple weeks after we first did anything. My emotions were all over the place. 

Over the christmas holidays I couldn’t see anyone since I don’t live near them and me and him started talking more. He started saying he really wants to be with me and I told him that he should probably stay out of a relationship for a while to process the end of his long term relationship and make sure he’s comfortable with himself etc. and see things from a clear perspective, but he insisted he was ready. When we got back in January he asked me out and since I had warmed to him again over the holidays I said yes. We’ve been dating since, but I feel so ashamed about the fact that I slept with him when he was still in a relationship. I can’t get that out my mind and it’s been a whole year. I feel terrible and I’ve lost respect for myself; before, despite any insecurities I might have had, I had the comfort of knowing I was proud of my values and personality. Now I can’t say that anymore and I don’t know how to right it. I’m starting to think maybe if I broke up with him it would help me move past and distance myself from that terrible decision and start to better myself to make sure something like that never happens again. The thing is, we’ve already sorted out living arrangements for next year and I’m living with my boyfriend and one other friend.

back in July I turned 16, and my online friend gave me a visa prepaid gift card. I thought saving&gt;spending so I bought an amazon ecard with it so I could just have it join my 1600. 

I didn’t know you can’t buy a gift card with another gift card.  instead of just canceling my order, it made me lose access to my entire amazon account 
 
it would ask for the billing statement of the visa card (but it’s a gift card and that’s not possible). and when I explained everything to customer service (I did like 15+ times, they said they understood and that they ‘knowwwww’ the amazon specialist will give me access again. ) but they just send the same email “we were unable to verify your ownership of the visa ending in xx” 

it’s weird. even the last digits of the visa they’re asking for changes. i dont care about the card or anything btw it was $25, and I did spend it! I ordered essential oil from Walmart. 

It’s my amazon account that has $1600 in the balance!

Hi guys, this may seem pretty trivial but not really sure where to go from here so just thought i'd try getting some advice.

I have a very good family, dad and mom love each other, provide for the family. Dad retired maybe 5 years ago? Mom is a housewife and has always been caring for the family. I've started working myself but still living with them, planning to move out in a year's time.

What started irritating me was that my Dad would never help out with the chores, all he does at home is read the paper, watch netflix. My mom will be the one doing the cooking and washing. I'll help as well because I don't want her to be too tired, but it really annoys me that my dad doesn't help out.

We've talked to him before about helping out, but he claims that when he tries to help, my mom isn't happy with his standard of cleaning (He is pretty relaxed about cleaniness - while he isn't dirty, he's the kind of guy who wouldnt bother about re-wearing a 2 day old t-shirt).

It really annoys me because he claims he wants to help, but to me, if you really wanted to help, you would learn to live up to my mom's cleanliness standards and clean the way she wants so that she would be happy for the help, as I have done.

The thought of my dad being a bum probably irritates me as well. It's gotten to the point that I dislike talking to him. I'm closer to my mom so usually i talk to her.

Honestly my dad is a pretty good dad. It's just this notion of pseudo helpfulness he tries to portray when he's actually not helping - that is pissing me off and making me abhor him. Any idea how to go from here? Or is it just my unrealistic expectations.",20Nov2020,1

Last month i broke up with my girlfriend who i was with for a year. She was my first proper relationship so i was devastated. My step mum helped me get over it and made me feel better about myself. She took care of me and assured me everything was gonna be fine. I stayed with her for 2 straight weeks during the holidays and it was easily the best 2 weeks I’ve had in a long time. 

Here’s where it gets a bit complicated though. As i spent more time with my step mum i started developing feelings for her and i think she might be developing some for me too since we flirt. A lot. 

My step mum and i aren’t related by blood and there’s a lot of sexual tension between us. Would it be weird if I pursued a relationship with her or am i just overthinking the whole situation?",20Nov2020,1
71,"This is gonna be a long story typed up on my phone. Here it goes. I’m scared and don’t know what I’m doing. I used to have really poor mental health which distracted me from real life. I had anxiety, depression/suicidal tendencies, an and eating disorder. I’ve put a lot of work in the past couple of years and I’ve finally come out of it for the most part. But now that I’ve created a routine. I don’t know who I am outside of the illness. Like I honestly thought I wouldn’t be alive this long. I thought I would’ve killed myself by now. I’m freshly 21. And I want to do something with my life. I just don’t know what. I’m in school. I’m pretty sure for the wrong thing. I don’t have a relationship with my parents. So I don’t ask them for help.(they were abusive growing up) I really hope this makes sense. I know it’s really rambley and stream of consciousness.  How do I find myself? I feel like there’s nothing to my personality. And I keep trying to find out what I like. I’m just lost as person. Fml.",20Nov2020,1
72,"So, there is this situation. My friend is having this issue where he is stuck between two girls, one being his ex (We’ll call her Kayla) one being his current girlfriend (We’ll call her Jade.)


Basically his ex had randomly just disappeared due to her father cutting her off from all communication, and my friend (Let’s call him Nate) got with Jade after months of little to no contact from Kayla. Kayla had contacted him saying that her father had cut her off from communication via online (this was a long distance relationship.) and later broke up with him due to not being able to talk to him unless she was at certain places. 


A few months later, Kayla comes back fully online. Nate is still with Jade but admits to me and Kayla that he still loves Kayla and that Jade is not the best for him. Easy solution right? Break up with Jade. Turns out Jade is a crazy bitch who pulls knives out on him and is psychotic; tries to commit suicide on Facetime, etc. I told Nate to get this crazy bitch out of his life and go to therapy. Kayla told him to get therapy for Jade and then break up with her if it was not working out, then get therapy for himself. Heres yet another issue: Jade doesnt want therapy. She thinks she’s fine.  This situation goes on where Jade finds out about Kayla and goes pyscho on Nate, constantly asking him if he loves her, telling him to get rid of Kayla and eventually suggesting a poly relationship. Kayla and Nate both denied the poly relationship. 


Later around January of this year, Kayla leaves. It was due to her own mental health declining because of this issue and Jade constantly stalking her instagram and sending her death threats. Then, the only issue was getting Jade’s mental health back up. Which Nate lied to me about..saying it was fine when she actually started to physically harm him over trust issues and her thinking that Kayla is still around. She also continued to stalk Kayla’s art account on instagram on several accounts; requiring Kayla to switch accounts twice. This was around May.



Now, Kayla comes back and situation pops up again. Nate wishes to be with Kayla, but can’t leave Jade because she’ll go pyscho and possibly kill herself if Nate leaves her. Nate has said he wouldn’t be able to live with that, having to let Jade kill herself just so he could get what she wanted. I keep telling him that this bitch is crazy, and that she can fend for herself if she can pull a knife out on someone she “cares” about. Nate’s health continues to decline and there’s been situations where Kayla gets on calls with him where he is having a mental breakdown. 



I need some advice on what to tell Nate to do here because I have no clue myself and neither does Kayla. If you need more information to lay out a proper answer, just say it in the comments.",20Nov2020,1
75,"I’ve had a rough few years and this year I hit rock bottom. I feel like I’ve failed and feel like a loser. I dropped out off uni because of mental health. I’m currently looking for something to do before I go to uni next year but I’m stuck In a grey area. There are no jobs in the area and I’m stuck at home. 
Please help I just need some advice and guidance.

My situation if anyone can be bothered to read: 

I’m 19 years old and the last two year of my life have been the worst . It all started in November 2018 when I broke my wrist, after this everything went bad. 6 weeks after this my dad had a stroke, after a year of follow up appointments was then diagnosed with a neurological disease. 2 days after receiving a disappointing a level result which left me feeling like I had failed myself, My mum was then diagnosed with cancer during 2019 on top of this my Nan has cancer that started spreading to her spine. While all this was going on my grandad who had previously had a heart attack was having heart problems also. I would see my mum every week after intensive chemo curled up on the sofa tired and drained. Both my parents are caring, hardworking and strong people, and I just wanted to help them but felt so helpless as there wasn’t much I could do as a 17/18 year old in full time study. This was mentally draining for me, I already suffer from anxiety but worrying about the health of my family sent me into a period of depression late 2019/early 2020. No one around me knew what was going on, I hid everything from everyone and kept everything to myself because I don’t want to put my problems on anyone else. A girl came into my life who convinced me to open up to her, every time i spoke to her I felt guilty as I didn’t want to feel like a burden to her but she insisted. This helped for a while and helped ease the depression. She gave me a glimmer of happiness. She convinced me to tell my parent what was going on as apparently it was important they knew what I was going as I was having panic attacks and severe breakdowns. I’d say I was just about surviving, I missed 20% of the school year as there were days that I just couldn’t get out of bed. I’m quite naturally smart so I never really struggled with the school workload which was lucky for me.
Then COVID Hit. In the beginning, to me this was a blessing: no exams, a quick lockdown, time to relax and breathe, and I’d be able to travel and go on the holidays I had planned with my friends. But of course it didn’t turn out this way. A few weeks in my dad fell ill with the virus, he had it quite bad. One night he blacked out while going to the toilet, luckily my mum found him and called an ambulance, he was take into ICU. The doctor said if he had been found any later he could have been dead. It took him a few weeks to recover. Things seemed okay for a bit. Then my other gran fell ill with the virus and unfortunately passed away, this news was heartbreaking for me and put me in a bad way. After a while however things started improving once lockdown had eased. I started doing things with the girl who was there for me and i fell in love, we hang out loads went on trips together and in august I asked her to be my girlfriend. She’s the best thing that’s happened to me in 3 years. 
I got my a level results A*AA, and went off to Exeter to study economics. But I got there and it was not what I was expecting. My anxiety was triggered and I spiralled in a bad way. In 3 days I had 10+ panic attacks and made the decision to withdraw from the uni. I was not mentally ready for it this year, especially during a pandemic. 
I spent time at home trying to recover and heal, I hated myself for dropping out of uni, I felt like a failure and a disappointment to myself. I don’t know what to do with my life and I became panicked. It is only now that I have become well enough to start getting myself back to normal. I’m getting help from a therapist. But I’m struggling to find a purpose; I have always been a winner in life and achieved but for the first time in my life I feel like a loser. I lack purpose. I’m looking for work, something to do but this pandemic has rendered that close to impossible. 

I just need some advice, some guidance and a purpose.",20Nov2020,1

To sum up my original post. My girlfriend has been texting her ex a lot and planning FaceTime chats behind my back. 

I decided to confront her and asked if she still had feelings for him which she responded with “ no” after that she said she was hurt because I didn’t trust her and questioned me as to why I would ask that.

 The other half has been empty. Last weekend young collage students moved in. (I’m a 22 year old collage student myself they are like freshman collage age)The first day I went and asked them to turn it down during the day cus of my bfs migraine. Everyday we can still hear their music but it isn’t too loud. Tonight there’s like 7 of them in their driveway with the car doors open blasting music. And the car is like 5 ft from my bedroom wall/window where I have my hedgehogs who arnt a fan of loud sounds. It’s only 8:40 so is it too early to ask them to turn it down? They wear collage modes having fun in their new home but it’s becoming annoying I moved outta the city because how loud it was. 

One the first day when I asked they apologized and from that day forward it slowly got louder again. I’m unsure what to do if they keep up that pattern as I don’t want to get cops involved, but it’s getting annoying when I’m getting distracted from school work and now have trouble sleeping and end up having to sleep during the day.",20Nov2020,1

My main issue is my relationship with my parents. They're trying to have control over aspects of my lifestyle that really have nothing to do with them (eg my gender expression, what I'm going to do with uni, being in a polygamous relationship) while being very hurtfull. I understand that from their POV they're trying really hard to help and push me away from bad decisions but they're actually actively making it all waaay harder for me. It makes me feel like I have no real control over my life which is what got me depressed in the first place. During the quarantine I started having panic attacks again, losing hair and sleep.  
I've tried explaining this to them and how it makes me feel numerous times to no avail. I know that all they see is dumb teenage rebellion that is going to ruin my life. They've told me so.

I need to get some of you guys advice on something I just found out. 

I hosted a sleepover with 3 of my best friends. We all drank I barely drank (bc I not good and drinking it), and they all drank a little not too much. It was a fun time everything was going great. We then we went to my living room and slept on the couch in front of the tv we all woke up and everything was fine. 

But today I found out that one of my best friends actually molested my other best friend at my house when everyone was sleeping. 
(I will call the victim Bella and the other one B.)
Including bella (she woke up during but was so scared). B knew bella drank a bit so I think that is why she did that.  
Bella then went to my bedroom (we were in the living room). And billed her eyes out. 

I did not know this all happened until today. she didn't want to tell me until now. B hasn't been a school since then. 

What do I do now bell said she doesn't want to make me not be friends with B anymore if I still want to be but it remains she really wants to get past it is seeing her reminds her of it. 

B has a a lot of family drug and mental health problems and I feel back cutting her off I don't want to trigger her to do anything because we were a friend group. And now B will have none. 
 
But at the same time I would not want to hang out or be friends with someone capable of this.

The problem I'm facing as mention in the post title is with a Coworker at my job. I'm in my early 20ies, a highly ambitious man with a pretty good managing job that I started about a year ago, which was well deserved with prior experience.

Since I started working this job, I had a more experienced colleague, let's call her Emma, she's about 40+ yo, career oriented, excellent in her job, she's actually incredibly great at what she's doing, and without any mistake. I learned a lot from her, but since the day I came to the office, she doesn't let me show my skills or ideas to the team leader or other company stuff. 

She always takes my opportunities or exposes my mistakes to everyone around. If I see an opportunity for a task, she grabs it ASAP even if her regular tasks will suffer because of it, but she will not let me get it. As well as she exposes my bs mistakes that I would accept and correct. Instead of saying: ""Hey colleague, you made a mistake here, better fix it!"", she says to our team leader ""Hey, he f*cked up, he's not that good with the job, but I'll fix his mistake, he can do some basic job instead.""

And it annoys me a lot, I lost motivation for this work even if I love it, what would you do in this situation?",20Nov2020,1

I'm a first-year student looking for housing in second year. I have a group of 3 super chill people.

However one member says A is at the high end of their housing budget and would much rather go with B to save money. My parents told me to offer to cover a decent chunk of the difference (probably the majority of the \~130/month or so difference) just because the quality difference between A and B (in terms of location, extra washroom, space) is so substantial but they told me that their parents would not approve of this arrangement I guess on principle.

Today, as a had a mental breakdown in my car, I realized I am literally a terrible person. I have manipulated, used, and neglected my friends, family, and my own wife! 

I’ve also been doing this since I was 16, I’m 23 now. And everything something doesn’t go my way. I either go high and mighty or play the victim card and flash my depression around.

I even confirmed it by going to “A Terrible Husband” and read “9 signs you’re a toxic person”. Guess what?? I do all 9!

I really should sound so cheery, it’s heartbreaking actually. I vilify people who act like me, yet here I am. 

I need to be honest with my wife. I need to tell her how fucking awful I am. What horrible things I’ve done.
She really deserves better and while I know she loves me more than life itself, I’m not good for her. Not in the slightest. 

I am just scared. I don’t want to hurt her. I love her to death and I can’t believe I betrayed her like this...

89,"Hello, this is my first post here so I apologize if it's not of the best quality, not really a common Reddit user!

I've been dealing with some pretty heavy mental health issues relating to anxiety and depression for most of my life which I won't be getting into heavy detail but have for the past few years only gotten worse and have really impaired my ability to function as an adult, maintain self control and any routine at all really. I am getting psychological and psychiatric help (which have helped a lot) but ultimately most of the struggle is for me to do, not for others to do for me.

I find myself struggling to maintain any sort of constant routine or muster the willpower to do most things unless I am actively pressed by someone to do them. Maintaining a job, finishing my (extremely behind schedule) education or really doing the basics like keeping my home clean or my facial hair shaven is becoming very hard to keep track of and actually do and I keep forgetting to do basic things like bathing or going out to buy things I need.

I am thankful to have a supportive family and a girlfriend with way too much patience, but I just find myself in a position where I'm not really sure what to do at all, willpower comes to me only in short streaks that last at most a week before I burn out for months, and the things my psychologist recommend me to do (Like keeping a physical diary or day planner) don't seem to stick with me, as I just keep forgetting to do things and continuing to just waste time at the computer, phone, TV, or whatever other thing I don't really enjoy doing but do more to waste time.

I'm not very good with maintaining physical records of things, if anything I think electronic things are more helpful for me to keep in my mind for more than an hour. I also understand asking for psychological help on the internet is stupid, so that's not what I'm really asking, I just want to know what sort of advice I can get about maintaining routine and order both in my life and inside my head when having to deal with anxiety brain only thinking about the short term.

EDIT: Following the automoderator bot's message here's some extra info I forgot to add. I'm a 21 year old male and as said above I am undergoing psychological treatment.",20Nov2020,1

She had me begin working months before my first semester began, and it didn't take long for me to realize there is something off about her. She actively told my colleagues I was ""not qualified for the job"" (the same job in which SHE hired me from tons of other applicants). Which essentially led to me working significantly harder than my coworkers to solidify my place at work. She's become increasingly reliant on me, promoting me to a higher position without extra pay.

So no, I am not missing data. Every day she finds a new way to insult me and slow my colleagues and I down. From throwing out a thesis draft we have been formulating for a year, to having me work until 3:00 AM for projects unrelated to my thesis. This all peaked immediately after she found out about my PhD applications. 

What should I do? Some suggest I leave the lab w/o the masters if I get into a good PhD program, but stepping on a well-known scientist's toes is not a great idea. Thank you in advance.",20Nov2020,1
100,"Hey, I'm an Onlyfans creator and over the last year and a half, I have been posting videos on the website to generate an extra buck here and there. I started my Onlyfans around July 2019 and only ever posted solo videos on there. In the meantime, I was seeing a guy (let's call him Mark) whom I had met in March 2019 and we probably saw each other four or five times from March through to June of 2019. Mark knew about my Onlyfans and we had talked about filming for it to which he seemed okay with doing so. I was always very upfront with Mark that I wanted to film with him and feature him on my Onlyfans and he was very chill about it and said something along the lines of 'sure'. 

Fast forward to June 2019 we're in his bedroom getting frisky and I ask him whether I could film and he says 'Yes, just don't include my face'. Easy! Meanwhile, I get involved with someone else and I end things with Mark and we go our separate ways. This new guy becomes my boyfriend and we continued the Onlyfans by filming with each other. We make a lot of money doing so and life is good. In August of 2020, I clean out my camera roll and find this video I had filmed with Mark. I had completely forgotten about it and remembered that I asked him whether we could film and he said yes so I posted the video on my Onlyfans.  

About a month later I get a call from the Victorian, Australian police saying I've been charged. Mark had taken out a restraining order on me and accused me of revenge porn. One of his friends subscribed to the Onlyfans and saw the video, recognising Mark's chest tattoo.  I was shocked and confused. In my mind we had agreed that this video would get posted - however, the police said that there was no written agreement and that this case is my word against his. The situation also looks bad for me as I posted the video more than a year later after ending things with Mark. Mark had told the police the video was only meant for the two of us and not to be shared around. In one part of his statement to the police he said he had no idea about the Onlyfans but in another part, he seemed like he knew for a while. I have screenshots of Mark threatening to show my parents my Onlyfans In August of 2019  - so solid evidence he knew that I had one. But that, I don't think, has anything to do with this case. I'm being accused of revenge porn and the way Mark is pretending like we were dating and loved each other throughout this whole thing is really making my situation look grim in the eyes of a courtroom. 

I am being asked to go to court on the 8th of December and I'm not sure what to do. I've called a lawyer and they'll be in contact with me. 

I Just need Law Reddit to help me out. What do I do?",20Nov2020,1
101," 

I'm 25 and I'm a woman

I've been married for almost 6 years now. Anniversary coming up in January. Lately my husband's drinking problem has become more out of control. We have a good marriage. He's extremely supportive, kind, generous and loving when he's sober. Not too long ago my father in law passed away from cancer. RIP. This made my husband's drinking problem exacerbated. Totally understandable. But the problem is, he's not a happy drunk. He's very emotionally (NOT PHYSICALLY) abusive. He'll scream 1 centimeter away from my face, basically touching, at the top of his lungs. Stupid arguments, little things not even important enough. Like if I close a window wrong, play a game wrong, if my mic on the computer stops working. I'm walking on egg shells. The other night there was a problem with my mic, we were playing a PC game, as we do. He got mad because I just told him to let it go, its ok. But that made him angrier. Long story short, I was on the floor in the corner, being screamed at, very closely, I was spit on. He told me he wants a divorce, told me he would be happier alone.... I didn't take this seriously because he says this same thing LITERALLY EVERY TIME he gets drunk and mad. It's just happening a lot, I am getting used to this behavior. But I don't want to. For other reasons that I'm not going to go into detail about we very rarely have sex, almost completely don't anymore. It's about a health condition I have and when we have sex, it makes it worse... But even when we do it only lasts about 1 or 2 minutes and then as soon as he's done, it's done. that's it. Not trying to go into anymore detail about that but yeah it's fucking terrible.

Lately, I've been reaching out for emotional support, but I always hear the same thing. ""If you're not going to leave him then I don't want to hear about it""

I'm so sick of hearing that. I just want someone to listen, not fix it. Advice is always good but not like that...if you call that advice...

One person specifically I have been talking to is someone close that me and my husband talk to online every night, a man in a different state, across the country. We'll call him B.

B and I are friends but, like many friends wives have that are also husband's friends, they see you more as your husband's property than one of THEIR friends. They won't go to far to actually be YOUR friend because the other relationship comes first. And I'm not complaining about that it's 100% understandable. However B and I got really close. He flirts with me sometimes and I flirt back. I'm not proud of this but he's across the country so I don't really see the harm. I know flirting is cheating's ugly cousin. I get it. I'M NOT PERFECT. But B admitted he has feelings for me and I said the same. We had a um.... inappropriate video chat. That's all I'm going to say. Although I feel incredibly guilty about it I'm not going to tell my husband and relieve my conscience just to feel better. He's grieving I basically cheated. I am a terrible wife. Loneliness is real. And although I've never met B in person I still feel like what we did is just as bad as sleeping together. I have been praying for forgiveness. Yes, I am a Christian, just a VERY IMPERFECT one.

I reached out because I felt emotionally abandoned and at times, very unsafe.

i HATE playing the victim, and i know i am. It's been so hard to seek advice and reach out. It's been so hard to talk to anyone about this. I have been fearing being judged and being thrown out like the dirty rotten person I am. or at least that's what it feels like.

I love my husband. I love him so much.

I just feel so alone. It feels like he doesn't love me anymore.

I want to feel like everything's ok again.

What do I do?

He won't go to couple's counseling, he won't go to AA, he won't try to stop or slow down with the drinking.

and B won't even talk to me too much anymore, even though we both agreed to put everything behind us for the sake my my husband. We both said we care about each other but now he's trying so hard to burry those feelings he doesn't treat me even like a friend any more.

Am I a terrible person and wife?",20Nov2020,1
102,"For background, I used to be what was called a ""gifted child"".  
At age six, I was a very wide reader and knew many things that a usual 6-year-old wouldn't know. At high school, I was almost an achiever, I would always make it to the honor roll of students every year. But ever since I got into college, I have never felt the world turn itself on me this bad.  
For reference, I am studying a medical course.  
I only get enough to pass. If I'm lucky, I get high grades but this is very rare.  
What is the problem is that I often fail quizzes that everyone else finds so easy. I always study every day as every day there is always a quiz or an exam to be answered and yet, nothing I do seems to work.  
When my friends say ""how easy a quiz or exam is,"" I often find myself disagreeing.   
Sometimes, I agree, but then days later, realize that I made a mistake in the middle of answering and then it won't stop bugging me and then my sense of perfectionism strikes me again how I could have gotten perfect marks if I only paid more attention to that One Test Item.   
I feel so unbelievably stupid because this isn't even the first time that happened,

103,"So I've had my two cats for about 4 years now, both from the same litter. Ones male, the other is female. I got the female spayed and she doesn't seem to have the same problem as the male, which is peeing on everything. He's on a 3 month wait list to get neutered because I know that's the main issue. 
He seems to only do this more after we exclude the cats from sleeping with us, but I do that because they will pee on everything in the room at night if I don't shut them out. 
I live with my boyfriend and his grandparents so I need to keep the door shut at night regardless as they have a  noisy machine they run all night that helps her breath in the hall so his grandma can sleep.

I was just wondering what I can do or should do to stop this from happening as often. I have to literally clean my entire bedding every day and it's becoming a hassle.",20Nov2020,1
104,"So to start off my mom has not been the best parent and my dad was even worse. She used drugs when I was growing up and I still have issues with being alone to this day (about 8+ years ago). Might be abandonment issues I’m not sure. But she also became an alcoholic after she stopped using and still is to this day. She is a pathological liar and has many psychological problems. My dad got my mom addicted to drugs and used to abuse both her and I. He was also 30 years older than her btw (older than my grandparents). My grandpa came and got me when I was about 5-6 cause the state was about to take me away. As you may guess me and her don’t get along much. We have our ups and downs but I’ve honestly given her so many chances when she’s done wrong with me and the rest of the family. Just recently my great grandmother passed away. My grandparents seem to be trying to keep me out of what goes on with the family considering I found out the day after she passed by my mom. My great grandmother lived in a different state. My grandparents went to the funeral and my mom flips out because I couldn’t go. I am a college student and some of my classes require me to be in a meeting or else I will automatically fail the class. I also live on campus as well. She told me that, “I’m ashamed to call you my son”. She didn’t even go cause she said she had to watch the dogs. As I argued with her she said that I’m exactly like my dad. As my birthday approaches followed up by Thanksgiving, my grandparents most likely want me to come home. Personally I don’t want to go home because of my mom. But I’m honestly not sure what to do. I’m wanting to know if I’m the one causing issues/or if it’s ok what I’m doing. Also I’m not sure if I should just cut my mom out of my life for good or my family in general or just to keep it as is. Personally my mom is causing me so much unnecessary anger and stress. Any advice would be appreciated.",20Nov2020,1
105,"I’m going to start this off by saying I voted for Trump in 2020. I won’t go into the details because Reddit is Reddit, but it concerns a neighbor of mine. We’ve had some beef in the past, and after confronting him he’s stopped bothering me and my family. The other day is got a letter on my front door that was written by him, telling me to take down my Trump flag since he lost, but I don’t want to. He’s written letters since that have become increasingly volatile and almost threatening, and I’m scared he might actually do something that’ll harm my family.

106,"Sorry for the length, this is just a very detailed story and a lot of emotions are coming out with this one.

Background: I am a teenage girl and my teacher is a white male.

TL:DR our teacher pressured us into standing for the pledge. I can’t stand, but I can’t sit alone.

I have come to a revelation that I don’t agree with the pledge of allegiance, or what it stands for. I, as an individual, have realized that there is not justice for all, and I don’t agree with the content of it.

My Aquatics teacher is a “back the blue”, “ all lives matter” type, and is very adamant that we must say the pledge. With covid, my school does a hybrid group, where you come into class on certain days and if you don’t want to come in, you can do virtual school. My aquatics class has been dwindling in numbers. We started out with five students and last class (when our teacher figured out how to hook up the pledge to the PA system in the pool area) it was only me and my friend. When the pledge came on, we looked at each other and silently agreed not to stand. Our aquatics teacher, however, was not ok with this and raised his voice, almost yelling at us to stand for the pledge. We looked at each other and continued to sit, until we couldn’t take it anymore and closed our eyes and stood silently. Neither of us agreed with it and stood because we began to feel uncomfortable and pressured. Today, I came in as the only student in person. I didn’t have aquatics class today but I will tomorrow and judging by the pattern, I will be the only one there.

I know that I don’t want to stand for the pledge this time, but doing it alone will be hard. I want so badly to stick to my morals but it’s hard when I think about the consequences. 

In significant court cases, it was ruled unconstitutional to force a student to stand for the pledge, or punish them for not standing. But I know my teacher will get mad at me after I make my stand, or rather my sit. I worry that I won’t be able to control my emotions afterwards and land myself in detention for “blatant disrespect”, which could compromise my future. If I talk back, it’s disrespectful. If I don’t speak at all, it’s disrespectful. If I present my sound, personal opinions in a respectful manner without raising my voice or crying my eyes out, my teacher will disagree and call it disrespectful.

My gut tells me to stick to my morals and my brain tells me to comply; but I feel like years of having this drilled into me over and over are the source of my feelings to comply, making my gut even more reluctant. If I wasn’t the only one in class, I would be much more willing to sit, because I would know I have people supporting me. But going it alone is scary. I cannot stand for something that I don’t agree with.

What do I do? What do I say? For those of you who have gone through this, what was your experience? Please help!",20Nov2020,1

I have no issues with being confident and presenting myself as an outgoing person because that's genuinely the kind of person I want to be. The problem is turning an initial meet into a friendship.

Regardless of what the reason is, I feel like the fact that I can't connect with people is what is blocking me from creating a friendship. I always think ""how can I be friends with someone if I don't know what to talk about with them?"" Again, I don't have strong opinions, I haven't had have very many ""interesting"" experiences in my life, and that makes me think that there would be nothing to talk about.

Like what, that's pretty random. Anyways, I don't take it too seriously. I just told her ""no because that's pretty random and makes no sense."" She then tells me she'll just test it here. 

Now I'm busy with my work. I look over and she's looking down at a book, has her phone angled towards my phone as if she's recording something and then she's strolling on my phone. She's not even looking at the phone, probably trying to make it look like she's just going through the book. I look at her for about 10 seconds before trying to snatch my phone back. She closed whatever app she was scrolling on but I managed to see the camera app on her phone meaning she was recording something.

115,"So back in summer of 2018 I got falsely charged for a dwi in North Little Rock Arkansas. I was driving home late one night from Walmart and I got behind a car going 20 in a 50 so I started swerving to try to get him to speed up or pull off and let me pass him. 

I got a few miles down the road and got pulled over by the police the officer said he got call saying I was swerving he told me he never witnessed me breaking any laws so he asked me for my license and registration. He said if everything came back alright and I had no warrants out for my arrest he would let me off with a warning. 

But since it was called in over the radio more officers showed up there were about 10 police circled around my car the other police who showed up asked the original officer who pulled me over if he did a field sobriety test on me because they thought I was under the influence the officers started arguing about if I was under the influence or not.

after a few minutes of them arguing they pull me out of my car and make me do a field sobriety test and I failed 2 out of the three field sobriety tests because I couldn’t focus I was scared for my life there were so many officers circled around me. I told them I would probably fail the field sobriety tests because I was sleep deprived from taking summer classes in college and working full time i told them I had a final that next day and I asked them if I could just do a breathalyzer test but they didn’t have them in the patrol cars. 

After I failed the field sobriety test they threw me in handcuffs and put me in the backseat of one of the officers patrol cars they searched my car and called the K-9 unit to search it also after they didn’t find anything they said they were going to bring me into the police station to have me do a breathalyzer test after they realized I had 0 alcohol content they blamed it on dwi drugs and made me piss in a cup and took me to the county jail.

They held me over night after I got released I had to walk to my university from the county jail so I wouldn’t fail the final I had that next morning I arrived to the classes with less than 10mins to finish the exam I asked my professor if I could have extra time but she denied it I tried explaining my situation after I got done with the exam.

 I had a classmate take me to go get my car out of impound which overdrafted my account 300 dollars. I had several hundred dollars worth of groceries I just had to throw away because of they got spoiled in the summer heat after all of this happened I couldn’t afford to eat for several weeks which pissed me off.

A month went past and I had court for the false dwi I was accused of I had to leave my college classes early to be to court on time. I arrived a little bit early they told me just to go sit down in the courtroom and wait for the judge and everyone else to get there a few minutes goes past and one of the arresting officers came up to me and he said good luck I told him to fuck off he’s wasting my time and money by falsely charging me 

He got offended and pushed me out of the court bench he never said he was trying to detain me and I was pissed off living in the moment I pushed him back all the officers ran up in the court room they choke slammed and dragged me back to the holding cell they kept saying put your hands behind your back and quit resisting arrest but I couldn’t put my hands behind my back because of how they had me pinned down. So they tased me I went unconscious woke up in the holding cell coughing up blood 

The medical examiner eventually came back to the holding cell and took pictures of all my injuries she asked me if I wanted to go the ER because I was coughing up blood and I told her I don’t have health insurance so I told her I was fine in reality I wasn’t eventually the judge came back and talked to me in the holding cell and told me all charges are dropped and I’m free to go 

Once I left the courtroom I could barley walk from what happened my whole body was shaking and I was in pain I ordered some food and I called off work once I got to the restaurant to pick up my food I tried to take a bite of it and it felt like I was swallowing glass shards I wasn’t able to eat or drink anything for the next several days 

I ended up not going to work or college for several weeks over what happened trying to get some well needed rest I ended up getting evicted because I wasn’t able to afford my rent after all that bullshit happened I became homeless living in my car and I dropped out of college. 

Eventually I got back on my feet it was hard to find a new apartment to rent because my credit was fucked over that situation now that im finally getting back financially stable I want to sue the police over what happened but I’m scared of paying attorneys and not being able to afford rent again definitely with the COVID virus going around so many people are out of work do y’all think I should pursue this lawsuit l",20Nov2020,1

118," I’m  a 21 year old woman from Texas, and I’m really in a rough spot and  really honestly don’t know how to get out of this situation. I’m  experiencing some seriously awful fatigue and cognitive dysfunction  issues that are really stopping me from living life. It’s so bad that I  can’t do much of anything I want to do most of the time. I can’t force  myself to do anything, I can’t give myself commands- it’s basically like  being controlled by a puppet master that refuses to do his job. It’s  sort of “if I do it I do it”. It really is just like purgatory because I  can’t even make myself do fun things like go to a resale shop or play  video games or read books or ANYTHING- god forbid doing things like  cleaning or stuff. I can’t cook or clean 90% of the time and the only  reason I can keep myself clean or change clothes is just because I get  so itchy without bathing every day and being in the shower feels really  good and like a couple minutes of peace for me where I feel serene- but  most importantly I’m sort of thinking clearly and my brain is working  for once rather than this nearly constant state of agitated nothingness.  That basically means that I’ve got the level of angst over being unable  to work on my battle jacket or play Minecraft, that people usually get  over not being able to focus on homework or whatever. I desperately want  to do SOMETHING besides lay in bed with my brain barely awake but it’s  like every thought I have doesn’t actually work. I want so badly to stop  doing nothing and even go out and make friends but there’s some  insurmountable unseen force blocking me from even the most simple  things. I live with my parents but it definitely causes some tension  because I keep sleeping and don’t help out. I get so frustrated because I  hate doing nothing all the time. I believe in using every last  available second of my life to actually live and experience things. Let  me put it this way: the idea of being hooked up to machines in a  hospital and forced to just survive makes me distressed- it’s not  anxiety where it’s interfering with my life because I don’t have a life  for it to interfere with though. I don’t live in fear of that happening  because it’s basically already happened. Except I’m my own machinery  sort of. Something is blocking my alertness and actions so I’m living in  this purgatory, this haze that I just can’t break through no matter  what I try. I don’t know what’s causing it so I don’t know how to make  it stop. But there is nothing I want more than for it to stop, to just  be able to live again.

I know I  have major depressive disorder but none of the medications I’ve been  given by the low income clinic (I can’t make myself take any steps  necessary to get a job, and I can’t figure out how to get insurance,  either- so the low income sliding scale clinic is my only option  really.) have helped with the lack of energy and presence. They’ve  helped with the suicidal thoughts, but thanks to the problem of the  overwhelming brain fog (sounds like an understatement to call it that,  it’s more like having my brain trapped in a block of lead than just fog)  not going away the hopelessness and despair aren’t being kept at bay as  effectively as they used to be. And I just can’t get myself to find  another doctor to go to for some reason, someone who’ll actually try a  different course of medicine than add a medication every time I say I’m  still not feeling better, that doctor has me on 4 or 5 medications.  That’s in addition to all the stuff I’m taking for thyroid problems so  I’m having to take a ton of pills every day. Every time the doctors take  my blood it comes back perfectly normal, thyroid levels and all! It’s  really frustrating because I keep getting told I’m normal and I’m like  “NO. There’s something seriously wrong here! You’ve got to find it! Stop  taking my blood and making me take a fuckton of antidepressants and  just try something different!! It’s obviously not in my blood and it’s  obviously not depression related!”

Honestly  the symptoms of multiple sclerosis sound exactly like me- as do a few  other autoimmune disorders. I’m trying to see how to get the low income  physical health clinic (as opposed to the mental health one I previously  mentioned) to screen me for some autoimmune diseases and not just draw  blood and send me away then look at my goddamn hormone levels again and  tell me everything’s fine for the billionth time. Clearly, like I say,  something is VERY wrong since there’s no way I can function  independently and take care of myself here. And I have to find out what  it is and how to fix it before I lose even more precious sanity I can’t  afford to lose any of.

There’s  something that I’ve been desperately wanting to do that this is  preventing me from doing. Besides all my hobbies that seemingly became  suddenly forbidden for no real reason, lately I think that I’ve finally  formulated a life plan that would offer peace with not just the world  but myself. I want to just leave the rat race of society and the  obsession with social media and complicated shit, and go live a more  simple life. I want to go off the grid… well sort of- I don’t want to  live like a caveman and do all the outdoorsy stuff like a never ending  camping trip. I still want electricity and plumbing, and I still sort of  want access to computers so I can play with speech synthesizers and  listen to music. I won’t miss the Internet though- well except for  discovering new music, that is. I… I want to go leave the cities and  never play the stupid game of modern life again- and find a Victorian  steampunk alternative lifestyle thing to settle into. Like a village  where everyone lived like they did in the late 1800s, and we didn’t have  to leave, we could just rely on ourselves as a community. A little  oasis of Victorian life, almost like you stepped into a time warp or  something! Where my problems would then be so much more down to earth  and I’d enjoy being amongst people like me, in a rather close knit  society of people who weren’t so petty, and were more insightful and  resilient and really saw the value in simplicity and the little  pleasures of life... Where I would no longer have politics rammed down  my throat 24/7 with absolutely no escape, and I’d actually be given a  chance to just go at my own pace and be a more easygoing person… Where  sure I’d have to do more mechanical labor but I honestly feel like that  would be far more rewarding than the sort of lifestyle people today  live. I used to think this was an America problem but then I came to the  grim realization that while Eastern Europe is a little more traditional  and has a culture that would fit me better it’s still as much of a rat  race and too damn complicated- and I realized it’s a modern times  problem.

Unfortunately I realized that I’ve got two major problems preventing me from going and living out these dreams and having peace.

One,  I have no idea if such a community exists, or how to go there. I have  no idea if it’s even possible to do this and I really have no idea what  to look up or ask about to find leads to this.

And  two, my biggest obstacle, the fatigue issues I was talking about in  great detail earlier. I desperately want to do all this and have every  reason to in the world… but I can’t even rely on myself and take care of  myself as is. How could I ever make it in a society of heightened  independence and self discipline? That’s why I need this problem fixed  now, so I can go live my alternative Victorian lifestyle. (Just with old  computers too, is the difference.)

I  know this is just a jumble of words and thoughts and probably makes no  sense whatsoever, and that I sound like one of those “I was born in the  wrong era” people… but if just one person can get some meaning out of  this, and if someone can rescue me- or rather, can help me rescue myself  really- from this purgatory and angst, that’s really all I want.  Because then maybe being okay won’t be so out of reach anymore. Please,  somebody help me out of this purgatory and on the path towards serenity  and an actual social life. All that stuff has been really weighing on me  and I haven't really had much of anybody to help me through this. It  would be really nice to even just have someone to comfort me and make me  feel like someone really cares about me while I'm trying futilely to  kick my brain into gear and trying to find out how to start on the path  to alternate living.

Well, one week, he called me over to where he and D were sitting. D said I could work a day by myself, something I had been asking for forever. The condition? It was the 6 a. m. shift and W told me I would be ALL alone. I wasn't allowed to call or text either of them if something went wrong. And if something did go wrong, I'd have to call the boss. W said, ""Don't bother us.""

It all went well but I didn't care to explain the events of that day.

Long story short I 21F live with my aunt 40F and my long term boyfriend 21M, it has been this way for about two years. We all rent a two bedroom apartment together and everything is great. He and I both work in the area, but my aunt recently got a new job that is a 1 hr commute. After she got the job she informed us that the drive time was too much and said in a few months she would have to move, and we could either move with her or get our own place. She would prefer we all kove together, because we are a little family.

Here's whats stressing me out: all of those options suck. 

- He and I can't make it just the two of us. We both are shift supervisors at a big company and still don't make enough money to rent a studio in the area and still buy groceries, not to mention hours are down during the pandemic. We can't find anyone else to rent with us cause everyone is staying with their families. My aunt takes care of a bigger portion of rent because what I make in a day she makes in an hour. I know I'm in a priveledged position because of this. 

-I have spent the last two years building connections with the people in this area to get promoted to a manager. I just got asked to lead a community project where I work with every manager and store in our district, bringing me closer to upper management. Moving would mean leaving not just the project but the only common boss I would have would be a regional director who doesn't know I exist. My progress would be lost. 

We don't receive any kind of help from our parents, if anyone is wondering. 

I know I'm young and this is a time in my life where I have to toughen up and make a decision. I truly feel like I can't leave this area and all the support I have from the managers who are trying to put in good words for me. This promotion is the only thing I'm working towards in my life right now but I just literally don't have the money to stay. 

Can someone please knock some sense into me? Every option feels impossible.",20Nov2020,1

but here's my first issue: I still love him. and I know, I know, he's a peice of shit and I could do better and blah blah blah but I've thought about it long and hard and im ready to forgive him and possibly start over, even if it may not be a good idea. 

here's my second issue: its only been less than 24 hours and he already has a new name in his instagram bio. a girl I've never even heard of before, which means he's already in an entirely new relationship. and I am beyond fucking hurt. when I found out they were broken up I thought it was because he realized that he still loved me, but I guess I never even crossed his mind. and I know that should be enough to make me forget about him and maybe even hate him a little, but I guess the fact that he can hurt me so bad, both knowingly and unknowingly, isn't enough to make me stop loving him and waiting for him to come back to me.

Every time I start working on a majors requirements for a few months I start to feel icky about it and pick a new path.

I have no idea what I want to do. I know if I pick another route I will just pick another after that. The problem is I’m running out of time to finish the credits I would need to complete before four years are up.

137,"I'll make this as brief as I can. I joined a shared house in late September for my final year at university with 3 other people. We were all strangers to each other and moved in at the same time. Originally 3 guys, 1 girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 23, Housemate 1 is 28, Housemate 2 is 29 and the girl is 21. Decent enough people, no big deal with them. I've always had a strict no sex/relationships with housemates policy because there are so many downsides. Things can get awkward very quickly between the two, and for the two housemates not involved it can be isolating, especially if the relationship breaks down between the two people e.t.c

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, 1 week into the tenancy, the girl and Male Housemate 1 sleep with each other. Myself and Housemate 2 are naturally annoyed, but we move on like adults. No big deal, especially during Covid restrictions things can happen when people don't have much to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Housemate 2 moves out of the house for personal reasons 1 month and a half into the tenancy. A new girl fills his room. This girl is 20 and has a boyfriend. Last night, 1 week into her moving in, she tells myself and the other girl that she is attracted to Housemate 1 and feels guilty because she has a boyfriend, unknown to her at the time that the other girl had slept with him. The girl tells her she slept with him. It's not a big deal for the two girls it seems, they've been chatting away. However, it puts me in a very difficult position. At least before I had another guy to balance the house, but now there is this extremely strange love triangle that I am on the outside of, all while living in the same house. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am friendly with the guy and have nothing against him, but he isn't someone I would consider a friend. The first girl I am friendly with and comfortable with, and consider her more of a friend. The new girl is quite anxious and naive (as is normal at her age), and not someone I'd particularly be friends with. What I'm trying to say is it's not like we are all old friends who are all comfortable with the dynamic. I am only really friends with the first girl.

&amp;#x200B;

I was somewhat comfortable with the dynamic when it was just the first girl and Housemate 1 sleeping with each other, but now it's become a bit ridiculous and I don't want to live in a house with this kind of love triangle.

&amp;#x200B;

I am seriously considering leaving the house, and with university being mostly online, it wouldn't be the worst to go back home for the next term. Alternatively I could find another place to stay near university. Regardless, I am seriously considering leaving. What is the best course of action, in your opinion? What would you do?",20Nov2020,1
138,"
I am currently in my first year of university, it feels like I’ve been waiting for this moment my whole life. What I thought would’ve been the best year of my life turned into shit with this pandemic. I decided to hold off on going to residence for at least first semester, due to uncertainty and just being able to save my parents some money and also work some more while I can since I get great hours at my job. I have been looking forward to moving out second semester as residence was always the plan, yet my father recently let me know that it made no sense to move to residence second semester and we have a weird dynamic so I didn’t bother to force it or tell him my point of view plus he was dropping me off to work so there was no point in starting that argument in the moment.

So this is my dilemma at this point because of course staying home would be great, my job is great and even with another possible lock down I would still be working (store would close to public but we’d still be fufilling online orders) but i do not want to stay at home much longer. My birthday is in February and I really don’t want to celebrate my 19th at home miserable. Yet staying home where I don’t have to pay bills and can get away with staying in my room most of the day while having a secure job seems like the easiest option. So far I have $4,000 . For more reference I live in Canada, Ontario specifically and I plan to move to Ottawa for school which is 5 hours away from where I live currently. Do I have enough saved to move out comfortably? I’ve been looking through Facebook groups and rent is usually between $450 - $700 in the areas I’ve been looking at. I could really use any advice, I’m so torn between moving out in January/February or staying until the summer so I can continue saving. for extra context I’ll kinda break down my relationships with everyone currently living in the house with me if that aids in feedback.


My relationship with my mom

- basically non existent. It’s been that way even when I was younger. It was always me and my dad basically and my mom didn’t seem to be around much due to work. Even on weekends when she was off or just any time spent together it just seemed off and cold. She’s very dismissive, I feel nothing when I think about her. She’s literally gifted me the same cheap necklace two birthdays in a row. Only talks to me when she needs me to do something or when it’s time to criticize how I look or how fat I am lol.


My relationship with my dad 

- we used to be super close of course. I used to go to him for everything. Very abusive when I was younger (grew up in a Caribbean household) so that “tough love” bullshit was always a thing. A lot of traumatic things that went on in my childhood that he never really bothered to address with me, he never really cares to talk about feelings. I have two older siblings making me the last and he’s had issues with all three of us and instead of thinking that he’s the common denominator, it’s all of our fault and he thinks we sit in a group chat and talk about him. Very much his way or the highway. I remember once I told him I didn’t want to play soccer anymore and he stopped talking to me for a week, yet turns around and thinks that he deserves father of the year for putting up with everyone. He just loves to play the victim despite his actions leading him into situations. I really can’t tell him anything because I’m always wrong. So we don’t talk much now that I’ve gotten older. We’re still cordial or whatever but just enough to keep peace and I bet he thinks our relationship is perfect.


I live with two aunts both on my dad’s side

- one of my aunt’s had underlying health issues and she’s always lived with us. She’s in her 70s and is very miserable and projects that onto me. I understand she’s very lonely but she acts like that’s my job or something. I feel like she robbed me of my childhood because nobody wants to deal with her and it was always me she would call out to if she needed anything. I hate her honestly. In highs school if I came home an hour late it was an issue. If I didn’t tell her I had an extracurricular activity after school she’d literally call my dad asking where I was. Just very controlling. If I go out and don’t tell her I’m leaving it’s a big deal. When I do tell her when I leave it’s always a million questions to the point where I don’t even go out much because I don’t like giving her the satisfaction. When I was younger I never used to say anything despite being annoyed but now I talk back. She’ll have a lot to say but the second my parents come home/ are in the room she’s quiet. My mom doesn’t like her. My dad gets irritated by her but it’s his oldest sister so.. and my other aunt originally moved in because her old place was being sold so it was only temporary but it’s been almost 2 years at this point. She’s decent but unbearable at the same time. She loves to play “cool aunt” but she’s really miserable. Over the years she has seemed to morph into the other aunt I just described. She thinks she knows best. Always critiques me and how I am. Makes fun of me for being anti social when I’m just an introvert, always acts like she is higher then thou when she’s been miserable and single for ages. Spends most of her days on Instagram, asking me “did you see what Kim Kardashian just posted” mind you she’s in her late 50s..


And lately my brother 

tw/ sexual assault and physical assault 


- I mean the trigger warning is self explanatory lol. He was very physically abusive when we were younger. My parents enabled it and just called it “rough housing” despite him being 9 years older than me. Once he punched me in the face and my tooth came out. Whenever I didn’t listen or he wanted his way he would hit me. I’ve went to school with bruises and have had to lie about it and say I just fell when I was in elementary school. I blame my dad for that, because he always used physical violence to teach us a lesson. He moves out ever so often when he gets a girlfriend and when they break up he moves back in. He lives in the basement and there’s a tv down there so if I wanna watch something I will. He’s jerked off while I’m there and it’s pretty obvious and he’s even done it upstairs in the living room while my aunt and I were in the kitchen. I’ve never felt comfortable to say anything because even though I know it who would really believe me and I’ve always just told myself once I move out I’ll never have to deal with it. Or I just make sure I’m never in the same room with him alone. He just disgusts me honestly another reason why I stay in my room. He moved back in around April but since we both work I don’t cross paths with him much so it’s whatever but it sucks that I literally fear doing laundry when he’s home because I don’t wanna be alone down there.



I have another brother but he’s like 15+ years older and doesn’t live with us. He’s married and has a kid and we’re not really that close.  He’s super chill and I know if i ever needed anything I could go to him but I hate confrontation and I just wanna go. I’m not close with anyone else in my extended family. I just feel like because of all this trama it’s so much harder for me to trust people.

Hopefully that context helps! I appreciate anybody that took the time to read all of this. Although it sounds really bad I’ve been dealing with this dysfunction since I was a little child so I’ve leaned to just cope which is sad but it just doesn’t bother me as much as it used to.

I (19nb) recently had to withdraw from my current college term for a variety of reasons. I don't want to get into it, so in short, I'm back home with my mom (37f) and her boyfriend (40m) as of one week ago. I already knew situations weren't great at home, but I had nowhere else to go that I wasn't having full trouble with. Frankly, my mom is an alcoholic. No better way to put it. She drinks to cope nightly. Her boyfriend also drinks. They butt heads rather often when they are both drunk, and sometimes when not- the boyfriend usually instigates and will not drop it. Three times within a week, it has ended in my mom crying and breaking down while the boyfriend leaves (tonight I had to yell at him to leave because he just. Would not. Shut. Up and GO.). My mom loses her mind when she breaks down, and I try to console her but it doesn't feel like I'm helping, especially considering she feels so guilty that I'm trying to help her. I don't know how I can help her and make her feel better, and I so desperately want to.

And I feel weird just standing at the window. I kind of want to have a conversation with them, because that’s personally what I’d want as a customer .

When I ask them how their day has been, they usually say good, and ask how mine is, and then it just ends. Not much conversation.

Things haven't been great in the world lately, and for months now we haven't really done a lot of talking. I find that I'm okay with being alone, it was really rough at first, but I'm okay. However, I find that I have a hard time doing things alone without, sort of, instinctively expecting to do it with them (If that makes sense).

Since I can't, then I hold off doing something I want to do, because I'm holding onto this tiny hope that just maybe we'll be able to experience it together. I've always sort of done this, and there's a few times where I've sort of tried to do things to prove to myself that I didn't need them to enjoy things, but this usually backfired and now I own co-op games that I've never played because as it turns out, I couldn't enjoy them by myself. I bought a game a few months ago after trying the demo, and I thought I might really enjoy it. I haven't played it since, I think deep down I keep thinking, ""If I hold off on it, maybe, just maybe, we'll play it together"". I've kind of been talking to this guy, he's nice I guess, and he said we could play the game together, which I at first thought it would be a great idea, but then I just started avoiding it. I've played a few games with him, but it isn't the same, and frankly I don't think our personalities work all that well together, so I don't know if I'd really end up enjoying the game at all. 

I think the problem might just be that I'm overtly dependent, or maybe needy. I just have a hard time enjoying activities by myself or with other people, knowing I could just hold off for a few months and then maybe, possibly, experience them with someone I care about. This ends up being a big problem, because as you can tell, it leads to me struggling to enjoy things by myself and constantly hold off on things. Anybody got any Advice?",20Nov2020,1

148,"I am a single parent with two kids. I am only 24 years old and I have a three year old daughter and a one year old son. The mother of my kids and I broke up almost a year ago. At first we were both taking care of our kids 2 weeks each back and forth but that slowed down alot because the mom started to drink alot and do drugs. One time when she had the kids I got a call from one of her family members to go pick my kids up because she was drinking and it was 4am at the time. Of course I didn't hesitate I went right away to pick them up and that day I didn't let her see my kids for 1.5 months. Was I wrong for that?
After she finally started seeing the kids again only with me around I didn't leave them with her until about two months later she complained so much about taking care of them and always wanted to drop them off to me which I had no problem I love my kids and will always be with them, but anyways it happened again she started drinking and doing drugs alot again so I've had my kids with me for two months without her seeing them. She acts like she misses them and says she misses them but when I ask her to come see them or even video call them she never wants to and it's starting to piss me off. I try my best to help her out to try get her away from the life she's living because I still care for her but it's draining me and I need to focus on myself and my kids, but I don't want to lose her to the point of no return due to her addictions. I work to support my kids, my parents watch my kids when I work for now due to the virus and daycares not open around where I live. I just wish the mother of my kids would actually take responsibility for our kids. I do struggle but I'm hanging in there for my kids. I need advice on what to do. Should I continue to try help out my ex for my kids or should I just focus on myself and my kids only?",20Nov2020,1
149,"So I live with my mother who is extremely high risk and susceptible to virtually anything, and so when this covid came into play she completely changed how we live.

Since it began in china we haven't gone to any restaurants, no outings, no parties, no friends over, and absolutely no physical contact with anyone whatsoever.

No. Once.   Ever since patient zero.

I can't remember when the last time I had a hug, let alone even shaken a hand.

She threatens me if I even consider being near anyone less than six feet .

This never really affected me in general because I was usually an introvert to begin with but now it's like I can feel a very prominent crave for human touch. 

As if every person I see I want to hug for an unknown reason.

My dreams are recently being absolutely filled with visions of cuddling my ex, hugging my friends and being physical with people ect.  

It has gone from a want to a crave.

I don't feel a need to wake up anymore as my dreams are feeling better than reality..

I can't find a purpose to continue on anymore even though financially I'm doing quite well.

It feels like if I don't get a hug from someone I'm going to die.  Like. Litterally... I can not explain the feeling in words.

I'm sorry to spill all of this so unorganized..

Anything anyone can recommend?",20Nov2020,1
150,"I guess I'm not completely sure what answer I'm looking to hear, but any thoughts would mean so much. For starters, I'm an 18 year old female, a freshman in college doing pre-med. I currently live with my mom, who I believe shows signs of a toxic parent. I used to try and justify her parenting style, telling others that she was just strict, but I'm very close to my breaking point as of now. I don't want to downplay mental health issues as they're very serious, but I do think that growing up with her has been a cause to my extreme anxiety and a guilty complex I think I may have. 

My mom has always been extremely short-tempered. She never lets me go out with friends unless it's for school. She won't allow me to get a job. She won't allow me to move out. She won't even allow me to pay my tuition (the recent ordeal that has made me so upset). She's a nurse, and every time she comes home from her shifts she'll snap at me and be angry towards me until she goes to bed. I understand that it is not an easy job, every job is difficult, but ever since I was really young, any sort of work stress she had was taken out on me. I get that I'm the only person she lives with, but I don't think I should be her verbal punching bag when she's tired.

I also baby my mom and play housewife. I clean the house, do laundry and clean the pool, I drive her to and from work, there have been no exceptions to that. I pay her bills every month, so I call the credit card companies and write checks and things like that. She loves to see her friends, and will make me stay late even after I express that I have an exam due, or an online meeting (I'm in the college's music program so I have online performance commitments). She'll get mad at me until I cave into a situation in which I have to perform or take a really big exam in someone's guest bedroom. I drive her to those parties as well, and will end up having to drive two hours back home at 4am, it's not fun. Every single small thing I do for her, and she never thanks me. She gets up every morning, opens the door and says ""coffee"" so that I make her some. I'm seriously not kidding, she won't even say good morning. I make her breakfast every morning, make sure she has lunch and dinner, and she's never thanked me.

She's never showed me any sort of affection unless its in front of her friends. However, she's always quite demanding when it comes to me being affectionate. She yells at me to hug her and say I love you, which I do everyday of course, but she stands there like a dead fish. 

Lastly, my mom financially supports me in every way possible. I can't stress enough that I am thankful for it! But it makes me feel disgusting. I want to work, I want to be self-sufficient so badly. She says she does this to support me, but I can see more clearly it isn't coming from a good place. It's to put me on a leash, where I'm continuously under her jurisdiction and have no freedom. I'm living in a constant state of serving her needs, with zero way to choose how I live even though I am an adult. She makes me feel so guilty about me being financially dependent, and holds it over my head. She saw my tuition balance a few days ago as I had to let her know how much it was, and she's been telling me that I make her want to die and that I make her sick and that I'm irresponsible. I saved all of my money that I ever got from family on holidays, and tried to pay for my tuition, but she won't let me. She won't let me get a job, yet she makes me feel guilty for being financially dependent, even though its a state she wants me to be in so she can control every aspect of me. I feel like an extension of her, and not her daughter. I don't know how to confront her and tell her that I want a job, and that I want to pay for my own things, because she terrifies me.

I'm not perfect, so if I ever mess anything up like forgetting to call and schedule a dentist appointment for her or something, she goes on a rampage about how I don't love her and all of these pretty nasty things. If I'm ever running late to get home because I'm doing errands, I start shaking from fear and I feel paralyzed. If she warns me she's going to have a bad day at work, I vigorously clean the house and can't sleep because I'm scared she'll yell at me when I pick her up. I have zero self confidence, from the way I carry myself, to my body image because of how much stress I'm put under. She'd never put her hands on me, but I could go on all day about how I feel as if she's messed my mind up. 

Just to clarify, I don't do anything illegal (like drunks/underage drinking), and I've always had good grades as well. Does anyone have any experience with parents like this? If anyone has advice on how I should confront her, or if I shouldn't, pleaseeee let me know. If there are any parents out there who could please let me know if this situation is normal/healthy, and what I should do, I'd also greatly appreciate it. I'm extremely lost, so thank you to anyone in advance. I want to leave the house so badly, but she'd raise all hell and I would feel so guilty. I'd have no where to go and no idea where to start. I just signed up to doordash at night while she's working so I can start saving without her knowing. If anyone wants to tell me what I should do, it'd mean everything.",20Nov2020,1

153,"Hey all, I'm 17 and I'm planning to move out in about a month when I turn 18. I have felt a lot of guilt about the situation because I will be leaving my dad all alone, but they have been a leech on me financially, and they have also been abusive and overly controlling. Plus he is basically a hoarder, and living in the house is a borderline health hazard.


For ME personally, the situation couldn't be better. I am graduating high school a semester early this winter right after I turn 18. I have a college acceptence letter in hand, and I have a clear path for paying for college completely independently. I have about 4k saved up for moving/relocating, and My job is transferring me to a delivery driving position in the city that my college will be in, plus I have a reliable car in my name, which I paid for. Things are going better than I EVER would have imagined even just 1 year ago.


But I am worried I will be really screwing my dad over when I leave. Because of his own irresponsibility his car recently broke down, so we have had to share mine. We have food assistance from the government, but because he refuses to go to the employment classes we are only getting money for 1 person. If I leave I don't know what he will do. He is unemployed relying on welfare that he gets only because he has a dependent child in the house. Before covid and his car breaking, I was thinking that maybe my move would finally force him to get off his ass and go get a job like the rest of functioning society. But I don't think it would be possible for him to get a job without a car, and it will be especially difficult because the unemployment rate in our town is like 12% right now.


Not to mention, my sibling buys into this religious sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice family is everything BS, so I wouldn't be suprised if she ends up sending him money (which she doesn't have.) Not sure what to do. I can't exactly give him a heads up because he still has complete control over my life (including my bank account) until I turn 18.",20Nov2020,1

I felt something in my throat like i was a bit nauseous but it wasnt affecting my daily function.
Two days after this happent i went out and sparred with some guys on box.I got hit on the jaw and i have intense vertigo Everytime i get hurt badly on my neck area or jaw due to a fall on water i did once.
I went home and i was very nauseous and shaking.I didnt vomit.I didnt think kuch of it because that had happent again when i was hit and i though it would not last much.
A lot of days after here i am with a lot of symptoms.My vertigo is not that severe(nausea.dizziness)but i have tingling in my throat some cough,eye pain,and diahrea.

156,"I'm doing this to vent mainly, but E was my best friend for years. Now, I haven't talked to him in months. I messed up by threatening to call the labor dept. and report his job for not making lots take breaks after 5 hours (as is the law in my state). I did think bc he persistently undermined my work by saying it's easy for me to make money... my wage is $4/hr... It was all the time and he would also make fun of my business ideas, saying it was stuff that belonged on budget tv shows or toys r us shelves. 

Anyways, since I threatened that (and we had a huge fight), we haven't talked. But, I miss him all the time. We paint his house together and I just painted my bedroom and I cried. I was thinking abt writing and he was the first person to read my first book, and i cried. Someone was asking if I went to my last highschool dance w anyone, and i teared up bc it was w him... and those pictures were hung up all around his mom's house.

157,"My SO was complimenting my makeup today but then he looked at my eyebrows and told me that if I’d just let the right one grow in a little more toward the middle that I would look much prettier. He often has critiqued my makeup saying I have too much of something on or he doesn’t like the lipstick and I don’t look good because it’s not natural looking. I even stopped wearing lipstick for a while because I thought he thought I looked bad with it until recently when he said that he didn’t mean it like that and that he was probably just referring to the shade of lipstick I had on that day. I used to love wearing red lipstick as I have dark brown hair and I thought it complimented one another very well but I never wear it anymore because of the comment he made about preferring me without lipstick. It’s such a hard line to draw between trying to look good for yourself but also trying to appeal to your partners likes, so I’m just wondering if this is an example of him negging me? He’ll also say stuff like you look great today but did you exercise this morning and if I say no he gets really disappointed in me. At this point in my life my self esteem has hit an all time low where even when I watch workout videos on YouTube I start crying because I know I don’t look like those women and feel extremely frustrated that I don’t. I also got corona virus this year and exercising is still a little bit challenging as I get winded very easily now and feel super tired afterwards. I hate going out in public with him as well because all I can think about is how good other women look compared to me and how he would probably rather be with them.

162,"Hi everyone. I've never made a post like this before, and I'm nervous that this is a stupid story and I'm completely overreacting. Please bear with me as this is kind of a lengthy story. 

I (19f) work as a cashier in a grocery store. I was let go from my office job in March, when lockdowns in the US shut everything down, and this was the first job I was able to find in the mess. I liked the management, my coworkers, and the hours I got were good, if not sometimes stressful. 

The only thing that bothers me about the management is the ""precautions"" they take against COVID-19. Considering we are a grocery store, and the workers interact with hundreds of shoppers everyday, I feel as though it is our priority to take strong precautions in order to keep us and the shoppers safe. For example, our mask policy is not enforced at all. In fact, it is completely ignored by a large number of shoppers, even though in my state still has mandatory face covering laws. Management will get mad at us if we politely ask someone to put a mask on. In addition to this, every employee is ""screened"" before coming in -- management takes their temperature to check if they have a fever. But at least a couple of times, there has been an employee who was found to have a fever, and was simply sent upstairs with an ice pack until their forehead read an acceptable temperature. 

I began to feel feverish towards the end of my shift on Friday, November 6th. I was suddenly very hot and my nose was beginning to run. I mentioned this to the supervisor on duty, and she told me to drink some water, and then I went home. I had Saturday off. I woke up with the worst headache I had ever had in my life, an extremely runny nose (snot was running down my face uncontrollably, it was so disgusting) and a fever so bad that my entire body ached. I stayed home and figured that my cold would blow over before my shift on Sunday.

On Sunday, I felt a little better. My nose was no longer runny, but I developed the smell of burnt toast in my nose that would not go away, something I figured was a sinus infection. My headache was bad but not debilitating, as long as I did not move my head too much. I went to work and immediately regretted it. It was a cold day but I was sweating uncontrollably, and my eyes burned and itched. I told my supervisor and she told me I could go home if I still wasn't feeling well after two hours. Two hours went by, and I was feeling even worse, so I went home. I had Monday off, and called out Tuesday because nothing had improved. By Wednesday, I realized that my sense of smell was completely gone, and I had a cough that made my lungs hurt, with coughing fits that would last over half an hour. I decided to call my doctor Thursday morning, and she sent me immediately to be tested for COVID-19. She said the results would take several days, but that I was to remain in quarantine for 14 days. She gave me a note to give to my work, and the note stated that I would be able to return to work on **November 26th.** I called my work to let them know that I was in the process of being tested for COVID, but that I was instructed by a doctor to stay in quarantine. They had me call this company health screening line, and they asked me a bunch of typical COVID screening questions, and I told them I had already been seen by a doctor and had a doctor's note. They told me that they usually issued a shorter quarantine time than what was given to me, but they would just go ahead and follow the doctor's orders and put my return to work date as the 26th. I said okay and hung up and went to sleep.

By Tuesday, November 17th, I still hadn't received my results, but was still sick. I was completely bedridden. Every time I would sit up, I would get a severe headache, and chills all over my skin. I received a text from my boss. 

&gt;Boss: Hey, so you're supposed to return to work this Thursday. Are you gonna be able to do that?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Um.. My doctor ordered me to stay in quarantine until the 26th. I haven't even gotten my test results back yet, and I'm still sick.  
&gt;  
&gt;Boss: Your last day worked was the 8th, so Medcor (the company health screener) put you down to return on the 18th. Even if you did have Covid I don't see how it would last til the 26th. Just call Medcor and tell them what you told me.

At this point I was frustrated. He had never even asked me how I had been doing, and only reached out to ask me if I was returning to work, and seemed annoyed when I wasn't able to, despite doctor's orders. It seemed like he was kind of doubtful of me being sick and wanted to pressure me into going back to work. I was also irritated because it's not like sickness has an expiration date. It's not like it's impossible for me to be sick for more than ten days, even if it wasn't COVID. Regardless, I called Medcor but they didn't answer so I left a message. As of the 19th, they have still not called me back. 

On the 18th, I received my positive COVID-19 lab result. At this point, I was not surprised. I texted my boss to let him know that I tested positive and should probably let my coworkers know. I also decided to ask for the number for HR so I could talk about eligibility for sick pay, as three weeks is a lot of time to miss work and I have rent to pay. He told me I did not need to worry about that right now. I said regardless, I would like the info just so I have it. He ignored me and reminded me to call Medcor, and I told him I tried but they literally did not answer. He didn't say anything after that. 

As of today, I am still sick. I want to return to work but getting out of bed is still an insurmountable task. 

I guess my advice is... Is my manager allowed to put pressure on me for not being able to come back to work yet? Is he allowed to imply that I might be faking my illness? Do I have cause to file a complaint against my store for not following the safety precautions and guidelines? If so, how could I do that? Am I overreacting?",20Nov2020,1

Around 3 or 4 years ago I had started talking to this girl (we will call her T), at the time we were both fairly young I was 15 and she was 14. At first it was just harmless friend stuff, she didn't have many friends due to her being bullied and I was struggling with severe depression. After 3 months of talking everyday and every night, she told me that she liked me and at first I was overjoyed as I felt the same way. The only issue was her mom, she didn't like her dating or going to spend time with any boy. However a week later she came to me and said her mom would not let her, she then asked if I still wanted to be with her. Because of the circumstances nothing ever really happened.

Skip ahead a few months to late august, up until now we had been talking as if we were together even though it was never official by any means. In the time I started talking to her she had started being more out going and confident, she started talking to new people and making new friends. I had been trying to be there as much as possible, I would stay up late to talk to her, I would listen to her vent about family or any other issues she may have had. She would do the same for me but not as much. Then towards the end of august my aunt got diagnosed with small-cell carcinoma (an aggressive form of lung cancer), and by the time she found it she was already pretty far in. This was majorly devastating to my family, It sent a large part of my family into a downward spiral as my aunt was the nicest person you would ever meet. A few days after I found out I went to tell T, and her response was... well it was basically indifferent. She almost entirely brushed it off, this however would stick with me for a long time.

A few months later and it is around Christmas time, me and my family took a trip to see my uncle out of state. While we were flying I would get a message on Instagram from a person claiming to know who I was, when we landed and I responded but I wouldn't get a response for another 3 hours. After we started talking they told me they were a friend of T, I found it extremely odd at the time that they would reach out to me. Not too long after another person would reach out (we will call him J) saying they knew the friend that had messaged me, they told me not to trust everything they say. Both of these people stood out as very odd to me, both were accounts that had a sizeable following yet seemed so empty at the same time. During this time T would actually get a legitimate boyfriend, however her friend would come to me saying he wasn't good for her. Her friend would go on to make a group chat and have me try and convince her that he was bad, in the end I couldn't do that to her so I just made sure that if she needed advice or help that I would be there for her and she said the same.

Not long after that conversation my aunt would pass away due to her lung cancer. When I went to T to tell her, she never responded. Feeling worse than ever I would reach out to J in which he helped and talked me through my feelings. It would be 3 days before she responded saying that she hadn't seen it until now. This would continue to happen, I would try and talk to her and she would go dark for days. During this however I would talk to J learning about his life and we would bond over our experiences.

Around 2 months later T would block me on everything, and her friend would message me telling me that I was a horrible person and that I should give up. I was highly confused, and for the next 2 weeks I would get message after message from her friends and other random people at my school, calling me almost everything you can think of. It finally stopped and she unblocked me saying it was just to test me to see how loyal I was... I went through 2 weeks of hell and harassment for... a test? 

Finally at the end of the school year she would break up with her boyfriend and come back to me, however by this time I was in a bad place. I was made to believe by her friends that I was a horrible person that didn't deserve her. So when she came back to me I didn't respond, and would block her on everything as well as her friends. After this I sunk down further until I started talking to another girl that was 10 years older than me, but that is for a different story. This year however I would get out of my horrible relationship and try to start over. I felt bad about leaving T the way I did so I reached out to say sorry, she would accept my apology and we would talk here and there for a little.

However a week ago T would send me a long paragraph telling me that she thinks I am a horrible person, and because of me she has major trust issues. She would go on to tell me that every time I talked to her it would bring up bad memories. She would then again block me on everything once again and I would do the same.

Ever since I got that message it feels like my heart has dropped and never came back up, I keep telling myself I don't have the right to feel hurt. But being called a horrible person by someone I cared about just makes me feel like a monster inside. I just want to know what to do I feel horrible and I can't shake this feeling of dread. I don't want to feel this way and at times I don't want to feel at all. I know I'm not 100% in the right but I feel so trapped. Is it really okay for me to try and feel better when I've caused someone so much pain? I don't know I just need to know what to do it hurts so much. (sorry this was so long I tried to condense it)",20Nov2020,1
169,"4 years ago I started dating my first love. It was one of the happiest times of my life. The relationship was so new and amazing 8 months later she decided to break up with me, she lost her feelings for me. I on the other hand loved her more by the day. A couple of months go by and we try again but we decided to go out as friends first but as we do this she realizes that her feelings are gone for me and she couldn't go back to me.

The unfortunate part of this breakup is that she was apart of my friend group. She was there whenever we all hung out and I couldn't do it anymore so I dropped all friends I had and became an introverted hermit. Months go by and she slowly drifts away from my mind but I didn't get over it, I just forgot her. So when I thought I was ready to go back to all my friends, she was there and all and it hit me again. Every day she is on my mind figuring out how I can get her back.  We've come to be good friends again. We text every day and hang out with other friends and all. 
I'm able to handle being around her again but I've started to fall in love again. 

For all she knows, I'm over her and have accepted to be friends. On my end, however, that's not the case. I just can't handle these feelings anymore.  For 3-4 years, I've become a slave to my emotions. I can't do it anymore. She was my first girlfriend and my first love. The feelings I have for this girl are so strong. 


I plan to tell her everything I'm feeling soon just so I can get some closure. I need to hear her say that we won't be back together again. I haven't talked to her yet just because I don't want to ruin our great friendship. But I need some sort of advice.

You don't have to provide anything but it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",20Nov2020,1
170,"Hey yall. Apologies for any formatting errors, I’m on mobile
Warning - this is long and has mentions of cutting/suicide

I have two things here that I’d like to ask about: the first is what to do after being suicidal and the other is if I should reenter therapy.

1. I’ve had depression for a while (~7 years) and was suicidal for most of my middle/high school years. Because of it I didn’t think I would make it out of high school, and I didn’t do anything to find out the things I enjoy or make a plan for the rest of my life. After I went to therapy the suicidal impulses mostly left, and I went to college for biology (had a vague interest in it). However, I’m not sure how much I want to stick with it and I don’t know the best way to go from here/find out what I like doing. What exactly would my advisor for example do? Are they helpful in general? Is it a smart idea to take the semester off? I want some time and space to myself but I’m worried I’ll end up doing nothing. 

One of my professors said that as he was looking at all the other cars at a traffic stop, he saw that he was the only one happy to go to work. I have this dread that I’m going to be one of the unhappy ones, and I’ll be that way for the rest of my life.

Has anyone here with depression/suicidal tendencies been able find what they are passionate about later in life? I know it may sound silly but I worry that it’s already too late for me - especially when you hear that decent artists/writers etc start really early in life. How did y’all (depressed or not) find out what you liked doing?

2. I put (?) because I am not sure I have “recovered” or if I’m relapsing or if I’m being overdramatic and there is nothing wrong. I feel like coming out of therapy I wasn’t suicidal, but I still didn’t know how to be a person, sort of. I didn’t know how to speak/interact with people or know if I was truly happy or if I was faking it. I made some friends and it definitely truly helped, but with the pandemic and being at my parents house I feel guilty again and am starting to forget what I liked about having friends. Has anyone felt like no matter how often you hang with friends your brain refuses to remember the good times and just keeps the cringy parts you’ve done? I feel like a fraud sometimes and wish I felt more so I could be a better person or just not have met them so they wouldn’t have to put up with me if they think I’m fake.

For my mental state right now I’m not passively/actively suicidal and I’m not praying to get hit by a car or anything, but the thought that I’m better off dead crosses my mind sometimes. I’ve started cutting but I couldn’t tell you why exactly - I did it at first because I felt like I deserved it but now the best reason I can give is boredom (is that numbness or am I just looking for attention?).

I feel like I tend to measure the need to go to therapy by my suicidality since it’s an easy tell but I’m a lot less sure if I’m depressed. I know the cutting is probably an instant tell, but I have a good home and my normal mood is just chilling. I don’t know what I would tell the therapist as there is nothing really wrong and I still keep in contact with my friends and I have no idea what goals I would make in therapy. I feel like by going to therapy it’ll also be like showing ungratefulness for all the good things I have.

tldr; I didn’t think I was gonna live past high school and now idk what to do with my life; idk if I should go to therapy as my mood is mostly chilling with some guilt on the side and fear that I’m a bad friend.

Thanks for listening yall",20Nov2020,1
171,"So, as my post states..I'm about to literally fail highschool if I dont pass an english test by tomorrow..issue is, I've suffered from anxiety, crippling depression, adhd and I get frustrated super easily. I cannot focus on my homework for the life of me, I'm doing online classes so it personally makes it harder for me to focus, since its online, a 70 percent on my test is failing so I need at least an 80 to pass.. my english test is complete and utter bs because the questions make little to no sense whatsoever, the style of language they use for the readings are from the 17-1800s, I'm so, so overwhelmed with worry and fear about failing highschool, this is a program designed to give kids a last chance to graduate but somehow it's even MORE difficult for me. I know I'm not stupid, I'm actually really decent at english, but the way this online stuff is set up is ridiculous...

175,"Throwaway bc obvi. TL;DR at bottom

First off, I am a homoromantic asexual 21 year old woman. (Any comments trying to ""disprove"" asexuality will be ignored).

All this happened pre-covid fyi

Theres this girl that I've known for about two years. (shes also 21).  I've been romantically attracted to her for a while but never done anything about it bc I know shes a quite sexual person and couldn't fathom her being willing to give up sex. She knew I'm gay but didn't know I'm ace.

&amp;#x200B;

One day late at night, she (over text) tells me that she likes me. In a gay panic I call her and tell her that I like her too but I'm asexual. She had a few clarifying questions about what that means specifically for me since all aces are different. I told her that for me, it means I want a romantic relationship and do not want to have sex. She understands and tells me that to her, she would not consider it dating if she was not having sex with the girl she's dating. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the next few days, we discuss (per her proposal) the possibility of just cuddling together. We are both single and touch-deprived, so I agree. I go to her house and she comes to mine every few days and we just lie together, keeping all clothes on. One day, she's lying on top of me and kisses me, and I kiss her back. After I go home, she texts me and asks if I enjoyed what happened. I did.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks later I'm on top of her, kissing, and she reaches under my shirt, unhooks my bra, and starts touching my boobs. I was curious to see how this would feel, so I let her. All clothes stay on. After I go home, she texts me to see if I enjoyed what happened. I was feeling iffy about it, but didn't want to think about what it would mean if I said no, so I said yes. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the moment, physically, it felt good but afterwards, I wish it didn't happen. If she had asked permission right before, I would have said no but I didn't stop her. She asked if I liked it and I said yes. Now I don't know what to think. About a week after this is when everyone in my college was sent home bc covid. We seem to have grown apart during this time so I'm not looking for anything to say to her, just some other people's thoughts on what happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I'm homoromantic asexual. While cuddling/kissing a girl touched my boobs without asking explicitly for permission first. I didn't stop her, but would have said no if she'd asked. When questioned later, I said I enjoyed it bc I didn't want to think about what it meant if I said no. I'm not looking for something to say to the girl, just want other's opinions.",20Nov2020,1
177,"Im sorry for mistakes im mobile. Also this is about head lice. 

My parents have been divorced for a while. Im 16f, and I have really long hair. It’s part of my culture and i am very attached to it. My dad is remarried and lives with his wifes parents, who take care of her nieces/nephew. The nieces, younger than 10 get lice a lot. It is horrible, and they always give it to me and my sisters. It is exhausting to get rid of, when we do it every month. My dad will say the cleaned the other girls hair over there, but sometimes they dont wash their sheets/vacuum the couches. The spray doesnt work THAT well. You have to vacuum to get rid of it. My mom and I both know how to get rid of it, during last lockdown we didnt have it at all after we got rid of it. Then we went back to our dads and got it AGAIN. Its humiliating to just KNOW i get it so much. My mom said she wants to take my dad to court because he and his wife arent taking care of the lice problem at there house. I love my dad and his wife. I try to stay neutral through all of their problems. I’m just tired of the lice, and there fighting. I’m debating on going through the gurls hair myself while i’m there with medicine and vacuum/clean myself. To tell my mom I got rid of it over there so she wont take him to court. But idk if he and his wife will let me do that. If he did, and its not gone idk what will happen. 

Should I do my little “plan” or whatever? Or just let my mom take them to court?",20Nov2020,2

I had to help my nephew with school then once they all went back I had to start picking him up in the days my mom works. (About 3 times a week) on top of that I make dinner once a week and do dishes 2 times a week. I am also taking a English class for collage.( Would do more than one but not great at not being in person) I have been having problems the past year with my mom. She yells at me and is either very nice or very mean with almost no in-between. They pay my insurance for my car and they pay for my phone. ( I pay for my gas) I understand that these things are not cheap and am very happy to have my mom and dad helping me.  The problem is my mom keeps taking my phone and telling me she can take it until I pay my own way. I would be fine paying my own way but am not able to get a job. ( my mom says I can't rn) I got into it with her today when she wanted to take my phone because my brother and I where fighting/ arguing with each other. ( We where not even in the same part of the house or talking to each other) I would not give her my phone since she still pays my 25 year old sisters way (she lives with us with my nephew) she ocationaly will buy a gallon or 2 of milk witch is something I do as well. ( Money from savings) now she is telling me she is going to cut me off tomorrow and go get my insurance cut and my phone cut. She even shut down the houses wifi  I am not sure what to do about this. I only have about 2 grand in savings and no job. How would you suggest I move forward? 
If you think I am a bad person please just tell me I want to know if I am out of line. 
I also don't want my brother and nephew/ sister to get screwed since they would have no one to pick them up from school or babysit. I would like to just leave but feel traped in every way because I don't want to completely cut off my family but can't go on like this for much longer.

So I’m the youngest of 4 siblings and they all dislike me. They always make these rude comments and manipulate my mother against 
 me and it gets me really upset. They always go out without me and have fun. They’re constantly putting me down, and they always make these mean comments then when I get defensive they always accuse me of “starting arguments”. Or when they make a rude comment and I say how that’s rude and I don’t like it I’m always getting called “a victim” then they’ll make a joke about how I’m a victim then I’ll argue and say I’m not then like I said earlier “always starting arguments”. My mom is tbh really stupid everyone in my house knows it and she’s easily manipulated. When my sister is mean to her she’ll say “your always mean to everyone” which she is then when all my siblings are calling me victim for example she’ll always jumps on the fun. If I could describe my relationship with them it’ll be like literally yesterday. We’re leaving my grandmothers and my sister is going with my mom I say “I’ll come to” then she’s like “oh your coming.... nvm I’ll just stay” and it doesn’t even anger me it’s just very hurtful and if I ever speak up on it I get dismissed as a victim. Another thing is like 2 weeks ago my mom says “why are you so mean to your siblings” and “why are you always starting arguments”. She says this because I never talk to them and they tell my mom how they think I “dislike them” which I don’t( well I do how can I not but I don’t go out of my way to tell them or I don’t act on it I just mind my own business) Oh and whenever they want to put me down another thing they’ll say is how “everyone hates you”. I just can’t handle them anymore honestly when I tell them how they’re being mean it gets no where, if I try to ignore them they continue making these rude comments to me, I can’t talk back, I’m not a physical guy I try to avoid that at all costs.

Recently, there are about 6 times strangers knocking at my door. 2 of them (most recent) seems suspicious. Both happened around 3 pm, with no car in the driveway and in front of my house since I park in the garage.

The first one ( 1 week ago) - a man driving a car (sedan, black) park in front of my house, knocked on my door 3 times, but I just kept silent. Then he went away.

The second one (2 days ago), 2 guys knocked, one standing next to the door, looked at his phone and look around checking something (??). The other guy standing behind the first guy, looking around my neighborhood (which is quiet at the time) and around my house also. I just kept silent, and he knocked one more. Then they talked to each other and walk away Quickly when they saw the FedEx guys parking in front of my house.

My gut feelings said it's something suspicious.

188,"Second post on this sub tonight because I'm sick, have nothing else to do, and my life is a mess.

If you read my initial post (about my work related issues to my diagnosis), you will know that I first started showing symptoms on November 6th, and tested positive for COVID-19 on November 18th.

I (19f) live with my brother (24m) and his fiance (26f) and their daughter (2f). I pay half the rent in our small apartment. I do not get along with my brother, nor do I like many choices he makes, but I never say anything because he has bad anger problems and sometimes violent outbursts. Most of the time, I would rather not just deal with him and his annoying ego, so I stay in my room. 

My niece was born with several health problems. She was born missing a spleen, a missing heart valve, and a small hole in her heart. She had her first open heart surgery at 1 year old. Even now, her lips and nails will turn blue randomly which requires them to rush her to the hospital. Any small cold threatens her life. 

I notified my family on November 12th that a doctor had ordered me to be tested for COVID. They told me I had to wear a mask when using the kitchen, which is fine. I don't mind masks. I suggested that maybe they should quarantine as well.

I tested positive and received the news on the 18th, as I mentioned earlier. I told my brother immediately and continued to quarantine. Because they had had close contact with me, CDC guidelines require that they self-quarantine for 14 days. My brother went to work right after I told him the news, at the gym where he is a personal trainer and nobody wears masks, not even him. 

But what really enraged me is this: He went to our mom's house after work. My mother has an autoimmune disorder, and she lives with my grandmother, who just got out of surgery for her cancer and she is very frail. He showed up at the house, without telling her first, and he refused to wear a mask when she asked him to put one on. He was there for several hours before leaving. 

Today, the 19th, his fiance began showing symptoms. But she is not wearing a mask, and she is laying on the living room couch and throwing her used tissues on the couch next to her, and her daughter is right there. She isn't wearing a mask either. I worry for the health of my other family members. 

What should I do in this situation? It feels like it is completely out of my hands. He keeps going to work every single day and I worry that he might be spreading it out of his refusal to wear a mask. 

TL;DR, My brother is refusing to quarantine and refuses to wear a mask anywhere he goes. He is putting our family in danger.",20Nov2020,1

Right now she's still on campus but she doesn't know what to do whether or not to go home to an abusive mother or stay on campus and spend the holidays by herself.

To escape from this mess, I somehow started watching porn, and then nutting and shit. They caught me. I fucked up.

I’m a guy and junior in high school. For my entire life, I have never had any desire to have girls as just friends. I don’t know a single guy that doesn’t talk to any girls as friends. 

My view on society is that it has shaped guys into thinking that having girls as friends is necessary and that u need them to be socially acceptable. Like I seriously don’t know a single guy that doesn’t talk to at least 1 girl. 

I asked 1 girl out last year in my class which was a whole messed up situation I won’t get into. 

The reason I have no desire to talk to them is because I feel like there’s literally nothing in common I have with any of them. All they want to do is talk about sex and drugs and they just talk to a million other guys. I feel that there’s no point in talking to girls other than to date. 

So basically my question is: Am I doing something wrong by this logic and do I need to change?",20Nov2020,1

Over the last few months I got myself into a bit of credit card debt and owe about $700 to a local hardware store for home renovations. All of this adds up to roughly $4500. Im wondering if there’s any chance of me taking out a small personal loan from my credit union to pay these off, consolidating them into one monthly payment with a lower interest rate. 

It’s crazy to think a few short months ago I could’ve easily payed this off in full. I recently came into a free house from my grandmother which needed about $10k worth of renovations. This saved me $700 in rent so even though it’s put me in a tight spot I believe it’s worth it. Also, earlier this year I wrecked my car, so when I inherited my mother’s vehicle upon her passing I realized this was a blessing in disguise and decided to drive her car instead of financing another new vehicle. So fast forward to now my cost of living is basically just utilities, food, gas, WiFi, phone.

I’m currently only 20, but until the past couple months my credit score had been 720-750 since I was around 19. I was told I had top tier credit and was offered an interest rate of 4% on my previous auto loan without a co-signer. I’ve had a few credit cards as well to build credit which I usually paid in full every month until recently. I’m fairly confident I could get a small loan of around 5k to cover these small debts. 

The only issue is moving to this house meant relocating, switching jobs, and switching banks. I used to bring in around 2800-3500/month serving, however other than a tip log I don’t have much proof of that as we didn’t claim all our tips. I recently got a new serving job here and don’t have a very good idea of my new expected income, but my credit is pretty decent and I don’t have many bills or any loans so I’m hoping my credit union will loan me the money! 

How do I approach this as I’ve had so many big financial changes recently and haven’t had this job or an account with this credit union for long?

EDIT: I do have a detailed tip log from my old job including my biweekly payroll checks and the paystubs to prove it which is how I was approved. Today is my last training shift at my new job so within a couple weeks I should have direct deposited checks, and cash tip deposits to prove my new income.",20Nov2020,1

200,"Hello fellow redditors,

Here's some context. I've been dating my GF for about 3 months now and the relationship is frankly amazing. I know we're still getting to know each other but it's green flags all around so far. Except for one huge red flag hoisted well above the air for all to see. 

Her family, specifically mom &amp; dad (50s), are absolute jerks. They berate her constantly, put her down every time she has something to be happy for, and recently even took her dog to an off-road and left him there to his luck out of sheer spite. When we're together it's all sunshine and rainbows but the moment she has to interact with them she just tenses up. As she's opened up with me I've come to hear progressively more fucked up things that they've done to, not only her, but also her two older brothers. The first one married at 18 just to leave, the second one developed a drug addiction and is currently in rehab and I feel that they are now dumping all their vile on her as she is the only one left in their home. 

I want to help her but she's still got school to finish (fortunately it's a public university so tuition isn't a big issue), doesn't have a job, and her parents also know where I live and moving is something that's only feasible in two or three months. I also see them from time to time, but they don't know what I know to detail, they're absolute two-faced jackals acting all nice in public, and I personally feel anger welling in me everytime I see them.

Basically I’m in college and I found 2 best friends that I am incredibly grateful. Over the post couple of months I have this overwhelming feeling of wanting to share the insecurities I have developed from hs and in a way try to explain why I am the way that I am sometimes. I struggled a lot making friends in hs and it led me to develop a lot of self doubt and over compensating in my every day life today.

I want to share this with them not because I want pity but I have this feeling that I am being two faced (which I am not).

Ok, so I have two coworkers, let's call them Amy and Beth. The three of us are friends outside of work too, we run together, go out and stuff. Beth admires Amy a lot, professionally and personally, and she's like the nicest person, which sometimes makes her naive. Amy is driven, but she's always there to help if you need it.
The problem: Amy is about to leave on a much needed vacation time, and Beth will fill in for her for that period. Amy once told me that she was scared to have time off because they might not have her back (that's how she got her job in the first place, she was filling in for someone and they asked her to stay and fired the other person).
Since then, she started treating Beth like shit. She doesn't train her properly, and if Beth asks anything she will say things like ""if you don't know this, you'll never be able to do this job"" (which is not true. Also, when Amy first got here she has completely lost!)

Now, do I even say anything? She's like a week away from vacation and I already told Beth that I'll help if she needs anything, but I'm really uncomfortable with this treatment

Some back story: my (FtM17) best friend (M17) had sort of a rough childhood and just kinda struggles with emotions and avoids physical contact with people at all costs.

 About two months ago I started having reoccuring panic attacks (and a small crush on my best friend) and when I asked my best friend for a hug afterwards, he obliged.

Now that many not seem significant, but for me and him it very much was. I'm one of the only people he's ever hugged, and has hugged the most amount of times (since I have a panic attack about every week now and he's always there to comfort me). And he likes to remind me of it every single week.

And I've told him that he can always say no if he's uncomfortable, but he's stubborn and always brushes me off when I tell him that.

He's very important to me and I care for him a lot. We talk almost every night for hours and just really enjoy each other's company.

But here's the thing. When ever he reminds me that I'm one of the only people he's hugged, he always says ""if you're not the first, then you're the last"".

What does that mean. Please help I am so lost, I've tried looking it up and there are no definitions for this.

I got prescribed it after going to ER multiple times convinced I was dying only to find out it was just my anxiety acting up. This is the first time I’ve ever taken meds for my anxiety and depression(I was diagnosed about six years ago). It works really well for me but I think it works a little too well to be honest. My mindset has done a complete 180. I no longer feel sad all the time which was great for a while. But I’m starting to miss who I was before. My mental illness was a pillar of my creativity and even though I can still be creative well on the medicine my  creativity levels have really taken a dive. Sure I was sad all the time but that’s who I was. That’s who I’ve been my entire life and I don’t know how to be anybody else. It’s been incredibly jarring to just act so different and think so different. I really miss the way I used to be and I’m really sad about the thought of potentially losing that version of me forever.

I am a 30M and my partner 28F has extreme depression. We have been together for 4 years and have even discussed moving in together recently. When things are going well with us everything is perfect and she is the most caring person ever however the smallest thing can trigger her and lead to an argument which cannot be resolved no matter how much I try to reason and use logic to explain something. This will then lead to an often 6 plus hour argument which will lead to me ending up staying awake all night trying to calm her down. These initially petty arguments have many times spiralled and led to her self harming and threatening to commit suicide. I do not believe this is an empty threat by the way as she has attempted suicide before. When she is in a state like this it seems like nothing can bring her out of it. I try talking her down calmly but it never seems to work. It always ends up with me being blamed for her feeling suicidal and feel like it is used as a weapon by her against me. A lot of the time I am actually not to blame for these arguments and she just will not accept this hence things getting so far out of control. Often days later she will apologise and acknowledge she was in the wrong. Things get so bad that I am scared she will commit suicide there and then and it is made worse by the fact she lives a 2 hour drive away from me and has no real family or friends who live close to her who can intervene in an emergency. This has happened more times than I can even remember and it is honestly destroying my mental health as if I try to leave her it is made out that I don't care about her or her depression and am fearful she will commit suicide. She has told me during an argument she doesn't care about how it will affect me if she commits suicide and I deserve to live with it. On one occasion I actually had a panic attack trying to talk her down which was met by a similar response of if she does commit suicide then I deserve to live with the guilt. This has been followed by her admitting the next morning that she had overreacted and the whole argument could have been avoided. I have encouraged her to seek mental health support and professional help on several occasions which she has done including taking medication but nothing seems to work long term. She has also visited a Councillor however this also didn't make much difference. I know it may make me a horrible person but it is destroying my mental health dealing with this and I can't do it anymore. When I have tried to leave, she has emotionally blackmailed me and told me I just don't care about her or her mental health illness. I am also genuinely scared she will end up self harming or worse. I know it is selfish but I know if we stay together it will make me miserable for the rest of my life. If there were a way which I honestly believed I could help her then I would but I genuinely envision the rest of my life playing out like this. I can't even talk to friends or family about this as I'm not comfortable telling them all of this.

The restaurant is connected to several other establishments on property that are owned by the same person.

222,"I was hoping someone here could answer some questions I have about the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. I'll leave a TLDR at the bottom for those who don't wanna read the context. After a couple months of heavy cannabis use, I started to experience paranoia. Thinking that any plane that flew over my head was gonna drop a bomb, that people on the street wanted to hurt me, stuff like that. I then got obsessively into religion, and entered an eight month long psychosis where I had no awareness that I was sick. I thought I was becoming more enlightened, which I see in retrospect was part of the illness. Over those eight months I started to experience very bizarre thoughts; random phrases and noises in my head. My lack of insight prevented me from seeing this as a sign that something was wrong. The delusions got more and more intense, until I started getting visual hallucinations. It looked like translucent tv static that danced around on blank surface, forming vague patterns, particularly when i smoked weed. Then the static started moving like liquid across the wall and pulsating. 

After 8 months, I began to notice something was wrong. I couldn't feel empathy, or any other emotion. I was losing the ability to read; my eyes scanned over the words but my brain wasn't able to piece them together. When I looked at people I couldn't focus my attention on them, I was unable to fix my awareness on their face or make eye contact. I then decided that I had gone crazy. From this point on any apparent control I had over my mind disappeared. Over the next month things went from bad... to hellish. Everything started to look foreign, not distorted, but unrecognizable. I'd look at a person and it was like I had never seen a human before. My thoughts went from weird and chaotic, to incoherent but at least somewhat connected, to disconnected fragments of thought that finished before they made any sense. My mind jumps from one unrelated thought to another, and I can't even call them thoughts. I'm starting to lose self-consciousness... like even though my thoughts are insane and my emotions are gone, there's a weird unsettling feeling that I am fine. Like there's nothing wrong with me. It's like going under the water, and when I occasionally resurface I'm like ""what the hell is going on, I need help"" and then I go under water again.

Life feels similar to an acid comedown. Everything looks very high definition, like the quality of reality was switched from 480p to 4k. This makes going outside terrifying and overstimulating. I've been abstinent from weed for three months but it hasn't gotten any better, it's gotten worse. I'm unable to visualize anything, and thus am not able to recall memories, my memories are vague and un-detailed images that cannot be held for more than a second.
My mind is disappearing, and with each day that passes suicide seems more and more appealing. Without a functioning mind, how are you supposed to make it in the world? Have relationships? I can't even make the most simple conversation anymore because conversation requires thought and emotion. 

I'm getting an evaluation soon, and seeing a therapist but the purpose of therapy is clearly not to put back together a broken mind. I have not yet been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but both my doctor and therapists agree that it's most likely whats going on here. Positive symptoms started after a couple of psychedelic trips and heavy weed abuse, and negative symptoms began at the start of puberty. I didn't know what was wrong with me, I was emotionally numb, had a monotone voice, didn't ever feel lonely even though I'd spend most of my time alone. Before puberty I loved social interaction, but after it was painful and I avoided it as much as I could. For the next couple years when I would hang out with friends I would be silent almost the whole time. I had nothing to say, and when I did it would something weird and socially inappropriate. My brother also has psychosis, so it runs in the family. 

Some questions I have about this illness are, do anti-psychotics help with disorganized thinking? Do people struggling with schizophrenia ever recover from this sort of mental disfunction? Does the lack of emotions ever go away? If this is gonna be my life going forward, I don't think it's a life worth living. I don't have any suicide plan, so you don't need to comment about that. I just need advice about what the next step is. Thank you for reading.

TLDR: My thoughts have become incoherent fragments that I have no control over whatsoever, and I have no ability to visualize or recall memories anymore. I'm pretty much unable to read, and emotions have gone away entirely. Even anxiety. Do antipsychotics help with these sorts of symptoms? Ive only felt anxiety and fear since 7th grade, and now even anxiety is gone...is there any chance of recovering from this?",20Nov2020,1
223,"So I live in Canada. Currently in Grade 11. But haven't even started yet because of me. I've procrastinated for 6 months out of 2 years (with this being the 3rd year) that has started and I haven't done any course work. Total number of courses I have done 5 Gr.9 courses and 4 g.10 courses. With the total amount being 30 credits. Meaning I have done 9 credits. This doesn't even include the 40 hours of community involvement. I'm sure I fucked up and now all I can think about is this. Can't help but tear up a bit because I made stupid moves. 

I'm not like other students. I don't think I'm overly smart but I'm also not someone who thinks they can just make a comeback from screwups. I really need help.",20Nov2020,1
224,"I am a 17 year old boy, currently in my junior year of high school, and I am really struggling wether I should quit the only sport I play, ice hockey. This dilemma has been giving me anxiety for years now, and I really want to get this off my chest. I started playing hockey when I was 10, and I used to love it. I used to be truly dedicated to getting better, and I would train in my front yard every single day for hours.

A few years passed, and until I was in around 14, when kids were allowed to hit each other on the ice, I believe everything changed. I have always been very small and skinny, so I had a lot of trouble with this new change. At the start of the season, the first thing I noticed was that everyone on the ice was so much bigger and better than me. This is where I began to lose confidence in myself. As the season progressed, I became aware that I began to lose motivation and love for the game. I would also get a lot of anxiety every time I played, because I felt very embarrassed about being the worst out there. However, I fought through it, and I even received a reward for sportsmanship from my coach at the end of the season. 

By freshman year in high school, every player who was as bad, or worse than me quit the program. For around the past three years, I’ve been the worst on the ice. I always felt embarrassed and could never focus during practices, because I could not stop thinking about what the other kids were thinking and saying about me. I believe that the constant feeling of being the worst over these past few years has really destroyed my confidence, and affect the way I feel outside of hockey.

I understand that it is mostly my fault for not being as good as them, and I don’t expect any sympathy for it. They have much more of a drive to improve and make varsity than I do. However, these past few years I have just had no motivation at all to improve. I just can’t stand the sport anymore. Every time a game begins, I stare at the clock the whole time, waiting for it to end. 

I have tryouts next week, and I really want to quit, but if I do, I will have no other sport to play. I come from a very athletic and strict family, and they will be very disappointed in me if I quit. I’m not sure wether to push through these last two years, or just drop the sport and focus on something else for these final two years. I want to thank you if you read this far, and I would appreciate your help. Thanks.",20Nov2020,1

226,"I've had clinical depression for a while. My mom has taken me through therapy, counseling, doctors, even the ER. I really hated that time of my life, therapy sucked, meds sucked, everything sucked. 
They made it very clear though that the only way to make it end was to prove that I could act safe though, so I complied. And somehow I kind of got better for a little while. I had goals, energy, and stayed clean from self harm.

But recently verything has unraveled again. I feel like the band-aid that was put on my mental illness has finally fallen off. Everyday I feel on the verge of s/cide. 

Part of me feels compelled to tell my mom what's been going on, but she's either not going to take me seriously or panic and make me redo everything. What should I do?

My parents aren’t divorced either so it was points when we are all home together. I don’t feel bad about it, I’m just concerned about my father. I’m moving away from my family soon and I feel like he might get emotional after my departure. And honestly I don’t feel comfortable when any one gets emotional it feels really weird to me.

I'm pretty sure some of our co-workers is catching on (based on my behavior around her) and one of them asked if I do like her (which I told them, as it was obvious and felt hard to say no). my only problem is, I have a hard time just saying it to the actual person (something that I mentally struggle with every time I really like someone and I hate myself when I miss an opportunity or when I even struggle saying it).

Now I'm about to work two jobs in a couple of days (reasoning for two jobs is a different topic for another day). while that good on some points.

230,"I had a college friend group of five. I lstopped speaking to my college best friend because I noticed every single fight in the friend group was started by her, and she was constantly nasty. There would be screaming fights because of her. It never involved me so I ignored it, but then she was nasty to me and I felt like I finally saw her for who she is. I'm still friends with the other 3 girls, one of them is my absolute best friend (ex roommate, known each other since we were in the 6th grade). She wants to drop this girl as well because of the drama.

&amp;#x200B;

Next I dropped my high school best friend, and because of this, I lost all my other high school best friends except for two of them. Our friend group was so tight and close because one of our friends died our Junior year and it really brought us together. I swore our friend group would be close forever. Me and my ex broke up, but he said he was never rlly in the group, he just dated me. 2 years later he's coming to hang outs and is best friends with them all again, including my best friend. He's going to her lakehouse with her and her friends. She's given him so much advice about me since we broke up. They're constantly replying to each other on social media (tik tok, twitter). It made me uncomfortable so I dropped her. Now suddenly her best friend from college is friends with my ex and also dating one of the guys that was in this friend group. Her cousins love my ex as well. I thought I could handle it, but obviously I know my roles and this friend group clearly no longer should have me in it. One of the guys also called me childish for not wanting my best friend to be close with my ex, so I don't see myself being close with him anymore. The rest of the friend group are guys, so I'm SOL there.  
My best friend is now one of the girls that also left that friend group, saying she realized she only liked the guys when we'd drink and have parties, and she hated my ex best friend. The two of us are still friends with one of the girls, who is balancing both us and them.

I was also in an on&amp;off again relationship. It's now off because he's depressed.

I know this is a part of life and i'm 21 so it's bound to happen. But it makes me sad. I wonder if I subconsciously got too upset at my ex best friend because I didn't want to be close to my ex out of respect for the guy I was seeing. I wonder if I just stayed calm if I'd have so many friends right now and i'd feel less depressed and lonely.

249,"I was in a relationship with a girl for three years, we broke up a little over two years ago. She was the girl of my dreams, she was insanely smart and beautiful. The last five months of the relationship she was in Singapore finishing her masters degree, I had gone to visit her and we had an amazing time (actually had planned on proposing to her while there thankfully didn't) however while she was in Singapore the relationship started to have problems. A lot of it was on me, sometimes I can be slightly the jealous type but it never was an issue before. While she was there she would go MIA pretty much the whole the whole day and I would only hear from her once when she woke up and once right before she went to bed. After a while it got really annoying and would cause arguments. I knew before she left it would put a big strain on the relationship.  


anyway..  


She got home around the 4th of July. Went and had an amazing few days then out of the blue she just called me and said its over, and literally never spoke to me again. Within a month of breaking up she was with another guy, this break up devastated me. I had already suffered from depression and anxiety and this sent me spiraling out of control. That Christmas even though it was silly I got her a small bag of all her favorite things as a gift and left it on her doorstep. I thought maybe I would get a thank you or something idk what I was really thinking but I heard nothing in return.   


Flash forward to today, over two years after breaking up. Essentially every night I continue to have dreams (nightmares) about her, me begging her to speak to me or her telling me its over again. Theyre painfully vivid. I dont even want to sleep anymore because now when I wake up, I get panic attacks and its affecting my job and my regular life. I never want to leave the house, I gave up trying for another relationship quite a while ago. My best bud tells me to go to therapy which I know hes probably right. I probably should have started going years ago. He is the only one who knows about the issues I have been having.

Basically what I'm saying is, I have my life pretty gosh darn easy.

When I got into high school though, I had a problem. Turns out, I was going through all of my life without even trying in the slightest, and I ended up becoming allergic to actual work. I didn't actually learn anything in school up to this point, I only had a general intuition on the subjects I was working on. Eventually, things started piling up more and more, I started falling behind more and more, until the amount of work I needed to do was basically insurmountable. I just couldn't bring myself to do ANY of the work anymore. My parents just let me stay home from school every time I felt down, and eventually I told them I needed to drop out of school. So they put me into a online school, and I thought it would be way easier.

Nope. The way it worked, there wasn't any set schedules, I had to just will myself to chip away at an entire semester. Obviously that didn't work. I told my parents about it, and they had me take some competency tests and turns out I was ready for the college level. Pretty weird, I don't really know how that happened, but whatever. So I just went to the local college, thinking, I don't know, maybe it would just be ""better."" Well... you can probably guess the position I'm in now. Where I've always been.

I'm behind there, and instead of doing any work, I'm just making this post on reddit. All of the work is probably actually pretty easy, this is probably the amount of work my girlfriend does at her college over only a couple of days. I can't do it. I'm barely getting out of bed in time for classes. To be honest, I'm not really sure what I'm planning on doing after college anyway.   
To me, if I were able to cut out wasting time spending countless hours watching youtube videos and the like, and entirely focused on my hobbies and my girlfriend, I would have a pretty happy and content life. The problem though, is like, food. That plan doesn't really include the whole, making money thing. I have pretty bad social anxiety, so finding a job seems pretty rough, and even if I did get one, it's not like it would be different from any other obligation in my life, I would just drop it.
I don't want to live off my family forever either, I want to live alone, or with my girlfriend, but I just don't know how I could do that. I really love other cultures, and I want to visit other countries, but, well money.

I could probably live with my girlfriend as she worked. She's been really competent throughout her life so I'm sure once she's done with college she'll get something well paying and it wouldn't be much of a problem. I don't even have the dumb macho ""I'm the man so I should do the working!"" type thing going on, but. I don't know, some hobbies do cost money, and so although I wouldn't mind being a house husband, being the money leech does seem like a bit of a problem to me.

Basically what I want in life (like food) requires money and I honestly don't feel like I have the capability of getting any of it.

So, easy solution, see a therapist, right? My parents don't believe in it. It's non-negotiable. Talked about it to them for the last few years and it's just an absolute definitive no. After bugging them enough they eventually got me some definitely not doctor gurus that sucked and I stopped bothering with them. I don't have the money to get help myself, obviously, so I don't know if that's something I can do.

Well, there you have it. What do I need advice on, you ask? A way to make money perhaps? Should I stop doing college? Should I ""suck it up"" and just find a job? Just what to do at all with my life?
I have a creative drive, so starting a patreon and putting all of my content on a platform to get people throw money at me would be nice, but, well, again, it's not like my hobbies are competent, or my projects are finished often. I probably don't have a good enough personality to make up for it either. Also, the odds of it working out are way too low to drop out of college in preparation for it. Why not get started now? I'm busy doing college! Sure I'm not doing the work but I sure am sitting around doing a whole lot of nothing thinking about doing work.

I don't know. Sorry that this doesn't end succinctly or with a plan of action, but if there was one I guess I wouldn't really be making this post, huh?

256,"Apologies about the formatting as I’m on mobile, but here’s the ‘sitch!

I’ve been working for this big corporation for around 4 years now. The department I started in (I’ll refer to it as ‘Dept. S’) was the department I stayed in since the very beginning. Since COVID happened however, our production decreased and I was laid off for four months. (To make a long story short - myself and my supervisor in Dept. S have a rocky relationship because I was bullied hard by another colleague. He mostly took their side because they played victim when I stood up for myself and I was laid off shortly after (possibly as a result of this.))

When I was called back to work, though, I was put into ‘Dept. C’ we’ll call it. I was under the impression that I would be back in Dept. S however my shift and department changed. I accepted either way, because HR told me production was picking up and now this department was backlogged. This was back in October. I am currently struggling in Dept. C because the setting is very different. I am more used to being on my feet all shift getting everything done whereas this department is just very.. do as you please &amp; ‘sit and work or something I guess.’ I want to bring it up to my supervisor that I have previous experience in Dept. S and am willing to work there on the new shift I was given, but I do not want to seem like I am picking and choosing where I go and what happens to my job. I know there’s a lot of thought and planning that goes into these decisions so I don’t want to be *that* person. However, I’m struggling here. 

Should I try to reason with my new shift supervisor and see if I can be moved? Or should I just stay where I am?",20Nov2020,1

I can just leave the moment I'm in and enter my thoughts, which no one else will ever be able to enter or fully understand.""

261,"Hey all, this is my first post ever so please be kind! I'm currently a third year business student in Canada and have to take this useless class about negotiating. While this class is mostly group work which I'm okay with, I'm struggling with one member in particular. For some context, my group consists of three females (myself included), and one male. Now to make myself clear, I believe that anyone can be sexist regardless of gender. In this case however, its the male in our group. 

During our first negotiation a few months back, he basically wanted to exclude myself and another girl from the discussion altogether, and exclusively wanted to negotiate with one girl who happens to be from the same country as him. I feel that it's important to mention that most of my program consists of international students - two people in my group are from the middle east and one from latin america. I could honestly care less about where everyone is from and have a latin background myself. The only reason I bring this up is because he tends to only allow the girl speak who happens to be from the same Middle Eastern country as him. Anywho, when I politely voiced my opinion that this was a group effort and that all members should get a chance to speak, he would raise his voice at me and basically say things to make me feel stupid. I just let it go and let him have his way. Myself and the other girl ended up only having a small part and only spoke for 5 minutes each while the others spoke for 30. 

Fast forward to now, I arrange a meeting with my group to discuss our next assignment and we are all on a voice call. It took EVERYTHING in me to not snap at this guy. Whenever anyone tried to voice their opinion, they would immediately get shut down by him and he would belittle them. For instance, I brought up a topic in which we should discuss (dairy trade between US and Canada) only to get YELLED at. I was told that I ""didn't know what I was talking about,"" and how I ""only read one line in an article and try to act smart."" He did this to another girl as well, like dude you can't handle a girl knowing more than you about something?  He just has this need to be right ALL THE TIME to the point where  the other girls just don't talk to avoid conflict. After this happened (literally yesterday), I am just still so disgusted by the way he spoke to everyone to the point where I'm strongly considering just dropping this course entirety. I feel like his behavior is largely due to the fact that he can't handle a woman knowing more than him... No one is trying to know more than anyone for goodness sakes, we just want a chance to share our thoughts. Also important to note, no one has EVER been rude except for him. I get along well with the two other members. I'm just so sick of being treated like I'm stupid, and being belittled every time I share my opinion. 

I guess I just need some advice here... Should I address this with him directly?? Should I go to my professor? I literally have so much anxiety at just the thought of working with this person, and I'm not used to such controlling behavior. Trust me, it's worse than you think. I can really use your advice here reddit.",20Nov2020,1
262,"I had my first day working at a tutoring center. During my own session, I overheard a conversation between a male co-worker and his student, a girl who was probably a sophomore or junior in high school. They were having random discussions, where she was extremely giggly. At one point, he asked her to help him make coffee, which is located at the end of a hallway in the back corner of the center. When they made their way back, she started a new discussion about how all girls have freckles in two places on their body, their wrist and left boob (she whispered the word boob). He proceeded to ask her if she had one there, and she said she did, along with the rest of her friends. He then turned her attention to her homework assignment on circles, by saying “let’s find the area of your boob.” 

Now, I know this is extremely inappropriate behavior when working with a minor. However, I am concerned about bringing up this interaction with my boss because everyone has been working here for at least two years, and I feel (1) she would not believe me because I am new, possibly resulting in me losing my job, or (2) something big would come out of it, and everyone would know I was behind his punishment, whatever that may be. I don’t think anyone else heard the conversation since there was only one other tutor on the floor working with a different student.

I was on r/AmITheAsshole about two months ago when I came across a story that this one woman posted (she was 22-24 years old). She said that she was living with her boyfriend, and had thrown out his beloved baby blanket, because in her mind he was, ""too old"" for it, and presumably not giving her enough attention.


She asked, AITA?


... I'd like to say that I was civil, and didn't answer. No. I was filled with RAGE for the boyfriend, as I still have my favorite blanket from when I was a toddler, and would rip into anyone who threw it out.


She said she realized she most up, but I still made an awful decision.


I. Went. OFF.


I called her a b***h, a w***e, a s**t, and every degrading thing possible that I could think of. I even said the f word a few times, and said that she wasn't deserving of a partner.


As soon as I hit post, I regretted the whole thing. Someone deleted it within the next few minutes, and her own post was deleted for being ""too comedic"" and in violation of some rule not long after. I quickly sent her a message and apologized for everything. I waited for a day and a half. No response.


I deleted my previous reddit account, reminding myself that I would never do such a thing ever again after this one occasion I happened to become so incredibly mad.



I can't stop thinking about her. People on there said some nasty stuff, but I think my post took the cake.


Was it narcissistic or sociopathic behavior?


.... what if she killed herself?


I'm probably over-analyzing, but it is still a probability. I can't take it back. I can't apologize. I can't tell anyone. Most of all, I just want to know if she's ok.

Then he made my younger brother do them with me. Because he (my brother) was bigger than I was, he would pin me down. I understand he didn't have a choice but that doesn't help anything.

278,"The title pretty much says it all, but I will go into further detail. The advice is at the bottom this is just an explanation 

My mother and I are immigrants. We moved here to join the rest of our family living here. My mother and I stayed at my uncle’s place because, my aunt didn’t have a job and was recently kicked out of my older cousin’s place. 

Here’s the thing though. My aunt has lived at my uncle’s place for four years. Yes four years. And during the duration of the time my mother and I had stayed, it was an additional two years. 

Within those two years my mother has found a stable job and a house to live in. My aunt on the other hand... not so much. Instead she spend her days browsing through Facebook and hoarding the small room that we live in with endless food that she will never use.

After two years, my mother and I left the house and lived in a new house across from the street. You would think that my aunt would smarten up and find a job now. Nope. She still browses Facebook, she still hasn’t found a job, and our house, freezer, kitchen, and closets are now filled to the brim with her stuff. And she keeps bringing in more.

Four years later, and as of just recently, me and my mother had finally confronted her about her behavior. She complained about how we were treating her like a “dog” and a “servant”. However that wasn’t what set me off.

When I had called her out during the fight, she said that I should stay in a child’s place and that I was disrespectful and had no manners. Keep in mind that I never really raised my voice at her at all. 

Then she goes on to mention my relationship with my father, who hadn’t spoke to a lot due to multiple reasons. She said and I quote, “That is why your father doesn’t talk to you, you have no manners”. I lost the little respect that I had for her now. You have to be that sick to not only shout at a child, but bring up their relationship with their father.

1. I am 100% expected to drink, and if I do not, people will pick up on it and they’ll suspect the situation. I do not want this option, so I will drink. I will probably drink far less than normal.

But lately and since quarantine happened, things have turn... different. We fight a lot almost everyday and somehow he always manages to do something that upsets me.

Lately he doesn’t want to have sex anymore and he says he’s just not horny anymore, but I still catch him fapping in the restroom or the shower every few pair of days. He won’t text me as often anymore and says that it’s because he gets carried away doing other things, things such as grocery shopping, sometimes work, hanging out with his 2 best friends, and playing videogames pretty much all day which I completely understand, but back then he was much busier and still had time for me and now he doesn’t have much to do and it feels like he’s avoiding me. He used to be so cheesy and romantic for the first 2 years but that suddenly changed, he still says loving things but it’s not the same anymore.

Lastly: I don’t want to sound crazy but something that has me suspecting the most is his social media accounts. Sometimes he goes to sleep at like 9 pm and “go to sleep” but the next morning, either Facebook or Instagram would say that he was active up until like 3 am. He always seems tired now and if I ask him at what time he went to bed he always says right after saying goodnight to me and that he slept all night but still feels tired and it must be work. He’s always been secretive about his phone and I’ve never hid anything from him. He takes his phone to the toilet and to the shower sometimes, I don’t even know his password.

Am I crazy? My gut tells me that something is off and if i’m right, confrontation will come last because if he’s cheating on me I think it’s fair to think that he will completely deny it, specially if it’s only based on a feeling. I just want an outsider’s opinion on this. What do you think?",20Nov2020,1
286,"CW: Depression

For comtext: I have been diagnosed with persistent depression about half a year ago. 
I've really struggled to do things lately, the only things that I'm doing right now is getting out of bed and going to school, because I have to. I'm not really doing anything else, when I get out of school I go straight to the couch. I have absolutely no motivation to do a single thing. Sometimes I want to do something like longboarding, but I just can't get myself to do it. I keep thinking things like 'What if people will judge me"" or ""what if I fall down"" and it keeps me from doing it. I'm really struggling with it and I want to do stuff again. Does anybody know any advice for this?",20Nov2020,1

289,"Recently I’ve wondered if I have a problem. I only noticed it a couple months ago, but I’m 26 years old and I haven’t gone a full day sober since I was 21 years old. Sorry for the novel, but here’s my life story lol. 

I’m a white, thin, blonde, affluent Canadian girl, and I’m not overly confident so I hate saying this but guys do generally find me pretty. Ugh that was painful to type. 

Anyways, I used to do coke very regularly when I was 18 but quit after about 5 months when I realized just how addictive it was. I did mdma from 18 to 22 pretty often as a party drug, too. I think I probably did about 40+ caps, but I eventually stopped after watching a friend O.D. (she was okay in the end but scary enough to ruin the experience, I did it once after and it was never the same). I still do shrooms once every summer, so I feel like that’s okay.  

I used to drink to the point of borderline blackout or straight up blackout at least 1-2 days a week from 15-17, and at least 4 nights a week from 18 to 21. I cut back significantly for a few years after a few too many mistakes, but I’ve slowly fallen back into getting drunk 3 nights a week on average. 

I started smoking weed pretty regularly at 18. And it turned into a poppers (cut cigs and weed through a bong) addition at 20 until I was about 22-23. Then I went back to straight weed and haven’t stopped since. It was very excessive for many years, like 2.5 ounces a month. I lived in a haze. In the last year (since my breakdown, more on that below) I’ve cut it back to about an ounce every month and a half to two months, and only smoke at night (or weekend days when nothings going on - but cutting back has really helped with getting my social life back so this rarely happens). I still get wrecked most nights though with back to back bong hits (sometimes mixed with a bottle of wine).

I’ve been smoking cigs since I was 17 too. It started as a when I’m drunk/ stressed thing but it turned into a daily thing when I quit poppers. I was up to five pack a week but now I have it under 2 packs a week at most. I’m trying to quit completely. 

So yeah, since I was 21 I haven’t spent a single full day without either smoking weed  or drinking (or shrooms/ mdma..... or doing Valium/ opioids once each). That’s about 5+ years. 

I guess I should mention that I was in an extremely toxic/ emotionally abusive 6 year relationship that I got out of a little over a year ago. I suffered through depression for years, was very suicidal for as long as I could remember and I self harmed from the age of 12 until I was 24. After a friend passed away from suspected suicide and I sought out a couple months of therapy, but I was still struggling though. July 2019 I had a very bad couple weeks of what felt like endless panic attacks and essentially a mental breakdown, but I’m so glad it happened now. That’s when I really put the effort into cutting back on weed and smoking cigs, and started doing yoga regularly, taught myself guitar, made/ reached out to friends and so much more. I’ve worked extremely hard on my own to change my mindset, and it’s worked for the most part. I’m in the best place I’ve ever been. I’m happy most days, and I have the tools to keep the depression at bay when it rears it’s head up.  I probably still have an eating disorder though. 

I’m seeing someone new after a year of “finding myself” after my ex and he’s really great (not that the bar was high), despite being a bit of a goof. I work for a very well-known company at the head office’s e-commerce team, my resume kinda kicks ass for 26, and I have a couple contract marketing gigs too. I’m financially secure with a cool spacey condo in the city. I’ve slowly built some of the friendships I ruined during my worst years. 

But I still can’t go to bed sober. It gives me anxiety just thinking of it. And it’s not like I just have one bowl of my bong. I probably average 5 bowls a night, and a lot of the time there’s alcohol involved, or I’m pretty damn drunk if I don’t have weed... but it’s only at night, rarely do I get drunk or high during the day (maybe 3 times a month..).

So yeah, if anyone actually made it though all that crap - Do you think I have a substance abuse problem?",20Nov2020,1
291,"I'm on mobile so sorry for the grammatical errors.


I have been wanting to get a gaming laptop for the past month and everytime I tried to order one something bad ends up happening. 1st I order it and it magically gave back my money, this was solved by best buy giving me a 24 hour notice to pay it back the laptop or I won't get it. I payed for it and then went on for my day.

 Incident #2 Best buy when being sent to the delivery company to come deliver to my house it didn't put my full address so which casued the delivery person to sent to the mail in which it was retrieved by someone else. My brother called the delivery company to see what we can do and they told us that they'll do an investigation and to see what went wrong. Well nothing ever happened so we called best buy and we told them what went wrong and they gave us three options, Option #1 we can get another one delivered, Option #2 we can get a refund, and Option #3 we can ship to the nearest Best Buy so we can pick it up. We went with option #3 and went on with our day.

 Incident #3 Today we get an update saying ""There's none in stock"" and if we want a refund we only get half of we I paid for. Even though I've never gotten it and they know I haven't gotten it. Of course we tried to call but no answer.

292,"Start of the story is:
My wife dated someone from 14-19, she wanted to wait til marriage to have sex. This is an important fact for the story. 

At 17 her bf starts working at a place her mom works at. They start going to lunch together as they are around each other a lot. The bf was not so nice to my wife because of the sex thing. Over the course of the next month her mom goes to pick up her bf cause he needed a ride somewhere 3 times. The bf is a friend of the family and close friend of her brothers so it’s not too odd. 

My wife and her bf have a blow out about sex and he says he doesn’t need her anyway he hooked up with her mom. She’s devastated and runs to her mom and asks if it’s true she says he came on to her. Her mom told her it’s in the past and to shut up about it and be quiet because it will ruin the family. So hard for me to write this right now my heart is broken for my beautiful wife/best friend/soul mate when I heard this.

She finds out that he also had cheated on her with another girl and she was 7 months pregnant. Obviously he breaks up with her. They all go to the same church and my wife is forced to sit in silence while in the same church next to her mom and her ex and his new pregnant lady. 

The brother and mom keep inviting the bf over to the house because they like him. She asks to please stop. They say they like him more than her anyway so they will keep inviting him over.

The baby is born and my wife spends the next 2 years sitting in church every Sunday with these people who have wronged her and broken her heart like I’ve never thought possible. And the bf, new wife, and child are invited over to the house randomly.

I just found out and I have been clutching my soulmate and my heart is broken for her, but rage has emptied my heart when it broke and I want revenge on her mom and that piece of garbage human being of an ex bf. 

She is 30 now and we’ve been married 4 years. Tonight I found out. What should I do, because I just want you hurt them like they hurt her. The father doesn’t know this happened and he is my idol, excellent human, so caring and would do anything for his family.

295,"So I’m a junior in college and most of my friends are seniors, we are all off campus and throughout the semester we seem to be talking to each less (which is like fine bc people are busy) but it seems like it’s just me out of the loop. They have a group chat for their senior classes so I’m assuming they just talk on there and rarely ever use our old chat now and it’s gotten to the point where I just haven’t talked to some of them in months. 
I had some conflict with someone in the group which may have caused the distance but we are fine now and all is well. Idk I just feel sad bc i feel so left out and idk how to tell them that I feel that way. Only 1 or 2 talk to me regularly (and like I’m fine with just getting sent memes or something, it doesn’t have to be like heavy convos) but it kinda hurts Because I considered so many of them close friends and they all made a point to get involved in my life regarding the conflict I talked about to say they care about me and they’ll always be there but it seems like that’s not the case and I’m just like an annoying sibling who sometimes gets to join or something idk. 
I don’t think they mean it, but sometimes I’ll ask in the group chat for help and I feel like I’m bothering them or something idk. I don’t think they know about how I feel, am I just being needy? How should I communicate? Should I wait until winter break to see if anything improves?",20Nov2020,1

I am not only close with her but my family is close with her family as well and I fear if I put myself out there and get shot down I will not only lose a good friend but also create distance between her family and my family as well. We also share a lot of the same friends as well. She recently broke up with her boyfriend of 3 months.

Like I get it it was a big chuck of her life that was pretty traumatic and isn’t easily gotten over so I’ve kinda ignored it. But she was over tonight when her ex called her and was texting her saying he gotten into a fight and couldn’t remember if they broke up, which was apparently months ago, so Ik this dude is being full of it. And I thought she finally just got over it and started to ignore him. But I went to go grab her a glass of water and shortly I got back into bed she told me she wasn’t gonna spend the night cause she had work in the morning. Yet she works at like 11am and said she didn’t wanna do the 40ish min drive in the morning. So she left and we have plans for tomorrow n shit. But I can’t help but feel off about it all, and I can’t tell if I’m just being insecure but I can tell that he still has a manipulative hold on her.

300," 

I’m in need of some real advice and yes I’m going to turn to the wild wild west of the web (Reddit) to get it. I’m now 34 (M) and I have really drawn the worst card in the deck when it comes to romance, intimacy, affection and a life partner. To make matters worse I’m the kind of guy who really likes affection, kisses, tickle fights, hugs, having a partner that desires me. 

Having said that, here are a few highlights from my life.

* First GF abused me and treated our 8 month relationship when I was 18 like a job to break my values. This put me off relationships for 4 years. She also cheated on me for half that relationship with my former best friend.
* Didn’t lose my virginity till I was 26 to a random hooker….. Sad I know.
* I got married in 2015 after an 18 month dating/engagement period. I left her 6 months ago so 6 ½ year relationship. With some hindsight I know I married her out of desperation, she was my second girlfriend and I thought I should get her while she is offering. What a mistake. Intimacy was once every 2 months, if I was lucky. Even then most of the time it was “okay my legs are open, you’ve got 10 minutes” all this while she played on the phone. It also hurt as i often caught her using toys and the internet to set herself off. Kisses, hugs and hand holding weren’t common and I stupidly stuck out the marriage for this long as I thought things would change. She also had double standards, would emotionally manipulate me, Do all the taking and none of the giving, we both worked full time and I still did the bulk of the house work. I could go on and on but I think my point has been made. 

Now I’m out I’ve been trying to get back into the dating game. Pretty much my first real go at dating as my wife and I moved fast when we met via an online dating website. I moved in with my parents for a year (got 6 months to go and moving out) to get back on my feet. My life is okay otherwise as I’ve lost weight, made some money, getting my projects done for a hopeful career and so on. This is a small town and I think I’ve tried every girl I can find on any dating app, going out has proven fruitless and I really would like to meet a nice girl who wants a relationship with me, be it something casual or more long term. I always give anyone I meet a chance, just wish the same applied back. I also won't lie as I’ve been dry now for 18 months, dam ex wouldn’t do anything with me for the last year of the marriage. I honestly feel that sexually I’m still a teenager who is yet to experience too much into the field of under the blankets. The only time I’ve ever felt desire is when my ex wanted a kid and gave it to me 5 times in 3 days, one and only time that has ever happened to me.

I refuse to roll over and die when it comes to life. I really have tried to make friends and find a life long partner. But I’ve tried and tried and tried and nothing. Even a friend that has my back would be an amazing addition to my life, with benefits even more so. I’ve joined hobby and social groups, am trying many dating apps/websites, heading out over the weekend to see if I can meet anyone. I’ve even gone deep into my past connections and friends to see if anything could be found that way. I’ve added wood and paper, put fuel on the pile and used a flamethrower and I still cant make a fire, that is how it feels to me at least. I know I might have better luck in the city, which I do plan to move back to, or a new one, still not sure yet. But I need to get this project of mine done first. Can’t concentrate on it too well but as my loneliness keeps creeping back in. Feels like an endless circle that I can’t escape. 

I do want you to understand that I always try and keep a glass half full mentality, if I don’t get off my butt and try, nothing will ever happen. But what am I supposed to feel like when I think I’ve tried just about everything I can and nothing. Let me give you a little rundown on my dating tactics. 

Things normally start out okay, especially with online dating. Go through quite heaps of swipe rights or sending hello messages to get a few matches or replies (depending on the dating app). Most of the time unless I keep the conversation going and come across as a bit desperate doing so it fizzles out. The few times I’ve gotten to meeting in person (I normally like to suggest a coffee for a first meeting) it most of the time never happens (get stood up). I completely understand I’m not meant for every girl, and that is fine. But you would think I could make it to the coffee date to at least meet a few. I’m also not going to repeat my past mistake of being desperate, why a casual fling or friend with benefits would be really welcomed right about now. As of yet I haven’t made it far enough with a girl to make my mind up if I want to continue with her or not yet. 

I personally don’t think I come across desperate or come on strong when talking to ladies online. Every girl is different and I’m not aiming to please everyone, but instead be myself. But something must be going on if I can’t even convince one girl to be me a college try. Now I do have a few extra kilos, currently still going down as mentioned above 22kg in 6 months and counting. I also will admit I normally choose girls of a similar size to myself as I doubt I’d have much luck with the skinnier ones. Please note I have nothing against skinny or big ladies. I have my own personal tastes and know my limits, that is all there is to it. Besides I’m attracted to a few curves, truth be told. 

So here I am thinking I’ve tried everything I can and getting nowhere constantly going around in a vicious circle. I crave someone to share my life with. I want to shower her with affection and love, while getting the same in return. Until that time I got no outlet for all the love and affection I want to give and loneliness is really starting to set in. Start most days full of energy that something will change today, only to go to bed deflated. Really at my wits end and now asking you fine readers on Reddit for advice and help.

If all you want to say is to hang in there something will come along, thank you but I need practical advice. 

TL:DR - I’ve been given the short end of the stick when it comes to affection and love in my life and after trying everything I can think off to solve this problem the world has chosen to laugh it all back in my face. What am I to do?",20Nov2020,1

They were all about it. I gave them everything they asked for. The producer however didn’t. We got an email saying that they were going to go with her idea. I couldn’t help but to feel hurt because.

1. She was leaving at the end of semester(which the organizers don’t know about)
2.  She Was not nearly as invested as I was.
3. I feel like she purposefully told them that “the ribbon (more of a stroke animation) was too hard to animate.”

306,"So to start off my mom has not been the best parent and my dad was even worse. She used drugs when I was growing up and I still have issues with being alone to this day (about 8+ years ago). Might be abandonment issues I’m not sure. But she also became an alcoholic after she stopped using and still is to this day. She is a pathological liar and has many psychological problems. My dad got my mom addicted to drugs and used to abuse both her and I. He was also 30 years older than her btw (older than my grandparents). My grandpa came and got me when I was about 5-6 cause the state was about to take me away. 

As you may guess me and her don’t get along much. We have our ups and downs but I’ve honestly given her so many chances when she’s done wrong with me and the rest of the family. Just recently my great grandmother passed away. My grandparents seem to be trying to keep me out of what goes on with the family considering I found out the day after she passed by my mom. My great grandmother lived in a different state. My grandparents went to the funeral and my mom flips out because I couldn’t go. I am a college student and some of my classes require me to be in a meeting or else I will automatically fail the class. I also live on campus as well. She told me that, “I’m ashamed to call you my son”. She didn’t even go cause she said she had to watch the dogs. As I argued with her she said that I’m exactly like my dad. 

As my birthday approaches followed up by Thanksgiving, my grandparents most likely want me to come home. Personally I don’t want to go home because of my mom. But I’m honestly not sure what to do. I’m wanting to know if I’m the one causing issues/or if it’s ok what I’m doing. Also I’m not sure if I should just cut my mom out of my life for good or my family in general or just to keep it as is.

307,"Help, please!

When we found out both of our universities would be continuing with fully online classes for the spring semester, my friend said we should move out and get an apartment together. I said yes.

The past few weeks, I've realized how unrealistic the whole thing is for me. I make about $750/month (before taxes) working between classes. In our home town, two-bedrooms start at about $900/month, not including utilities. One-bedrooms aren't much better. I'd also have to pay for gas to get to work, food, and other costs associated with having an apartment that I don't even know about yet. I've been looking into other jobs, but I really like the one I have now, it just doesn't pay very much.

I also really want to save up, mainly because when COVID cases improve and I'm allowed on campus, I'll be moving countries and I'll want some savings to rely on while finding a new job there.

The reasons I haven't told her this:

\-She can't move out by herself, and she lives in an abusive household. I want to get her out of there, and I feel like it would be very cruel to give her the hope of escape and then back out.

\-Neither of us would be living comfortably, even though she makes more than me.

\-Maybe it could still work and be a good time.

\-I've already agreed to it.

309,"So, I decided to upgrade my pc. I lost my job some time ago due to covid, but they still gave me about 1k local money a month as “pocket money, it’s for you to spend on what ya want” (their exact words, translated).

I buy a CPU since that’s the only part I was saving up for before my worked for income died. Well, no problem they say. I’ll pay them off from that pocket money they give me. I cover 1/4th of the price, they cover the rest. All is cool. No sweat.

My motherboard does not support it and I was the absolute lobotomite who didn’t check first. Ok. I order a new one. They say I’ll pay them back from that pocket money. Little sweating occurs.

Now my mental deficiency widens. I picked a wrong one. 880 local cash gone. We’re all on the edge. They still cover it. I am really torn up inside. 

1450 locals, and I got the correct one. Ram is incompatible. That’s 1300 spent on ram. Now I’m worried sick, sweating intensifies. I know I dun goofed.

That’s somewhere in the 6k-8k range of local cash. I can’t front that. There’s no fucking way. 

Ok, so I propose I find a job. I know I won’t be an exec or drive a new car every week of course, so it would be a menial job. If I’m lucky maybe McDonald’s, if not, they are always looking for people to sort fruit at a packing plant here.

And that’s where everything goes sideways. You see, they tell me I am not to work like that. Paraphrasing: I should focus on my university and getting that degree (I dropped out a lot due to a long history of substance abuse). There’s no need for me to work until I get that degree. They will cover all my needs and wants. Just get your lazy ass together.

They are great parents, just to say before you think they are abusive or something. They paid for my therapy, they supported me through 16 years of addiction, psychosis and suicidal behaviour. They even paid almost 1.000.000 on my brothers brewery startup (before it devolved into him drinking with his buddies, who are co-owners and blaming it all on “them officials not bothering to work on [my brothers] papers to open that business up.”

So, excuse me, but what the fuck should I do? Asspull that 8k? If I’m not to get a job I am quite sure there’s no way I will suddenly run into that kind of money. 

I am utterly confused on what the problem here is and what do they expect of me. Is it financial? I can sell some old computer parts I got lying around and maybe knock up to 1.5-2k off that debt. But is it really about the debt? The emotional pain I inflicted? The irresponsibility?

Sorry reddit for that shitty rant I just pulled. But I just hope maybe someone can make sense of what they want or expect of me.",20Nov2020,1

323,"  *NSFW* might not be necessary but it mentions a violation of sexual nature 

  This happened over two years ago at this point and I don’t know if it’s fair to call it assault but I don’t know what else to call it. My best friend(I’ll call her J) of 13 years has been with her boyfriend/son’s father(and call him P) for 8 years and some change. She is like a sister to me, her family is my family. She has been the one constant in my life since we were children and any issue we’ve ever had we have always worked through it, the best friend I’ve ever had. 
  
  Her boyfriend is a serious asshole. Has been pretty much from the start of their relationship, they fight a lot. He’s strayed from the relationship a few times over the years(once while she was pregnant, might I add..), I won’t lie she has too. He has his good moments but for the most part, I’ve always wished she would drop his ass because even though she’s made a few mistakes of her own she deserves so much better. 
  
  However I get what it’s like not wanting to leave an unhealthy relationship, you get used to it. It feels “comfortable” even when it’s uncomfortable. It’s easier in a way I guess, and of course, the love is there. And they have a son so I get why it’s so hard for her to leave the relationship. 
  
  So I’m sure it’s needless to say at this point, that I’ve known him as long as they have been together. J, P, and I as well as my ex-bf used to hang out most weekends or days off. We spent tons of time together over the years. We’d stay the night at their apartment, and a lot of the time in the past years I’d stay there without my bf(ex or current[J.R.]). 
  
  We drank pretty much every time I’d stay. I always felt safe there, even when I was blackout drunk I never felt like there was even a chance P would ever be inappropriate with me. A smart ass or a dickhead? Sure, he could be a real prick to me if I stood up for J or ever called him on his bullshit. But never that. So anyway, it was back in 2018 my current bf had a class in the morning so it was just J, P, and I hanging out. We were drinking and were pretty wasted and all decided it was about time to go to sleep so I went to lay down on the couch and they were heading upstairs. 

  So I’m laying with face towards the back of the couch and all of a sudden I feel this hand between my legs, it proceeded to swipe across my crotch to my ass and then smacked it. As I said before I’ve been best friends with J for forever so I assumed it was her drunk ass being a perve, just goofing around because she was wasted so I started laughing and turned to see P walking quickly away from the couch and up the stairs.. 

  I was so confused, I just sat there in shock like... did that just happen? Did that motherfucker just touch me like that? This guy who I’ve known all these years? My best friend/sister's boyfriend? I was in the room with them when she gave birth to their son for Christ’s sake, I’m his godmother. I was horrified, mortified. So I start freaking out, crying, trying to find someone to pick me up at 2:30 am. I called everyone I could think of, no one answered. 

  Like I said before my bf(J.R.) had a class that morning so I didn’t want to wake him but had no one else to call and I needed him, needed to get out of there. I called him, crying hysterically so he came to get me and once he picked me up I told him what happened. He was so angry he wanted to turn around and confront him but I begged him not to, not that night. 

  Anyway, I couldn’t figure out what to do, I just couldn’t understand what happened or why or how. So a few months pass and at this point, I have avoided hanging out at J’s house because I couldn’t even around P, I still hadn’t told J about what happened. How do you tell your best friend something like that? So eventually I just decided to pretend it never happened because I guess it was just easier to. Easier to hide from it than to break my best friend's heart. 

  I started going over there to hang out again but only if J.R. went with me, I refused to go without him. So long story short, it finally came out one night when J was fucked up and P decided to treat her and everyone else like shit. I got upset, I told her mother what he’d done. Her mom convinced me over the next few days to tell J the truth. 

  I ended up telling her, it was horrible and she understandably freaked out and begged me to tell her exactly how it happened. I told her exactly what I remembered and she basically gave me an ultimatum. Either I say I know for a fact he did it on purpose, it wasn’t a drunken mistake and I rip her family apart. Or I say I’m sure he didn’t mean to, that maybe he had mistaken me for her or something because he was so drunk. I was drunk too and honestly, didn’t know if he meant to do it to me and I couldn’t stand being the reason they split up especially because of their son. 

  So I told her it must have been an accident, P said he didn’t remember it happening at all but apologized anyway and we all decided to try to move past it. Until the first time we all hung out after J and I talked about the situation. We start drinking and P immediately starts in on me, like he’s testing me. Trying to show me he won, trying to show me he can get away with whatever he wants. 
  
  We spent less and less time together because J.R. and I couldn’t stand P’s bullshit anymore. I’d get upset and cry or get pissed off when my bf and I would have deep talks because no only is it painful to watch your friendship deteriorate. Especially because you feel like you can’t be honest with her without losing her. But also because I was violated by her boyfriend whether is was intentional or not, IT HAPPENED. I've been sexually assaulted before and she knows that. I thought she would understand why it's hard for me or anyone else to let something like that go. 

  Fast forward to Sept 2020. We are at their house, having dinner and drinks. We all drink too much and J.R. was running on like no sleep. P, of course, says something crappy so J.R. just flat out asks him about the situation from 2018. He then admits to remembering it happening but that it was an accident. 

  So J(BFF) and J.R.(bf) somewhat get into because he thinks she deserves better than this dickhead. He was sick of acting like what happened didn’t happen and seeing me hurting because of it. Since that night, I’ve talked to J maybe twice. I’ve tried apologizing for hurting her and tried to explain to her why it got brought up again but she hasn’t responded in a month at this point. 

  I understand why she is sad and angry and confused about why it’s getting brought up again after all this time. But I can’t believe she’d just drop our friendship. ANYHOW, I’m so sorry for how long this post is! I just wanted to get some feedback from someone outside the situation and didn’t wanna leave out any details. Am I overreacting? Are my feelings justified? Appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this monstrosity of a post, thanks so much.",20Nov2020,1

My (27,F) spouse (28,M) and I broke up in January of this year. We started dating at 16/17 years old and got married at 22/23. He was my first everything but I was not his. Full on broke up: he left, I packed, got an apartment, my brothers moved my shit, etc but nothing legal (so we’re still legally married). 

This man is my best friend and even though we weren’t together anymore, we still talked every day. We were apart for almost a year (a COVID year which omfg was the worst year to be newly single) and now we are treading the waters of being back together. We’ve both done/said things that cannot be taken back and some things were done while we were broken up FOR ALMOST A YEAR that we don’t necessarily want to talk about together. 

What explanation do we owe each other about our time apart? Does our 11ish year long relationship have a chance even with that amount of time spent apart? This man knows me better than anyone and I don’t want to feel like we’re keeping things from each other but at the same time...why share things that will only cause each of us pain?

another thing I think, I just yesterday realised is that he is really cynical, while I rather try to be happy all the time and see the good in everyone.

Until last week when he reaches out again. My wife immediately shares this with me and his email is essentially copypasta from the one he sent 2 years ago only it’s “please don’t tell your husband”

My wife and I haven’t decided what to do about this yet. He’s not violent or confrontational and to our knowledge he doesn’t live around here. 

So today, his girlfriend Facebook messages me. She tells me her boyfriend (my wife’s ex) and her have broken up. This breakup also occurred 2 weeks after their child was born. Once my wife gets home from work we’re going to discuss this latest message and figure this out together. This girl wants to ask my wife if she experienced any abuse by this man and she also disclosed that she’s preparing for court herself.",20Nov2020,1

344,"I am basically an introvert, very shy, reserved, calm, hate confrontation, and getting into arguments. My old roommate was behaving in a very rude and disrespectful way multiple times so I moved out of the house last week and I paid them the rent for the time I stayed there minus some money they already owed me. They then contacted me continuously asking me to send the entire money claiming they don't have enough money now and will be paying me back later. I do not trust them and don't want to lend money and I have told them repeatedly I won't be able to help and I don't have money myself. But since they continued to disturb me I blocked them everywhere and thought the problem is over. They now called my dad and told him that I blocked them and not responding to them and asked him to talk to me. I am very angry about this and that they involved my dad but as I mentioned earlier about my character, I am unable to do anything about this. What should I do in this situation?",20Nov2020,1

346,"Okay, I am going to try and explain this as best as I can. 

I've been struggling for over two years now to get out of debt so I can lead a normal life again. The backstory isn't all that important, but I will try to sum it up as best as I can. Basically, I got divorced about 6 years ago. I basically got nothing out of the divorce and ended up having to rely on credit in order to rebuild my life, albeit on a small scale. That, by itself, put me in a position to where I had to file for bankruptcy. It helped... For a while. Flashforward about a year later and I got involved with a woman who turned out to be a thief. I was giving her every dime I made thinking that the bills were getting paid only to discover upon our eventual breakup that she wasn't using it to pay the bills at all. I ended up taking on the debt of that relationship (because I'm kind of a push over) and had to take on new debt to once again rebuild my life. 

I've been paying my bills for the past year and a half but only because my best friend has been super awesome and basically letting me live with him for close to nothing (to be clear, I do help pay half of some of the bills, so it's not completely free). However, I wasn't planning on living with him for as long as I have and the only reason I'm still here is because literally every dime I make is going towards paying for some kind of debt. But at the rate I'm going it'll be years before I can finally get my own place again and that's assuming I don't wind up with another unexpected bill that puts me right back at square one. 

I have about $25,000 of debt and probably make about that much every year. I'm at my wits end with it and I really don't want to be 45 (I'm 39 now) before I'm finally debt free and able to live on my own again. I'm living in a tiny room in the back of a trailer with 90% of my stuff in a storage unit. I don't get to see my kids as much as they deserve because I don't even have a proper place for them to sleep when they visit. What I need are some strategies for getting through this debt as fast as possible. Should I just say screw my credit and just focus on paying off one bill at a time and just dump all my extra funds into it or do I just suck it up and stay the course by continuing to pay all the bills? Is there a way of doing this that doesn't require me to take on more debt? Any advice here would be extremely helpful.",20Nov2020,1

348,"Whether I work in an office setting or retail, I tend to not meet bosses' expectations. They ether demand perfection, something I won't pretend I can achieve, get tired of how long it takes for me to learn new tasks (typically I'm told I should have it down to perfection after a couple weeks of employment), or they penalize me for taking absences due to my health and frequent physical injuries, which are generally aggravated by the jobs themselves. I have moderate scoliosis with a pelvic tilt, and I'm prone to back injuries (just got off of bed rest from one that I caused from reaching too much above my head). I also have metal in my ankle from a bimalleolar fracture and dislocation. Overuse causes it to strain and sprain, and I'm put on crutches or in a walking boot at least twice a year, almost always while working retail jobs.

So when I got a job at a gas station where I'm not expected to be perfect and am not considered an at-will employee, I was thrilled. Unfortunately, I hurt my back sprained my ankle in the 5 months I've been employed there. I love my bosses and team, but it's physically just too much. They're also legally exempt from having to give 15 minute breaks and 30 minute lunches per my state's normal law, so I have to be on my feet for 8 hours at a time. I also have a degree, yet I only make $1,100-1,200/month. Rent is $550. I don't want to be poor anymore. 

The change would be risky, though. I fear getting a new job at a call center or something else within my skill set, having a boss be unsatisfied with my work for any reason, and being let go as a result. I fear that I'll take too long to learn the job to perfection or get into the correct routines and be let go - once, I was let go after 2 weeks and at another job after 6 weeks for that reason. But I'd have significantly fewer absences since I'd get injured less often, and if I were to get injured, I could likely still get to work. I could also make significantly more money...if I'm not let go.

One other factor: I'm applying to a grad school program, and my current job will cover 50% of my college tuition as a part-timer, but I also have severe mental health issues and know I can't handle over 40 hours a week for work. If I get a full time job, that's it. That's my one job.

Do I take the leap or nah?",20Nov2020,1

353,"Hi I’m 19, I live in Arizona and I’m in need of some serious help , I have an ex that has emotional and mental issues I was in a relationship with her for about 7 months and I’ve noticed problems within the first couple months like accusations of cheating , not taking responsibility for her actions, and shifting the blame on me for problems and arguments she would commence. I over looked these problems, I know I should have left there and then but I had this false hope that she would change or learn to see the error of her ways and work on them. Things eventually got a little better but problems would still arise from time to time. Fast forward a couple months and we ended up moving in together, this is were everything went horribly wrong. She was working an 11 hr+ job at the time and I had a job with few hours , she started accusing me of cheating again and that I didn’t do much to help her out at home, I had a few female friends that would text me over Snapchat and to her this was cheating. One morning I saw that her phone had received a text from her ex and I waiting till she woke up to ask her about it , when I brought it up she got into a frenzy and was acting as though I did something wrong , she then ignored me when I asked why she was texting her ex and why she couldn’t just talk to me. She kept walking away from me and I eventually stood in front of her and said “ just talk to me” she pushed me out of the way and tried jumping out of our second story apartment window , she had attempted suicide once prior to this event so I wasn’t sure if that’s what she was attempting to do at this point. I held her back and asked her to call down and that’s she’s acting erratic. Afterwards she attempted to walk out the front door and I stood in her way again. She slapped me and tried going out the front door I attempted to stop her from behind and she pushed herself back into my chest we both fell on the ground I ended up on top of her and she continued acting chaotically for a few minutes. Then, she calmed down and later left for work. Later that night while home alone around 10 or so there was a flashlight shining through our bedroom window , and I was receiving a phone call from an unknown number. I later realized it was the police , she had told them I hit her and wouldn’t let her leave. I explained what had happened but they ignored it and arrested me on the spot , handcuffed me and took me to the police station. My family bailed me out and I was allowed to return home. She called me crying about “ I didn’t know they’d take you to jail” or something similar to that. I’d asked her why she would do this to me and she responded with “you made me angry and I didn’t know what to do.” I avoided her for a while after that. A month passed and I had been given more hours at my job , my parents didn’t know and had made plans on that day so they weren’t able to pick me up from work. I live about 40 minutes or so away from my work by car and couldn’t get a ride at the time so I made a huge mistake and accepted a ride from my ex to my house . My mother had been staying in touch with her for the last couple months and she was aware of her mental issues including heavy depression. I thought it would be okay and that I’d help with her depression if we got to have a conversation. When she picked me up I had noticed scars on her wrists , I asked her about them and she replied by saying she tried killing herself but was to afraid to go through with it. A few days later I had a police man knock on my door and handed me some papers , it was a restraining order she filled on me a while back. A week or so passed until I’d mention the scars on her wrist to my mom. My mom thought that it’d be a good idea to have her over for a night to talk to her in an attempt to make her feel better and provide comfort. This soon proved to be a really bad idea. While the two of them talked in my mothers bedroom I went out to the back yard as I shouldn’t even be near her because of the restraining order. While in the back I was on a phone call with a friend , my ex then called me and I didn’t answer. She thought I had left so she stormed out the front door towards the park that’s maybe a minute walk from my house. My mom asked me to go get her before she hurts herself. I hesitantly agreed and followed after her . I found her within a few minutes and she started yelling at me for not answering her call and not telling her where I was. I mostly ignored her and walked her back to my house . When we got there she went on a tantrum yelling about how much she hates me and how evil I am for not taking her into consideration. She was screaming and crying on the floor in front of my entire family. They calmed her down and she slept in our guest room. The next morning I woke up to make breakfast and realized we were  out of milk, I went into our garage were we keep our spare fridge in search for a gallon of milk. When I opened the door I saw her on the concrete floor laying in an unorthodox position. I approached her from behind and placed my hand on her back quickly in an attempt to wake her. She complained and accused me of kicking her. I replied by saying “I’m done with your bs , if you’re really gonna continue acting immature I’m breaking up with you. We’re done” she bolted out of the house and called her dad (a retired cop) saying I kicked her, he called the cops and told them I assaulted her. Within a couple hours the cops showed up to my house to arrest me , I wasn’t there . I was at my lawyers office asking for advice on what to do. The next day I went to work , about 2 hours in the cops showed up and arrested me for assault. I asked how could they do this without any evidence. The cop replied with “she had a cut on her shirt” from a kick ??? I asked how that would even be possible and the cop didn’t reply , I invoked the 5th and refused to talk to them as last time it proved to be futile. They took me to the police station and I again had to get bailed out by my family. Fast forward a couple months , she’s continued to call me consistently and sending me texts. She threatened me that if I don’t take her call that she’ll tell the cops I showed up to her place and assaulted her again. Knowing she would probably get away with this I felt as though I had no choice but to answer her call. The call went badly and ended up with me telling her to leave me alone. This is where I’m at now , less then an hour ago I received a text asking “ Is this (my name)?” I feel as thought she reported me for breaking the restraining order, I don’t know what to do. I have a feeling this is either her dad or the cop that tried getting in contact with me the first time they arrested me. I can’t afford to get arrested again and I’m in fear of what’s to come. What can I do ? This post probably won’t be seen but thanks In advance for any help.",20Nov2020,1
355,"So story.
We live in Hawaii, and one of friends just moved here from Maryland.
We’re throwing a thanksgiving party next weekend and everyone is bringing food/ potluck style.

Since my friend just came to the island, we wanted to invite him and make him feel included. 

My gf planned on making Vietnamese “pho” from scratch as well as pumpkin pie and green bean casserole. Since pho is something she would eat at thanksgiving with her family, our friends were excited to hear that she’s making it to share with us.

But, when my friend came over to our house, he said “eating Asian food for thanksgiving is weird, you should be eating mash potatoes not Asian food. Your family is weird”. - even though she’s Vietnamese and this is what her mom made on holidays for them.

My gf in response said, you don’t have to eat it if you don’t want too. That’s why I’m making green bean casserole as well as pumpkin pie. 

My friend proceeded to make a joke and said we should uninvite her to the thanksgiving party since she’s going to bring weird food. 

Since moving here, my friend has been very rude about Hawaiian culture as well. 

I want to address him about this, but I’m clueless on how to approach it.

357,"Hello reddit, I really need some advice on what to do, I'm pretty sure my mom is cheating on my dad, if not that, something is for sure going on.

Backstory:

So, I was never really suspicious of my mom, I've noticed some weird patterns but nothing too out of the ordinary to make me ask any questions. Well, until this morning. I got out of the online class (I'm in HS) and really needed to go to the bathroom. I busted out of my room and saw the curtains shut in the living room (which is very weird because we never ever keep them shut). The moment that I got out of the room, my mom shouted at me ""I'm changing!"" but I swear, I swear I saw her phone turned on, pointing towards her and there was someone on the screen (she was in a video call with some guy). After I was done peeing, my mom shouted ""I'm going to take a shower"" (which again is weird because she rarely takes showers in the morning before work, and if she does, it's usually at about 7 am, but this time it was like 10 am). She left her phone behind tho. I saw the opportunity and took it, check her last tabs ""Whatsapp"" alright nothing suspicious so far. Went to check her call logs, she was video calling someone named Alice or Emilia or something like that. Checked the messages she had with that person and found some very questionable ones, nothing I could prove my point with' but enough to raise my suspicions. I confronted her about this (I am a pretty confrontational person, and if I smell bullshit, I'm most certainly gonna call you out for it). She denied it all saying that I was crazy and that the music that I listen to is not a good influence on me (i mostly listen to rappers like Polo G, Lil tjay, King Von, Popsmoke, Nle Choppa, Nba youngboy.. etc) oh yeah and all the classic stuff like ""How would you like if I went through your phone"" and ""How dare you accuse me?"". She went through a lot of phases this morning. She was going from ""HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME?!"" to ""Whatever you think you saw, it's not what you think"" and when I mentioned the call logs she was like ""Yeah but I always video call \*my aunt\* and \*her best friend\* "" which is a dumb excuse. I had to finish that conversation with her because my next had class already started. I genuinely don't feel anything for her besides anger (It's not like I was very close to her, or anyone in that matter anyway, (i am a very cold person and don't really care about feelings and such)) but this whole thing gives me a weird feeling, something I've never felt before, I'm guessing that that is because I can't rely on her anymore, either way, I'm not going to tell my dad about this because I don't want him do go ballistic (He was in the military, has years of karate and some anger issues, but he's always been mad protective over my mom and mostly me)

359,"I work at a UPS Store.  Right now, my store is facing some serious understaffing and my store owner (Boss) is having a hard time trying to find another employee. We had a new employee 5 weeks ago. This guy works right near us so he was able to get hired because of his experiences.

I've been having a difficult time working with him because he's been constantly making mistakes non-stop. My boss has been telling me to keep an eye on his work and try to work together. It's incredibly hard since I have to work over 10 hours a day at his store because of the understaffing and the mistake he makes are usually not correctable but easily preventable if you pay attention. 

This coworker is in his 40s, he's a single dad and I feel like a lot of the stuff he says is pure bluff. He lies \*a lot\* and is very talkative and ""charming"" since he tries to engage with customers unnecessarily, which some have tried to ignore him. He definitely doesn't act his age. He blares the radio with horrible rap music, constantly complains about the workload, takes off his uniform when he feels uncomfortable and talks back to customers frequently.

Today, we got a domestic shipping request from a customer who had 90 packages to send. It was easily 3 hours worth of work and the coworker had about an hour left on his shift. He only had a 4 hour shift but he decided to take his sweet time to eat lunch. He's been disappearing from the store constantly and has a habit of going to the bathroom many times, especially when it gets busy. My boss has been of absolutely no help in dealing with him since firing him would put him in a worse situation cause it would be just me and another guy (a student with limited flexibility) working at the store. My boss asked me what he was doing and I told him right in front of the coworker that he was ""just eating and not helping at all."" Boss confronts him but the coworker gets angry at both me and my boss, being extremely hostile to us to a point where my boss says ""screw it"" and leaves us alone. Some arguing between us ensues and then the coworker finally leaves and now I'm in at a bad place where I likely won't get along with this coworker anymore.

I am trying to apply nonstop to other jobs but the jobs I'm looking for (basic tech jobs) haven't reached back. I really can't fathom starting over at another retail job. I need to know what are my options to make sure I can move forward with this job in one peace.",20Nov2020,1
360,"I was hoping someone here could answer some questions I have about the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. I'll leave a TLDR at the bottom for those who don't wanna read the context. After a couple months of heavy cannabis use, I started to experience paranoia. Thinking that any plane that flew over my head was gonna drop a bomb, that people on the street wanted to hurt me, stuff like that. I then got obsessively into religion, and entered an eight month long psychosis where I had no awareness that I was sick. I thought I was becoming more enlightened, which I see in retrospect was part of the illness. Over those eight months I started to experience very bizarre thoughts; random phrases and noises in my head. My lack of insight prevented me from seeing this as a sign that something was wrong. The delusions got more and more intense, until I started getting visual hallucinations. It looked like translucent tv static that danced around on blank surface, forming vague patterns, particularly when i smoked weed. Then the static started moving like liquid across the wall and pulsating. 

After 8 months, I began to notice something was wrong. I couldn't feel empathy, or any other emotion. I was losing the ability to read; my eyes scanned over the words but my brain wasn't able to piece them together. When I looked at people I couldn't focus my attention on them, I was unable to fix my awareness on their face or make eye contact. I then decided that I had gone crazy. From this point on any apparent control I had over my mind disappeared. Over the next month things went from bad... to hellish. Everything started to look foreign, not distorted, but unrecognizable. I'd look at a person and it was like I had never seen a human before. My thoughts went from weird and chaotic, to incoherent but at least somewhat connected, to disconnected fragments of thought that finished before they made any sense. My mind jumps from one unrelated thought to another, and I can't even call them thoughts. I'm starting to lose self-consciousness... like even though my thoughts are insane and my emotions are gone, there's a weird unsettling feeling that I am fine. Like there's nothing wrong with me. It's like going under the water, and when I occasionally resurface I'm like ""what the hell is going on, I need help"" and then I go under water again.

Life feels similar to an acid comedown. Everything looks very high definition, like the quality of reality was switched from 480p to 4k. This makes going outside terrifying and overstimulating. I've been abstinent from weed for three months but it hasn't gotten any better, it's gotten worse. I'm unable to visualize anything, and thus am not able to recall memories, my memories are vague and un-detailed images that cannot be held for more than a second.
My mind is disappearing, and with each day that passes suicide seems more and more appealing. Without a functioning mind, how are you supposed to make it in the world? Have relationships? I can't even make the most simple conversation anymore because conversation requires thought and emotion. 

I'm getting an evaluation soon, and seeing a therapist but the purpose of therapy is clearly not to put back together a broken mind. I have not yet been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but both my doctor and therapists agree that it's most likely whats going on here. Positive symptoms started after a couple of psychedelic trips and heavy weed abuse, and negative symptoms began at the start of puberty. I didn't know what was wrong with me, I was emotionally numb, had a monotone voice, didn't ever feel lonely even though I'd spend most of my time alone. Before puberty I loved social interaction, but after it was painful and I avoided it as much as I could. For the next couple years when I would hang out with friends I would be silent almost the whole time. I had nothing to say, and when I did it would something weird and socially inappropriate. My brother also has psychosis, so it runs in the family. 

Some questions I have about this illness are, do anti-psychotics help with disorganized thinking? Do people struggling with schizophrenia ever recover from this sort of mental disfunction? Does the lack of emotions ever go away? If this is gonna be my life going forward, I don't think it's a life worth living. I don't have any suicide plan, so you don't need to comment about that. I just need advice about what the next step is. Thank you for reading.

TLDR: My thoughts have become incoherent fragments that I have no control over whatsoever, and I have no ability to visualize or recall memories anymore. I'm pretty much unable to read, and emotions have gone away entirely. Even anxiety. Do antipsychotics help with these sorts of symptoms? Ive only felt anxiety and fear since 7th grade, and now even anxiety is gone...is there any chance of recovering from this?a",20Nov2020,1
361,"Hey all,

I caught myself into this very unpleasant situation, feel torn and broken about it.

I am 25 years old male, single, without kids, living in Europe. Cca. 2 years ago I met this girl, 27, Latin - American, while we were traveling around Europe. We spent a day toghether, hanging out, eating, exploring the city, just having fun. Even though nothing happened between us, we stayed in touch over social media, having long chats and videotalks daily for around a year. During that time I learned about her pretty awful ex who cheated and left her after then already had settled together, had two kids. I didn't think about it much, thinking we probably won't meet again again.

Fast forward, eventually she told me she'll be visiting Europe again. I helped her plan her 3 week journey, we also spent a bit more than a week together, exploring my country, but we also got romantically involved. I was fun, but I felt a bit hesitant, thinking, this is going too far, even thought I enjoyed it. Eventually she had to leave back home, we both had some hard time, but countinued to stay in touch for another year.

Well, this second year for a bit more bumpy. It wasn't just enjoyable talking with each other, but also a bit of tension of how to proceed with this situation. She has expressed her wish to be with me and to try finding a solution and be together, but I feel hesitant.

There'are some factors to consider that, honestly, scare me. First of all, we are an ocean away from each other, her moving from her country to Europe isn't a piece of cake. Basically, almost only effective way is for us to marry, which also doesn't seem like a very natural way for a relationship to develop, considering we have only met twice before. 

Secondly, she has two kids. Okay, I must say I am not sure how to feel about it, I have seem them while we were chatting, they are two lovely kiddos. But what worries me is following: In order for relationship to work, one of us has to move. That won't be me, because, truth to be told, there's barely work for citizens in her country, let alone foreginer who doesn't speak the language. If she moves, what's happening with the kids? Now they live with her, but she say the deal is that they go to live with their dad for a while (since they have been with her for the last three years). Alright, but is she going to be okay with being so far from them? And seeing them only a couple of times a year, or even less? If they come with her to Europe, is their dad going to be okay with this? What happens after few years, who gets custody then? These are just hypotetical situations in my head, but I guess reasonable enough to make me feel concerened...

I love her, she is the best person I have even met. So loving, genuine, carring, supportive, without her I would have way harder time getting through my education and life (which hasn't been kind to me either lately). I really want to make her happy and give her what she deserves, because life really hasn't been fair with her. She deserves so much, but got so little. But my indecisiveness and fear of such commitment is making me paralized. We don't move anywhere. She told me she feels stucked loving me, but we aren't even a couple. We tried stopping to talk before, but somehow got back to each other again.

 I have been undermining all my chances for a relationship with other girls in last two years, always keeping her in mind. I realize what we have now is very unhealthy, just as she says, we're stucked. As I said moving forward with this relatonship scareds me due to uncertanities, but the ideaa of stopping to talk hurts me beyond words.

Can anyone give me a resonable advice? I know you'll say I have to decide, etc. But how can I do it? Can you tell me how? I'd be very very grateful.

Thank you.",20Nov2020,1
362,"My parents were creatures of mediocrity. My mother had been raised in the genuinely authoritarian culture of Iranian girls' schools before moving to an Iranian neighborhood in turbo-capitalist Germany. She developed dreams of gaining great wealth, living youthfully past her youth, and travelling the world that were typical for German women of her generation. She was able to travel the world a little bit and develop a modest white collar career and move to America, but she did not really achieve much. My father was much the same. He was a tortured middle child who felt lost and under-appreciated by Iranian upper class live. He moved to America after spending his twenties traveling to be a French teacher and enjoy the beaches in Southern California. They were married in their late twenties and my twin brother and I were born when my mother was 32. Though they were people who possessed adult discipline and stable careers, neither of them were able to live with much purpose, which they did not mind as much I would have.

My parents held a sense of disappointment and resentment towards a structured, hierarchical family life and society and ended up raising me with no structure in my life at all. My parents felt that there was something heartbreaking and mean about forcing your children to be disciplined and active and taking too many important decisions away from their control. They wanted me to forge my own identity and ""follow my passions"", but without structure, the only ""passion"" that I had any access to was watching tv and snacking all day. I spent my entire childhood like this and I had quite a few embarrassing behavioral problems from my social isolation and from being told I was ""special"" because I showed great promise in school in my early days. I had no real identity during my socially isolated elementary school days, where I went to a small, cloistered Montessori school where everyone knew each other but no one was really close. I then went to a private K-12 school full of rich kids because my father detested the public education system for being too left wing and having poor history courses. At that school, it was extremely hard for me to make friends because the norms of the cosmopolitan rich kids were so alien to me and because they were all so close to each other. 

My parents died when I was 16 and I ended up failing school that year because I lacked any discipline despite being very ambitious. I finished high school four months ago at 19 through tutoring and I am currently sorting out the details so i can start junior college. I never got to know my parents very well since their lifestyles were sedentary and they had partied so hard as young people that they treated the rest of their lives with less interest. They were very kind and wonderful parents with only the best of intentions, but they did not provide me with any interests, any structure, any well of experiences to look back on, or any purpose in life. My parents ran through all of the hallmarks of middle class childhood such as vacation and occasional trips to McDonalds with me, but they did not do it with great conviction and I was always too lonely and in my head to enjoy anything. Their sedentary way of life was too poorly formed for them to be truly competent and involved parents.

All I have ever done in my life is watch television, fiddle around on my computer, and eat. I am physically disgusting and my body is fully of stretch marks that are disgusting to everyone. I have no experiences to look back on fondly or with regret. I have only a boring, sheltered childhood of television and a long history of embarrassing and usually effeminate attention-seeking that was caused by my loneliness and my lack of social training by my parents and Montessori school. I feel so inferior to others my age who have already had sex, posed pridefully for senior year book photos, gone on family vacations, and had more interesting and fulfilling relationships with their families. I have no identity and no experience in life. Nothing about me is tragic or interesting. I am just a poorly formed person from a poorly formed family with so little identity and experience. The only thing that I can honestly describe as an experience in my life is my parents' deaths, which was a nightmare that taught me nothing.

Has anyone else had this sense of lacking any identity or purpose? Has anyone else felt inferior because their life was so much less eventful and social than other people's lives? How can I pursue a life of meaningful pursuits and interests despite lacking inspiration from childhood and a solid identity with a bedrock of of non-cringe childhood experiences to look back on? Do you have any advice for me to accept my poorly-executed, uneventful, and embarrassing childhood? Thanks for reading.",20Nov2020,1

364,"Hey !

So here is my situation, i'm currently a junior developper in a pretty small company.

My job is to develop an app, but since I'm the only ""computer scientist"" in the company, I end up helping left and right for various tasks (excel projects, server setup etc ...)

We're going to have a trainee for a week (he's in school, so I think he's 15 or 16).

I will be in charge of him, and I have no idea what to do with him.

Should I just explain and show him what I do ?

Should I try to give him some sort of project ?

Honestly any ideas / suggestion is welcome, I'm not very good with people, and I remember my traineeship when I was his age, and it was awful. I literally sat on chair all day long doing pretty much nothing. 

My goal is that he enjoys this week, and goes back to school with a good idea of what life in a small company is like.

365,"Before this incident I was an absolute prude. I was a virgin til 21 and lost it to a guy I really liked. Unfortunately, things didn’t work out and I was extremely heart broken and tired of dating guys. I met this guy, friend of a friend, on a night out once after being really sad over that other guy. I was extremely drunk and he was very good looking so obviously I enjoyed the attention. He still lived at home with parents, so he convinced me to get a hotel room with him. I don’t know what the hell I was thinking, like obviously this guy just wanted to have sex but all my brain could focus on was feeling liked again, wanted again, I just wanted to feel that again. 

We made out for a while but all I remember is him getting very, very forceful. I said no many times but I remember how he was holding me down with his arms, I couldn’t move if I wanted to. I kept saying no but eventually I thought ok, it’s my fault for getting a hotel room, it would be embarrassing if I didn’t just give in and sleep with him.... So I did. 

I also had my period. TMI, when I woke up the next morning there was period blood all over the sheets. I felt so dirty and SO disgusting but then for some reason I continued being fwb with him. I even remember explaining it to my best friend and she said to me “i think it was good that he was forceful because you needed the experience” so I assumed it was fine until I recently started thinking about it more.

This led to me having casual sex with him for months and with 5 other guys within the same year (I was really against casual things until this happened). I honestly didn’t recognize myself or maybe I just brushed it off.

I just wanted to ask you guys - was what happened normal, or am I overthinking it?",20Nov2020,1

369," They've been in a rocky relationship for years, but not anything extraordinary, at least I would think so. In the past few days they've been fighting again, but a little more intensely. So I heard my mother on the phone talking to her friends about how I'm the only one that knows the password to her messenger (the facebook one), and that my dad cannot access it. Her tone was quite a bit secretive sooo I became curious. And around half an hour ago I decided to check on her messenger to see what she was hiding from my dad. And I saw her conversations with 1 man, whom I deem to be her ""2nd lover"" (oh man it hurts so much to write these things). They were talking about like excuses to give to their families to meet up (I think he lived in another city), and many hearts and stuff that would definetely not be approporiate for just a normal friend. So the question is, what do I do now? I haven't told anyone at all, because I'm so stressed out about what I found. Maybe I should never tell anyone to keep the family together? Or should I be honest about it and tell my dad? Does he know about this? Because their fighting was pretty intense, so maybe he has an idea, or is even fully aware. What do I do?",20Nov2020,1
370,"So my freshman year of college, I met a girl. We first started talking in one lecture because we were randomly assigned to each other for an assignment. We really hit it off for a few weeks until I finally built the confidence to ask her out. We then dated for 7 months and the few issues we had together were easily squashed and our relationship was extremely passionate, strong, and we were so close and so in love. She became the first girl I fell in love with and subsequently lost my virginity to. I only mention the latter because it's an important factor that I've payed attention to as to why she's so stationary in my heart.

During our whole relationship, I had been working to transfer to my dream school. In the earlier days of our relationship we spoke about it and how it would affect our relationship. Naively, I said it wouldn't at all and the conversation was basically over. Once I was accepted to my dream school, months had allowed me to realize the reality I was heading towards. My new college was only an 1hr and a half away, but I could tell that it felt much farther away for the both of us. 

2 months passed following my acceptance and my girlfriend at the time was not taking it well. She was extremely upset a lot of the time and emotionally in pain. I couldn't bear to see her like this, so I drove to her and essentially abruptly ended the relationship... bawling. 2 years have passed and I've been with multiple partners, but never long term. I've ended all of the relationships. None of them have amounted to her. Not a day has gone by in which I don't think about her. One thing I said to her the day I broke up with her was, ""Don't worry, you'll find somebody and eventually you'll move on."" At the time, I didn't realize who I had met. Now I'm afraid she has taken my advice and I've failed to move on. All that I'm confident in is that she is the most wonderful person I have ever met, and I believe, will meet. 

As of now, I'm mostly just focussing on telling her how I feel about her and what I've learned and experienced these past 2 years that led to me realizing that I truly never stopped loving her. I just don't know how to do so. I have terribly regretted ending our relationship and she deserves the biggest apology for my abrupt and sudden ending of our relationship. 

Essentially, I'm afraid that she's moved on and/or she hates me. I do NOT know what to do and I've been sleepless thinking about how to talk to her again. This is quite the emotional pickle. Help, please.",20Nov2020,1

381,"**I know this sounds kinda obvious but here is the full context (in Germany btw). Tldr at the bottom.**

(excuse spelling and grammar errors please. Sorry for the long post.)

I recently got fired from my teaching job (piano teacher) because I started wearing a mask and asked my students too if they are willing to wear one, to do that. According to my employer and her husband by doing that I am putting my kids in danger of oxygen deficiency, unconsciousness and potential death. I know that’s bs and refused to back down which got me fired. I’m not too worried about my kids, as it seems that all of them prefer to stay with me and have already told me that they will make contracts with me.  
   
 

A bit of background on them too: both have been sorta esoteric, putting crystals in their drinking water and using essential oils with their humidifier, etc. Nothing bad, and neither did they force it on anyone. If they wanna do that, I have nothing against it. However ever since the covid situation happened in spring the somewhat science-sceptic bubble they move in turned super conspiratorial, and they got dragged down with it. They don’t deny the existence of covid, but they strongly downplay its severity, and as said going so far to believe that masks are the deeply harmful things. I don’t know how much deeper their belief goes. I do know that they have regular contact (garden parties) with known covid deniers and essentially Qanon-believers, who are believed to regularly attend anti-covid protests that for sure will turn into super spreader events if they don't already have. Meaning that via my employers a lot of kids could carry it over to their family, and even into schools. Or similar situation if a kid caught it and passes it onto them.

Besides the masks I also know they don’t take the other regulations seriously, even though they say they do. They don’t air out the room nearly as often as they should, and I’ve yet to see them wipe down the instruments with disinfectant, or at least have the students (mostly kids. Important in a sec) disinfect their hands. Further they started hanging up posters and sending mail that spreads their anti-mask belief, the poster in their waiting room reads in big bold letters that kids are at the risk of severe health consequences, even death from a mask.

Talking to them about it is pointless. They start getting petty and seeing everything I say as a personal insult. I’m at my wits end there, and so is my brother, psychologist who studies those type of social phenomena in his phd thesis. 

My mother, my employers best friend of over ten years is set on staying out of this, and my dad, while generally on my side, often seeks the fault with me first, and says that sometimes I have to swallow my pride and comply to salvage a situation. I disagree vehemently with that, I know that the situation leading up to me getting fired is a she is the a-hole situation, but I had my not so stellar moments too as my voice tends to get louder when frustrated, however I was told that overall I handled it well.  
 

Thing is, and here is why I’m hesitating. With covid cases rising in the second wave, I feel as though it is only a matter of time until someone in her school gets covid, either cuz she catches it from those Qanon people’s garden parties, or one of her or her husband’s students bring it in. Either way I feel like the situation could in worst case become quite a spreader, especially would my employers be the ones to have caught covid. Besides spreading their misconceptions and potentially scaring the kids with those before mentioned posters.  
 On the other hand, that music school is her and husband’s retirement and entire existence (they’re mid 50s and mid 70s, age)). Should I report them to the officials and it would cause them to get heavily fined or even temporarily shut down it could destroy their entire life, existence and retirement. It might also break apart the friendship between her and my mother and potentially strain my relationship with my parents.  
 

I feel like an a-hole for doing nothing, as I strongly believe that in situations like this doing nothing is just compliance. But I might destroy their life, on the *chance* that it could prevent a death.

I don't know what the right thing to do is. I want to say that it is to report them, but I don't know if I can do it for said reasons. I could give an anonymous tip, but with the larger context leading up to this whole fiasco, and with how fragile my employers seem at the moment (my bro suspects that they have a strong fear of losing control, which reporting them would only reinforce) they would immediately single me out, and potentially go after me. I know that legally I'm covered as I haven't violated any laws or mandates, so I'm not worried or in need of legal advise. I need the human side of this.  


I struggle to find peace of mind with either decision. What would you do in this situation? Or what do you think I should do?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: employers, anti-maskers, fired me for “putting my students at risk” over me asking them to wear one, as state mandated. They also barely keep up with other spread-hindering mandates like disinfecting the musical instruments or airing out the room. They also have regular personal contact to known Qanon-ers, who are believed to attend anti covid protests regularly.  
 On the other hand my mother is best friends with one of my employers for over a decade, their music school is my employers’ entire existence. Potential retaliation as the mere context of everything that happened would single me out even if I reported anonymously.",20Nov2020,1

I’m aware im not in a relationship with that friend and that i shouldnt be like that but thats just how I am, probably my most toxic trait. 

The fact is that he is a straight guy, but he is acting weird sometimes. (Showed me his penis multiple times, knows im quite aroused by dominant men so he act like that and even told me he’d put something up my little garage bip but not his D cause he is probably ✨disgusted✨ by anal) but for example this morning he told me about that woman with glasses he saw, and basically said he’d slap her with his dick. Sooo i told him about that worker who came in my parents house to check something, and said he had a strong arabic accent, and then few moments later i told him his voice woke me up and he went « yeah, his voice his voice huh » like his face sent me jealous vibes (but not sure if im bein delusional) 

The fact is that i cant stop being jealous over the tiniest thing. I give him a lot everyday, like i wake up for him and call even tho i could still be sleeping just for him not to be alone in a his car in the morning (and many many other things) and it drives me mad he could imagine things like that with strangers who’ve done nothing for him. 

So i’d need your advices guys maybe about that whole situation or about how i could get rid of this jealousy feelings ?

I associate sex has bad so I get scared I’ll have to do it with a girl. I am a virgin and sex seems cool. However I’m just scared things will get real so fast. 

This is going to be a weird post. I feel like I’m doing something wrong when I get into a relationship or hold their hand in public. I want to hide myself. I’m not embarrassed of them by no means am I embarrassed of them. I get weirded out by people looking and smiling at me. I realized people smile at me a lot when they know I’m dating someone or with someone who is a female. 

I also get weirded out and lose my mind when my crushes who I have no idea about start to like me. It’s like I rather be infatuated by you than actually get to know you. When they do smile back, look back, say something to me or invite me. I want to run for the fucking hills. They don’t know anything about me and probably are only interested in my looks (again I’m not the best looking person or rich my ego gets to me) 

I’m not sure what exactly caused this for me. 

I [M20] rejected a crush or made it seem like I’m not interested when we first started talking. I couldn’t believe she liked me. Why does she like me? What do I bring to the table? I almost cried talking to her. I want to figure myself out.

They have three dogs who live exclusively outside and have at least two kids (that I know of). In their yard, there is garbage stacked up to the roof with barely a walking path for the dogs.

I’ve been really stressed for bills and though “why the heck not” with the intention of keeping everything online and only for a month or two making a few extra bucks. 

I then met someone who’s super rich. And I mean own his own private jet rich. We’ve talked a bit through video char and he’s convinced he’s in love with me. He wants us to get for me so he can come visit, get me a car, the whole 9 yards. 

The thing is I never intended to do this seriously. I know even tho I talk to him I could never have proper romantic feelings (plus I can’t see myself going to bed with him). But this is also money I would never have access to before in my life. 

Part of me wonders if I should just do it for like a year or something. Experience life from the other side. Have all my school paid for and travel the world (post covid) with my friends and buy things I’ve always wanted and never be stressed about a bill again.

397,"So before we begin, here’s a little background: Me and my friend (M), have been friends for a long time. After being in a small group of friends, we decided to be friends just us two as the other ones were mean.

So not too long ago, my friend started to get sick. She was feeling really ill and her head hurt because of anxiety, she told me it was because of the boys because they were always so rude. It did take time before she told me, but when she did I tried to comfort her.

And here’s where the drama starts: the teachers ask me to talk, and they tell me that M hasn’t been coming because of the boys, but also because she was scared to tell me that she wanted to talk to other girls in class.

Excuse me but, I was like wtf? I have various of reasons to be mad: first of all, we decided TOGETHER that we wanted to be only us two. Second of all, which is also important, I’ve been trying to include other girls to talk with us. For each time, she seemed uninterested, sad, and didn’t say anything. I tried my best to include her, but it didn’t work. So I ended up thinking she didn’t wanna be with others and she seemed happy. I even let her talk alone with her girl crush the whole night while I was alone and even gave away my bed so they could sleep beside each other.

She said she didn’t wanna tell me because she was scared of my reaction, when the teacher asked why, she said ‘because of the argument we once had’. Note that she DITCHED ME that day she‘s talking about, that’s because I was mad. Not because she talked to others. I even ended up having to apologize that time. The teachers said ‘but she has the right to be mad once’. What?

At this point, it feels as if she’s blaming her insecurities on me, and instead of talking to the other girls, she has totally stopped talking to me at school.

I’m so mad and so stressed that my stomach has been hurting/tickling, and I don’t have any appetite left.

What do I do? My parents say she’s not a good friend, as she’s made drama before. What she did isn’t good... but I wanna hear your guys’ opinion on this.",20Nov2020,1

401,"I \[31F\] have a 5 year old golden retriever. She is well trained and can play hard but has NEVER been aggressive. We have had issues in the past in every building we have lived in. I'm starting to worry I'm the problem.

First building: A pitbull across the hall would snarl and claw at the door every time I took her out when she was a puppy. It eventually bit her in the elevator when she was 4 months old. She was super traumatized, I was super traumatized. They ended up having to move out over the dog.

Second building: a black lab would make the same snarling noises every time we walked by the door. It literally shook the door and sounded like it wanted to rip us apart. I complained and took the property manager to see what was going on. They were horrified. I even offered to buy the woman a gate to gate the dog away from the door because my dog would cry when we walked by. They HATED us after that, but I was really scared the door would open one day while we were walking past and it would bite.

Now: There is a poodle in our building who has a problem with my dog, and apparently a number of others. My new building has a little dog park, and my husband and I rented the specific apartment in the building that we did to be close to the park to easily take her out. Every time we see this dog it loses its cool and starts going after us. It makes the first move every time. It's stressful for me and my dog, and I'm sick of having to constantly be on the lookout for it and sick of not being able to use the park when it's there.

So heres the AITA/WIBTA. Tonight I let my dog out in the park and didn't see this problem poodle (it was pretty dark). We had a problem. It started acting aggressively. The owner was very slow to intervene. This is the third incident in the park and the fourth total I've had with this specific dog, and we have lived here for 3 weeks. I lost my cool and basically very firmly told/yelled at the guy to take his dog and go. I'm sick of having to be constantly on edge because he brings his aggressive dog to the park. I think that is where I may be the asshole. I probably should have handled the situation differently and been more calm. I think I am getting really frustrated with the number of dog owners who think its ok to inconvenience everyone else for their aggressive dog. So far, the dog has only snarled and barked at my dog, but I know it has bitten at least one other dog in the park, and has problems with at least one other that I know of.

Now, WIBTA if I went to the building and asked them to either ban the dog from the park entirely, or restrict it to off times so we can avoid it? It has apparently bitten one other dog I know of, and has problems with another, and that's just the folks I've talked to in the last 3 weeks. My husband thinks I'm a bit of a Karen about this, and thinks I shouldn't get all upset. Basically, he thinks I'm the issue because we have had continual problems. I feel like you shouldn't be able to hold the dog park hostage by bringing an aggressive dog to it. So WIBTA if I reported?",20Nov2020,1
402,"I lost my best friend 4 months ago.

She was my person. My absolute favorite person in the whole world. I felt 100% comfortable with her and loved her beyond any words can describe. She felt the same about me. I know it for a fact cuz she kept telling me that. 

We started drifting away in quarantine. I didn’t feel like it was a huge thing because I knew her and I knew our friendship. It was strong enough to survive this.

We went from talking every day to maybe talking once a week. And by the end of July I offered her to meet up. She told me she’s scared and she doesn’t know why. I assumed she felt like I didn’t wanna talk to her and she was scared I was gonna leave her. She refused to talk to me, even on the phone and eventually stopped responding to my texts. On my last text to her I said I’m sorry if I hurt her in any way and that I’m here to talk whenever she feels comfortable.

4 months later, and I still feel sick to my stomach that I lost her, and even worse - without any explanation or a chance to say sorry for what I did and fix our friendship. I feel lonely. I feel hurt. I feel betrayed. I know I did something wrong, otherwise she wouldn’t have don’t that, but I don’t know what it is, and it’s driving me crazy.

403,"Hi, 
I (25M) am posting this here because I have come to the conclusion that I don't have enough balls to take a decision by my own.

I've been back to the University after 3years of doing nothing, to start a master's degree in nuclear physics. 

Class's been hard since beginning, didn't attempt to connect correctly with my mates mainly because I've been doubting this master since day 1. Not that I doubt that there will be any job, just because I don't feel it right. I don't enjoy things we study as I used to enjoy it, and well as a person who was used to have plenty of interests in scientific studies and being good at it for that, it's a (little) pain in the ass to feel being forced to study against my interest.

Although I'm like, ok, maybe finishing this master would be useful at the end.

These days I seriously think about leaving all of this for a minimal wage job, that would allow me to finally leave my parent's place, and be able to develop myself more. 

Of course keeping in touch with fields that are interesting for me would be certain, I just feel like I want to be more free.

404,"This is going to sound horrible but it torments it at night and I don't know who else to tell. Back when I was 14-15 I used to be, well, a stupid hormonal teenager and as someone like that I was also desperate for attention.

So I created a badoo account and I did shitty things, like catfishing older men and women into having a ""relationship"" with me, lying about my age, lying about my life, sending them pictures where I looked 18+ as I told them I was... I never sent nudes or anything, and I was lucky enough to really never encounter a real predator, only older people in university who just wanted to date and hang out.

It was shitty from me, back when I was that age I thought it was just lying but now that I'm 22 and I'm the same age of the guys/girls I used to catfish it makes me feel horrible to think I could have an online ""relationship"" with a kid 7 years younger than me and I couldn't know it, it makes me feel dread inside.

I got discovered three times because of stupid things like details about my life that didn't match, personal stories that were more typical from teenagers than from adults... But the worst case happened with a 22 years old guy who I ""dated"" for 4 months, we used to text every day, we used to talk about our lives and personal problems, he used to send me random pictures of his pets, family and friends and I only sent him pictures where I looked older.

But he started suspecting until he finally confronted me about who I really was and he pressured me until I told him the truth. And of course he reacted badly, he called me which didn't happen before, he was panicking and crying, he even asked me if I thought he was a paedophile or a predator and that's something that I still remember clearly these days because I never heard a man crying like that before. Until then I had inmature thoughts like men didn't cry like women do until I heard him. And it was what made me delete my fake social media accounts and even quit the internet for weeks, which felt like an eternity back then.

And the older I get, the worse I feel thinking ""what if I was in his place? what if I got catfished by a 14-15 child like the people I catfished to?"". None of them are in jail, none of them were paedophiles fortunately, the three of them inmediately cut contact with me after what I did. But I can't stop thinking how it would fuck me up if I was in their place.

And sometimes I feel like I deserve to be catfished, like I deserve to be lied and to go trought what they made me go trought. Sometimes I feel like I don't deserve people to treat me badly or to scam me. 

Because I don't know, I can't stop thinking if they hate me. Specially that university guy I ""dated"" for 4 months. But I can't contact him anymore and apologize or anything because he had such a common name that yikes. Also, I don't think it's a good idea to contact him honestly.

Do you think they hate me for what I did? It's been years and it still eats me inside, I've never heard an adult man crying like that before and after what I did.",20Nov2020,1

Lately I’ve been feeling very “bored of life” and have been roaming around my house in almost a dream like state. It feels like nothing is real, and very floaty sometimes.

I’m an avid video gamer and usually have no problems sitting at home playing games, I suppose you could call me an introvert. Recently however I will often sit at my desk and just stare at my desktop for 5-10 minutes then go lay on the couch and just kinda stare off into space. What used to be my number 1 hobby just doesn’t bring me happiness because I’ve been doing it all day every day since the beginning of the year.

I’m a high risk individual so I’ve quarantined since the beginning of the year, only to go to my local dollar store occasionally. All my friends are having parties, hanging out with each other and they’ve seen to forgotten about me. I haven’t had a text from anyone in months. 

There’s a party tomorrow where all my friends and many many people will be there. I won’t be going, but it just really sucks some people can just go on care free with their lives ...

However, over the past year I've started slipping down a slope of absolutely crippling self doubt. As with anything it started off without me really noticing it. Things like big decisions (expensive purchases, actual life changing things) got harder first, but since I've always been a little indecisive it didn't really seem all that odd. But now I question my little choices that wouldn't even cross my mind before. It took me an hour last night to choose that I was going to shower in the morning rather than in the evening. 

I'm so frustrated with myself. It's getting so stupid. I want to shake myself and scream to just choose SOMETHING. When I try to force myself to choose something it feels like my whole body goes into shock and I get a panic attack. 

I know there's more than likely a reason behind this sudden flood of self doubt. My parents and family have never been that supportive and I'm very used to my ideas being shot down by people I tell them to. It would be fine if they provided constructive critique or reasoning, but that's not what I receive. It's usually 'Oh you want to do that course? No."" with no explanation.

My boss is my boyfriends, brothers girlfriend and it’s caused some issues as she makes everything personal and lashes out at me in a very unprofessional way (swearing, saying we are friends and have a personal connection when we don’t.) She gave us all a choice to work Saturday to catch up because the department is behind because some people can’t do their jobs correctly and just automatically assumed my boyfriend and I were coming in on a Saturday when we typically have it off. So I spilled the news yesterday and told her we weren’t going to come in because we have better and more important things to do then work on the weekend (I.e, we have to try to sell our truck and get a new vehicle) she basically just stormed off on me, and acted like a total bitch about it. So I approached her and asked her what was going on and explained that I was given the option to come in or not and that’s when she basically told me that I shouldn’t have a job because I’m always a couple minutes late coming into work, and all this other stuff and made it extremely personal for no reason. Did the same thing to my boyfriend. It’s been what I considered a very one sided toxic relationship and she doesn’t treat anyone else in the department like this, whatsoever.

I was ill for 2 months and I still wasn’t quite right for a while after. 

I’m not sure if this was corona, because it wasn’t really a thing in the UK in January but it was horrible, I ended up bleaching my entire room and cleaning everything and buying hand sanitizers because I didn’t want to ever get sick like that again. 

Then corona became more of a thing here and it terrified me.

421,"I have zero stance on religion because it’s not my business. However this church is known for refuting science absolutely, causing members to make bad financial investments and aiding in the spread of misinformation. Currently our county has the highest Covid numbers and deaths in our state. This particular church encourages their members to not wear masks because Satan is a liar. They also force young members that have unplanned pregnancies to come full term and the church pastors keep the babies. There have been several reports of sexual misconduct in the name of the Lord, where one pastor will “heal” you if you preform fellatio. It’s fucking weird. Now that I explained why I bought the domain names, what do I do with them.

422,"I could be completely wrong on my observation and maybe just paranoid. But in the event I'm not I'd greatly appreciate any advice. 

I'm 22M my sister and her friend (F) are both 13.

Okay so Sis has been friends with, I'll call her A, for some time. Obviously they've hung out at our place and when they do I let them use my game systems if I'm home or when they were younger I'd wrestle with them, mainly my sister and have her attack her friend. 

More so recently, which is where my concern comes in, A has been asking about my relationship (I'm engaged but I don't think she knows that). Her questions always are directed to how long her and I have been together, if we're fighting, things that seem a bit odd to ask about, though that's my opinion. 

She also tried to get close to me when she's over, we have two couches, I'd sit on one then she'd sit on the same one too. 

Again maybe I'm reading this in a bad way, maybe she's just comfortable around me and all that. 

But what do you all think? Should I talk to my folks (I live at home) or to my sister to ask more questions? I don't want to accuse her or ruin her friendship or, at worse, make anyone think that I initiated anything.",20Nov2020,1

427,"Hello! 14M here.

I have a friend S. I helped him to become friends with a girl named A. 

They've been having an amazing friendship. Lots of fun chats, lots of gaming. They are like two drops of water - same interests, same humor, both are really smart.

It isn't only sunshine and rainbows, sadly.

Since S and I are really close friends, he often shares concerns. There have been some pretty worrying ones regarding A.

They had an argument because S had made an Instagram story tagging two of his female classmates. 

Another thing S has pointed out is the fact that A is cyber stalking him. I remember that when we three were talking once (that was a long time ago when I was still friends with A), A said, absolutely correctly, what phone S had, and that she knew that (A and S hadn't seen each other before). It was because the phone's camera made a tiny logo on one of S' photos on Instagram.

Third thing he mentioned is that he regularly sees her writing (without posting anything) in Discord chats he's active in, even though she doesn't do the thing those chats are related to (for example, the Minecraft chat, and she doesn't play Minecraft).

He also noticed that she changed her Discord status several times to match his. He attempted that 7 times, all of them yielding a change in her status, so it can match his.

A has also told S (indirectly) to not communicate with me, because I was acting demeaning towards her (which was true, for unrelated reasons, and it was my fault.)

Last, but not least, he has told me that when he starts up a game on Steam, he sees her online on this game a minute or two after he begins playing. She doesn't invite him as well.

I am pretty worried about my friend. I do not want to ruin their friendship, however. Should I be concerned? Should S be concerned? What should we do if our concerns are justified?",20Nov2020,1

436,"Hello there!

I've got a bit of a conundrum on my hands. You see, I am exactly 19 and a half (just to be exact) and I have never worked an ""official job"". Now before you think I've been doing nothing let me explain.

My family is in the house refurbishment business as a side thing. My parents work their jobs on the weekdays, and on weekends/free time, we usually work refurbishing houses. Now I've been helping my dad with this since I was 13, at the weekends, doing general labour duties (usual DIY stuff). Granted there were some months between projects, and around exams I didn't go, but usually there was always work to do.

When it came time in school to do work experience, my parents encouraged me to go to places where I can learn about courses that interested me, which at the time was veterinary and law, so I did a couple of months work experience in a veterinary clinic and solicitor's office (one day a week, rest of time was school). That was 4 years ago.

I'm in university now, studying Biomedical Science, and also working 12 hours a week in another house project. But I'm worried that won't be seen as ""real"" experience. I feel bad for not having worked a proper job outside of my family, and I don't know what to put on a CV, and I keep thinking that I won't be seen as employable. My dad reckons this house won't be finished until my next birthday, and I'm sort of afraid of turning 20 and not having any real work experience to my name. My parents tell me not to worry as when I get my degree, I'll find a job, but I am quite concerned to tell the truth.

So I have numerous accounts on Mega, where I stored my data, because I hadn’t had enough space on my PC. Few times I used the Mega-App or Mega storage program on computer (to get more gigabytes of online space). On some accounts, I had time-limited 50 GB storage, which expired either expiration/fullfilment with data (and I can’t upload onto these anything anymore).  I actually stopped uploading on this online storage like a month ago, because I connected new HDD to my computer, thus I don’t have any files which I want to upload anymore (but I left previous uploaded files on Mega). Now, as dumb as it may seems, the Mega team send me an e-mail (on 2 of my accounts, where I have 50 GB of files) where they explain that my accounts are overstored with data and I will need to upgrade them (for money) to ""get them back"" and have more space, otherwise my data will be deleted in a month, and quite frankly I didn’t expect that they will do this. Now,the first thing I tried was to download all the data from these 2 accounts to my computer/move them to another drive, but the Mega team blocked the accounts automatically, so I can’t interact with them at all. Now I have only 1 legal option which I could think about: **To upgrade both accounts for money.** It may not seem like a big deal, but I am young and in quarantine, so I do not spend but I also do not make any money, so I am trying to avoid losing any money ""unnecessarily"". 

&gt;*Does anybody know if there is any other solution for this? Is there any possibility that I could just upgrade 1 account and somehow move there the data from the other full account?*

Me: Eh, I've only been wearing the mask while working the 5 hours yesterday, and in fact I took it off a couple hours before the day ended

Mike: While you work hard and you have to mask on you breathe heavy causing your body to intake more CO2 while wearing the mask

Mike: Just take slow deep breaths, into your nose out through your mouth for about 5 minutes and then see how you feel after that

Me: Alright, I'll see if I feel better within the upcoming hours.. just figured it wouldn't get better since I've been up since 5:30 am with the symptoms 

Mike: Yes, what year symptoms you're telling me is from long exposure since you started working even wearing a mask and you're not used to breathing and all that extra CO2

I DONT TALK CRAP ABOUT YALL BEHIND UR BACKS BC IM A DECENT F()CKING PERSON! anyways this caused me to have a really scary panick attack and then sobbed, shakes violently, had a racing heart, and gathered perminant trust issues for the next three hours. I had one of my friends (WHO IDEK IF IS MY FRIEND ANYMORE AT THIS POINT) call me and calm me down for like an hour. The next day nothing rly happened until wednesday. I called one of my friends and she was like sorry i can’t talk rn and then WENT ON HOUSEPARTY AND TALKED WOTH ALL MY OTHER FRIENDS WITHOUT ME. THEY POSTED SCREENSHOTS ON A CALL HAVING FUN WHILE I SAT THERE LONELY ASF WONDERING WTF TO DO W MY LIFE. I texted my friend i thought i could trust about this and i wondered if i did something and she responded with “idk but i’m busy and can’t talk rn”. So that night i had no one to talk to and was rly upset. So then i tried to reconnect with some old friends i didn’t think where toxic. I told one of them(14f) i thought the other guy (14m) (lol i’m bi) was cute a few months ago but i forgot he was closeted so i told her not to tell anyone. Then he left me on opened for a long time and i said “why do u keep leaving me opened” and he said “bc u spread lies abt me” and i said “what lies?” and he said “to (other friend)”. HE LITTERALY CAME OUT AND TOLD ME HE WASNT STRAIGHT IN SEPTEMBER WTF! idk what to do now bc i told the other friend NOT TO SAY ANYTHING and she did. I have 0 trust for anyone at this point and feel like i have no one to talk to or anything. I already knew i can’t trust men but now idk if i can trust anyone. Why does everyone always go behind my back and break my trust. it hurts and i hate it. let’s just say my therapist got quite the conversation this thursday. i could go even more on about them but i’m not bc if anyone reads this they are already bored outta there mind.

463,"Here’s the backstory for context first (kinda complicated so I’ll sum it up as short as I can)
Last year in school, a girl that I never saw before was in my class and I got a major crush on her. I didn’t know she had a boyfriend at the beginning of the year. The dude was in my other class and he found out I liked her because we talked about girls without me knowing who he was. So they eventually broke up after winter break and then I told her I liked her in March (THe day before we got out of school for COVID) but got friend zoned . I stopped texting her in April because she wasn’t giving the same energy back and we didn’t speak until last month. I decided to text her just to catch up again and we’ve texted a few times since then. 

Side note: I was basically simping for her back (which left me so hurt when I got rejected) then and I was in a bad time for myself. I have improved myself very much since then, physical appearance and mentally and started taking better care of myself. 

Here’s current situation: I’ve had reoccurring dreams about her off and on for months and I can’t shake the thought of her. I really feel like I’m over her but I just can’t shake it off. So my question is, i kinda want to just put my thoughts to rest once and for all and ask if she wants to go out sometime but I just don’t know if I should do it. I don’t think there’s any chance of her saying yes but I think I just need to do it and get it done and hope it can finally put my thoughts away.",20Nov2020,1

Relationship advice needed !

My GF is becoming distant

My girlfriend is recently becoming more and more distant with me. She’s not as clingy and affectionate as she was in the beginning. We still hang out almost every day. 
  She acknowledges it and says she will change but never does and tells me she doesn’t understand why she’s like the way she has become. She never wants to have sex anymore, she just wants me to finger her, doesn’t give me random kisses, or hugs, or random I love yous. 
  She’s still super protective of who I talk to and hang out with (which I don’t mind). She’s still being loyal to me despite the change of her personality. I see her snaps, she doesn’t snap a lot of people. Her best friends list consist of me, 1 best friend, and the rest are family members. Her profile pic on all social media’s is a pic of us together. So she’s not hiding me. Even tho I ask her to post me on her snap story and she rarely ever does even tho she says she will more. 
   It hurts because she’s my first true love and I want a future with her and she says the same to me but yet she’s acting like this? I’m getting so many mixed signals and just don’t understand. The first 3 weeks of our relationship was PERFECT. And now it’s 50/50. 
  We have our good moments. She says nothing is bothering her so it seems like I’m the only one who’s hurting right now. Some advice would be very much appreciated! I’m 19 and my girlfriend is 18 btw",20Nov2020,1

467,"Two months ago I had to put down my 6 year old Spitz because he had grown too violent and had seriously injured my sister, even causing nerve damage. It was an unfortunate unavoidable outcome and I can't help but put all the blame on me. Because I was in school when we got my dog so I didn't know much about them and my parents weren't much help and they left all the training on me and I fear that the way my dog turned out was probably because of the basic training mistakes I made. Obviously he was a bit inherently violent as well because I've never heard of any dog turning out to be this violent. There was also the factor that he had a serious fracture at 6 months and that was when he started becoming really violent because we couldn't do any obedience training then. 
But I still really loved him and for two months I've been feeling like shit. I keep finding his hair everywhere and on my clothes and when I do I feel like crying again. He's also my phone wallpaper and in all of my social media profile pictures so his face keeps popping up everywhere and I feel like crying all the fucking time. I can't bring myself to change any of these pictures. I can't help but feel that I should've fixed him somehow and that it was my responsibility because till the end he had grown so violent that I was the only one able to handle him. Can someone give any advice what to do in this situation?",20Nov2020,1
468,"Some context:

About a month ago I did a test to try and get a scholarship on a college where I live and I got it! 50% to be exact! The thing is... I'm 100% unsure if it's what I want. It's something I'm interested at, analysis and systems development, but I feel like... It's not what I want totally.

I still haven't done my registration as I'm at the end of high school, I am 19 years old and that college is a private one, there are some financing options that it's offered, but not the ideal one, which if I where to go on with the college, the other 50% I would only pay when I'd started working, but...

I had to do a specific test called Enem (Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio, or National High School Exam in english) which could provide scholarship depending on the grades the student take on the exam. I didn't signed up to it earlier, so I can't take it, but if I did, I would've had more college options. Why didn't I? Because I wasn't planning on starting college, the plan was get a job first and THEN college, but someone provided me the chance and I was like ""oh, what the hell... I doubted I would've pass it anyway, couldn't hurt to try"", y'know?

And now, I'm nervous because I really don't know what to do. Should I go to college? Should I don't go to college and give myself time to find out what I want? By the way, I've already talked to my mother and she basically thinks that I should really think through it, due to college being still expensive even with my scholarship, haven't talked to my father and I even asked my boyfriend who before doing Fashion in college, he did Aeronautical Science and he said I should do what I think it's best for me.

I'm really unsure about it and I would appreciate some advice. And I'm really sorry for any grammal oddities, English is not my first language.",20Nov2020,1
469,"Hello! Here I am, done my first semester of engineering in a program I really enjoy, but because of covid I haven’t made any friends at my new university on the other side of the country which is due to a strange mixture between the workload of remote learning, and not being able to see anyone in person. All of my high school friends have chosen to go to a university closer to home, and part of me really wants to transfer and join them. It’s incredibly isolating knowing that they’re going to be able to spend the next few years together, whereas I’ll be on my own on the other side of the country. This sounds naive but I don’t want to lose my high school friends, despite most people saying that they do after university. Should I take the plunge and transfer, or should I stay here and make an effort to maintain my friendships with these lovely people?",20Nov2020,1

473,"Some Background: when my father was younger he was in a realtionship before he met my mom. in this said realtionship he had a son. Now because a lot happend between him and the Mother he was forbidden to visit and contact him after he was around 3-4 years old. Because my Father never contacted him again he probably doesn't know anything about me.   


I've been thinking about trying to reach out to him because i think he deserves to know that he has a brother but I'm not sure if this is the right thing. For starters, I'm not that interested in starting a family realtionship with him. I just want him to know that I exist. And  I feel that it is not my place to contact him, especially since i don't know how he grew up, what he thinks of my father and if he would even want me to message him.  

  
Another Issue is that I'm afraid of how my Father would handle it if i would begin contact with him. I talked with my dad about this before and he said it was fine but I'm not sure if he has unresolved emotions in this. After all he more or less has lost his son back then.

480,"Okay so this will be a bit long sorry. So I have this one friend who I like to play Cod warzone with. But the thing is, if his cousin wants to play with us, he’s required to play. So I usually end up with him, his cousin, and me playing trios. He’s in elementary school and his parents are extremely rich. So he has that i9 9700k 2080ti sli setup, all water cooled. In elementary school. He’s also extremely bad at every game he plays, despite spending $100 on the game daily and playing 3 hours a day. So it’s usually a sore spot between us, because he swears he’s better than us (his kd is soemwhere between 0.2 and 0.4, while Mine is somewhere around 1.6). Well I’m East Asian and they’re both Indian. It started off as a joke, we’d say a phrase which was meant to mimic me as a joke. I was fine with it, because we’re friends and we’d laugh about it. But then his cousin, I’ll call him joe, would constantly say it. I’m already a bit tired by him, because if it’s not his way, he straight up calls his aunt to tell her that his cousin isn’t doing what he wants, and then my friend has to get off. So I’m already pissed and hearing him do it about 1 time every 10 seconds doesn’t help. He’s started sayinf ching Chong dog eaters and I started blowing up on him, sayinf he has no right to say that, how he’s just being plain racist and it’s not a joke anymore. My friend and I agreed to not say it anymore in front of him but it doesn’t bother him. He usually dies off spawn, loses gulag and proceeds to spend the rest of the match pining buy stations and eating chips, while sayinf ching ching ling dumpling small eye people. So it’s usually 2 of us playing trios most of the time.  Duo trios. So I tried telling him to stop but he got Butthurt and how he’s only in elementary school. I said that’s the problem, you’re in elementary school and being racist. He says he’s Asian too so I shouldn’t care. I’m just pissed off at this point, and I want to be able to play games with my best friend. Is there any way to try and talk to him? He’s already blocked my phone number so I can’t talk to him unless it’s through discord.",20Nov2020,1
481,Hi there. To make a long story short I recently moved to a new province/state and it’s been hard. I moved in July and my mom bought a coffee shop and we’ve been running it and it has been a lot of hard work and stress. I went through a lot of ups and downs and then became content and happy for a while and then two weeks ago had an altercation with our chef. A minor one but it has thrown me out of it a bit. After that I became anxious to be at work and I was often anxious the entire day. I believed this caused me to get sad and frustrated. I went back home for a couple days to relax and now that I’m back at the shop I’m anxious and a bit sad again. I’ve battled with anxiety my whole life but I need to get out of this now because I’ve had enough. Any advice ?,20Nov2020,1
482,"Okay, really strange and specific request, but basically here’s what’s going on. I live with my boyfriend and it’s his birthday this weekend. We had plans to stay in and just order a bunch of food and day drink. But I woke up with a pretty itchy sore throat and, as you can imagine, it’s hard to drink with one. I checked my tonsils and my lymph nodes...both seem fine, and I don’t have any other symptoms. I’ve been drinking tea and honey which helps cost my that so that’s great. But basically, I’m just gonna ride this out. 

I need a really effective sore throat reliever that doesn’t have acetaminophen since that interacts poorly with alcohol. So basically no DayQuil or those similar brands. I live in the US so I’m probably going to hit CVS later for some stuff. 

I’ve been looking at other unknown brands like homeopathic stuff which seems interesting. But anyway if anyone’s ever taken a specific OTC sore throat medicine that doesn’t interact poorly with other drugs (like alcohol lol) please share!",20Nov2020,1

487,"I’m a 21 (f), four years ago I graduated from high school and since I live in a different country I don’t get to study at governmental universities, since private universities are very expensive here, a friend of my mom suggested I go to Ukraine to study medicine (I couldn’t go back to my country cuz there’s a war going on), even tho I never wanted to become a doctor my mom really liked the idea and I didn’t want to disappoint her. 
studying at Ukraine was, and still is the down hill of my life... I hated it since day one, I could go on about why it’s so so horrible but it will be too long. 
After 3 miserable, expensive years, I decided to leave. My mom said yes at first but when I went back home she said I’m over reacting and she thought I wasn’t being serious. I literally wanted to kill my self every day since the first day I went there, and I thought I made that clear to my mom. 
Now, I know my mom was concerned because Ukraine’s medical degree is not recognized in most countries in the world, which means these 3 years would be wasted. I wanted to take the year off since I’m severely depressed, study for gre test and apply for master next year but my mom said that I don’t live in reality, that I can’t apply for master without a bachelor’s degree, even with three years of university. Long story short, we came to an agreement that I would continue studying at my country in a different field (physical therapy).
 I’m in my country now, the university I applied for decided today it won’t count any year I studied in Ukraine, and I will have to start from zero. Even tho they promised I will at least skip two years.

It was fine, but I faintly remember him asking me to have something that was absurd, like a card collection. I said no because they were important to me and didn't think about it.  Fast forward to now, and these cards are now worth A LOT of money. I can't find them in the apartment i live in now, so I assume they're in storage.

I lost my job working in November of 2019, I have quite the bills so doing nothing was not an option, I was offered a job in construction so I took it. I worked for about 4-5 months, lifting heavy wood for hours on end, the pay was solid but it took a toll on my body. I was working 6 days a week, generally 10 hours each day, it was not pretty but it was what I had to do. I ended up leaving due to the constant mental/emotional abuse that was caused by my mother and her boyfriend, I moved to a very poor town in the south of Texas(with my grandmother), where there is not much opportunity. I owe 9k on a 2018 Honda civic, which my mother made me co-sign when I had just turned 18. I am about 90% sure I have adult ADHD and I simply cannot afford to see a psychiatrist and get truly diagnosed, I have had a very hard time finding a job that will pay me more than 8$ an hour, I have been working with my neighbors, they can only afford to give me 100$ worth of work per week. I have been taking on odd jobs for money but it is very hard at times to just get by, I do not have a relationship with my father as he left when I was 8 years old, I have not seen him since. I  do not have many people in my corner and I am losing more and more as time goes by, probably due to my inability to control myself at times, I realized I might have adult ADHD a few weeks ago from some girl I was supposed to hook up with from tinder.

We both left our jobs to do this as he wanted to go to school for his Ph.D. I was really burnt out on corporate culture, so I decided when I got here that I would just work retail for a while to kind of “decompress.” I got two part-time seasonal retail jobs at the mall.  So far it has been fine, but one of my jobs is at Bath &amp; Body Works, and I am starting to get very concerned about my possible exposure to COVID there. Firstly, there is no social distancing taking place.  Most people wear a mask, but many don’t cover their nose, and EVERYONE removes their mask or pulls it down to smell things while shopping. (Often while I am standing right in front of them.) I don’t have the same concerns about my other job as that’s at Barnes &amp; Noble, and my exposure is much lower due to the larger store (ability to social distance) and there being no reason for anyone to take their mask off. Due to the increasing numbers, my bf and I both are getting very uncomfortable with my exposure at B&amp;BW. I kind of want to quit, but part of me thinks I should just work through the season since the job is scheduled to end in early January anyway.  (But who knows how bad things will get by then...)

496,"Hello! I have been renting a room in a house where the homeowner,  lets call her K, also lives there. K has a dog and a cat, as well as 4 chickens which the city is unaware of despite needing a permit. There is a dog door installed which leads to a fenced in backyard. K will regularly leave and go to her boyfriend's house where she will without notice stay for several days, and regularly stay beyond what she initially tells us. K will occasionally ask us to feed her pets, but there is no standing agreement that we do. My other roommate, M, and I also have jobs and significant others so we are also regularly away from the house for several days at a time. The pet owner makes no effort to check our schedules and never inquires as to whether her pets have been fed, but will be off the grid for days at a time. K never has a regular feeding schedule for her pets and is extremely lazy, occasionally giving her 70 lb golden retriever leftover chinese from the fridge or pancakes for dinner, rather than walking to her food bin and scooping out the food. M and I feel very guilty and often feed her pets while she's gone, but we are in the process of breaking our lease and moving. We are very worried for K's pets given her care of them. She is unable to bring them to her boyfriend's house because he has an aggressive dog which has tried to fight/eat her dog/cat. These things will only continue to happen, but we wanted to know what our options are. Her animals act very neglected and cry incessantly if not being given attention. Her dog sleeps by the door every night she's gone hoping that K will come home. K also does not groom her dog, who is very prone to ear infections. The dog regularly has severely mats behind her ears. She also is unable to trim her nails and makes a joke of it saying ""oh I just have the vet do it and they have to put her under."" K also bathes the golden retriever multiple times a month due to her allergies, which obviously also leads to dry skin and irritation. Does anyone know what our options are? We still will be living here 2 for 2 more months with K occasionally there, so we want to be careful to not put ourselves in a position where she will retaliate. She is extremely unstable and makes light of it using it as an excuse for everything rather than being treated. She is also financially reckless and in a position where she is in extreme debt and this stress make her quick to lash out. What would you do? We have thought about calling for a welfare check from a shelter, but K is very manipulative and would be quick to lie and tell them she's the best dog mom and loves her pets more than most people ever could.",20Nov2020,1
497,"I love my girlfriend. We have been together 5 years now, we began dating when we were really young, 18/19 years old. We are in our early 20s now. My girlfriend has been through every disaster / trauma you can think of as a child, and as an adult in our relationship/in the military. She is now a disabled and retired veteran at only 23 years old. One thing I can commend her for is she speaks to a therapist every week and seems to have everything under control. She journals, does her therapy homework and really tries her best to get better. She has been through a lot and I will always be empathic to that. Her family has hurt her in ways that they truly should be under the prison for and caused her severe trauma. I can’t unsee it. She has forgiven them and welcomed them into her life.

The worst thing about being in a relationship with her is her family. Basically her entire family does not agree with us, which their opinion is their opinion. But they constantly bring her down, use her, manipulate her financially, etc. she says if she cuts them off she has no family, so she deals with the toxic things that come with them. I just graduated from college in May and landed my first big girl job I’ll call it, and her family has been like calling day and night asking for money. We ended up stuck with the bill for the thanksgiving meal, groceries for the week and travel expenses. None of them work, none of them have a car, all of them are on public assistant, and I’m truly not trying to be funny just stating facts. I’m actually going home for thanksgiving because I truly don’t want to be around them because they make me feel uncomfortable and ridicule her constantly about everything then I have to pick up the pieces when she falls a part. It’s a never ending cycle.

Then her family pressures her by asking when are y’all have a baby. What?! You hate the fact we are lesbians and you are asking questions like that?? As soon as I graduated and got a job all this baby talk started. I also feel like our relationship is dying because we aren’t even married and she’s engulfed in the baby talk.",20Nov2020,1

But the fact that she had to sit next to me just annoyed her so much. Her friends aren't the nicest people either, i've had some snobbish looks from them, i can't look at them because of it and when i see them nearby I just act calmly. (Sometimes I make a point of sanitizing my hands when they walk past to show im not some kind of weirdo) We're all 13/14 so i'm not sure if its just the age?

Last year I saw one of X's friends when I was shopping with my dad and I saw she was looking at me and pointing me out to someone so I just asked my dad if we could go home.

X didn't actually say anything to me while we sat next to each other. I feel so self concious around X and her friends that I just skip gym classes. I do remember one of X's friends asking me if I was depressed which I panicked a bit, I have a friend but sometimes I like to be alone and I am a quieter girl.

504,"A little over a month ago, on Oct 12th 2020, my girlfriend left me to work on herself. Her and I were together for almost 3 years, and our anniversary would have been this last Monday had she stuck it out with me. Through our relationship there had been ups and downs as there are in any relationship, but overall we had a very healthy and loving relationship that I'd honestly give up anything to experience again. 

The day she left had felt like a normal day. I had the day off, she just started on her first day at her new job. Things were looking up. I was helping my family around our house and she had text me saying ""hey im gonna head over after work"" and I thought ""heck yeah I dont have to drive today and I still get to see her"". Well she got off work, came over to my house and when she pulled in the driveway she immediately went inside and sat in my room.

After a few minutes of searching for her I found her with her ball cap pulled over her eyes, sitting on my bed, with the lights off. I asked her what was going on and she said ""This isn't going to be easy but I think we need to break up"". Immediately I shut myself down, turned my brain off, and detached from the situation so I wouldn't react too negatively. She went vaguely explained the situation. She told me she had felt like she had lost something in herself, she was unsure of what she wanted to do with her life, unsure if she really wanted to go to the college she planned on going to next fall, told me she wanted to know herself truly before committing to anything else. She told me she didn't want to give up on me, and that she believed I deserved someone better. She told me she was okay if I fell in love with someone better, and that I needed to be okay with that too. She said she was doing this because she loved me. 

My first questions were ""is there another guy involved? Where is the promise ring that I gave you on our anniversary?"" And I feel as though I fucked up there. I feel as though I should have told her what that ring was for. I feel as though I should have let my flood gates open and been vulnerable with her and let her know how I truly felt before it was too late. But, hindsight is 20/20. I told her I understood though, and didn't put up a fight for the woman I truly loved and couldn't live without. 

Skip forward some days and weeks and her and I still talked a bit here and then so we didn't lost connections, and so we could support eachother if needed. I stopped over their house once a week maybe to keep touch with her family and check on every one. It hurt a lot though. We ended up blocking eachother because it was for the best and I stopped showing up until their family had a big Halloween party I went to and thats when it went really south. She brought a new guy. Was all touchy feely and I felt like everything she told me wasn't the truth. I felt like she had lied to me. I felt like I wasn't worth her time or respect. So since then I've been absent. Her and I have the same friend group, and she'd always ask them how I was and id do the same. Well I haven't talked to any of them for weeks to get lost by myself and try to heal. I figured that if she couldn't have the respect or give me her own time, and she wanted to use someone else's time to get answers, she didn't deserve them. So I got lost by myself. Thats kind of when I realized my lack of vulnerability during the moment she was breaking up with me, and frequently through our relationship, could have been part of her decision. 

No one has heard from me in weeks, other than an occasional ""I'm alive"" and thats it so they don't panic. But other than that, every one is clueless. Since she's broken up with me I've cried myself to sleep almost on a nightly basis, and every single night atleast once ill wake up cry because of a dream where her and I are happy, and at some point in the dream, she isn't happy anymore and leaves, and I wake up sweating and crying to that. I dont know what to do. I truly understand that in order to love someone you have to accept their past, support their present, and encourage their future. I understand that encouraging their future means I have to be able to let them go and trust they'll come back if it was right for them, and to accept that they may not come back at all. 

She has the perfect idea that I can be her best friend forever even if she's madly in love with some other guy. I told her that cant always be the case, and that when she left our relationship behind, she also left the opportunity for me to treat her and love her the way I used to when we were together. Her husband one day won't want me to be bringing husband material to his wife's table in the form of a best friend, and my wife wouldn't want me to do that either. But she said ""lets make an agreement if thats the case I'll leave whoever it is because then they won't be right for me, and you'll do the same"". I wanted to tell her ""then you know what you want, and you want me so trust yourself damn it."" But i didn't and I just agreed to prove my point I guess. Shes unofficially with this new guy, and he already wants her to have nothing to do with me, but she doesn't seem to care or realize that even though he's specifically told her that. He's shown all of our friends and myself he has no respect for her or her image. Yet we have to sit and let her get hurt. She said she would work on herself by herself, and she's not. 

I dont know what to do. I'm caught between accepting that she may never come back, and wanting to marry the girl that I've known I wanted to marry since I could remember. I wanted her to be happy, but at what cost.",20Nov2020,1

508,"Hey hey hey! So I’ve been having some strange things happen while I’m asleep. It’s been going on for over a year, for sure since I noticed it. I have some suspicion it began when I became sexually active (will delve into that shortly) but I have no way of knowing when it’s onset officially was. 
For as long as I can remember I’ve had very vivid dreams, often fairly realistic and usually they’re negative dreams. Very rarely do I have “good” dreams, I just have negative and really really bad dreams. 
I frequently dream I’ve been cheated on, am cheating, or being sexually assaulted/r*ped, and this is pretty normal. However I wake up with bruises on my legs like someone had grabbed my legs, they’re deep and usually in line like fingers would be. I don’t bruise easily at all so this is strange and they’re particularly dark. I’ve had friends even try to recreate the bruises on my legs to see if they could get the same effect and fail to do so. 
Sometimes after sleeping I’ll wake up and feel like I just had sex, and that feeling lingers for some of the day. I’ve been told repeatedly that when I sleep I’ll talk in my sleep or even giggle, usually very coherent things and it tends to scare people that I’m talking so “normally” while being dead asleep. That being said I don’t ever sleep soundly. 
I’ve began to record w/ audio while I sleep to see if I say anything or hear anything in particular that happens. Haven’t gotten anything yet. 
A friend of mine suggested I could have unknown sexual trauma, and I don’t honestly know what or when it could have been, but I have minimal recollection of my childhood.

Anyway, any questions or insight is appreciated! It’s a bit strange and worrisome at times LOL",20Nov2020,1

511,"We had some good times hanging out 1 on 1 before the pandemic but here are some things that she has done once her group of high school friends came into the picture, in chronological order:

Dec 2019
She invited me to a puppet show and knew another friend from high school would be there with her ex boyfriend. She said that she hoped we wouldn’t run into her friend because she “didn’t really like her or him.” She didn’t even specify why, even when I asked. 
When they spotted us when we took our seats, her friend invited me to her house party that weekend. Right that moment was when I realized that this was the exact gorgeous friend she talked about and hung out with often, and whose texts she’d always respond to quickly when we hung out together. At the party, my friend gave her a late birthday gift and it was much more expensive than mine. (Various gifts in 1 bag for her friend vs 1 face mask for me) At this point I started dating my boyfriend and so I distanced myself from her by not contacting her past 1-2 times a month, which is what our regular catch up routine was. 

June 2020
We spoke on the phone and when I told her my boyfriend and I were a steady thing, she raised her voice out of nowhere and said she hated it when friends ditched each other for relationships and called me selfish. I was too shocked and didn’t know what to say. In addition she talked about how the friends I met at the party back in December weren’t social distancing and that they’re ignorant/bad m/stupid people for not taking covid seriously. She seriously shamed them but admitted that she did the bare minimum of trying to hang out with them so she wouldn’t end up alone. She also called my bf selfish for not getting tested back in March when he caught the flu. In his defense, the nurse he called told him to stay home. 

August 2020
We hung out for the first time in 7 months since the pandemic started. I showed her photos of my boyfriend after she showed me photos of a family friend she attempted getting with but failed to. She proceeds to make fun of him by saying his jaw was too big and that he looked like the moon emoji. She also told me some heavy and secret background information of 2 of her friends and that’s when I got the idea not to trust her. 

Sept 2020
I see photos of her on instagram hanging out with those so called friends in a group of 6-10 people. She isn’t social distancing or wearing masks, despite having shamed them for not doing so. This was also the week of the 1 year anniversary since my bf and I met so I made an instagram story about it and saw all of the viewers.

A bit later on Facebook, she reposts the tweet: You have multiple soulmates in life and they all aren’t romantic.

516,"So currently I am at a community college and just got my priorities straight. I want to go to uni for either computer or electrical engineering. Currently I work retail almost full time (37 hours a week give or take) and go to school part time (2-3 classes per semester). Now that I have realized, retail and a lot of other jobs are soul crushing to me, I want to do something STEM related (which I've always loved). This is going to require me to kick it into high gear and take 5 or 6 classes next semester (Chem, Calc, and Physics, along with 1 other class) to finish my A.A. and move on to university in the fall and continue full time school. I guess what I'm asking is, is it a good idea to keep the job I have and try to make it work, or focus on school exclusively? I am fortunate enough to have parents that can and are happy to support me through the rest of community and uni, my schooling is also covered up to 4 years worth of college credits, and I'm a pretty good student A's and B's. I just don't want to be a smoocher so to say, however I know STEM is extremely rigorous and under the circumstances is it ok to just focus solely on school?

520,"Hi everyone! I'm a 25 year old female.  I have worked as a middle school teacher then I went back to school to complete a bridge program/prerequisite program to be a Speech Language Pathologist. This program enabled me to work as a Speech Language Pathologist Assistant, which is what I have been doing since January 2020. I have applied to a couple of schools for my Masters in SLP to become an SLP, but lately I'm having some doubts. 

I am not financially stable at all yet. The bridge program got me in debt for 15k and I had another 15k from undergrad. I make good money as an SLPA, but I haven't been able to get as much hours as I'd like. My clients can be seen in the afternoons only due to school. My savings isn't that much and I've been feeling like I'm in a rut with everything. 

Looking at getting into another 80k for my Masters just scares me to death. I'll never be free financially. So I started to brainstorm. Before I did the bridge program I was teaching and between getting my Masters in School Counseling or SLP. I researched the School Counseling Masters again yesterday and it's only 30k. 

So I started to think about it I went back to teaching and worked as an SLPA in the afternoons via teletherapy so I wouldn't have to travel I'd be able to make around 6k a month. That would help tremendously and pay off a lot of my student debt and enable me to start saving/feeling more secure financially. 

I then talked to my sister who is an SLP and once I finish grad school and everything as an SLP that's around what I'd be making. So is it worth it? I love both fields. I was always happy being a teacher and loved getting out of bed everyday. I also love doing speech therapy, but I don't know if it's worth it financially.... I also think I'd eventually be a great school counselor. It has always been my dream job. A lot of people just shit on it because you're working for the school system. So I had been hesitant about pursuing it. I also feel like speech has been pushed on me because my sister does it and has her own company. She makes great money but it would take me years to get to her level. It's not about being super rich to me. I just want to be financially stable and doing well. It's just me for now. No kids or husband. 

So my two options are A) start SLP grad school in January and be done in 3 years with 80k or more in debt living at home with my parents. B) get my temporary license processed to be permanent and start working as a teacher and an SLPA in the afternoons for about 2-3 years to save up/pay off debt then think about which grad school I want to invest in. C) start a school counseling program and not work as much/still get into debt. 

What do you guys think? Any advice?? My biggest concern with teaching again is taking the assessments. I had a difficult time with them. It would be worth it though and I do miss the classroom. I feel crazy even reconsidering this. However, 80k in student debt sounds horrendous to me especially already having 30k.",20Nov2020,1
521,"I'm a first year graphic design student in Colombia (I wanna be an illustrator) and I work for a technology company providing customer service remotely. This company has two other affiliates, being that the main company is in charge of providing the tools and human assets for the marketing and telecommunications of the affiliated companies.

Recently, the marketer working for the group of companies resigned due to ""overwork."" There are already two in the same year, the first one resigned because our boss demanded things from him in an incredible time. I emphasize that is a single person in charge of the marketing of three companies, from the design of strategies to their application.

In the end, my boss decided to assign the marketing responsibilities to me, because ""he can tell I like that kind of thing."" I accepted because I thought that he was aware that he could not expect much from me, and that it was temporary since there were no changes in the contract (I also admit that I was afraid that he would fire me if I refused, and I need the money)

But more than a month has passed and she shows no indication of seeking a specialist. You want me to develop and monitor an effective multi-channel digital marketing strategy each week and create a social media content plan for both affiliate companies.

That has frustrated me too much because I really don't have the knowledge and the experience to achieve the desired results in the ridiculous time that my boss demands. I ask him for time because I need to know in depth the companies, their clients and users, their values, etc; to know what is the best thing to do.

523,"I am a male and I am extremely confused as to what I am into in terms of sexuality and need help. 

I am not sure if this is the right subreddit or not but my situation goes as follows. I am EXTREMELY attracted to women. I love everything about them from their personalities (which isn't a gender-specific trait, but a female doing something cute is more impactful to me than a male doing so), and body. I have no problem getting aroused to a female should the situation call for it.

BUT whenever I see an attractive male, I feel something different towards them rather than just some other male like me. It took awhile, but I came to the conclusion that I may be bisexual. That would have been the easiest answer to my confusion until I realized something else.

I don't fall too far on the spectrum. It has to be A REALLY and I mean VERY attractive male for me to feel anything, as opposed to a female where I am way more open. Even then, I feel I would go as far as to be with someone who is a male, kiss them and all that, but I would never want to sexually do anything with them. That thought just wouldn't cross my mind.

They are living on different floors of the house to stay safe since the infection rate in NYC rose to 3% abd my dad is immunocompromised.

I would attend certain lectures for the modules I enjoyed more. Whereas the ones I didn’t just the thought of going use to send me in panic mode so I would just end up not going because I would awful. Then COVID happened and I don’t know why but I was much more productive at home got so much more done was focused even though there was way way less contact time. I still flaked on certain modules my fault again I know as result I failed, I had chance to resubmit and i did resubmit 2 out of 3 things but still failed this was in August. The stress was building up in aug and deadlines were early aug. Long story short I ended up having breakdown because I knew I hadn’t submitted essays and the stress got to me again told no one dealt with it on my own kept it bottled up. September came round I was waiting for my timetable when I got a message saying I’ve been discontinued from my course essentially been kicked out. Again another breakdown I was lost just didn’t know what to do and was right state. After cooling down after a week I contacted a student advisor who suggested applying for a late mitigation. I did and it was accepted but I’ve only just been told. Now I’ve been given a deadline for 18th dec for 3 submissions 2 lab reports and a poster presentation. Less than a month to do it and I have no access to my student stuff aka the past slides that can help me with this. I have been told to contact the module leaders for each which I have. But I’m scared of one he’s not very helpful and gets annoyed rather quickly I remember in one online lecture he called everyone’s mock answers BS. And I’m scared enough as it is. 

Now I’ve just been crying all afternoon because I’m not been given any support and I don’t think I’ll be able to do it. I have contacted student advice numerous times but they haven’t got back to me regarding my anxiety and it’s stressing me out. I don’t even know what issue is but I feel like another breakdown is coming along. The modules I did pass I did get well all above 70%. My anxiety and stress is just not letting me focus on anything it’s just gets me into a terrible state and I can’t do anything I just sit and cry rather than do anything. 

How do I deal with everything and stop it from overwhelming me? Should I just drop out if I can’t deal with all this? But if I do what I’m gonna do? Please help me. I’ve have been to my GP and she was not helpful at all she said stress is normal at this age.",20Nov2020,1

Also I started talking to Jessica again.(other friend, made up name) Gina then asked me how Jessica was and in a part of my reply I said “the conversation doesn’t really flow, I can talk about one topic with them and then idk what to say” Gina then started talking about how Jessica only seems interested when they are sexting or other lewd stuff, that they never want to have an actual conversation.

Gina then sent me proof of a conversation that took place between them (also didn’t ask for that, eww), but Gina was the one saying all the lewd stuff, not Jessica. So I told Jessica about this, I thought they deserved to know that they were being talked about, I’ve also know Jessica for longer so I know what they’re like and they’re not like that. 

I promised Gina I wouldn’t say anything but from what they were saying, I think Jessica deserved to know. Gina also has borderline personality disorder and since we’ve become friends they’ve been saying things like “I’m glad I found someone who understands me” and “I finally feel like, if I died someone would care”.

Gina doesn’t know that I’ve told Jessica, and now Jessica is really hurt and is feeling like a terrible person because they felt like they both consented to the sexting, and from the proof it looks like they did. I’m worried that Gina will hurt themselves if I tell them that I told Jessica, they’re already drinking pretty badly because of a breakup.

I’m at such a loss and I physically feel sick for lying to them, I know I shouldn’t have done it but at the time, I was in between two sides to a story and I didn’t want to take a side until I heard both sides. Should I tell Gina?",20Nov2020,1
531, A couple of weeks ago my kids let me know that there BAND teacher was showing political videos in BAND. These were not from MSM and I was upset about what he said to my oldest boy even if it was a joke. We told him if he does it again go to the superintendent. Needless to say he confronted the teacher after class and asked him not to show those videos in his class. The teacher told him to get his ass out of his room then as my son was barely out of the room the words of frikin or F'ing liberals you can't reason with him. While my kid was in ear shot prompting him to turn around and confront the teacher again. Then he went to the superintendent to tell his side of the story. I called the School Board president before I contacted anyone at the school. I am hard set on the fact that politics does not belong in anything outside of history or a social science class. Even if asked the adult in my mind should have said this is band and left it at that. I am not trying to be an ass about it but things like this as well as a major bullying problem have been going on in that school for years and few things have been done about it. There has been little to no documentation by the administration and I am unfortunately lumping this in with the other issues at the school. The teacher is willing to apologize for his part in this and my son is willing to go back to band but I want there to be a short leash on this teacher so that other students won't have to go through this in the future. Am I overreacting like my wife thinks I am or is this a battle i should continue to fight. Note that i am not a republican or a democrat.,20Nov2020,1

533,"I need advice for two things.

When I my teens I, like many other boys, collected intimate images of girls.

Fast forward about 5 years and my first kid is born. I got rid of everything related to those idiotic years. I wanted to prove myself a better person now that I'd become a Dad. I realized I was acting like a boy but my kids needed me to be a parent.

3 years later, after my third child is born, it's discovered that I had these images and some of the women now know I had them. I feel worse than terrible.

I've always been known to have a good reputation known for keeping out of trouble and helping everyone with when I can. Life's a struggle, so I try to ease the struggle instead of making it worse.

So when people found out about my past many were quick to defend me, saying who I was then is not who I am today. That my present-self defines me and not my past-self. There are also those who feel I'm a vile person for having done this. I've been letting my past eat away at me for some time now and don't know if I deserve forgiveness.

I was beating myself up about having done this, but now that everyone knows what I did it has made it much worse. Regret doesn't begin to describe how I feel. I hurt these women and will never be able to come to terms with it. I apologized publicly to everyone. I felt genuine disgust in my actions and vowed to never partake in this again.

**My first question: How can I ever get over what happened?**

Second part.

I work a steady job but am unable to advance higher title-wise. I was offered a job that paid more, plus benefits. This meant I could allow my kids to do more and i could buy them toys they've always wanted.

Then I realized, to my horror, that one of the women I had wronged is employed there. I'm certain she knows of actions. I'm worried she won't appreciate me taking a job there and might show my to-be employer what I had done many years ago, which could then leave me jobless with 3 kids. The extra money would really help us.

My kids are my world. I want to be able to always support them.

**Second question: Should I take the job and advance my career, or stay at my current dead-end job and not take the chance?**

**TLDR;**

Years ago, had nudes of women. Years later got rid of them after kid was born. Wanted to change for kids. Years later after 3rd kid, the women find out. Deep regret before, even more now.

1. **How to get over stupid mistake?**
2. **Current job almost dead-end. Should I take amazing job offer if one of the women I wronged works there? They know what I did. Scared to be jobless with 3 kids.**",20Nov2020,1
534,"Okay so right off the bat, I've never done this before so hi Reddit.

For context, my ex and I have been broken up for about half a year now. We were together going on two and a half years before he split up with me because I said I thought I was an asexual, we'd been a QPR the whole time but saying that seemed to change something in him, he then said that was the reason why when he split up with me.

I was okay with the reasoning at first, but the way he did it and the timing of it all absolutely destroyed me. My family had been going through a really tough time because of Corona, we lost our house an' all that kinda stuff, so I was already at a low point in my life before this happened. When he split up with me I fell really ill (pretty sure it was mainly coincidence with the timing though) and was bedridden for a week, I was almost hospitalised several times throughout it. He even tried to lead me on when he split up with me, basically giving me false hope that I could still be with him in the future.

The first weeks after the breakup were really hard, but there were a few months where we managed to partially go back to how we were before we were together. That was until he started (I think it was) jokingly flirting and saying semi-cute stuff to me again, which re-opened the wounds he'd caused. It really messed up my mental health and now I feel like I lost several years of recovery from my mental health issues, so I basically told him that I wasn't doing well and couldn't be talking to people much at the moment (which is true).

He recently messaged me to check if I was doing any better, but I have no idea what to say. I've been avoiding his message for five days now.

I miss him so much, and tbh I still love him. I thought he was going to be the man I married. Heck, I was saving up what little I had left to afford a ring.

Talking to him is hurting me just as much as not talking to him is. So I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any advice?",20Nov2020,1

536,"Anyone who's a trump supporter probably won't be agreeing with me, but... I got a message from another friend sending me screenshots of my best friend's instagram story which I couldn't even see because she had me blocked from seeing her story for some reason... In her instagram story she was saying things like ""If you support antifa/blm block me right now. you disgust me."" and other things that clearly showed she was a trump supporter. I'm not a trump supporter and I support the blm movement. I confronted her about blocking me from her story and I confronted her about saying she doesn't support blm. We got into an argument and she said she doesn't support the blm movement because all protesters are violent and we're fighting for justice for criminals (yes, she said most of the victims were criminals). She said we're being manipulated/lied to. She kept claiming that my friends were trying to convince me that she's racist even though, 1. They don't even talk about her and 2. I never said she was racist. She said she even has a problem with BLM being written everywhere for some reason... Anyway, I blocked her on Instagram because she said it herself, ""If you support it, then block me."" so I did. She said something along the lines of ""you're gonna delete me from your life? okay fuck you"" and made a list of all the times she was there for me. She said she doesn't know why I can't just accept her political beliefs, but someone saying they don't support blm and calling black victims all criminals doesn't sit right with me. I'm a minority so why should I be a trump supporter/on the right side when they don't care about me. She's a minority too, so I'm confused. She then told me ""I pray to god you finish school because you're not getting anywhere with your dreams."" which was completely uncalled for and hurtful considering that's something personal. The conversation turned into us talking about our friendship and her saying how good of a friend she's been. She ended up calling me three times and I didn't answer because she had never called me before and I had tried to call her many other times and she's never answered and now here she was calling me three times in a row... I wasn't going to answer to argue with a trump supporter, no offense. I told her how our friendship was holding by a thread anyway and I felt like she wasn't even trying or cared about me that much. I brought up the fact I had sent her a letter MONTHS ago and she never even cared to write me back. Then she said, ""We're misunderstanding each other."" and sent me pictures of the letter she had wrote me. She hadn't sent it and I don't know when I would've ever gotten to read it honestly. The letter was very heartfelt and she wrote about our friendship and all the great memories. It almost made me feel bad for the whole argument we were having and made me wonder if I can really just end the friendship, but... This doesn't change the fact she's a trump supporter who doesn't support blm. She has said a lot of questionable things I don't agree with. This is more than just political beliefs to me when they include people/morals. I don't know how I could be friends with someone who thinks the way she does. She has been my best friend for almost ten years though, which is why I'm so conflicted. What do you think I should do?",20Nov2020,1

Problem background. I have already failed to submit my thesis the last two times because the pressure that I put on myself was too much. In 2 weeks is my final deadline for submitting my thesis and I'm not even a quarter done with it. I haven't been able to focus on it at all. I've put too much pressure on myself to do a perfect job of it. Lot of people were expecting big things from me. Rather than motivating me, that gave me anxiety. I keep rewriting the parts I've already done because I keep finding fault in them. But I don't have any real progress in the last 1.5 years. My parents have invested a lot of money into my education and they've worked hard for that money. We are a middle class family. I even received some scholarship money for my education and if I don't complete my degree, I'll have to pay it back. Its a lot. But I just can't anymore. Every night I have anxiety attacks. Every week I'm determined to get writing again.. Open up my laptop to start working, and end up playing solitaire. I haven't opened my university email in months, scared of what I'll find there. My girlfriend is really hard working and is also investing money to support me as I don't have an income right now. She's banking on my completion of my degree so that we can finally start a life together. I'm scared of disappointing everyone around me who has high expectations of me. I had high expectations of myself as well. I'm scared of being seen as a failure. The ironic thing is, it's not even possible that I finish my thesis now. So my failure is inevitable. I've been acting like I'm working on it for the past few months and been lying to everyone around me. Because I didn't want to disappoint them. How do I tell them? What do I tell them?

Mind your business"" and the other roommate (her bf) already told me to stop dropping by when D isn't home.

545,"I really don't know where to start, but there are a total of 4 things that are leading to me getting these feelings. It's a bit long. 

I'll start with the first. **School**. I'm in community college and am applying to transfer to a university soon. Just the application and getting everything right has me stressed. I'm also in a chemistry class that I have to drop because I won't be able to get a B. The teacher is horrible. For example, I work 35 hours a week, and we had 4 weeks of material before our first exam. Every minute I spent at work, I was studying and taking notes the entire time. So that's over 100 hours spent studying before my first exam, and I ended up having a stack of notes as high as a soda can. I went into the exam extremely confident, along with 12 others in a group chat that would send each other answers. Me with all my notes and 12 other people in a group chat, and we didn't even finish HALF the test. None of us did. The teacher curved, but that obviously didn't do anything since we'd failed. So I have to drop it and get a W. Basically, school has me stressed out and my chemistry class made me lose all motivation.

Next, **migraines** and **back pain**. Toward the end of the year and the start of the beginning, I get very bad migraines. I can't do anything when I get them, and often times wake up in the middle of the night with one, resulting in less sleep. I've also started having very bad back pain, all I want to do is just lay down and do nothing because of how bad it is. 

Next, my **family**. My family is amazing and they love me, but they constantly have me doing things. Every time I leave my room, they find something to ask me to do. Sometimes my mom treats me as a personal chauffeur despite her having her own car. My parents are extremely picky and nothing is ever good enough for them, every week my dad finds something new to do with the house or new things to order for the house. There's never rest at my house, there is always something going on. And no matter what project we're working on, my dad always goes with the longest and most complicated way to do it. I know I'm lucky to have parents that love me and live with them rent free, but the amount of things they have me do sometimes leads to me just hiding in my room the entire day so I don't remind them that there's something that they need me to do. Every day, before the usual time that my parents start coming home, I'll stuff my face with food to stay full and I'll bring up a big water bottle to my room so that I don't need to come down the rest of the day. 

Lastly, I'm in a long distance **relationship**. It's been 11 months, I met her in person and have visited a few times, will be visiting again in 2 weeks. Her time is 2 hours ahead, and I'm pretty attached to her. We're on  the phone with each other anytime we're free (hours), and we fall asleep on the phone with each other every day. My problem is that I neglect a LOT of things just to be free and able to talk. This is another reason I hide in my room all day, just to talk to her. I'll pretend to be asleep the entire day when my family keeps calling me to find new things for me to do. I'll just hide in my room and talk to her or play video games or do homework. Last night, I had promised my brother I'd play video games with him. Both of my parents were also constantly calling me for 2 hours straight. I was also starving and needed food, but I ignored everything and pretended to be asleep the entire time just to stay on the phone with her until she fell sleep. 

Overall, there are a lot of things that make me want to just lay down and hide in my room the entire day. And lately I have just felt like a mess. I'm sure my back pain got worse BECAUSE I'm just laying down the entire day. Migraines probably got worse since I'm rarely moving or getting any fresh air or sunlight. 

I don't really know what I'm doing right now and I feel like a mess. Does anyone have any insight",20Nov2020,1

549,"So, i know these never end up being that short, but I'll do my best to keep it brief, here's aTL;DR: Therapy got much harder due to me not being a kid anymore. Mind keeps me reliving past traumas and I'm not sure whether I can continue or quit.

Also, for the rest of this I'm putting a **trigger warning**, I'm gonna talk about a lot of unsettling things so yeah, if you think that can affect you negatively, **this is your chance to stop reading**.

So I started going to therapy when I was 15, I'm currently 19. Back then I had a lot of panic attacks and depressive episodes. After a lot of toxic relationships brought out the worst in me and in the girls I was dating, at 18 I finally managed to get a grip on my panic attacks, depressive episodes, etc. It's not like they disappeared one day, I just took steps, breathing exercises, mindfulness exercises and slowly started easing them down when they start. Nowadays, getting a panic attack is rare, and allowing it to progress any further is even more rare. However, recently I found out my therapy will change.

To make things simpler, I started therapy at the time when my parents were considering a divorce, my father was abusive and to this day has a lot of clinical narcissism in him, while my mother is extremely emotionally fragile. In my therapist's words: I needed a 3rd parental figure, since adult therapy is much different than teen therapy. Teen therapy is controlling symptoms - the panic attacks, etc. Adult therapy is resolving trauma and unhealthy defensive mechanisms, in a nutshell. Now, I am a much healthier person than I was back when I was 15, I haven't self-harmed in years, I am not addictted to anything anymore, in 2 years, I have not used suicide to manipulate people ( I know, disgusting, no need to point it out). However, what I found out recently is that I still have an incredibly self-destructive worldview.

What do I mean - according to my therapist, I'm what's known as a parentified child. Basically, a parent/s is/are disfunctional and/or missing and a child has to ""grow up"" instantly, either to replace one or more of those parental figures or mature in certain areas to compensate for another or survive in an abusive environment. This makes me a quick learner and I can easily read people's intentions, however this also means I inherited or cultivated my dad's narcissism and my mother's emotional fragility. This makes me a toxic perfectionist, to my subconscious if something isn't excellent, that = I'm worthless. This leads to lots of procrastination or distraction at work due to me fearing failure. Furthermore, there are conflicting fears of abandonment and fears of suffocation. These make my relationships never seem ""just fine"".   I cannot converse normally with a partner - I either decide to avoid conversations or take a conversation to a fight (fear of suffocation) or if I'm the one who needs more attention - guilt trip (fear of abandonment). And that is fixed by adult therapy.

Finally, though, adult therapy feels really hard so far. All the above-mentioned symptoms are something I can identify and stop. I put my mental health away from my relationship because i know how much both me and my partner would suffer if I were to just let it all out.  So in spite of what you just read, I'm completely chill and a clown 99% of the time. My fears have lead to shouting matches, though. So there needs to be change, I respect myself and my partner and none of us deserves to be in such a place. When I'm in a therapy session, I am chilled out and can even recall past traumas I had forgotten for years, I mostly humor these experiences, accepting how things were and I do not feel any pressure or pain from them at that point. However mere minutes after therapy ends I get intense emotional exhaustion, after a few hours or days I can recount the whole experience we were discussing with my therapist - visuals, audio, and a huge emphasis on words or actions that really left an impact on me when I was a child. Sometimes that leads me to randomly drift off into those experiences while on work and thank covid I'm working from home because they tear me up a lot and it takes a minute for me to come back to reality. I don't know if this means my therapy is working or not. But it does take a toll on me and I'm at a crossroads. I either A) work past it to be a functioning adult but have it really really hurt me for a good few months/years or B) stop therapy and make do with what I have.",20Nov2020,1

553,"A little bit of background, this place used to be a little more of a mom and pop business and we've since been bought out and have become a little more corporate every year. But the way we run things is essentially the same. Everyone gets paid pretty well because you may be expected to do work from home in an emergency. Kind of always on call.

So my office has not been very proactive with Covid precautions. It really appears like no one is concerned about our safety and they're more concerned about us coming into an office store. It just feels like nothing is being taken seriously. It took a few months before they reluctantly let us work from home half of the time. Meaning group A goes in Monday Tuesday Wednesday and group B goes in Thursday Friday. Then it swaps the next week. 

Once things settled down a little bit, we were asked to come back in full time again. I've been working in the office full time again for the past few months. 

And yesterday we found out that one of our coworkers was exposed to someone who tested positive and we were with him in the office for two whole days. My manager said we'll see what his test results are and if they are positive we will all need to work from home until we have negative test results.

What should I do? Realistically I need this income. But I don't know if it's worth risking the health of my friends, family, and myself.


TL:DR
Office hasn't been proacrive about Covid-19. Someone in the office was exposed to someone confirmed positive and came into work two full days before they found out. Management is waiting for the test results before they do anything. In the meantime, we're expected to keep coming to the office.

555,Does anyone know what questions to ask them?,20Nov2020,1
556,"I've known this term for a long while now and I'm starting to question my understanding of it. I'm seeking other people's understanding of the term to improve mine.

Is self-love actually a strong feeling you could actually, well, feel? Or is it more of a way of life an idea?

I think if you asked people if they love themselves, a lot would say yes, since saying no would imply they hate themselves. And hating yourself seems illogical and needless, right? But I've realized you can claim things about your own psychology while being completely oblivious to how you truly feel.

I'll make an example. If people asked me in the past ""Do you accept yourself?"" I would have said yes. But my actions in the past spoke against that. I'd be secretive about things about myself that aren't actually bad, because I feared the response of others. I'd think of cringy moments in the past and would want to kill myself over it (metaphorically of course). In short, I would do things that contradicted that statement. That realization lead me to actually improve my self-acceptance, which I naively assumed I already had.

Now back to self-love. What does it actually mean and is it a strong feeling you can feel? And how does it feel? I've done things in the past that have made me feel happy, proud, strong and attractive, but I'm not sure what self-love feels like. Being content with myself? I think I already am. But I'm not sure if that's worth calling it ""self-love"".",20Nov2020,1

Woke up to some strange doordash delivery texts that were made between 1am and 3am PST to some address in New York. The person placed orders and cancelled them several times. Some of the orders were paid using “credits” and others using my personal debit card. For Walgreens, CVS, McDonalds, and some place called Snack Cater (I don’t think it’s local to California where I am located) I contacted doordash support and they didn’t have any record of these orders, not to mention the orders aren’t reflecting on my orders tab on the app itself. At first I thought it was a fluke and then I saw the charges on my banking app. I immediately cancelled my card and changed my password to the app...I have no idea how any of this even happened....if it’s an app thing, or someone got ahold of my card, or both. Has anyone had this happen to them?? Not a great thing to wake up to Friday morning....

565,"Posted on my boyfriend's account, as i dont have reddit myself)

I was at the graveyard in my hometown (i live in a super small town with just about 1000 inhabitants). Everyone knows everyone here and most of my family lives here. 

I was looking at the different graves with my boyfriend and then we stumbled upon a child grave. It was a boys grave. Then i noticed that the boy was stillborn on my exact birthday. Same day, month and year. It kinda freaked me out but i didn’t get suspicious until i saw that his last name was the same as mine. We have the same exact birthday and the same last name.

I got very freaked out and decided i would try to talk to my dad about it. At first he misunderstood me a little and thought i asked if we knew anyone who had lost a child (since everyone knows everyone here. My dad even grew up here). Then i said clearly that the boy had our last name and was stillborn on my exact birthday. He didn’t anwser, he simply ended the conversation by pulling out a newspaper and telling me he needs to get a haircut soon. 

Another reason that makes me believe this might be my stillborn twin brother is that i had a very traumatic birth. My mom and i was very sick and the doctors found out that my mom had pregnancy poisoning. So she had an emergency c-section and i had to lay in box for a week on supplementary oxygen. My mom also got very depressed after my birth and my dad was the one mostly taking care of me. 

I was not born in my hometown and my parents didn’t live there when i was born. We lived in a bigger city, but moved to my hometown after just about two years. But?wouldn’t it make sense to bury my potentially dead twin brother in my hometown?

567,"So basically since like a month ago me and my bf started noticing this smell on our apartment floor, it smells kinda like old candles that you get in hippie shops. 

At first it was a pleasant smell, just sweet, a bit strong but nothing crazy. 

Well every like 5 days it’s been getting stronger and stronger, like it’s awful. I have to hold my nose when walking across the hallway, and my dog starts sneezing and pulling me down to the next floor. 

It’s now at the point where the entire floor has this awful sweet stench, and it’s only getting stronger. 

I’ve went up to the floor above and the 3 floors below. They’re all fine, no smell at all.

I can’t tell what door it’s coming from, but it’s starting to worry me because I don’t get how it can keep getting stronger, how the person must deal with that smell in their apartment? 

My bf commented that it smells like the morgue he visited when his grandma passed. Which has me really worried. 

I know it’s probably nothing, maybe they smoke weed and don’t want anyone else to smell it. But Jesus it’s getting crazy. The air is like thick.

I have been medically retired from my job at 34. Long story short, I am a first responder who has been to hell and back and it took me almost two years to recover from my occupational stress injuries. I get that many are still skeptical about mental illness, but what I have is real, deadly, extremely prevalent in the world of emergency services. While I will always deal with PTSD, I received some really good help and I feel like I am able to move on now. 

My ""Golden Ticket"" is an opportunity to retrain into any career I choose. It will be covered by the workplace insurance I have paid into throughout my career. 

Many would say this is a ""winning the lottery"" type situation. Nevertheless, while half of me realizes how incredibly fortunate I am, the other half is extremely bitter, angry, and guilt ridden over being sidelined. Funny enough, I have heard stories about people winning the lottery: the winners paradoxically become less happy when the almost limitless potential of wealth enters their lives. Somedays, that is how I feel. 

I feel overwhelmed. Consequently, I am throwing a Hail Mary to reddit.  I would really like to hear from anyone who lost their identity at an early age. It is tough to be cast adrift like this. Also, if people have any ""outside the box"" educational/career ideas, I would love to hear that too.

571,"I made a new friend this year and have become sort of close. For context, I have been active in the community in terms of social work and mental health. Although that kind of stuff is very new to her, we have this as a shared interest and is mainly what we bond over. 

Lately she’s been getting on my nerves though. Early this year I took a course in meditative practice and have made it a side business. This is something that she’s also found interesting as it’s helped her through tough times. 

But. Recently she told me that she also hopes to take the same course that I took, and to also offer her services, just like me. 

The course I took was online. She could have searched for literally ANY other school/website to do her course. My focus has always been in mental health and wellbeing. She could’ve gone into ANY other area in mental health.

This is when I started to realise how she has been latching on to me and whatever it is I do. Whatever I volunteer for or want to get involved in, she’s there. If I’m unavailable, she also would have some excuse not to go. Whatever hobby I want to start, she wants to start too. 

This kinda stuff didn’t used to bother me. I used to really enjoy sharing these interests with her but it’s gotten to the point where... I just don’t get to do anything alone. With fitness classes, craft workshops I do... she also wants to do, too. 

She is such a supportive and caring friend and she’s nothing but nice. But her lack of individuality and personality is making me feel creeped out. I work with her so it’s very awkward as I can’t really avoid her. 

Does the situation seem as bad as it does to me? How do I navigate this, considering she’s a work colleague? How do I gently allow this friendship to sort of quietly cool off?

TLDR: I’m starting to notice my friend is latching on to me, my interests, my hobbies, even my professional choices. Help.",20Nov2020,1

573,"I’ve always struggled with making friends. I usually didn’t have singular interests, as my interests in things would be fleeting. Many things I even preferred doing alone. However, I always valued being able to talk to people in class and befriending people who had the same academic/career interests as me.

Unfortunately, those friends never felt like “real” friends. They were more like acquaintances who were friends among themselves, and I honestly feel like they often saw me as the third wheel. Most of our interactions were one-sided, and I just gave up after a while.

Now, in isolation because of the pandemic, I thought it would be a good time to get away from social life and do things more on my own. But now I’ve started to feel even more lonely, and I’ve lost interest and motivation in a lot of stuff, and I feel I would have a lot more fun if I was surrounded by friends.

I can’t go anywhere or meet anyone because of the pandemic, and i’m not really having success connecting with anyone on dating sites or anywhere online. I’ve been considering perhaps picking up online gaming, but I’ve tried it in the past and have had trouble fully enjoying it.

576,"This is my first reddit post so if I'm doing anything wrong let me know. + I'm sorry if this sounds dramatic. I need coping advice.

This is a problem that's been plaguing me (F20) pretty much my entire life. Ever since I was a kid the number one thing I wanted to experience in life was finding love and getting married because I've always wanted that kind of companionship.

An important thing to know is that I'm very unattractive. I'm been insecure about my appearance as long as I can remember. It's not really arguable, because I have a facial deformity regarding my forehead that's always been there. 

I also don't think my personality makes up much for it, because I'm awkward when I first meet a person, and rather boring, and I *do* warm up to the people I meet but it's not like anyone's going to willingly stick around to get to that point. 

The thing is, no one has ever been attracted to me. It's not an exaggeration- no one had the silly childhood crushes on me in elementary school, no one had a crush on me at all through the entirety of middle school, high school and college. No guy had ever even expressed interesting (ie flirting). People would treat the concept of liking me in middle school as a joke. One of the other students would see me in the hallway and joke around with his friend saying ""Oh it's SalamanderNice9457, aren't you going to ask her out?"" and they'd all laugh and try to embarrass the kid. 

None of my family members question why I've never had a boyfriend, either. They can all probably tell that it's because I'm unattractive and it'd be a miracle if I had one. 

I know some people are going to say ""you're only twenty, you have time"" but I honestly feel like by now, I at least would've encountered someone that would be interested in me, if even just a little. I've felt lonely my entire life, even in the realm of family and friends.

Other people might suggest going on a dating app but I've never posted a picture of myself on social media before out of insecurity and most dating apps would require pictures.

Very often I wish I was pretty, or at least average looking, so I could experience romance so easily like most other people do.

So I need advice on how to cope with this- being unattractive and also the possibility of being single my entire life. Does anyone have suggestions? (please be nice but also be honest)",20Nov2020,1

————————————————————————
I joined this team as the marketing manager the first week of September. In the last 12 weeks, I’ve seen three people on the mgmt team quit and one either let go or quit (not sure which), as well as a higher manager quit (not from my team, but oversaw it). Another let the team know a couple weeks ago that they have plans to leave in the near future. 

The roles included in those who quit: General Manager, Retail Director, Nutritionist, and the one planning is an Operations Support Mgr. The one who’s was fired/quit was the executive chef. The one who oversaw our team and was let go was an Area Mgr

This is all in the span of twelve weeks and not including the AM, are all my direct coworkers. My team has 13 roles. 1 GM, 9 managers and 3 supervisors.

578,"My boyfriend and I moved in together in June. Every since I’ve had strange nightmares that make me uncomfortable being home alone. They always consist of me seeing my boyfriend then realizing it’s not really him. Sometimes after that the dream ends, sometimes once I figure it out my “boyfriend” turns into this tall shadowy entity and sometimes I think I wake up and have the same dream in a different way. On of the first examples: I was laying in bed and didn’t feel a weight on me but all of a sudden I hear him say baby move your leg and he’s like laying on me. And I was really confused cause I thought I was awake and I thought he already went to work. But I just ignored it and hugged him. Then it was like I fell asleep again and woke up cause he was standing at the side of the bed (the way he does when he says goodbye in the morning) but he was telling me baby get up. But i could remember the pervious dream and I said you’re not ~his name~ and then the figure grabbed my arm and twisted it dragging me down the bed. Then disappeared and I fell into another similar dream. 

Last night was similar. I woke up about 2am and couldn’t sleep. I must have fallen asleep without realizing because in my dream I decided to go downstairs and lay on the couch. When I “woke” up I was in a living room that isn’t my own. I started to get scared but I saw my boyfriend. Something about him was off and I tried to say something but I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t scream or say anything. I was paralyzed laying in this living room that isn’t mine. I finally managed to squeak out you’re not him. He smiled at me then I woke up.

584,"I am looking for advice - I have worked at my current company for 20 years. I helped build it from the ground up and have been the CEO / Owners right hand. We have developed a close personal friendship and I have considered him to be one of my best friends. A lot has changed over the years - both in the company and in my personal life. I started as a single woman who had no issue with a 50+ hour work week and now am a married woman with a young child. The CEO has made it clear he expects more from me and needed me to pull more weight than 40 hours a week. He is super goal oriented and if we are not moving at warp speed towards the goal he feels we are 10 steps behind. As in true 2020 fashion, things began deteriorating for me there this year as I went to 100% work from home while others stayed in the office and have kept things propped up. Over the summer I began to have what I will call a nervous breakdown. I began thinking about work obsessively, but was unable to act on the things I knew needed to be done. During one of these breakdowns I contacted the CEO and explained some of the responsibilities that fell under my umbrella slipped and that I felt I should work towards the development role he had been wanting me to work towards and step out of operations. I also clearly needed a mental health break. He was initially supportive, but quickly moved to make sure my tasks and knowledge were designated to other staff members. Upon my return from my break all of my duties had been reassigned. I had a large project I was in the process of wrapping up. He asked for me to write a development plan and submit for his review - which I did. After I wrapped up the project and kept asking ""whats next"" and he avoided my question I could see the writing on the wall and knew I was going to be let go. Yesterday he asked to meet outside of work and i knew what it was. I know it was very hard for him, but he explained he was burnt out and looking for an exit strategy himself and he was letting me go. He explained he's not interested in developing the business any further. He is offering a severance package and wants to make sure I am taken care of and asked what I wanted, which I needed to think about. After our meeting I of course overanalyzed every word and realized while he may be burnt out he is not going to stop developing the business. He has asked me the various ideas I had for development. He is going to implement those strategies - and just get me out of the picture. While I am of course really saddened by this I also know its probably for the best. I am on the cusp of 40 and know if I dont stay there for the long haul my window of opportunity is shrinking. I guess I am looking for advice on the following:

\- What should I ask for in my severance package? While I earn over 6 figures, he earns over 7 figures a year. I have been instrumental in building a recurring revenue model within the business than is going to continue to gain steam long after I am gone. I have no pension there - only a self funded 401k. He has a company pension in which he puts over $350k a year into his own retirement. I don't want to take advantage of him, but also don't want to short change myself. I just bought a more expensive home just 2 months ago :/ Things would have been way easier in my last home.

So, for context, I (20, F) moved in with my fiance(20, M) and our roommate (28, M) about 5 months ago. I wasn't keen on the idea of having a roommate at first because, ya know, I was finally moving out of my parent's house and in with my fiance and knew things wouldn't be how I originally dreamed it'd be. Well, it took some time but I came around the the roommate idea. He was homeless before and living with my in-laws and he was trying to get his life together for his daughter so he can get custody of her. I can admire someone like that. Plus, it would help us save up money for when we got our own place because we'd be splitting the bills 50/50. Or so we thought. I recently found out that my fiance is paying our half of the rent, the electricity (which is about 140 a month because roommate insists on leaving the AC or heater on all day/night), and half the internet (which was supposed to be what our roommate paid for). So my fiance is paying more money for literally everything (about $1200 each month), even though he asked roommate to pay just the $80 on top of the rent (about $980). It seems dumb, but with everything else we have to pay for (our groceries, car insurance, car lease, pet food, and other monthly things), we don't have money saved up like we were hoping. Not to mention we have to help him if he's short on rent too. It's hard. He and my fiance work the same job, he makes more money than my fiance though, and I work minimum wage. 

So, essentially, he doesn't pay as much as he should. And on top of that, he's been getting money from my in-laws. They're getting annoyed with him too, because they've lent him thousands of dollars the past few months.

There's other things too. Smaller things, but still. Like, he sleeps with his bedroom door wide open. His room is through the living room and by the kitchen so anytime I walk to get food or anything, he's just sleeping (his bed is right in front of the door too). And other times I've walked just to my bathroom or anything and his door was open, I've seen him... pleasure himself. It's under the blanket but it really triggers my PTSD and memories of my dad, and then I end up locking myself in the room because I don't feel comfortable. And the other night, my fiance and I were sleeping (it was 5 in the morning, so the time my fiance and roommate would be getting ready for work), and my roommate was at our door (which was open a little) trying to get my fiance's attention. It was really hot in our room (because roommate kept the heater on all night), so I was sleeping without covers and yes I sleep naked. So he got a good view of that. It kinda scared me. The day after that happened, I got up to go to the restroom for like 2 seconds and let our cat out of the room (she'd been in our room all night with the door closed) and she was just hanging out by our bedroom door. Right after I left the bathroom, our roommate got mad and yelled at me because our cat supposedly just peed in his room. The same cat who was in our room aalllll night and who was in our doorway for 2 seconds while I went to the bathroom. That pissed me off a lot. Especially considering his dog sleeps in his room and has a history of peeing in there if he's not walked at 5 in the morning (which he hadn't been, by the way). And lastly, I like cooking so if I cook, we'll share with him. But work had me drained last night so I ordered my fiance and I pizza and ordered wings for myself (its that time of month and all I wanted was wings). We ate and put it in the fridge for left overs for the next day (since i had it off work). When I went to get some this morning, some of the pizza was missing. I'd assumed my fiance took some to work, no biggy. But then I got my wings and some were missing. I texted my fiance and asked if he'd let the roommate have some and he said he never told him he could have some and that he didn't take any to work, which means when we went to bed, our roommate just ate our left overs without asking. Which makes me mad because we don't eat his stuff. We bought him a cake for his birthday and didn't even have any because we gave the cake to him. I dunno. It's really annoying. We've been talking about getting our own apartment, and his parents are onboard with why (they don't even know the whole story either). But the problem is we're on the lease until May 2021, so we're kinda stuck here. 

What should we do? We've tried talking to him, and we don't wanna like kick him out or us move into a different apartment in the same complex and screw him over

TL;DR: older roommate is being a buttnugget and taking advantage of us and we only have 2 options: stay and just ignore it for the last 6 months of lease, or move into a different apartment in the complex and screw him over because he's financially irresponsible",20Nov2020,1
589,"As the title says, I'm writing this on behalf of my older sister. We talk frequently on the phone about our lives and sometimes vent about our problems. 

Recently over the last few conversations she has expressed concern over her neighbor being just a little too interested in her. 

He is an older man who is a former Marine and Vietnam veteran. I mention this specifically because we are Asian and she thinks he has a weird racist fetish. She is a petite girl in her thirties who lives alone. He lives in the same apartment complex in a unit one floor above hers and it overlooks hers across a small courtyard. She has also expressed that she thinks he watches he door with his Ring doorbell.

I guess ever since she moved in and introduced herself to all the neighbors at a BBQ one of the residents was having, this dude has been oddly more and more intrusive.

This is especially unusual since he is an older married man with daughters around her age and there is a global pandemic going on where people need to be social distancing. He often knocks on her door often without a mask on, for inane reasons like ""hey i got some old glass bottles, cause I hear you like to brew beer!"" or just simply to have a conversation. Its gotten to the point where she has to pretend she not home and not answer, but the knocking is very persistent and very long. He also shoots a bit of casual racism her way when referring to Asian people in conversation with her as ""your kind"". She also has told he he has touched he legs when talking to her and despite the fact that she jumped away to indicate with facial expression and body language that was weird, he just kind of brushed that off as nothing.

She has told me multiple times how she feels in a way trapped in her own apartment because he often tries to stop her as soon as she leaves out her front door, and occasionally he will just hijack her with conversation by standing in front of the elevator she is trying to get into to go to the parking level. 

Unfortunately he also somehow got her phone number and also blows up her phone with texts. 

I am not sure what advice to give here and I cant physically do anything from where I am since i live in a different state. 

I told her I would post this problem here since she is too busy right now to do it herself, so what do you think of this situation reddit?",20Nov2020,1
590,"I have a molar that broke about 5 years ago now on my bottom left side and I had a temporary filling put in it, my dentist at the time said they could try a root canal but since it was a vertical break that it probably would be best to just pull it. I couldn't afford anything else to be done with it at the time and just kept chewing on my right side and it's lasted this long. Now it's starting to break down and when I bite down on my left side the tooth is feeling off and when I move my jaw sometimes I get a weird sensation on that side where the tooth is so it's starting to reach the breaking point. I'm going to need an implant because it's right in the middle. Not to mention the tooth beside it is probably fucked as well now since it's been so long. 

Now on my right side, an upper molar I'm sure has a cavity that gets a small abscess every so often that breaks because it bleeds a little off and on and I get a bad taste in my mouth. Plus I have 2 wisdom teeth left that need to be pulled, I have no pain thankfully but they're riddled with cavities. 

My front bottom teeth I can see grayish mark's around the gums on top of just plaque buildup so I'm terrified they're not going to be able to save those either. 

I've had horrible dental care for years because of depression and low key being suicidal I just didn't really give a shit about my body at all. Didn't shower, barely ate, etc. I've managed to work up to brushing at least once a day and the same with flossing which I know is not nearly enough but better than not at all. I've been taking zinc and vitamin c which oddly seems to help my gums from bleeding and any aches I start to get in those teeth fades some. Not sure how those are helping exactly but they're doing something.

My credit is terrible because I had a couple bills go into collections and now with my current job income I'd have to work 60 hours every week just to have enough extra money to even attempt to pay those bills off in collections which will still take *months* for me to pay off. I don't know what to do.

Should I just keep going and hope to god that filling and tooth holds another 6 months or see if there's a dentist that will accept literally $10 a month towards whatever bill I have because even with insurance I'm straight up just fucked. My entire mouth needs I'm sure several cavities drilled and filled I can see at least 3 and of course the one in my upper right molar, general cleaning, 3 teeth pulled (the bad molar and last 2 wisdom)... 

How the fuck can I fix this? What can I possibly do? I'm also scared of the dentist, I just want to be knocked out while they fix everything, but most don't do that right? I'm so scared of losing all my teeth and it's all my fucking fault.",20Nov2020,1

592,"hi so I’ve known this guy since august (online) and turned out we lived pretty near. We planned to meet in October but our country went into lockdown so we had to wait. 

Now things are open again but we found out yesterday it’s only for  one week so tomorrow is the only time we can meet until the new year. So yeah we decided fuck it we gotta meet and I’ve got my heart set on meeting up with this guy. 

I fessed up and told my mother the whole truth about it and she agreed to let me go even though it was so last minute and I told her everything about the guy. I’ve FaceTimed him etc etc. However it’s 5pm Friday night and we plan to go Saturday 11am, my mum told my dad and he’s adamant I’m not allowed to go. He said I’m not allowed to go alone to meet some guy. I completely understand that but this is something I have to do. None of my friends can make it on such short notice so I only have one option to save myself. Lie. I figured I only live once and I don’t want to mess up my chance with this guy. (I’ve never lied to my parents, I’m an A* student and I never go out to parties etc- pretty much a goody two shoes) 

How do I pull that off? I could lie and say a friend is coming but I feel like it’s going to look so suspicious on my behalf after I asked to go alone so many times and I’m worried my mother will check the bus stop to see if my friend shows up and I will be crucified if I’m caught.

596,"During high school I was pretty much the average nice guy, friendly, cared about everyone, you know average...
I had a lot o friends and girl friends, but never dated until college, where I meet my first girlfriend...
That's when my life changed, I was dating her for about a year, I really liked her and thought she was my soul mate, (yes I was really naive, I know) until I saw her making out with another guy.
Damn, that was really painful and that wasn't even the worst part. I was so shocked that I freeze, she saw me there and still didn't say a word.
Man, at that moment I was not depressed at all, but I was angry with myself for being so stupid and disgusted with life, I couldn't accept that...
After that my life changed completely, I started going out every night, without caring about anything. Had weeks where I slept with more than four girls...
Especially naive girls or girls who had a boyfriend. I felt pleasure conquering and having them in my hands like toys.
I no longer know how many girls I've ruined in the past 2 years.
I guess I'm already broken, I'm twisted... I feel like, I can't go back anymore to the old me, that naive boy. This pandemic made me realize that I can't live like that anymore. 
That's just an endless path of no return... 
I don't know what to do anymore.

601,"I've pasted a test and had the interview on Oct 28. The hiring dude said that he'll call either way within 2-3 weeks. He was very adamant that he would let people know no matter what. 

It's not been a little over three weeks. I get that it may take longer with covid since someone may have had to call out or something. 

They would have called if I got it. So if I call today then I'll either hear ""we're still working on it,"" or ""we went other people."" So nothing positive will actually happen. Only possibly the disappointing news that I didn't get it but I could move on.",20Nov2020,1

No matter how pissed I was I should have just walked away and calmed myself down. We talked it out afterwards and I apologized without making any excuses for myself, because there is no excuses for that kind of behavior. 

Despite that, I can tell he's still really hurt by it, as he rightfully should be. I already apologized and promised nothing like that would ever happen again, and I intend to keep that promise. Up to this point nothing like this has ever happened and I've been living with him since I was a kid. We've had arguments of course but they've never gotten this bad.

606,"Long story short, I was a college athlete at a junior college before 2 reoccurring injuries stopped me from playing. 

As was the original plan in the first place, I now have to transfer to a 4 year to finish my education, just not as a college athlete this time. 

I applied to 2 schools, one in state and one out of state. Both schools have a set of friends from highschool there (the in state friends I see much more frequently), but I feel like I’m growing apart from all of my in state friends, almost to the point where they annoy me on the daily. 

I would just go to the out of state school, but their transfer policy made it to where several of my credits wouldn’t transfer and I would have to take them again, so essentially I’d have to repeat a year to a year and a half of college. The in state school however, does not have this issue. Both schools are almost even in price due to this. 

My question is, do I focus on finishing school as early as possible even though I may not be happy at all with my social life? Or do I go to the school where I’ll likely be happier socially, but it will take much longer to finish as I’ll have to repeat some courses? 

Some context that might help: I’m a pre-med, so it’s not like retaking these courses will be easy or fun lol.",20Nov2020,1

615,"I am a 19 year old adult male. For the past few years (throughout highschool), I have been certain that I have a moderate-severe learning disability. I have brought my concerns to my parents several times, but being immigrants who grew up under the ""hard work pays off"" doctrine, they don't really understand the importance of mental health/disabilities and keep insisting that my inability to perform in school is simply a function of my laziness, while refusing to help me get a proper diagnoses.

Now I am in college, and I feel like my impairment is seriously inhibiting my ability to perform basic executive functions such as focusing for more than a few minutes at a time, remembering important information for more than a few hours, and social upkeep/maintenance with acquaintances. My grades and social life have both taken a serious hit since I enrolled in college, my chances of being able to accomplish my long-term future goals have become extremely slim, and altogether I am in a really bad place right now.

Every resource I have used (such as school therapists) have acknowledged my disability and advised me to see a psychiatrist, but my parents who pay for my education, housing, medical insurance (everything important in my life) won't go for it -- psychiatrists are expensive! Since I am now an adult, what are some BUDGET-FRIENDLY options I have to get the help I need?

617,"Ok so context. 

My friend group recently broke off a friend she was kinda toxic. 

Every since then,  friend 1 started being very self conscious and friend 2 and I would tell her she's amazing and other things. 

Friend 1 doesn't have a good relationship with her parents and today she sent this to the group with me, friend 1 and friend 2 in it. I can't send photos but I will type the conversation out.

Friend 1: 

I can't do it anymore

I had a fight with my mum bc my dad brought a £500 sofa and

I was drawing with Sharpie pen an a piece of fabric and we got in a fight and she called me snotty little bitch so I called her a snotty little bitch

And now what am I living for

My family wouldn't care if I died

They all hate me

They don't care what makes me happy

And what I like doing


Friend 2:

First of all I’m going to say it’s wrong of her to do that. If only you could live with me

I don’t know what to say cuz I can’t relate 😬


Friend 1:

Friend 2:

620,"here’s some backstory: 
in september, i quit my minimum wage job working at a movie theatre to work for a small mexican restaurant. i wanted to make more money and improve my spanish, and both of those things are happening and going well. 

the restaurant i work at has ten employees including myself. recently, one of our full-time cooks got in a car accident and is going to be in the hospital for a while. two of my coworkers are going back home (they attend a local university), so my job will be down three people until january, leaving seven of us. 

i enjoyed the first two weeks working there. and then everything went downhill. 

the third week i worked there, the AC in the building was broken. i am chronically ill, and because my boss REFUSES to give me a break even though i’m a minor (which is illegal by the way), i couldn’t stop for a minute to drink some water. i became so dehydrated and i threw up and passed out on the bathroom floor. i believe i was in there for about ten minutes. when i regained consciousness, i explained to my boss what happened and she told me continue working, even though i thought i needed to go to the hospital because i threw up blood. i worked for five more hours WITHOUT a break. 

my boss has also gaslighted me numerous times. we sell a small selection of mexican candies, and a TON went missing. my bosses have cameras everywhere to make sure we are always working. we looked back at the cameras, and it was a young latina women who took all the candy. my boss, after seeing video  footage of who stole the candy, blames it on me. 

mind you, the woman in the video had black hair and olive skin. i have blonde hair and i am incredibly pale. 

i’m not fucking stupid, and i know i did not steal anything from my job. after arguing with my boss about it for twenty minutes AND having video footage proving my innocence, she still tried to convince me that i stole the candy and next time she would fire me.

a week ago, she texted me and my coworkers that if she sees us on our phones for whatever reason, she will deduct $10 from our paycheck, which is also illegal. 

my boss and her husband own the restaurant. her husband is addicted to meth, verbally abuses his wife and nine year old son, and me and my coworkers.

here’s where i’m conflicted:

i am making a FUCK ton of money. like. a lot of money. 

because we are short staffed, i would feel really guilty if i left.

my spanish has greatly improved, and i want to go to college for spanish.

what should i do??",20Nov2020,1
622,"I have been meeting every other week via videochat with my therapist during the pandemic.

For the first time today, they used a background image of an office space (shelves with plants and books) that looked plausibly realistic, but the masking of their hair and the high backed chair they sit in created a bit of a ghost effect, especially if they moved at all.

I found this extremely distracting and made very little ""eye contact"" during the session.

For context, I am ADHD, and keeping myself engaged in the discussion is a very real challenge that requires that I set up with something to fidget with, a notebook, and clear my room of as many distractions as possible, and it helps to focus on the face of the person I'm conversing with to keep my mind from traveling away from listening to what they are saying.

Is it appropriate for me to ask, via email before our next session, that they not use the background image, and instead go back to the video showing the room behind them?",20Nov2020,1
623,"I bought my roommates each a small gift for the holidays and since we're all moving out and probably won't see each other for a long time. W e're in college but not returning to on-campus next semester.They're leaving in 30 minutes. I bought the gifts like a week ago and just haven't given it to them yet, for some reason I feel so awkward!! I always feel like this but at least during birthdays and on an actual holiday gifts are expected.

I don't even know if they'll like the gifts and it doesn't really matter, I guess? Like I hope they'll like them but I also want them to know it's fine if they don't.

Anyway the gifts have been in my drawer for a week. And time is almost up. But I feel too awkward, can someone give me a script or something to follow? How do I approach this conversation? :/",20Nov2020,1
624,"We are a large family. Due to health conditions I (38f) am unable to return to work. My husband (36) never had an opportunity to get his college degree because he had to care for his dying mother for 12 years. Consequently, he has worked hard manual labor all his life. Now he is struggling with 16 hr work days, 5 days a week, 2 days off. It’s killing him. Our baby has an autoimmune disorder now and is kept alive through my care 24/7. Neither has any family. 



If he could somehow get his college degree it would change our lives drastically! Some online courses are expedited and he might be able to finish a bachelors in 2 years instead of the usual 4. 


We receive some aid that should cover bills, EXCEPT our rent. We are willing to sacrifice everything to make it. We already rent as low as possible in our area (west Texas, rent is $1,100/month for a family of 6, which is already a reduced rate).



Please, Before anyone starts in on how many kids we have, yes we know it’s too much for people in our situation. The last Two of them came while on birth control. I am getting a permanent fix as soon as my health allows me to. Please don’t address this right now, as it is obvious, and we are PAINFULLY aware of how much it complicates matters. But what can we do now? They’re here. There’s no giving them “back.”



I know this is all pretty much impossible. But I had one shred of hope that someone out here might have an idea for how to get rental assistance so my husband can go back to school and we can get our lives in a better place.",20Nov2020,1

626,"A little background: My previous neighbour used to take in every stray cat they can find and like 10-20 of them would chase me when I was coming home (I was 7) so I am okay with cats but fucking scared of them in close distanc or when they show interest. 

They moved out about 9 years ago. 

About 3 years ago, all the cats in my little cluster of block was eliminated. When I said all, I mean you can walk past 10 blocks and won't be able to find a single cat. 

About 7months-1year ago, this cat tried entering our house. This happened often because the whole block changed our door and most of us had the same ones. Some block upgrade thing. BUTT this cat kept coming back and he doesn't have a collar. One fine day, my neighbour fuckingly fed him so he is here everyday now. From 9pm to 9am, meowing really loudly. He is the loudest cat I have met. 

What is he meowing for? He can meow for 5 hours non stop. He wants to get into my neighbour's house to sleep. He goes out to do his adult stuff frkm 9am and 9pm so he leaves their house by himself. 

From time to time, when I accidentally leave my door open and he gets in I am still so fucking scared but he goes out after seeing my fear. Automatically. You know how animals can sense that you are scare of them so they dont trust you? Yea, he trust me the least between my neighbours and family. 

I feel sad for him and want to help him. I realise that he doesnt come when there is a storm and I keep thinking that he may be stranded somewhere. 

My parents treat him endearingly but we know that they do not want to adopt him. My neighbours also do not want him. 

Suggestions? Should I get a bed for him outside or something? What should I do about this. I think taking him to the vet is kind of useless because he gets out to do his stuff in the wild everyday. I can't call authorities cos they want kill them and we arent close enough for me to put him up for adoption. I am still scared though but it has been months and no one is doing anything about it.",20Nov2020,1

I had friends in middle school but that's because I went to a private school where there were only 30 kids in the class... so... a totally different story.

632,"I (24F) have been in a relationship with my gf (27F) for about a year now. She’s wonderful and creative and smart and just everything good. We’re both victims of extensive and lengthy sexual abuse as children and some other wonderful (/s) rapey shit as adults. She’s bisexual, but homoromantic, so she has consensual sexual experiences with men that she’s enjoyed, but she can’t maintain a romantic relationship with one. My view on men is mostly just disgust. Some basic caveman instinct fear that has manifested into some truly aggressive hatred. I try really really hard to not let this affect anyone. It’s not fair to be a dick to someone just because of their sex or gender (depending I guess). I have a younger brother and I avoid him because he’s a young man now and I am repulsed. 

The point is my gf told me recently about giving a guy a blowjob and being into it (before we were dating) in the bed that we sleep in now. I don’t know how to let it go. It shouldn’t matter. This shouldn’t even BE a problem. Every time she tries to touch me I recoil. I can’t look her in the face. I can’t stop picturing it because I know EXACTLY who she’s talking about. Is it because of my aversion to men? This isn’t news to me or anything. It’s just that she talked about being into it and just talked to me about it at all. She called me out on acting weird today and I told her exactly what I’m writing here now. I was just honest with her and I tried to explain that it was my own hang up and it doesn’t reflect on her at all. How can I move past this? If it’s not a big deal to begin with what can I do to overcome it?

Also I’m sorry to any men reading this. I hate your sex, but not you as a person. I wish I didn’t. We could be really good friends for years and I would still resent your sex. It’s not rational and I’m so so so sorry if I hurt any of your feelings.",20Nov2020,1
634,"My mom buys me a planner every year for Christmas (one of those bulky Erin Condren ones). My mom doesn't make very much money and I know those planners are pretty expensive.

The thing is that I simply don't use them. I have my work calendar on my phone and I use that for pretty much everything. I don't have the space in my bag to carry around a planner and writing things out in three different places (two are required by my employer) is just a hassle when I have instant access to my calendar on my phone. 

I appreciate the thought and I know that she really thought I would benefit from this type of gift, but it just doesn't work for me. 

It wasn't a huge deal the first year I got one (smile and say thanks, etc.), but now she's made a habit of it and the last one I got stayed on my end table until I finally recycled it last week.

635,"Not my dogs, but here is a little back story on the situation.

I have two pretty chill roommates that I will be leaving soon because they just got married like three weeks ago and want some space. They are really good friends and I get it so as soon as I was informed of this wish I found a place to rent not even a month later... but unfortunately their time being spent together alone has been postponed because T's (roommate 1 F) dad has had a heart attack and will be moving in while he recovers. This includes his dog, who was unfortunately a dog that was chained up most of his life and kept outside. I'm not sure what kind of dog this is, but he's a mut anyway.

Anyway, my roommates have two well behaved dogs. One female husky/shepard mix, and one American Pitbull male. Please do comment if you have any hatred toward that breed. He's a well behaved social dog that has never had an issue with any other dog before. 

The mut that my roommates have staying here is still kept outside, as he is not house broken and trys to fight the Pitt. One morning after coming home from my usual twelve hour overnight shift I plop in my bed and as usual a few hours later my roommates are getting ready for work and T will let the dogs out. My roommates have bought one of those small enclosures and set it up for the mut. Well, I woke up to the sound of a dog fight and ran outside, the Pitt and the mut are nashing a nawing at each otherthrough the fence of the enclosure. 

After some questioning of T and later her husband C, I have found out that the Pitt went over to investigate said enclosure and that's when the Mut began growling at the Pitt and Pitt didn't like that very much. Soon teeth clashing through a fence began. Then everytime he'd be let out to use the bathroom, that mut would start barking at him and it would happen again. Now the first thing the Pitt does is quickly use the bathroom and rush over to fight the mut. It's really out of character for said Pitt to be aggressive toward anything other than a bug it sees hoping around. Pitt is cool with the others dog in our 'neighborhood' which consists of only one neighbor and he is so well behaved he never leaves the yard and does not require a leash because he listens and we live in the woods, but he won't leave the front yard anyway. Anytime he goes to play with C's friend's dogs he always behaves. 

I do blame a little bit on my roommates for not properly introducing the dogs, but C was not thrilled about having to take care of someone's dog who was not well taken care or trained to begin with. 

Obviously, a leash is now enforced but he still trys to go over to the mut and kick his ass. So I'm wondering if maybe this could be a good training oppurtunity for the Pitt and hope that you guys might have some methods in which to teach Pitt to watch his temper and stay away from Mut's enclosure. I was raised with pitbulls so I know how they are about holding a grudge, but I want to figure something before I move out because it's the least I could.",20Nov2020,1
636,"I (27f) am a new mother. My husband (32m) and I have recently had to put up a no contact with my mother and I was wondering if I was the asshole. So to give u an incite of what was going on let me start when my baby was born. I had a horrible pregnancy but to be honest it was worth every sec when my baby came to this world. When she was born my mother literally took her away from me when I was holding her. But I thought she's excited to meet the baby. Everyone was but I saw a look in her face that told me other wise. But I ignored it thinking naw there's no way. Now skip to spring we had a few friends move in due to the pemdemic. I was just about to go back to work and on that fateful day police came and told us one of our roommates had molested our child. I was horrified, disgusted, angry, and more. But my mother had other plans and other ideas. That night we went to the hospital with our child. My mother had said ""Well it is ur fault"" I looked at her at that point and said ""Excuse me, what did u say"" she said ""If u didn't have a gold heart this would have never happened this is ur fault!"" I couldn't even look or sit next to her at that point. I told (sorry yelled) at her to leave. But I forgave her. Thinking maybe it was my fault. But after therapy I got better. I was getting back on track. I was going to work. I was starting to defend my husband from her racist comments. And then she posted a picture on Facebook that got me and my husband really..  well angry. So some incite, my husband and I are huge about keeping our mask and being clean do to our baby being so small. We have followed the 6 feet rule. We saw our baby being held by some random Man that nether of us knew. When I brought it up that we still aren't comfortable with random people holding our baby she dismissed it and told us that this man was a family friend and that it was only him and his wife. I have never seen him before that picture. So I knew it was a lie. Now this is where I started putting boundaries. It was when my mother yelled at me on halloween and that it was Her right to take Her baby trick or treating. She littlely said Her Baby. That i killed her mother because i don't wear a mask (fyi everytime i see my grandmother i do wear a mask) My husband and I at this point have said you can see the baby at our house but she is to not be at my her house with out ether of us there. Now I've been told by a lot of family that I was in the right what she said was wrong. But I grew up with family is family u can't abandon them. You have to forgive but at this point shes just hurting me and my husband. Ooooo there's so many stories I can write about her if u want just let me know, but how far should I go?

638,"I started having a light hearted debate with my friends about reselling ethics, I believe reselling is ethical and was giving points and it just ended up with them 3 v 1 telling me to shut up and move on every time I made a point and calling resellers scumbags at every point. 

I would like to just move on and pretend it didn't happen but they make jokes about me being wrong about it occasionally and it puts me in a bad mood as when I start to reload the debate they just tell me to shut up and move on. 

It's not part of my character to let things slide in general, I prefer to hash things out there and then, it is especially frustrating when being taunted with it also.

Here are the points if anyone was interested;

Luxury Reselling Ethics 

1) People who are willing to pay to extortionate prices don't care about the money they spend as it's a small percentage of their bank balances and is negligible.  

2) After restock and more restock the people who are willing to pay extortionate amounts of money will reduce and resellers will get stuck with products.  

3) The argument that even though rich people shouldn't pay high prices just because they're rich (I know, poor rich kids right)  If the rich people choose not to buy at extortionate prices the reseller market crumbles and they could then buy at cheap prices like everyone else.  

4) If you have limited amount per household this will help further prevent reselling.

5) These items are luxury items therefore not necessary and no one loses out. If reselling luxury items to some poncy rich kids can put food in your kids mouths then there's no problem. 

6) The argument that if the original business sold it at crazy prices is shitty, therefore reseller behavior is shitty is false as the reseller does not have the options to have economies of scale (to mass produce more products in order to make a larger more stable income)  

7) A strong reseller market is a direct result of a company not making enough units whether first release or on restock.",20Nov2020,1

* When you buy something for someone else, that **does not** make it yours. If you buy someone something, you **cannot** take it back. It is **theirs**, and learn that once and for all.

Say you recently went out and bought some new school shoes for your child. They've tripped and ripped the sole of the shoe off. Would you say that the shoes are now yours? Of course not. Don't be silly.

&amp;#x200B;

* Your child's room is **their personal space**. Not for you to rummage in, not for you to enter without their permission. **Stay out**.

Your child's room is their space for them to feel comfortable and for them to live in.  If you look around their room, you'll lose their trust and make them feel as if they have to live up to your expectations of a perfect room, same with cleaning. Let them be happy with the area in which they want to live in. You don't live in their room, so why should you care?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Do not look through your child's phone.**

Do you want your child to lose all kinds of trust in you? Even if they're not hiding anything, Don't ever snoop through their phone. They'll have private stuff, even if it's not bad, such as simple texts from friends or S/Os (significant others), without needing you to watch over their every move. Next, their gallery. They don't want you to look through their pictures, videos, Snapchat, or anything else. Some people might want to keep their personal life personal, and you're no better than them, even if you gave birth to them. They're still human, with rights and an opinion, and you're gonna have to learn to respect that.

&amp;#x200B;

* Don't **doubt** your child too often.

Even if they do lie a lot, if you really know your child, you would be able to tell if they're lying or telling the truth, especially about serious situations. You losing your trust in them will turn out to be a double-edged sword, which will stab you right in the ass as you see your child doing the same as you do to them.

640,"I recently repatriated after almost a decade abroad. A couple years into my life abroad I made a good friendship with a girl from my same original country. Our friendship grew and grew over the years. She became, to me, one of the best girlfriends I’d ever had (I always had trouble maintaining friendships with girls). I took her to the hospital when her water broke early for her first child, and she eventually named me godmother to that child. I took care of that child when she went into early labor with her second and was there for her and her family when they lost that second child. I celebrated with her when she got pregnant a third time and was there for the birth of that baby. Our families would do things together like game nights and day trips and even holidays together when neither of us could return to our country to see our family. When our parents would come visit us, we introduced them to each other. She would text my mom separately from me. She and I even started planning on opening a business together. 

Then I found out my husband and I would need to relocate for his job. As soon as I told her, she started to pull away. I tried to see her more, because I knew I wouldn’t get so many opportunities in the future, and she started turning me down more. She got very distant, but I just figured she had a lot going on, taking care of two small kids and going ahead with a new business venture (different industry than the one we’d been working on). After I moved this past January, we kept in touch via text and video chats...for the first few months. But around May, she ghosted. I couldn’t get a response. I couldn’t get feedback on any platforms. Even when I would post a comment on her business’ social media pages, she would like or respond to everyone else’s comments but mine. 

This was awful. It hurt me beyond belief. But over the past several months I’ve tried to come to terms with it. I stopped reaching out or making any attempts in August. However, my question is this: am I still the godmother to her first child? His birthday is coming up, and I have always given him a gift. My heart still wants to connect with him; I love that little boy like he was my own. I don’t want him to feel forgotten by me. It seems obvious (though has never been explicit) that his mom doesn’t want to put any effort into continuing our relationship, but does this extend to her kids? It’s so heartbreaking. What do you think? Should I send him a gift and let him know I still love him, or should I just wash my hands and walk away? TIA

TL;DR: I was the godmother to my best friend’s kid, and my BFF has now ghosted on me, and I’m wondering if I can/should still pursue some kind of relationship with my godson or if I just have to back off.",20Nov2020,1

Hi! I will be a high school student after 1.5 years. I am both excited and worried about it.

First reason tht i am worried about is, friendship. I live in a foreign country. I have friends are from same country with me. But in there are mostly foreigner people in the high school that i want to start, and i have so many mistakes when i try to speak language of this country. I am worried about if they prejudge me and if they refuse to be friend with me. I am already concerned about if i can't reach the point that needs for high school that i want to start.

Second reason is, my grades. I am worried about my grades. I heard that in high school, there are more difficult. I am worried about if my grade going to be more worse and if i can't reach te goal that i want.

I feel like I could turn around and turn back and all I'll see is a canvas with a drawing of my room on it",20Nov2020,1
644,"This is perhaps the hardest situation I have or ever will face, and I've genuinely no idea how to fix myself or resolve this issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I suppose I should start from the beginning, 

&amp;#x200B;

About a month ago, the police department called my parents telling them that I was talking to someone in France and they have to check through my laptop/phone to make sure that I wasn't doing anything terrorist related \[due to the recent terrorist attacks in France + the UK being at a high risk of a terrorist attack\] and afterwards, told my parents I wasn't allowed to use Discord anymore, even though they found nothing on the laptop. 

&amp;#x200B;

This French person was an online friend of mine and we grew pretty close over the course of the 7 months and we helped eachother out in the tough times and celebrated the good times. We got so close that I decided to get her a little snow leopard plush as a gift (also yes, it IS a her, we called and all her pictures don't exist on the internet) and I guess that's what caught their attention. As far as I know there's an investigation going on to find a 'group' linked to terrorism. As a 16 year old undergoing a transition to a new bit of school (A-levels (Essentially 11th Grade for the Americans)) and randomly getting the main source of socialising when at home shut off, it caused me hell in my head. Life at home is already pretty stressful and I used Discord as a main way to keep my sanity (and yeah I do have friends in person, but my phone has restrictions like a 1hr limit before it locks for the day) and now that I can't Discord, I panicked and probably did something pretty bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a few VPNs and then used another social media site to talk to this French person \[for now let's call her Ray\] thinking it'd be okay, I wouldn't get in trouble and this situation would sort itself out. It really didn't :(

&amp;#x200B;

The police called a second time on last Friday and took my laptop for 5 days to check through it. This second time caused my parents to just become distant and disapproving of me, and honestly expected me to run away and join ""ISIS"". I'll admit the past few days haven't been their shining moments in parenting, but I honestly don't blame them, I would be harsh too if my child supposedly conversed with a 'terrorist'. And now I've been having incredibly depressive episodes where I just break down crying and don't want to be physically alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's really hard for me, I don't know who to believe, even though I really do think that Ray is innocent, but the police are saying otherwise, but they themself won't talk to me at all, and all the information I'm getting is being relayed by my parents. I haven't been given the chance to ask questions or make peace with any of this. :(

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up this morning after a dream about Ray being able to talk to me again and being given chocolate via post, but after I realised it was just a dream I got depressed and only got out of bed out of fear of crying and falling into a deeper hole of sadness.

&amp;#x200B;

The question of if she is or isn't innocent about the allegations are already enough to make me question everything, and I really do care about her, but I think it would really be the best idea if I stopped trying to talk to her, for better or worse, because I can't handle the stress of the police or anything that could bother her.

&amp;#x200B;

So in conclusion, how would I make saying goodbye easier and deal with the new loneliness in my life?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for sounding a bit like a loser, I just can't handle it on my own

TLDR : Police think Discord friend is part of a terrorist group and now I have to deal with loneliness and frequent periods of sadness",20Nov2020,1
645,"I'm really on the crossroads here and I need an outsider point of view. 

I knew her since we become classmates in 2015 but due to my natural shyness, we didn't really speak with each other more than needed in natural interactions. Years passed and my friend told me she asked him to tell me I should ask her out to prom, after all, I didn't because a) I saw she already paid for someone outside our school (she might have done it being shy as well and wasn't sure if anyone's going to ask her out, they didn't end up dancing together after the initial dance so it might be it), b) wasn't sure if my friend isn't fooling around as he was known for it, c) the whole prom thing was really stressful for me already and I didn't really get any vibes from her indicating she might want to be my date for prom.

She also invited me to her 18th birthday and I was one of the few boys out there, not everyone from my class was invited. I generally think she liked me even if we didn't spend much time with each other. 

After we graduated, I got my summer job as a night receptionist at the hotel, I'm talking 12 hours shifts and understaffed so I ended up working almost all of the summer. All I did for a few months was basically sleeping or working. Now here goes the part that doesn't let me sleep at night: we got matched on Tinder but I never asked her out. You see, the point is, I was so overworked I basically had no drive to do anything else and after all the only free time I could write to her was around 2 AM, not good, right? Long story short: my grandpa died and I got even more depressed, I started university and suddenly we have almost 2 years since our Tinder match, never approached her as well as she didn't made any moves, only to delete our match year after. We've met 3 times since The Fateful Match, every time it was in our class group but I didn't get a sign of courage to speak with her and I don't think she was going for it either(?). Then we've met in the public library once, alone and we spoke for a few minutes as she was in a visible rush. I remember this prosaic talk to this day. I saw her a few times in the same place but both of us didn't really approach the other one? After all, it's the library, you came here to read not talk. 

Last thing that makes me unsure about doing anything: from her Instagram page it seems like her post-high school life is full of experiences, she has travelled to USA, Vietnam, France and now is participating in semester-long university exchange in France. Meanwhile, all I did was not much, to be honest. I ski a lot, but it's not really travelling, at least compared to her trips. I'm really miserable atm, stressed about my future and lonely. I know how it goes, you should be content with yourself first to think about the relationship but I believe that's not the case, I like myself and I'm passionate about my hobbies, I guess all I need for now is companionship. 

So, should I ask her out after she comes back from the exchange? I'm afraid I idealized her and she won't be the person I think she is, I'm afraid I'm going to be boring for someone who seems like enjoying their life to the fullest or that she is no longer interested in me if she ever was. And finally, I don't want to be some sort of creep, nice-guy that romanticises casual relations with girls, to this day I wonder if I'm overanalysing and she was never interested in me but I just can't stop thinking about her and move on. I'm mad at myself for not doing anything in high school or when we matched on Tinder. Truth be told if not for a Tinder match I would probably move on a long time ago but it makes me feel like I lost a chance. 

Please, give me some advice on how to approach this problem of mine. Sorry for my English grammar, not a native speaker. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: We've matched on Tinder two years ago after graduating high school but neither of us made a move. Now I'm afraid if I'm overanalysing/romanticise things, idealized her. Should I move on or ask her out?",20Nov2020,1
646,"The story is a bit long, and I want to ask strangers to let me know if I'm in the wrong and should support them in their decision. First of all, my family is really close, so when my brother sprung up to his engagement this month and his desire to get married next month, I was hesitant to congratulate him (btw going to refer to him as Tim). So the issue I see here is that his relationship started wrong. What I mean by this is that my other brother, let's call him Bob, had known the girl first and were friends. Bob had a crush on this girl when he was in middle school. Tim, at that time, was about to graduate high school and was oblivious to this girl and her existence. Tim began playing video games on the pc with bob. Tim started medalling in Bob's life and trying to help bob flirt with the girls they were playing with. Despite bob telling him to fuck off because he had no interest in these girls. Tim had conversations with those girls despite them being a lot younger than him (he was an adult, and some of the kids he was playing with were in middle school). Tim ended up finding out the girl who bob was interested in and claimed he had contacted her to try and be his wingman. When bob first found this out, he told Tim to stop talking to her and let him do his own thing. Bob eventually finds out Tim, and the girl was flirting despite everything Tim had told him. Once the girl and Tim started dating, they kept their relationship a secret. At this point, bob had thought Tim and the girl had cut whatever was going on before it became serious. Tim is in the army, and when he was able to take a few days of leave and visit, he had told our mother he was dating this girl and who she was. Tim's mother had told him to break things off with the girl; she did not believe she could support the relationship if it would hurt another one of her children.  Time eventually told his mother he broke things off and started handing out with another girl while he was in town. He started hanging out with that other girl a lot. He even took that other girl to a family Christmas party and other family events. But surprisingly, a few months later, Tim told his brothers and sisters he was dating the girl bob had a past interest in.  And today says he is engaged with the girl.  And also says he wanted to inform his family because he care about them and wants their blessing. Despite his parent not know about this girl's existence. BTW the girl and Tim had not interacted much time in person. It's mostly all been over the phone/facetime or playing video games. 

If anyone wants to give any advice, it would be appreciated and welcomed. I also want to ask if me not supporting Tim is wrong?",20Nov2020,1

648,"Here’s the backstory for context first (kinda complicated so I’ll sum it up as short as I can)
Last year in school, a girl that I never saw before was in my class and I got a major crush on her. I didn’t know she had a boyfriend at the beginning of the year. The dude was in my other class and he found out I liked her because we talked about girls without me knowing who he was. So she knew I liked her bascially for the whole year (messed up situation, IKR 😂) So they eventually broke up after winter break and then I told her I liked her in March (THe day before we got out of school for COVID) but got friend zoned . I stopped texting her in April because she wasn’t giving the same energy back and we didn’t speak until last month. I decided to text her just to catch up again and we’ve texted a few times since then. 

Side note: I was basically simping for her (which left me so hurt when I got rejected) then and I was in a bad time for myself. I have improved myself very much since then, physical appearance and mentally and started taking better care of myself. 

Here’s current situation: I’ve had reoccurring dreams about her off and on for months and I can’t shake the thought of her. I really feel like I’m over her (but I also think I still have feelings at the same time. I think I may just be trying to deny I still have them) but I just can’t shake it off. So my question is, i kinda want to just put my thoughts to rest once and for all and ask if she wants to go out sometime but I just don’t know if I should do it. I don’t think there’s any chance of her saying yes but I think I just need to do it and get it done and hope it can finally put my thoughts away. 

My birthday is this week on thanksgiving so I figured that it’d be a nice gift if she said yes lol. If she says no, I won’t really affect me that much. 

But the only thing that I’m hesitant about is that I just talked to her on the phone for a little yesterday and the local Fair in January came up in the convo and we talked about going. Idk if doing anything now would ruin a chance for something that could happen then",20Nov2020,1

(I have a different reason for not telling my parents) So, she said her dad said maybe we could meet up, but he doesn't want to lie to her mom, so we don't really know what to do.

He’s handsome, young, single etc. Our appointments run over time and we always have a lovely chat (apart from last time when I was so nervous I had a spasm - yes I’ve posted about it on Reddit for your entertainment).

I only have one more appointment left with him and then I’m going to leave the practice - as I have my normal dentist elsewhere and only went for a discounted cosmetic procedure. I plan to ask him out but cannot do it in person because I’m too scared, his dental nurse is always there and I’ll still be his patient whilst I’m sat in his office. I managed to find him on Facebook (obviously didn’t add him) as I was thinking of where I can message him.

Now I’m not deluded and know there’s a 99% chance that he’s just being friendly and will reject me, but what’s the worst that could happen? He rejects me, I get embarrassed and won’t see him again. Life is too short not to try. My issue is that I can only ask him through social media and I’m worried he may be creeped out by me searching for him and messaging him (even though he has a unique name and it only took 2 seconds).

658,"A little background info about me: I’m currently a first year science student. When I originally applied for university, I wanted to do music, but I couldn’t audition because I wasn’t ready. My parents wouldn’t let me take a gap year so I had to get into something and picked science because my grades in high school for math and science were good.

Im currently writing this at 1 am and I have no idea what to do right now.
I thought that I was going to spend most of my time practicing my audition material by minimizing my course load. This wasn’t the case. I only have 3 classes (some have 4 or 5) yet all of my time is basically being forced to be spent on school.
I am mentally exhausted.
I just want to cry and let out all my emotions.
I feels so isolated and I lonely. I haven’t seen any of my friends since high school ended.
Im so exhausted from spending my entire day at my desk that none of my hobbies are appealing to me.
I feel like my audition material is falling behind due to how much time I have to spend on university.
My grades in university are terrible. I’m barely doing well on any major assessments no matter how much I study.
I’ve had so many people tell me that it’s not worth studying music because it has no future, and that I should study something with actual value so that I can make time and money for my hobbies.
We’re almost through the first semester and I just want it all to end. I can’t spend the rest of my life working in science. If first year university is causing me to feel like this, I don’t want to know what a full time job is going to be like.
I wanna do music so bad
Every time I get the chance to play music or study music, or think about going to music school, my optimism comes back. 
Like I said, I don’t know what to do right now.
Even though the auditions are in a few months, I feel that time is going by fast.
A lot of my friends and family say they believe I’m going to make it, but I keep doubting myself.
These audition pieces are also not easy, and if I want any chance at earning scholarships or awards, they need to be top of the line.

I recently graduated college and got a good paying job on pretty much the other side of town (around a 50 minute drive from my parents house) I'm getting sick and tired of making the drive out every day/night. Also, we work with various clients a day, and my dad is high risk and being that I literally live in the city with the highest daily cases of coronavirus in the USA, I thought it would be best if I moved out to protect my dad since I will naturally have a higher risk of getting covid than anyone else in my household. I found a very nice apartment around 5 minutes from work at a very good price with utilities included. My girlfriend and I had been talking about moving in together for a while and it just all seems to line up. However, I brought it up to my family a couple of weeks ago and they really put me down, they said I should be focusing on saving money so I can eventually buy a house, and that I shouldn't be moving in with anyone im not married to. However, since the apartment is at such a good price, I can fit in my budget to still set aside good amount of savings after all my expenses, I explained this to my parents and they seemed to be more understanding. However, once I brought it up to my sister she said that I was making a huge mistake, and that I haven't been at my job long enough yet for it to be stable, and she started questioning my reason to leave to protect my dad by calling me selfish, and pretty much just made a huge scene. I understand its tough to move out, and I will miss my family, but I don't think it should be such a big deal for a 22 year old with a stable paying job and a college degree to move out of his parents house, right? I just can't seem to shake off the guilt/cold feet ever since speaking with my family about this since I was originally super confident and excited to move out. Any advice? Am I doing the wrong thing?",20Nov2020,1

677,"Last summer, I took a trip with a group of friends. I hooked up with one of the guys in the group, and we are now roommates along with another mutual friend. Because we decided to live together, we agreed that it would be best to stop hooking up and stay friends. 

After a couple months of living together (this was a little over a month ago from present time), we ended up hooking up again and again for nearly 2 weeks. We never sat down and discussed the “terms and conditions” of our hookups or where we stood with each other, but he made a comment about our hookups being “something that happens sometimes”. In my head, this translates as he wants a casual, sexual friendship in which I am all for. 

This is where I begin to get mixed signals... Three weeks ago, he and our other roommate visited some friends at another college. Since they have been back, he has slept in my room for all but two nights. However, we haven’t had sex since their trip, which has thrown me off. He doesn’t initiate anything sexual, but he initiates cuddling and sleeping in bed together every night. I’ve tried to make moves but he doesn’t reciprocate anything so I just feel awkward. Based on this information, I’ve began to think that he isn’t into me anymore. But it confuses me how he still wants to sleep and cuddle almost every single night.

I know that talking directly to him would be the best option, but he tends to shut down whenever topics like that have come up in the past, and I don’t want to make it seem like I’m pushing for something more than a casual, sexual friendship. Is there a piece of this that I may be overlooking or being inconsiderate of? Thanks everyone! 

Edit to add: It may be important to note that he is not the most sexually experienced person, but he had only great things to say about our sex. This is another reason why I’m confused by our lack of sex lately.",20Nov2020,1

I am legit just a farmer from Oklahoma that drives an old dented up Silverado and come from a very middle, middle class.

680,"This whole situation is my fault. I am a licensed insurance agent. I am working remotely. I usually work in an office, but since the pandemic I have been working at home. My office didn't have a way to have us make calls from home for about a month, so I was using my own cell phone to make calls if needed. That was fine. I let clients know to call my work phone still, it would forward to my cell, and I may call back from a different number than my desk phone. 

My office now uses a soft phone so we can use our cellphones at home, which is great - other than they're not paying my cellphone bill. I had a client ask me to text him my direct number, extension and email. I had talked to him several times before, and I have done this many times with people, plus I was using my phone to call people anyway for about a month until the soft phone was up and running. Clients have never ever contacted my cell phone after I provide the direct number and email via text from my personal number. This man calls me about 6 times a day. I stopped answering unless he calls my direct number for my desk phone. He called it once. All other times he serial calls my cell phone. In my text to him I told him to call my direct number ONLY. He has called me about the same thing each time. ""I don't have my invoice yet. Where is my invoice? I want to pay it. Please send invoice."" I keep telling him an invoice will generate once the billing cycle restarts. It hasn't started yet, I can't force an invoice because there's no balance for you to pay yet. Your policy has renewed, everything is fine. He called the insurance carrier about the invoice, and they've told him the same thing yet he calls me 5 or 6 times every day. 

Without being rude, what is the best way to get him to stop serial calling about nothing? I can't help him, and I am extremely annoyed with him. He doesn't even call during business hours. He calls up until like 7pm.",20Nov2020,1

I found an old CRT in my neighborhood and am a little of an enthusiast and am also getting rid of some other CRTs so need some help.

It's not under but close to under someone's porch. It is crusty as fuck and really dirty, but most likely works. I believe it has been left out for a while.

In my neighborhood, CRTs left out (is this one 'left out'?) are smashed quickly so the copper inside can be taken and sold. This is a really nice one and I would hate to see it smashed (probably be gone within 2 days.)

I asked around and have gotten mixed reactions, some saying it would be stealing and others saying it would not.

For good measure I will include my phone number/email on a note and put it in their mailbox in the case they want it back.

684,"I (19M) have been friends with (16F) for more than 3 years, so we're pretty close since we both share common interests, excel in our studies, see ourselves as pretty mature for our ages, having shared outstanding moments both online and offline. However, she has grown up in a difficult household with her grandparents since her biological parents left her to them. She has had a history of depression and just yesterday she couldn't fulfill her dream of studying medicine like me since she just got out of high school, so I called her, listened to her while she cried, ranted about how her efforts, according to her, were never enough. Fortunately, all she needed was to vent, she started feeling better because I was there for her, giving her advice, or just listening to her in silence; the same way she has been there for me.   


Just this morning she dropped the news of how her father, the biological one that was never there for her and has never supported her as much as her grandparents did, decided to take her phone, laptop, pretty much anything that would communicate her with the outside world, with her friends, myself included, indefinitely. As she told me time and time again yesterday of how despite both of us being afraid of losing one another and other unthinkable stuff, she was going to be fine, that she won't allow anything to happen to her and our relationship, she was going to keep herself healthy, and was going to miss talking to me, as much as I will, I'm still feeling afraid.   


Afraid of letting these feelings of dread, sadness, uncertainty, blind me of what I truly want in the future, which is succeeding in med school to become a doctor, among other projects in my life, but at the same time, still feeling afraid of something happening to her because after all, knowing that she has had a background of depression and suicide ideation.   


I know this might be a ""see you later"" instead of a forever ""goodbye"", but I have no idea of how to try and move on, keeping my hopes up of seeing her return once she goes online again, or anything that has to do with my relationship with her. I know it's stupid of worrying over something like this, unable to shake off the feelings of fear, being unable to find someone that special, caring, and wonderful as her. What should I do?

She thanked me but said she doesn't talk about it a lot because it's very personal (which is okay, I don't think I could have opened up this much to someone I know for barely 3 months). So I don't know if she receives treatment. Or any other details.

Currently composing her a text assuring once again that I'm here for her, and can understand her to some degree (been treated against depression and anxiety myself). I don't want to pressure, just make sure she knows I care. Being lonely in this state is the worst.

Those 3 months I've been harassing repeatedly by my former friends, Casper Braem and Jada Roos leading the group as they have stalked me 2.5 gear prior before the incident and are likely the ones that started it. I've been getting threatened at work, school, social media and even in the safety of my own home. It's been getting so bad that I have been getting severe panic attacks whenever I see them.




The pre-court is coming up and I'm forced to go there as the victim, sadly, my lawyer informed me a few minutes ago that my attacker Mike van Oorschot will be present as well. I want to be there to get justice for what he did to me but the fact that Jada and Casper gave me so many panic attacks makes me not want to go. I know I'll be on the balcony of the court room, safe from him when he's on the prosecutor bench.

694,"As the title says, I'm writing this on behalf of my older sister. We talk frequently on the phone about our lives and sometimes vent about our problems.

Recently over the last few conversations she has expressed concern over her neighbor being just a little too interested in her.

He is an older man who is a former Marine and Vietnam veteran. I mention this specifically because we are Asian and she thinks he has a weird racist fetish. She is a petite girl in her thirties who lives alone. He lives in the same apartment complex in a unit one floor above hers and it overlooks hers across a small courtyard. She has also expressed that she thinks he watches he door with his Ring doorbell.

I guess ever since she moved in and introduced herself to all the neighbors at a BBQ one of the residents was having, this dude has been oddly more and more intrusive.

This is especially unusual since he is an older married man with daughters around her age and there is a global pandemic going on where people need to be social distancing. He often knocks on her door often without a mask on, for inane reasons like ""hey i got some old glass bottles, cause I hear you like to brew beer!"" or just simply to have a conversation. Its gotten to the point where she has to pretend she not home and not answer, but the knocking is very persistent and very long. He also shoots a bit of casual racism her way when referring to Asian people in conversation with her as ""your kind"". She also has told he he has touched he legs when talking to her and despite the fact that she jumped away to indicate with facial expression and body language that was weird, he just kind of brushed that off as nothing.

She has told me multiple times how she feels in a way trapped in her own apartment because he often tries to stop her as soon as she leaves out her front door, and occasionally he will just hijack her with conversation by standing in front of the elevator she is trying to get into to go to the parking level.

Unfortunately he also somehow got her phone number and also blows up her phone with texts.

I am not sure what advice to give here and I cant physically do anything from where I am since i live in a different state.

I was with some friends fishing, and another group of people I knew came to our spot. We sat there, fished, and then the new group lit up a joint. Offered me a hit, there were girls around and tons of students so I didn't wanna cause a scene so I just ripped it. I felt decently intoxicated, but more than functional. I then ate hot cheetos.... and no heartburn or nausea, my lungs felt like they expanded because it's anti-inflamatory. I felt great. Even when it began to wear off, I had zero pain. It felt like I was a little kid again, my friends and I walked (didn't feel safe driving) to a nearby ice cream shop, and I ate ice cream for the first time in 6 months, and unlike 6 months ago, it didn't hurt. This lasted for pretty much the rest of the day. I instantly began researching, and found marijuana can:

Reduce inflammation

&amp;#x200B;

Reduce pain

&amp;#x200B;

Reduce stomach acid production

&amp;#x200B;

Increase appetite (I'm decently underweight)

Reduce stress (my reflux is there when I am not stressed, but gets a lot worse if i am)

&amp;#x200B;

Helps sleep (have trouble sleeping if I'm having an episode)

&amp;#x200B;

Reduces nausea

i (20F) have known my online bestfriend (19F) for nearly 4 years and we talk almost everyday. we are close in a sense that we have many inside jokes and fond memories, and we used to meet up frequently until the pandemic. but there is no depth to our friendship — everything is very surface level. i learned very early on that she has no interest in having deep conversations with me. i almost broke off the friendship in the first year after i entered another severe depressive episode and she offered no emotional support whatsoever. even when i ended up in the psychward again earlier this year she didn't seem to care.

on top of being very emotionally unavailable, she's also extremely immature both mentally and emotionally. she can't take no for an answer, doesn't take anything seriously, throws tantrums when she doesn't get her way, is very spoiled, etc... an example of this would be when last year while i was visiting her in the summer she made her mom pull over in an empty parking lot for 45 minutes because she couldn't decide where she wanted to eat, then proceeded to yell at her mom for always making her choose what we do. it was extremely awkward for me and i didn't know what to do other than sit there silently.

the final nail in the coffin of this friendship for me, though, came at the end of last year when we both decided we should look for a 2nd job since being paid minimum wage was not sustainable. very quickly she was able to get another job that paid more and was willing to work around her other job schedule — and she had less than a year of work experience.

unfortunately for me, i live in a very rural state in a small town with limited job opportunities. i applied to almost everything i saw on indeed, and did multiple interviews, but got nothing. i had 3+ years of work experience and had held the same job since i was 16, so i quickly became frustrated. and my friend didn't offer a single encouraging word.

instead, she started to make fun of me. frequently called me a mcdonald's worker (because that's where failures work at according to her), told me to have fun mopping bathrooms and flipping burgers. said very classist things in regards to being a frycook — despite the fact that i literally already am i frycook at my job.

to put it in comparison, when our mutual friend quit 3 jobs in the span of 2 months and got fired for misconduct at her last, my friend was nothing but supportive. she even gave the place our friend got fired at a bad yelp review claiming the workers there were racist. she told our friend, ""don't let that stupid place get you down you're too good for them."" meanwhile i, a responsible, well liked individual at the job i've held for 4 years isn't good enough for anything.

to make things even worse, those two have belittled me and bullied me over the dumbest shit; tried to get me to spend literal thousands of dollars to be a tagalong on their trips to korea; equate me and my family members to being ""dumb hicks"" because of where we live; are extremely immature and have both wracked up thousands of dollars of debt on credit cards, etc. it's just stupid, and i'm sick of it.

so how can i cut her off? i can't just talk to her because she refuses to participate in a conversation that's the teeniest bit personal or emotional, but i don't want to completely ghost her. i'm just emotionally drained and tired of dealing with a teenage toddler.

707,"So I made a good friendship with a co-worker in another clinic (We work in the medical field) She originally always talked about moving to the Carolinas or Florida with our job. We both started this same job at the beginning of the year. Because of my abusive ex, court dates, lawyer, and financial abuse, I was thrown back 20k with my psycho ex boyfriend. My coworker friend, meanwhile, is in a happy marriage and so has dual income.

Aka, it's taking me much longer to save than her. We shared our dream locations and I told her about living and loving the desert life of Arizona and dry heat and that is truly be happy in Vegas where so many of my closest friends and some family are. Over the year she went from die hard Florida to thinking about Arizona and we talked about the growing city of Phoenix and opputunities. I didn't think much of it at first, if anything I was excited of the idea of another friend out west.

This week she called me, stating she is not going to renew her lease and talked to our boss about positions in Arizona (I told my boss upon hire I had a two year plan to move out there) and my boss apparently said they're going to try to get them a regional position that I had my eyes on. I honestly feel kind of betrayed. She didn't even want to move out west until I mentioned it, and I kind of wish I never even mentioned the west coast to her. I would prefer to stay in the same company but now I wouldn't be able to move up with my move out west because my friend is taking it. And I've been trying so hard to pay off the debt of my ex boyfriend to keep my credit up to buy a house out there. Am I bring too jealous? I feel like she used our friendship for help at work and now for the idea of the great position out west. I feel stuck now as I even doubt if she was regional that she'd help or vouch for me when I wanna move. I don't know how to bring it up to her or if I should suck it up and just be happy for her.

Tl;Dr - My friend is taking my dream high pay position out west only after I mentioned it to her, when she originally was going to move to Florida. Is she being an ass or am I being dramatic and jealous?",20Nov2020,1

While I do get much better grades online it makes me never leave the house. I have friends but I don't really care for them that much if that makes sense. I used to hang out with them more but lately i've been avoiding them because im just tired of them. I want real connections with people I actually care about. Its really hard because now all I do is just stay at home 24/7. I do get out and go to work and I socialize there ( I have no problem socializing or making friends) but after that I go home and I do nothing. I've gained a lot of weight so i have been working out and trying to fix my diet but none of this is satisfying my sadness. Right before my 17th birthday I was super super sad because I felt lonely and nobody I really wanted to go party with on my bday. Most people just say go and try out a sport do something but the problem with that is I need the money from my job and balancing school, work, and sports would be tough for me. Maybe I should do it not sure. I just have no purpose in my life... I wake up do my classes then I do my homework then go to work if I have it that day and then I go to sleep.

713,"Okay so this is a complicated (maybe not?) situation. I met this friend first year of uni (i’m in my last year now) and we created our little uni friend group. At first we were super close and spent sm time together. A couple months into knowing her we all realized that she has rlly bad mental health issues (depression and anxiety) and a bad home life (mentally abusive parents). This was never a problem as some of us have other friends with depression or have experienced mild depression ourselves. What became an issue is her toxicity and fakeness. She’s a very bad communicator and would be passive aggressive about everything instead of talking about what was bothering her which lead to many problems. She complains about everything but never tries fixing the problem instead. She is very selfish and will only do something if there’s something in it for her. We stayed friends with her despite all the red flags bc when things were good, we had fun and we thought we could help her grow. Another year goes by filled with conflict and toxicity. She had grown a bit but looking back it just seems like she got better at hiding it from us. Everything feels transactional with her, she would throw things in our face like “I did this for you..... why can’t you do that for me?” She needed everything to work out in her favour and if it didn’t she’d throw a fit. Nothing ever felt genuine. Then we moved in with her (what were we thinking?!) and nothing changed, the energy in the apartment was so bad and toxic. 

She doesn’t have any other friends, we have been therapists, friends and family to her. We’ve been the only constant in her life other than her toxic family. But after she moved out this year I’ve tried reaching out to check up on her and she either doesn’t reply or is she’s very dry. She’s ignored all the messages in our group chat and only contributes when she has something to say about herself so we stopped texting in that chat. She claims she’s busy but we’re all in school and going to work... nobody is too busy to answer a friend that’s checking up on you. The energy in our home since she’s been gone is immaculate, we’re so happy to be home and never feel uncomfortable like we did while she was here. Even other friends who don’t live with us have noticed the change. We’ve also realized that we don’t really have much in common with her. 

She ignored my most recent text asking her how she was and I received a call from a job she’s applied for, I was one of her references and she hadn’t asked me if that was okay. I texting her to let her know I got a call and she responded immediately... looks like she’s just using me and others for what she needs. 

I’ve come to the conclusion that the only reason I’m trying is because I know she has depression and not many people around her to provide support. But otherwise I wouldn’t continue to be her friend. The energy she brings into my life is not positive and while I’m trying to grow and be my best self, she doesn’t elevate me like my other friends do. We’re all so supportive of each other and positive. I know that they’re all genuine people who don’t have an ulterior motive to our relationship like she does. I feel bad bc I know she is the way she is due to her family life, but do I continue to put my needs aside to be there for her when she is this toxic? I know other people with depression who do not make me feel the way that she does, but I’m still struggling to let go bc if anything were to happen to her I would feel guilt. Like I should have done more? Even tho I know I can’t force myself to be there for her when she’s acting like she doesn’t want me to be.

Do I drop her or should I stick around?",20Nov2020,1
714,"Hey Reddit, maybe I’m about to sound like I’m rambling but this is just how I feel. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and an anxiety disorder and I know I get it from my parents a lot too. The last two months ish I have hit “rock bottom” almost a month ago I attempted suicide which I am very ashamed of. I spent a little time in the hospital and I think that actually helped a lot and was an eye opener for me. However something still feel so wrong inside me. A part of me wants to just leave life here behind and move and start over. But I’m in college here and my family is here my (ex) boyfriend broke up with me a month ago too. He really screwed me up if I’m being honest. I really believed he was gonna be the one I was gonna marry as we talked about it so many times. I like to think I was good to him and I know for a fact I truly tried my hardest for him. I loved him unconditionally. Anyways it’s not just him. I know I shouldn’t feel like this, I have a good job, I have 2 close friends, I’m in college, I have a family who sometimes makes me feel worthless but overall they love me. Yet I can’t help but feel lost, i feel so trapped. It’s like one moment I’ll be okay then it’s like a wave of bad feelings come over me and it makes me sick. There’s no more excitement and happiness inside me. There’s just this urge inside to just leave Arizona and forget all the pain I’m feeling, have my own life but again I’m trapped. I honestly just wanna cry, I wanna be alone but yet I really don’t. I’m trying so hard to fight this but the feeling inside isn’t going away. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I feel so worthless like I’m just an object and like I have no purpose and life in general has no purpose. It’s so hard to have to have your parents watch you take all 4 medications you’re on to make sure you actually take them and to make sure you don’t attempt again. I feel miserable and trapped.

715,"For context, it got pretty heated a few weeks ago between me and my dad because our dog, who we didn't fixed, had puppies and my dad was boasting about how he was going to kill them. Now, some of what he said was pretty sadistic but I can tell he was trying to get a reaction. However, it's was quite clear he was willing to kill them, maybe not as immorally as he said, but he would do it. So I've had to put them outside of the house and I made a little home for them. I've been taking care of them by myself but I am in my senior year and I plan to go to college or ,if I get rejected from my dream colleges, join the marines. Basically, I can't take care of these puppies for more than a year. I've contacted the animal shelter but I personally can't afford to pay the surrender fee since I'm paying for college apps... so I feel kind of trapped between a rock and a hard place.

716,"Definitions in mind:

Manipulation = to work skillfully with information, systems etc. to achieve the result that you want.

Influence = causing something without any direct or apparent effort

Mind game = deliberate actions of calculated psychological manipulation intended to intimidate or confused (for competitive advantage)

Predatory behavior: acting with or indicative of rapacious, greedy, or selfish motives.

Lets say you’d like to hook-up with someone, but you don’t know if they’re interested or not. Neither of you have expressed prior sexual interest. Can it be considered “mind games” , predatory behavior or manipulation if you ask semi/sexual questions / make subtle suggestions (such as to stay put at the person discretion) to increase sexual tension between the two of you (as long as they are not unwanted advances). The suggestion to stay is because the individual has stated they have an event in a bit. The intent is to later directly ask for sex. One has a goal in mind, is doing things to potentially increase sexual chances but isn’t revoking free-choice making. If it does fall under and aforementioned category how harmful is such? Doe it revoke the possibility of the person giving consent due to the fact the didn’t know what was happening (hypothetical) until the “would you wanna have sex?” Question is asked. Or does it only become manipulation if what transpires is successful?",20Nov2020,1
717,"For context, I (f15), live in a very homophobic area. There are a few non homophobic people, including my best friend (m16). I’ve been planning on coming out to him for months now. We knew each other before, but we weren’t close up until about a year ago. He was also not doing well mentally, but he said he only pulled through because of his other friend and me (important for later). Let’s call my friend E for the story.

The thing is, I didn’t really have a problem with coming out to E up until this whole mess started. 

E told me a few weeks ago that he used to have a crush on me and that’s why he started talking to me more. I was surprised by this, but I didn’t really pay much attention to it because it all was in the past, right? 

Turns out I was wrong, E just told me he figured out he still has a crush on me, and he asked me to be his girlfriend. I was surprised by this, and I rejected him, mainly because he asked me to reject him if he ever tried anything with me. E understood, because he remembered he made me promise I would reject him. 

This makes me feel uncomfortable, and it made me realize; what if E stops wanting to be friends with me once he knows that he most likely doesn’t have a chance of getting with me? I’m still not sure if I even like guys or not, so idk what I’m supposed to tell him. 

On one hand, if I tell E, he could just accept that I don’t really like guys and move on.

On the other hand, he could feel really bad and go back to having bad mental health.

And if I don’t tell E and he eventually finds out, I could have accidentally led him on somehow.

718,"This is a throwaway account. Cutting down on minor details and reasoning to keep the content short.
I (25F) was in a serious relationship for 4 years with my boyfriend (25M). We were best friends in school and many years later we confessed our feelings for each other. 
Everything was going well but the issue was our age. Please note we are Indians and marriage is considered a serious matter here. I am a working professional and he is studying to become a doctor.
We discussed the issue of time since his parents were strict on getting him married at a later age ,because of his profession, before we got into a relationship since my parents were already looking for a groom. We decided we needed roughly 4 years and I promised to get him those 4 years. Keeping my end of the bargain, 4 years later we decided it was time for the talk to our parents.
My family was in complete support of my relationship but it was not the case of my boyfriend.
His parents were fixed on the idea to get him married at 28 because. Their reasons - his brother's marriage life is not going well because he was married young - he is studying to become a doctor and he has no income right now. And another reason that I believe to be true but was not stated openly is that I am not as rich as they are.
His father is a businessman. Started the company a few years ago.
There were a lot of issues all four years and I fought off everyone to buy time and even went as far as talking to his family.
In the end my family agreed to talk to his parents and they refused to accept our elationship saying my boyfriend will not do anything without their approval and they do not approve.
He loves his parents dearly and does not want to hurt them in anyway. I feel his parents used that and had no concern for his feelings.
When I asked my boyfriend what happened he said his parents asked him if he will marry the girl even if they do not approve and if my parents say that all anger will be no more after the marriage is over. He told them he will not leave them but he still loves me.
His mom and dad are the only ones who did not approve of the marriage and my boyfriend wasn't as optimistic as I was. He was always saying we will not be together everytime we faced a problem.
Is there something else that I could have done? Is it my fault we did not end up together? Should I have approached this differently?",20Nov2020,1

It has been an eventful relationship. About 1.5 years in it started a downward spiral he quit he’s job Amist insomnia caused by a police and court problem. (At this time he was violent with me once)(this didn’t happen until a few years later). Then after dead end jobs he had A cocaine and gambling addiction and stole from me. I sat through it. Countless arguments and ruined weekends away as he couldn’t sleep at night. He would stay awake all night and sleep most of the day. I pushed my support and provided help, the doctor prescribed but he refused to take. Instead he chose to work unsociable hours which did not help. This carried on for years. In the meantime with my own health problems he refused to visit me I always had to go to him. I reached a limit of how much I could stand, but things improved with a job and we persevered. He slept much better. We went away for A break and he became very violent and I was so hurt by this as i had shown so much patience and he hadn’t shown this side for so long. I don’t know how I managed but we carried on. Then covid happened and he slipped back into old routines while I continued working. Uncontactable until 5pm, elaborate excuses to meet because of he’s sleeping problem. So I said enough is enough. Gave him one final chance with rules. 3 days later he disappears and I find him fast asleep at 6pm (he had been asleep the whole day). 

We split up 5months ago and I have a whole lot of questions about my self esteem and Self worth. But still find myself holding back. 
He is relentless in trying to get me back. He does really love me. He has sent hundreds of pounds and gifts and flowers. (I am not into monetary things). He says he has changed everything. He won’t leave me alone. I worry now he says he’s fixed everything I’m chucking away something good. 

I don’t think I should go back but sometimes just need to say it outloud. Being responsible for  ending the relationship and causing pain. He is very dependent on our relationship as doesn’t  have good relationships with anyone else. I don’t have anyone to discuss this with.

I loved it, so 2 days ago I told my mom that I wanted to do it again, although this time with different outfits. She got angry and yelled at me, calling me homophobic slurs (I am straight). I want to dress up again badly but my mom has now began ignoring me. What to do?

736,"In my neighborhood there is a house that is very cluttered and no one knows anything about the guy who lives there. Outside in his lawn are TONS of cats, most of them kittens. We think that most of them are incest babies. Either way, they are definitely being neglected. They are all very skinny and only have a dirty bowl of water and a small cat dish of food to share amongst all of them ( I would wager that there are about a dozen or so) I have watched the house for a few days and it seems like the guy who lives there only gives them new food every week and water almost never. I would think that they knew how to hunt except that their parents are almost never there and I haven’t seen them leave the front/ back yard. They have almost no shelter, except for the quite open and unprotected front porch, which is dilapidated. Winter is coming and it’s getting colder and colder outside. I’m fairly certain that the liter of kittens was born in the summer, making this their first winter. I know for a fact that one of them has a bad eye, and another had a limp. I haven’t been able to get close enough to see if they have any other issues. I’m really concerned about their safety and would like to help them. 

Both my sister and I have experience with animals. We have adopted two lovely cats, as well as two dogs. One of which was abused so we have a little experience with trust issues in animals. Also my sister runs a stable and calls me out to help with wild animals and or stray cats/dogs. However we have never dealt with animals in a professional sense.

Small things come up, I get into arguments that I think I have a reason to argue over then realizing right after that I was being too extreme.

(Sorry about any bad grammar, i'm not the best with it) Me and my sister are very close &amp; many times she comes to me for advice. My parents are amazing, they love us with all their hearts, no drug or alcohol consumption **at all.** However they are slightly traditional in their viewpoints. One parent has a school education of 3rd grade and the other of 6th grade. They've done amazing by us, so please don't hate on them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**This happened today, 30 minutes ago.**

&amp;#x200B;

I was playing videogames around 12:30PM today. My sister frequently goes to lunch with her friend(18F) during the lunchbreaks of the online classes during the Corona Virus. They go through a drive-thru and come back. Usually doesn't take long. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today while I'm playing a game and not *too* focused on what she was saying, she tells me she's going to grab lunch and that's there some stuff in the fridge I could eat. I wasn't paying too much attention to her but thought it would just like most days. 

&amp;#x200B;

At around 2:30PM, my father walks into my room (which is unusual since he is normally home around 5PM) and tells me if I knew that my sister went out. I said yes, she mentioned she would be grabbing lunch, she's probably holed up in her room now. He turns my attention away from my videogame and tells me I was wrong. My father was parked outside the house cleaning the inside of his car, when all of a sudden a car pulls up, she jumps out and the driver was a 32M from the choir group she attends at church. My dad, being a religious man &amp; active in his church, recognized the driver immediately. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my sister how she knew him; From the choir group.   
I asked how they have been talking; On a messaging app. 

I asked if they were talking a group chat; No. Private messages. 

&amp;#x200B;

I then broke down the situation for her, explaining why it was so incredibly bad and stupid, and how fucking weird it is that this guy is talking to her. She explains to me that he is a nice guy, and that he's bought her things and offered to buy her lunch ""that's just the way he is"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always helped my sister out a little bit to get her out of the house, I know my parents are very strict on her because she is a girl and limit how much she can hang out even with her girl-friends. I frequently had to argue for her to let her go to the movies with her friends just once a month, or to hang out at one of her girl-friends house more than once in a blue moon. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as though my sister taken advantage of me. She knows I don't let my parents know when she goes out to get lunch with her girl-friend despite it being my sisters only respite out of the house besides church choir. (she wants to go into music in college &amp; has been offered a early small scholarship, which is why they allow her to attend the church choir.)  

&amp;#x200B;

I tried my absolute best to explain to her that someone twice her age offering her food and clothes under the reasoning ""its just the way he is"" **is not normal. It's WEIRD.** I tried to draw a comparison about how her friends always try to get to know me, but I avoid contact and am slightly mean due to the fact I'm 22 and they're 16-18. I tried explaining to her that my trust and help feels damaged now &amp; that I feel betrayed. I explained the fact dad caught her not only coming home when she wasn't supposed to be out and with that man, means they probably wont let her go out for a while &amp;  that I can't help her with that anymore and I feel like I'm not even supposed to now because I don't know when I've been lied to either now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I explained to her that if anything happened; murder, rape, car crash or kidnapping. We wouldn't know &amp; that in those worst case scenarios, it would likely be days before we find her. There would be no group chat trail, he likely wouldn't even be a suspect because no one knew she was talking to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to feel &amp; I don't know if what I told her was correct. But is there something more I can do? Should I go through her phone? Should I be one of the vigilant restrictive people in her lives now just like mom &amp; dad? I hate the idea of her not being allowed to do anything anymore considering how restrictive they already are, but I hate the idea of anything happening to her more. She always comes to me for advice and my parents often come to me or my older brother for advice as well.

754,"Hi! I made this account to post this. This needs some backstory : before high school,i was the quiet,bullied kid. I hated going to school and hated everybody. People used to throw pencils at me,beat me up,and every single day,i was made fun of. Either it was something about how i talked,walked,dressed,etc. It was horible,i had suicidal thoughts alot. At one point,in the final year,i atemped suicide. I didn't go to school until my mom lied about child protection taking my little bro away,because of i don't go to school.So i got back to school. Some people were pretending to be nice to me. Some were the same. One day, a group of boys,were having a rap battle( i know,sounds cringe) they called me,to laugh at me,but to their surprise,i was good at freestyle-ing(i liked rap too). Since then,noone said anything bad about me anymore. I was at the top of the world. Noone could beat me. I once said to one of my worst bully,that i will be famous.

And now here i am. I tried everything to become famous and it did happened. And it sucked. I  started to post edgy jokes videos,and people clicked on them. The problem was,i became a joke. Noone took me serious. It seemed like everyone needed to tell me how bad i was. It go to the point were i couldn't go outside. The first time in 4 years of high school,i felt bullied again. Some people found my adress,and put it in the comments. Thats where i gave up.
My comment section consisted of : self promoting 14yr olds,people telling me i sucked,people telling me im good at it,and people posting random links/people telling me to be friends with them/partners?

Anyway,At 19, i could say that i did not,made it in hip-hop. Im still poor. Im actually worse than before. I cant sleep because of the bed bugs. Im balding because of my seborrheic dermatitis,im still depressed.

When i go back to my old neighborhood,i see the people that bullied me. Some still throw rocks at me when they see me(literally)
Or just laugh at me for no reason,or wink.
Some have girlfriends too.
Now,i know its immoral,but i wish they were worse than i am. Or atleast not better.
There is no karma. 
I know i shouldn't care,but i can't help it. I promised myself i will be better than them,and while i became a better person over the years,They are the same,and have things that i don't have,and still consider me a joke.

So I am a senior at FSU. I am expected to graduate spring of 2021. I am finishing my real estate degree this semester. I am failing my first class ever which is an accounting class. Now since I failed I am being held back to graduate. I have 3 finance classes, 1 SIP class ,1 accounting class, and the 1 accounting class retake left. I will be taking next semester my 3 finance classes and 1 accounting class. Over summer I would take the retake of accounting and the SIP class. 

I was stubborn and I wanted to have something else on my diploma other than just real estate because I thought that would be lame. I don’t know what I want to do after I graduate I was always interested in real estate, flipping houses, and dealing with investment properties. So, not knowing exactly what I want to do I wanted to do finance to possibly not be locked down in real estate if I don’t like it and broaden my career path. I do not know if I should go through taking this finance major if I’m not going to graduate on time and also it bring down my GPA even more. I’m at a 3.1 GPA something right now even before this F and having to take another accounting will drop it lower more likely.

772,"So this has been weighing very heavy on my shoulders lately. I feel like screaming about this on the street to any rando I see, but since I don’t want to be that bitch I figured I’d do it here instead /) I would love thoughts/reactions/ feedback on this!

This has happened over YEARS so not very event is in chronological order. Sorry about how scattered the story is. 

Also for the purpose of not making this even more lengthy than it already is, I have not mentioned every event.. so again keep in mind this story takes place over years and years and i have not mentioned every single thing that has happened.

My cousin, who we’ll call S and I were always close growing up. We are both only children w single mothers so it’s a big sis/lil sis dynamic between us. She has always been very spoiled by her mom. Always bragging about their travels and her grades, how popular she is at school, material objects etc.

Anyways, 
My cousin is in college so I make it a point to visit her and take her shopping for clothes/ groceries and treat her as much as I can. It’s important to me as I want to be the kind of ‘big sister’ I would’ve loved to have.  I have always been this way with her since she was little. I’m older than her by four years.  I’m 23 and she’s 19.
On this day I go pick her up from school for break when she showed me a picture of her at a party, In the photo she’s wearing a sweater of mine I had only just noticed was missing. I tell her to ask the next time if she wants to borrow anything.Later that week we go out for lunch, I have my dog with me so I sit outside, give her my card to order for me. The next morning I have to wake up early for work. I borrow her windbreaker while she is sleeping and see that in her bag is my T-shirt I had just shown her the day before and my makeup. I know exactly what I have in my closet and in my room so Im not mistaking anything. I put the stuff back in my drawers and move on. Once the week is through and she goes back to school I check over my bank statements and see that where we went to for lunch before billed me an unusually high amount. She had used my card to pay for both of our meals. I text her and ask her about it she is confused and says she wonders how it happened, that she paid with her card but they must’ve used mine by accident. I call bullshit on this one but just keep quiet and say ok just pay me back, which she does. 
Another time I come home from work to see her wearing a jacket of mine. No big deal but later I find a Starbucks gift card in the pocket. I ask her about it since it’s not mine, and she says she found it lying around. I put it in a drawer and forget about it. One night I lose my dab pen and we start looking for it, because of her history I check her bag for it and while I don’t find my pen i  find a wallet of mine that I had noticed was missing a few days before and my perfume bottle. When I ask her what they are doing there she tells me that I had left them at her apartment. I know it’s not true, but can’t help but doubt myself. Maybe I did leave it there? Another time ,she has a student senate meeting so my mom lends her some clothes and shoes. Later on my mom notices other things are gone from her closet, specifically apair of hoop earrings. When she sees my cousin WEARING them the next time we see her and asks why/ how she has them, my cousin tells her she let her borrow them and forgot. My mom wouldn’t have done that, with them being her favorite pair. I get smart and make a list so whenever I notice an item missing I can write it down and keep track. I notice more makeup is missing so I write that down. Two blushes and eyeshadows. The next time she stays over we are getting ready to go out andright in front of me I see her using one of the eyeshadows and blushes Im missing. Later on I go into her makeup bag and find All. Four. Things that I’m missing. I finally decide to say something and when she comes back to the room tell her that I found them in her bag and ask her how my things got in there. She apologizes and looks nervous as I tell her she needs to start making sure that she doesn’t leave with anything of mine anymore because it’s been happening way too often. Her body language is very telling, she’s slouched over and her hands up to her chest as if she’s protecting herself. She apologizes again and says that she doesn’t want me to think that she’s doing it on purpose. I laugh at that and tell her again, it’s happening a little too often. Conveniently, that night her mom comes to pick her up bc they have something to do the next day. I think she just wanted to gtfo. I stop texting/talking to her bc i want to see what her next move is.
I’ve heard nothing for 5 months.
About a week after the last time I see her my mom tells me about how she went to grab a coffee that morning but couldn’t find her gift card. Alarm bells go off in my head and i go to grab the gift card I had found in my jacket pocket and go to show it to her. Surprise! It’s my moms, meaning my cousin had basically been shopping in our house behind our backs. Going through our rooms and wallets. Later on my mom is talking to a mutual friend of my her and my aunt when he brings up that he suspects my cousin is a thief. She had gone down with my grandma to stay at his place for a few weeks and went out almost every day with a friend, coming back with shopping bags almost every day. A few days later my grandma goes to him and says she had withdrawn 600$ from the bank but only had 300 in her wallet. Upon hearing this my mom realized that my cousin has been doing this to almost the whole family. She had noticed that there would be cash missing from her wallet but always thought that I was the one taking it. ME. I am so angry about all this it makes me sick sometimes. Thinking that my family suspected me of doing these things while she was always presented as the good girl.

Anyways, I’m not really sure why I’m posting this to be honest. I just can’t believe that this really happened I guess and just want someone to react as angrily as I am. My grandma tells me that it’s no reason to cut off family, but I think it’s an obvious thing to do. I have no plans to speak with her again. And once I see her it’s on. fucking. sight. For my own sanity I want to see her one last time so I can tell her off and have some closure.

775,"I will try to keep it brief, but basically my fiance's(20M) mom doesn't approve of me(19F). She hasn't personally said it to me, but her attitude towards me says it all. 

We have been together for over a year now, been engaged since spring but we were friends for a year prior to us getting together. We are both Christians and plan on getting married sometime next year or a little bit later, we will see what Covid does. Anyways basically I have no idea what to do. I live by myself and work part time. He still lives with his parents till he finishes up college in the summer next year while also working part time.  His parents are very conservative christians so they have very traditional family routines and structure, where both my parents were split up while I was growing up. 

His mom has shown her disliking of certain things I decide to do (like calling out of work which doesn't even affect her) or voicing that we are getting married too soon. There was a time I was unemployed for about 5 months and that made his parents super concerned for our future for some reason. We differ a lot on politics, and interpret the Bible differently or what God says about sin (I dont think being Gay is a sin nor is it wrong) 

I just want to know if I should just give up trying to be overly nice and not attempt a better relationship, confront her about this issue and make it clear that im not going anywhere, or just continue what I'm doing (which is playing along) till me and my fiance get married. I feel like these facts will help too:
1. My Fiance is the youngest of 4.
2. His mom got married to his dad right after she graduated high school, she just turned 18.
3. His parents are workaholics, his mom works from home. 
4. I became a Christian in 2017.

Any advice...ANY would be appreciated.",20Nov2020,1
776,I am a 15 years old. My ex just texted me and said she was pregnant. I pulled out every time. The last time we did it 9 days ago I pulled out and she sucked my dick for probably 5 minutes. We went for round 2 and I pulled out and quit. My cum never even touched her at all. We was 14 when this happened it was actually on my birthday. Is it possible she is even actually pregnant.

777,"

I am so fucking angry so forgive me if my post is messed.  Yesterday everything was perfect and we had talk about diferent things and the moment was perfect and I even told him some if my insecurities about my appearance  and he told me I am beautiful queen and I am gorgeous when it comes to aesthetic and my heart (bullshit I was happy to read ofc) and well today we had argument over something not very important that I had to do but I didn't fully due to another person's fault and rather than listening to me and be happy I agreed to help him. On top of this he gave me the silent treatment and said this shit : I'm tired. Thanks for ruining my day
You stressed the life out of me today. and obviously he gives me the silent treatment even tho it's all his fault but whatever. 
I got angry about this but that's not the point that made me fume! Recently it was his birthday and he went to LA for party and dear God. I found photo of him on boat and what is interesting there is 2 men that are his friends and what I could count 12 ladies around him and 2 of them were so close to him almost on his lap. He put his hand on one of the  girls shoulder. I immediately took my phone and told him all kind of things. Don't misunderstand me it's okay to have party, it's okay to have girls that are your friends but I think he crossed the line big time. And the fact that there were 3 men and 12 girls gives me red flag honestly.  
in my head now all his wedding plans sound fake and rubbish honestly. Am I overreacting?
I acted like tornado today. Btw I have therapist and told her too and even showed her the picture",20Nov2020,1

I didnt see any water after he walked on it (i think), so I let him go back up stairs, which is all carpet. I felt fhe carpet, and t didn't see wet to me, but I decided  to quickly vacu stairs on which he walked, and the carpet around my moms bet, on which he spends most his time.

784,"Context: Lease ended last month and I moved back in with my parents while still working from home. I'm definitely saving a lot of money but to some degree, I believe I'm kind of stunting my independence by staying with my parents. For example, I noticed that I will regress back to a personality I've had as a kid growing up there. I'd take back on the same habits I've had from K-12 because it's an incredibly comfortable environment I'm living in. I've also been in the process of trying to pivot careers by building up the skills needed for it and the distraction being here is affecting my progress.

I've been explaining this to my friends but I have two groups of friends. One group is a lot of successful and intelligent people and think I should do it and that it will be healthy in the long run because they've done similar things or are doing it as well. The other group that I'm closer to (bond and proximity wise) are insistent that I'll just be wasting a lot of money when I can just save that at home. I know moving out alone isn't indicative of ""success"" or whatever but I'm leaning more on their side just because it makes sense but goes against my upbringing and environment of always being frugal.

786,"I(m) was very close to a friend(f) over a year ago almost everything was connected constant texting etc. She started avoiding me but it was odd. I'd message and somehow shed find ways to not talk or  basically jump down my throat when I did. So I'd stop talking. Only to have her later start talking again. When I say later it would be later in that same day. We used to talk about everything. She started talking about wanting to find someone she could vent to even though she already would vent to me. A guy came along that she was very into and it was obvious which I didnt care cause were just friends. But when he came along it seemed like anytime I would message her shed get angry at me like I interrupted her.

Again I'd just stop talking and leave her be just to have her message later all sweetly. After two weeks I jumped her for the fact that she always jumps me when I message. Only I said it like this. ""Don't jump me just cause you're talking to some guy"". Which was true she was irritated that anyone bothers her when he was around. From that day forward became an avoidance thing but not just her. Her roommate. The guy and other friends of ours. I completely lost the social group. This wasnt even me saying that infront of anyone else either.

About a month or two of her doing the avoidance but also reaching out I got tired of the back and forth talk dont talk situation so i just straight up asked why she was avoiding me. Her reply was that she wasnt avoiding me she was avoiding everyone because people wanted to much from her and she was going through stuff and she even exclaimed that our friendship was to codependent. I mean we hung out all the time sure. But most of that was us wanting to hangout together. Now nothing. But she was saying she didnt wanna stop communicating with me. We started talking normally again only it was in text messages.

Before all this there were calls and hangouts. At this point it was just texting. Eventually there was some hanging out to which when we did she was constantly messaging someone else or supposedly working on something. Verbally she was avoiding me which was the opposite of the recent texts.

I mean I get it it's easier to manage a conversation over texting but in person you csnt really change what you say or how you react. She kept making it out to be that she wasnt talking to anybody or anything but heres the thing I didnt care if she was and I didnt even ask. It was as if she still sees this guy and because of me standing up for myself she feels the need to hide it so shed preemptively would act like theres nobody else I never cared. But now stages this whole play to make it seem like he doesnt exist so the friendship comes of as a blacked out CIA file. Being called then put on hold for 45 mins etc

The friendship as it stands atm we havent really talked in months. Was it wrong for me to stand up for myself and call out that she was doing it because of the guy. I even tried getting to know the guy. Was there something I could have done different. It's just all so jarring and confusing I really feel like Charlie brown coming to kick the ball as Lucie holds it.

Thoughts on this situation??",20Nov2020,1
793,"So the title gives the gist of the problem. 

3.5 months ago I moved into a beautiful old home that my husband and I bought. It’s a triplex and we will be having our first real tenants coming up soon.

Since we moved in I haven’t been able to enjoy a single day in my house due to my neighbor’s dogs incessant barking. They bark at other dogs, cars, howl at ambulances (we’re 5 minutes away from at least 4 different hospitals), bang loudly on their metal fence and whine at the top of their lungs.

In our old house everything has been preserved. The doors, the baseboards, the floors, everything. So it comes as no surprise that we have old windows that don’t do anything to protect against sound. The dogs’ owner is a contractor and his home is also old so he can see our windows suck.

His “dog run,” we found out, is about a foot onto our property, up against our house. My husband and I are NOT petty people who have cared about this at all but this means his dogs are 1 inch outside my windows barking like this. He has a bigger back yard that is off limits to the dogs so they’re always two or three feet away from our home. 

I have to blast my TV to 60 or 70 just to hear my shows. I can’t go sit and read on my porch. If I want any quite I have to lock myself in my bedroom. I also have virtual Drs appointments often.

He leaves the house for hours with the dogs outside so it infuriates me we have to deal with the barking and he doesn’t. On top of that I’ve seen him multiple times egging one of the dogs on when he is screech-whining. The guy just stands there and laughs.

I have such bad anxiety and depression that these dogs are actually having an adverse affect on my mental health. I’ve cried so many times over the barking.

These mental health problems also make it extremely difficult for me to approach the neighbors about this. I’m fairly certain the owner KNOWS I hate the barking already. He loudly stated “AWWW YOUR JUST BARKING AT THAT OTHER DOG BARKING” when I was sitting outside once. So I also don’t want to come off like a b word on top of my anxiety.

My husband would rather die than have any conflict with anyone and with my mental health problems making it hard for me to talk to them I can’t blame him. If I won’t do it how could I make him??

So my question boils down to what do I do? Is toughening up and speaking directly to him the only way? Is a note too cowardly or just inappropriate? Do I bake cookies that tell him and his dogs to F off? (Jk!!) 

any advice is appreciated!!",20Nov2020,1

797,"It has mentally become so hard for me to write this because I already know that it's probably not going to help me at all, but I have nothing to lose... so here I am again, trying this one more time... trying hard to find hope or some help.

I'm a 26 years old guy in Iran, completely out of hope and have no power to change anything around me. I'm 100% financially dependent on my parents because there's no job that would pay enough to even achieve the minimums of living expenses. There's no human rights or authorities that would give a damn about you and your quality of life. Last year they killed thousands of people who were protesting and injured many others, some of them got bullets in their spinal cord and got permanently paralyzed while the government shut down the whole internet for a week.

There's no future or hopes for me here in this country... I must get out as soon as possible or become rich here to actually start living life, but no matter what I choose, I am surrounded by dead-ends and huge walls. You can't imagine how many restrictions we have here that are only found next in North Korea. We can't financially be connected to the world. There's only cryptocurrencies for that and most of the time it doesn't help because it's not accepted. So even Kickstarter would be useless for me here as there's no PayPal, Master/Visa Cards or anything. Everything you can imagine is sanctioned and it has been like that even in the times of US President Obama.

Sometime ago I was looking to go to Germany to study there as it's one of the countries that offer affordable education to foreigners, but sadly it's not possible anymore because the embassy rarely issues student visas due to political reasons and also the rate of currency exchange has become so expensive that I won't afford even the costs of living there without paying anything for a university.

So I really don't know what to do anymore... I feel lost and abandoned in a desert. 😰",20Nov2020,1
798,"I live in British Columbia, Canada. Yesterday, the province announced that our lockdown would be extended into December. 
Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are rising higher than ever. 
This massive rise in cases has left no choice but to also make masks mandatory in all indoor public places for the first time.
My younger sister dealt with her first break up right before the first lockdown in March. They were together for nearly 5 years until she found out that he was a cheater.
Recently, she begun dating a man that she previously knew from years ago. 
They have been together since October. 
I am worried for her because she and my parents, who she lives with, do not seem to take this as seriously as my significant other and I do. 
My mother has been in remission from breast cancer for a year now, while my father does not have optimal health for his age - they are both considered high risk. 
My sister continues to hang out with this man and his family (his mother is also high risk), though we are told to only come into contact with our immediate family. 

So far, I haven’t said anything to her. 
But if you look up the graphs of cases in our province from the beginning of the pandemic to now, you will see the huge rise in numbers and the reason I am seeking your advice.
I don’t know if or how to explain to her that she is taking an unnecessary risk, while trying to help her understand that I am doing such because I care for her and our family. And not to be a nuisance.
She often does not listen to me, even if she is asking for my advice. 
She shows little to no respect when I speak of important matters such as this pandemic. Usually she kind of shuts down, becomes snarky and/or acts completely annoyed. 

Am I out of line?",20Nov2020,1

802,"A little background first,     
So I’ve recently acquired a new car from my mom, a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee in pretty good condition. It is currently still insured under her and in her name with me as a driver, but I want to look at insurance before I get it titled in mine. I already have insurance with USAA for my other car, a 1996 328i bmw, which I don’t have comprehensive on because it’s a cheap car and makes insurance for it at like $47 a month. I’ve looked at a lot of places but most want to charge me average of $200+ for both cars which is pretty outrageous that the Jeep will be 2x my bmw’s cost even with comprehensive and the goods on it. I have a clean driving record and am the “model driver” which should give me a bit of a discount or so I thought. 

Anyway, so I recently checked out Allstate and they quoted me with a really good insurance offer, like $140 a month and very small or no deductibles for not at fault accidents and stuff. The lady was really nice the first and second calls she made with me. I asked a few questions because obviously I’m skeptical about such a low monthly cost for both vehicles, and everything seemed good and I said I’d think about it/look around some more. She said she’d check up on me later. Well that was yesterday. 

She called me again today, asking about it. She seemed a bit urgent and almost chastising this time around though. I told her I was busy and had a lot on my mind and basically wasn’t ready yet. She said I’d be saving a lot of money and that I should do so as soon as possible to save money for Christmas and stuff and nothing is more important. When I told her I was busy, she asked with what and said she could work around it. I told her hesitantly(because that’s an odd question) that I have two midterms next week and will be going skiing tomorrow and have class in 10 minutes. She seemed to soften up a little and said she gets that as a single mom trying to get her degree. Then she pushed the insurance again. I told her I really have to go because I have class and she seemed to get angry, with a long awkward pause. Very almost like hurt/offended, she replied, ok, well then, bye. Like I should drop everything to get cheaper insurance. And immediately ended the call. 

And I’m like, Umm, I was interested in Allstate insurance, but now I’m not so sure. I also don’t want to get screwed because I have heard some bad things about Allstate. It’s almost like she acted like how a scam caller would when they are losing their catch. But everything was legit, the email sent me to the official Allstate site with the quote and options to change or alter it. Idk what to do now. I don’t want to talk to her again if she is going to be like that, but I do like the price/benefits they gave, but I don’t wanna get screwed by the low price/company. 

TL:DR- Allstate agent gets short with me and tells me I should prioritize saving money over my other priorities, even though I don’t even have ownership of the second car yet and don’t exactly need it ASAP. Seems to get especially offended when I tell her I have class in 10 min(ie can’t talk any longer) and hangs up awkwardly/abruptly.",20Nov2020,1
803,"Hello Redditors!
I need some advice and wasn't sure the best place to post. I hope this is okay. On mobile. 
So I,  52F, live in Indiana in an apartment I luckily love, as I cannot move. Landlord has always seemed decent, until now.
I suffer from horrible recurrent anxiety,  bipolar I, and maniacal depression. I also am immunocompromised, so I rarely leave the house. I was recommended by therapists to get a service (therapeutic) dog, and have a letter stating as much. I have started looking into different breeds, etc. A friend of a friend brought me a dog to keep for 24 hours to see if we matched. The dog came around 7pm. 
The dog was quiet and calm, and did his outdoor business outdoors. I saw my nosey neighbor (fellow building tenant) while taking the dog on an outdoor trip, but thought nothing of it, we get along fine, I thought.
Come morning, landlord knocks at my door just after 8am. He is there about the dog that's been there for barely 12 hours. He was upset that I hadn't told him about the visiting dog and said no dogs were allowed. That's not true. There have been at least 3 fellow tenants with dogs, and quite a few with cats.
My question(s) to you are:
1) Does my need for a service dog fall under Americans with Disabilities Act provisions/rules?
2) Does my landlord (Indiana)have to let me have a service dog?
3) What do I do??
I need your advise because I want to discuss it with my landlord but I get extremely anxious and emotional during confrontations, and want to be as prepared as I can.
Any advice is greatly appreciated",20Nov2020,1

812,"So my partner's dad runs a really lovely non-profit organisation that helps lots of people, but I won't be revealing the specifics of this. For years my partner has planned on running the organisation whilst his father moves away for a while. This would ultimately give him the experience needed to one day take on the organisation altogether, which has been his life plan and ambition for years. My partner would be the best person possible for this job, it suits him down to a tee. His father has always reaffirmed this plan, but he is also quite loose and his plans often seem to change. 

Recently my partner's step-sister had to move home for a while, so she has been working at the family business. I overheard her say that she feels like she runs the place, which I know isn't true, she's just quite opinionated like that. Because of this I told my partner he should discuss the plans for the take over with his Dad. My partner asked whether he would need any training or qualifications before taking on the project, and explained this was his life plan. 

All seemed fine and set in motion. Untill tonight. We were at a small family gathering and his step-sister dropped in to conversation that she would be taking over the business in my partner's dad's absence. My partner said nothing. Nobody said anything. The conversation just went on. My partner is not good at confrontation and now I am worried that he will not discuss this with either his father or step-sister. This has uprooted all of his life plans. His step-sister is very confrontational and always seems to be surrounded by some kind of drama, so the idea of taking this up with her is very daunting.

I was nowhere near the speed of other drivers, but when I tried to step up my game, I always overdid it and spun out/crashed. I looked up how to become faster, found some tutorials, but none of them really helped me. I can't pull off even the most basic techniques (trailbraking for example, it looks like sorcery to me on the tutorials). Since then, I've been feeling burned out. I came to terms with myself that I am never going to be a racing driver, and it's better for my mental health if I forget this stupid dream. But the other half of me says that I didn't try hard enough, that with enough practise I will be fast, I just need time. I don't know what to do really. So my question is: should I give up on my dream of being a racing driver or should I listen to the other half of me and keep pushing?",20Nov2020,1

834,"So my girlfriend emailed her professor about a question she got wrong (the answer was wrong bc of a rounding error, off by .00001). The question directly determined if she passes or fails. She sent a nice email to the professor about it and the professor rudely told her there was nothing he could do with added insults (he said the rounding was required, then takes the time out of his day to check her grades and takes a shot at her for not doing everything possible to pass). He ended the email by recommending my girlfriend drop the class.

My girlfriend is dead set on replying because the professor was rude to her multiple times in the past for no reason. Its a “youre a jerk” email without directly saying it. I’ve read the reply, and its not rude. Its taking the highroad (highest except not replying) and just replying to everything the teacher said and why she didn’t do it. In no point of her reply does she insult or threaten the teacher, other than saying his reply was rude.

Should she avoid sending this email? The class is over, and she never has this professor again (its an intro class) She wouldn’t care if the professor just said there was nothing he could do, but the professor going out of his way to be rude just made her angry.",20Nov2020,1
835,"I was laid off from my job today and was told I wouldn't be rehired because of my attendance this year and the last 2 years. At my job were allowed 5 sick days a year and in the previous 2 years I had like 6-8 sick days each year. 

This year I've been struggling with anxiety and sleep, I've been taking sleep medication all year long but my sleep quality hasn't been great and I called into work occasionally and after about 6 months of taking this medication it seemed to stop working completely. I recently switched to a new medication and sleep has been better at times but not great and I've also been having issues at my new apartment such as constant noises keeping me awake.

Anyway today was my last day of the season and I was told I wouldn't be rehired the next year(usually laid off for like 3 months). I was pretty shocked as I told my managers throughout the year I've been struggling with anxiety and sleep and I thought they understood. I've missed like 11 days this year because I've called in when I couldn't get any sleep the night before but I still came in plenty of times when I was exhausted because I didn't want to miss too many days. At my end review almost all of my reviews from foreman/co workers were positive but because of attendance they said they wouldn't rehire me.

I'm wondering if I have a case to talk to our union or if I'm out of luck and should look for another job. Any advice appreciated.",20Nov2020,1
836,"This is very difficult for me to write, and I'd like to put content warnings here for violence, threats, self-harm, basically this is a really horrible story.

I used to work at a pawnbroker's in the UK, a small chain (5-10 stores) and we had many awful things happen. We had a cockroach infestation, angry customers, I even had someone throw a monitor at me. It was a horrible place to work but it was my first job and I really didn't realise how bad it was. 

About a year into working there, a man came in and demanded a refund that we couldn't give to him. He started yelling racist things at my colleague and sexist things at me. We had a button to call the police under the desk which I went for, but before I could the man backed me in to a corner and held a piece of glass to my neck, saying that he was going to wait until the police came and kill me in front of them. My colleague ran out into the office during this and I was left alone. I was completely convinced I was going to die. After some time the man was momentarily distracted and as he turned I made a run for it and locked myself in the office. The police came, arrested him, but when they tried to speak to me I was too much of a mess to respond. 

My colleague spoke for me and explained the threats, but it turned out he didn't explain about the glass and the man had been let go without charge. When I found this out and told management we needed to go back to the police they told me I was over-reacting and though they were sorry I got threatened, my life was never in danger. I continued working there for way too long - I was young and traumatised and really didn't understand - and started self-harming and suffering from hallucinations. I saw a doctor and was diagnosed with PTSD, put on medication and into therapy, and though I told management this they had no response. I also pleaded with them to put a screen up between the counter and customers, and they repeatedly said they'd look into it but didn't see it as important. 

I've been out of there for a while, but I think about the people working there now and what danger and terrible conditions they are in. Nothing has changed, and no screens are up at the counters. I know it is unlikely for their lives to be in danger like mine was, sure, but I know it's possible and I'm certain they will be treated terribly, possibly violently, and that whatever issues they bring to management will be dismissed. I wish I could talk to them and tell them what happened to me, but I don't know how to and I also don't want to have any contact with the company. Should I do this? How can I do this?  Any advice would be so appreciated. Thank you for reading.",20Nov2020,1
837,"Yesterday my mom had confronted me about moving out and I ended up talking about a lot more. I have been living with my mom and her boyfriend for 5 years(I'm 17) and over time a lot of things have happened that have been quiet troublesome. 

A lot of fights have broke out and I was always apart of it with my sisters. After my sisters moved out they seemed to settle down and chill down. Either way I have come to terms with the idea that I havent dealt with a lot of issues properly so I have been dwelling on a lot of things. 

When i had talked to my mom, I brought up a lot and I dont think I properly expressed what I meant to say. So for context ""i cant get along with him and I dont like doing everything for him"" and I just kept jumbling my speech because I was asked this out of no where and I didn't have time to think of what I should say.

I know my mom's boyfriend is really hurt but I had my reasons as well, it's not ok to yell and say racist jokes, but I still feel hurt also. 

My mom took my words and repurposed them, saying things like ""so you think I make everything negative"" or ""that's to bad because he really cares for you"" I feel horrible right now and I dont know how to talk to them about it. I dont want to intentionally abandon our relationship but I just feel so tired having to deal with this. I also said how I didnt feel happy and she happened to book a physiologist appointment for me, which I really appreciate and truly need to sort out my feelings properly.

839,"
I’ve done some bad crap to others (people/animals)in the past. Nothing to be in jail for but I was very immature and young. And, I can’t ever forgive myself from it. I’ve been crying I’m my room for this full entire day, dreading anything. I never have drank water, I feel so lethargic, I barely ate , and I’m about to vomit. I feel like passing out, I’m talking to a Therepist, but I’m embarrassed to say what this young piece of shit did in the past. I’m so embarrassed to tell anyone and burst out crying.

Nothing illegal, just playing around in a cruel way. Like with my sibling, pets, and one of my pets died from an illness and I felt so guilty because I was so rude, and once hoped she did you know. I was extremely young, and it affects me so much. I wish that demon in the past would just sink in the pits of hell, I wish I could go back and yell at them so hard, and make them pay. I wish they were more mature. I know you’ll all say I’m an asshole and don’t deserve help, which is true. But I can’t stand myself back then, I’m still not the best person in the world. I want to be nicer, but it’s so hard.

Right now, I’m isolating myself in a room from everyone else. I enjoy being alone, and it clearly benefits others. I also have a binge eating disorder, and am know 118 which hurts me so much. I gained weight. I have depression, and health anxiety, social anxiety, future anxiety too. I’ve been diagnosed with all of them, and currently take medication which gives me side effects. 

But, what should I do. I can’t enjoy life anymore. I’ve never felt happy in a long time, and I know I’m an immature, ungrateful, dumb brat but please try to help me. I’m trying to think about the good times I had with my pet, instead of only the bad times but I’m thinking it’s more bad times. And, btw I never have self harmed currently, and probably never will I’m so afraid of doing it. Please, any help will greatly be appreciated I need to improve myself for the better. I need to get rid of that dumb asshole my damn past self. Especially when I hear sad songs, read sad books, etc I start having a breakdown.

841,"I've been going through it, man. 

So here's the situation- I have terrible anxiety. It's a mix of genetics and some other traumas that happen to everyone at some point in their life. I also have really terrible mood swings that are dramatic, and I turn to self-harming behavior to calm down when the anxiety and mood swings tag team me. Needless to say, it's not healthy. I won't go into a deep analysis of everything that is going on in this little brain of mine but I have been diagnosed with a laundry list: ADHD, OCD, Panic Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It's gotten to the point where I am having difficulty functioning.

I can't sleep, I'm either ravenous or not hungry at all, my heart is always racing, and I am feeling every single emotion at once while simultaneously feeling nothing at all. I cut out caffeine for the most part except a standard cup (12-16 oz) in the morning. But I am worried that things just aren't changing for me. I need a break from it all, and it's so hard. It's so so so hard. I am on Wellbutrin and Lexapro but they no longer are helping. All my therapy appointments are virtual, and they are far too infrequent (once every month and a half).

I don't know how I'm supposed to get better when I have school, college apps, commitments, little to no medical attention (to be fair, 40 minutes every month and a half ;-) ), and this brain that sucks all of my energy,

I can barely function the way I need to anymore and I don't know what to do- I think I am addicted to my own self-destruction because once you hit rock bottom, you can't sink any deeper.

I don't really know what I need but if anyone has been in my boat, what do I do? How do I get better?",20Nov2020,1
842,"

I just got out of a 3 year relationship 2 months ago, and that's fine I'm not heart broken over it but being single has made me remember why I was single for 19 of the 22 years I've been on this earth, I'm not normal. I'm far far from any type of normal and while I'd consider myself conventionally attractive and I have no issue attracting women I don't have anything other then my looks and it's disappointing. Recently me and an old friend of mine started getting very close and at one point it felt like we where dating but we don't live close to each other and I think the biggest deal breaker for her and most women iD that I'm legally blind, so I can't drive anywhere and I'm dependent on family and friends to get around and now the person that I have literally everything in common with is becoming distant for someone else because (this is an assumption) she probably feels like it'd be hard to build a future with someone who can't drive (she also can't drive due to heart issues) and I guess I can't blame her, women need someone who can't take care of them they don't want someone they have to take care of, I also have a lot of needs (sexually and non-sexually) that pretty much knocks out a good majority of women. Basically, I just feel like I cant really hold a relationship very well because I'm handi capped and I don't have a lot going on with my life other then having my own place.

844,"When I was 9 I was struggling with my health (I'm in my teens now). I had chronic pain issues. There wasn't something causing it, I was just really unlucky all at one time. This pain caused me to miss a lot of school because I wasn't able to function properly without being in pain. Medications weren't going to work for a while, and my parents needed me back in school.

The doctors couldn't take appointments for months, and I had already missed school, and was on track to  fail that year of school because of how much I missed. 

So my parents decided to put me in acupuncture. I have an awful fear of needles. I also have undiagnosed adhd or add. They knew about my fear of needles, but they don't think I have adhd. (But that's a whole different thing) As you can imagine, a fear of needles and having trouble sitting still is not something that really works well with acupuncture. I constantly moved, which caused more pain. I complained a lot. My parents were very aware that I hated it with everything in me. I also pretended to feel better just so they wouldn't make me go back. But since my parents thought it was working they sent me back because I ""felt better"" afterwards. In a way, their idea worked, because I did go back to school. But I was still in pain, and afraid to talk about it because I didnt want to be put in more pain.

My chronic pain thing kinda fizzled out after a few months, and my parents stopped making me go. But I can't move past it. Its been over five years and I'm still thinking back to it a lot. Therapy isnt an option, and my parents know about how I lied so that they wouldn't make me go. They also apologized for it, and said they needed me back in school. I understand that. But i feel like I can't trust them anymore. What can I do to forgive them, or at least move past it? 

(For the adhd part, I'm aware that not everyone with adhd has trouble sitting still, and that not being able to sit still isn't an exclusive trait of adhd. I have other reasons for why I believe I have adhd, but that was easier to explain.)",20Nov2020,1

846,"3 months ago I found out I was pregnant, it was an unplanned pregnancy with my boyfriend of 4 years. (Completely irrelevant in my opinion but for extra information I had the implant so was not expecting this at all) I knew from the get go that it would be a difficult situation as he is not ready for children, and admittedly maybe I was not either. 

I only found out I was pregnant after some sudden random bleeding I had at work during my night shift, it was accompanied by short sharp abdo pain but after an hour the bleeding stopped - I continued my night shift but took a test when I got home - I was then referred to the early pregnancy unit. 

From my initial scan they believed I had had a miscarriage and was told to return in a weeks time, and from further scans they diagnosed me with a hydatiform molar pregnancy. It’s extremely rare and can develop into a fast growing rare form of cancer within the uterus called GTD. Due to this I had to have an operation to remove the tissue and have been under a specialist hospital as there are only 2 hospitals in england that deal with this type of cancer. 

I have been being monitored with weekly bloods and had chemotherapy lingering over me this whole time. It has been stressful and challenging and put a lot of pressure on myself and my relationship. Not to mention me worrying about any future pregnancy’s I may have. 

Our best friends found out the same time as us that they too were pregnant - they had open conversations Infront of us about how they didn’t think they wanted it, how it would ruin there life, how they wouldn’t be able to go to ibiza drinking etc, she waited 4 whole months to get a scan and there pregnancy is fine and healthy. I am happy for them but struggle to see what could have been my situation. 

This has lead me to get angry and resentful to my boyfriend because I knew he did not want this pregnancy in the first place.  We didn’t have discussions about our choices before the choices were taken out of our hands completely and this happened. He also at times has been unsupportive and selfish - two days after my operation he got very drunk with his friend and after me repeatedly saying I wanted to go home he completely ignored me and ended up shouting and swearing because I wanted to go home. He did apologise but after a drink he just loses self control and it’s usually me that has to pick up the pieces, not unusual in most relationships. But not ideal two days after surgery. 

I have tried to talk to him but it just ends up in an argument and the intimacy in our relationship has gone completely. With him often sleeping in the spare room. 

I am taking active steps to make myself better - getting a Counciller etc but I just don’t know if these feelings of resentment and anger will ever go away.",20Nov2020,1
847,"I constantly have incomprehensible and unpleasant feelings. In the last few months, a lot has changed in my life and this that affects me. my mood is absolutely messy, I mean, it really changes incredibly quickly and sometimes it concerns things that are too important to be treated with such frivolity. my decisions change for no good reason and this is awful, and sometimes it comes to such stupidity that no normal person would have done, besides, these decisions come to me in one second and then take root in me so much that how it is impossible to get rid of them, even understanding their silliness.

 Ex: I had a person whom I knew for several months and I considered him a pretty close friend (yes, yes, I know, now everyone will say that how could he become a close friend in such a short time, but yes, I really thought he was, so I missed it) but once, for no reason at all, I thought: ""what the hell did I decide that he was my friend, I don't even want to think about this person"" (I know it sounds absurd, but that's how it sounded in my head) several days passed and I developed this idea to such an extent that he became disgusting to me, imagine, the person who meant a lot to me became unbearable to me, I disgusted answering his messages and calls, so now I'm thinking how I can stop communicating with him without hurting his feelings (if anyone has any ideas, share)

This example seemed to me eloquent enough to show how suddenly and stupidly my thoughts are born and then develop. I cannot concentrate because strange and unnecessary thoughts come to my mind, which are quite difficult for me to supplant, I have a feeling as the life I am living is not mine. in fact, all this garbage going on in my head is very unpleasant and does not terribly interfere, sorry for this terrible pun, I just read what I wrote and was horrified by the illegibility and inconsistency of what was written so excuse me, if anyone had the strength to finish reading all this nonsense, I will be glad get advice and sorry for wasting time",20Nov2020,1

And, for the most part, I do well in this crazy world. I live in a city and the houses are very close to each other.  No one has big yards.  Enter a new next door neighbor about 3 years ago.  He is a cop and he and his girlfriend and his two high school aged sons are really giving me a hard time. (DISCLAIMER - I am a firm supporter of first responders and respect all professions within that category.  I  even donate to the policeman's association.  So i am def NOT a cop hater.)  I only mention his job because I feel this is a factor in how we interact.  He blasts his music inside his house so loud - my little house physically shakes.  And, when he sets up his huge speakers outside - wow - no way can I think of enjoying my back yard.  I have talked to him about this - and predictably he got all loud and shouted that he works hard and parties hard.  Loud music was the first issue. On to the second issue, before he even moved in I had installed a  6' white PVC fence between our yards. I, also, had built two fairly large raised garden beds directly in front of this fence. His sons play frisbee. More than once the frisbee was thrown over the into my garden.  Knocking down a tomato plant once. I asked them to try not to thrown in that general direction.  The neighbor was livid and said his sons can do whatever they want in his yard. and, basically - told me to stuff it. I tried to ask him to see my perspective - made no ground. So the third issue - 2 years ago he got a boxer puppy (and I love dogs,  I watched the puppy grow into a most beautiful dog). But - puppies have boundless energy. The neighbor exercises his dog by throwing a soccer ball against my fence.  Then the dog  body slams the fence as he tries to catch the ball.  When I fist heard this one/two noise I jumped out of my chair.  It's old news now. So tonite, a new issue - I heard the body slam but I didn't hear the ball slam first. So I looked out my window and now this guy has a laser pointer which he is teaching the dog to chase.  He points it right at my fence.  Do I have any rights?  talking to him is useless, he refuses to consider how his actions impact others. What can I do, if anything?",20Nov2020,1

He always seemed to be better at making conversation and developing connections with people who were older than him as apposed to people who are the same age or younger.

862,"This post might be a bit more than the title itself. But hear me out, I really need some help.

I (18F) currently live with my mother and a sibling. I dont know whether or not to consider ourselves homeless, but we lost our home a few months ago due to being evicted. Since then, we have been staying at my cousins house, she's not here often as she's mostly with her boyfriend.
We are only allowed to stay until December 1st, and my mom has a court date for the eviction on the 17th of December and I'm not sure where we will end up staying.

I have been trying to seek out jobs for months now, but this is a bit difficult for me. I just graduated high school back in May, but I'm already wanting to sort my life out I guess? The problem is i dont know how to drive nor do i even have a permit. So even if I was to get a job, I'd need to be taken to and from the workplace. I dont know if I'm rushing things or what but I really just want to get my life together, especially since I dont even have my own place.

The problem i am having is that, my parents nor my family are supportive enough to help me, as I've asked nicely many times. I kind of feel trapped almost. I also do not have friends at all who can help me. I'm not currently staying by any place I could just walk to and work at, but another thing is I'm looking more specifically for like a warehouse job of some sort so I dont have to deal with the backlash for having piercings and colored hair. My mom works at one, and I've been asking for months if she could let me talk to her bosses, I've filled out an application, and for months have been told that they would hire me someday but I still haven't been able to get this job.

My other problem is that, I have no family or friends who will help we with the whole learning how to drive thing. Not when my mom will help me, so I'm not sure what I should do.

I'm also worried about what to do about the living situation because of this, and that we can only stay at my cousins house until the beginning of december. Where I live, literally no places at all will accept people who either have evictions/foreclosures or recent evictions/foreclosures.

Why I want to just suddenly get my life together is so I dont have to keep being stuck in this situation. I'm having trouble with the job and driving and even getting a car for myself, but I also do not have a credit score or credit card or even a bank account, which I think that's important for the most part, in trying to get a place of your own, which I hope to achieve after all of this. I'm sorry if any of this sounds dumb at all, and this as well but I also dont know a whole lot about using credit csrds/bank accounts? Ahhh I feel really stupid for this, I've even looked up stuff about it but cant seem to find understandable advice really. Everything is usually worded really weird for me. 

Is there any possible advice I can get for this? I've talked with my mom and family about this for months even before losing our home but still recieved no help at all. I just dont want to keep continuing to live in a really rough situation, and on top of all of this I kind of feel trapped because I'm not getting the help I really need. Thank you so much to anyone willing to give advice and such, it is very much appreciated!!",20Nov2020,1

I thought this was strange but she didn’t seem bothered by it so I tried not to worry. He has a young daughter maybe 12 that I think stayed in the room too. One night L asked me to pick her up but when I asked her where she was she never responded and I was left worried the whole night until she told me she was fine the next morning. I come to find out L’s dad had touched her inappropriately and I don’t know how far it went, but i know it didn’t go as far as it could have. L told me that her dad told her he doesn’t think of her as his daughter, only a pretty girl. I had to convince her to kick him out.  She doesn’t have a good relationship with her mom and her mom has a history of putting men before her. L called me and told me that her mom kicked her out because her mom told her that her dad sexually assaulted her and L didn’t believe her. She’s now living with her dad.

I think the mom is messed up letting her daughter live with a man that she claims has assaulted her which makes the truth harder to figure out. I’d rather my friend live with a “liar” than a rapist but L doesn’t agree. All in all her parents are awful and she doesn’t have a lot of options.

We talked a little on that and then the topic just changed. The next day at the office, neither of us mentioned what happened, instead we went about our day as usual.

881,"It’s a precarious situation. I love my Lord AND my family who has done so much for me. A family given to me by the Lord Himself. I treasure both relationships.

Will Jesus forgive me and understand that I only pray to Him and read the Bible in private and never tell my family?

I was born into a Muslim family in the United States but I have fallen in love with His Word and I pray to Christ daily in my room with the door shut every morning. I tune in to online church every Sunday and I also have Bible study early in the morning a few times a week. I feel so much joy! I was never this enthusiastic about the Koran or Muslim traditions. Is that bad?

I could never ever tell my family because they are staunch in their faith and they would be devastated and I want to keep my relationships intact. They have done so much for me and I love them and I hold my relationship with them as sacred. Is it wrong that I choose to never tell them? 

A couple members of our community turned to Christ and they were disowned by their families and completely ostracized from everyone. My family also looked down upon them in shame. I don’t want to put myself in such a predicament. 

Is it wrong that the Bible makes me feel different compared to the Koran? I mean a good different. I feel so at peace. Is it wrong to never ever tell them? Is it ok and forgiveable to love and accept Christ in my heart alone? I don’t plan on going into ministry, so I don’t feel the need to share my faith (especially not with my family). I was just looking for a relationship with God that allows me to connect with Him on a deeper level and so that I spend my days in peace, which I didn’t have for a long time. I can already feel the transformation in my heart.

There are some aspects of Islam that just never resonated with me the way Christianity does:

I really dislike how Islam is practiced entirely in Arabic-reading, reciting, and praying in Arabic. Especially since I grew up in a family that does not speak Arabic. I also don’t like having to go through the mechanical motions (although truth be told I’m ashamed to say I never actually learned how to pray). I love the way Christians pray. Whatever is on your heart, you speak it aloud or silently. No matter what language you speak, the Lord hears it because He is an all-knowing God. He understands all languages. I can pray any way I want. 

I also love the concept of song as a form of worship in churches, through choir or worship bands. There is nothing like that in the mosque! I will say the Azan is beautiful and the Koran can be read in a melodious way, but I’m so drawn to actual worship songs. The Lord should be praised through music in song in a house of worship! 

I tried to read the Koran in English. The tone was entirely different. It felt like a rule book. Many of the stories are the same in both the Koran and the Bible. But in the Koran the stories are very short and disorganized, they are in different chapters. Whereas in the Bible, it flows like a story which I love. 

Next I’d like to address the the relationship between God and man. In the Koran, I found many passages that mentioned how God’s love is conditional. There were many verses stating that God does NOT love liars, sinners, unbelievers, etc. (even though it does say He forgives and is merciful). Also the relationship between God and man is that of a Master and slave which did not sit well with me at all. There was a lot more emphasis on man proving their love for God through good deeds so that they get to Heaven. 

In Christianity, it’s so different. God’s love for man is unconditional, that of a parent’s love for a child, which is how I’ve always seen the relationship! 

That said, for a little while I tried to get into Sufism. You know, reading the world of Mystics such as Rumi. I still do read his works. I like Sufism because it focuses on the emotional and spiritual connection between God in man. In Sufism, God is indeed a father. 

But Sufism didn’t hit me the way Christianity does. I like Sufism, I LOVE Christianity. When I started reading the New Testament, I absolutely fell in love with Jesus Christ’s character. I knew that I wanted to follow His teachings. He was so humble, patient, loving, altruistic, and compassionate. I love reading about His miracles (and again this was mentioned in the Koran but doesn’t go into detail about His journey with His disciples). I love the concept of a God incarnate. I can easily put a face to God. And knowing that He walked among us, it makes Him so personable. I see Jesus as a true friend and confidante. In Islam, there is a veil between man and God. You can’t see Him (I get it, it’s supposed to be that way). 

I’ve always been so attracted to Christmas and Easter for some reason, more then Eid. I don’t know why! 

I’d prefer to listen to the sermons at the church I tune into every week instead of the sermons from Muslim clerics.

But I have so much love for Jesus Christ and it’s a love ive never experienced this before. 

I did read a bit about Muhammad and his followers in some of the Hadiths. I didn’t enjoy reading about these random Arab people like Abu Bakr, Uthman, Fatima, Aisha. I don’t know I just don’t acknowledge them. 

I even read about the account of Jesus in the Koran when he was supposedly not killed and raised to heaven instead, being replaced by someone else who was killed in his place. I had a weird feeling in my stomach afterwards. This account felt like a cop out. 

Sorry for the long post! I’d like to read your thoughts. This may sound weird but a close friend of mine who is Christian said there are many paths to God and I found my way through Jesus. This particular path gives me so much peace that I didn’t feel before. I could never tell me family though. I feel that religion is such a private matter and that it’s really no one else’s business. It’s between you and God. 

With that said, I still see myself a Muslim man because I don’t want to break away entirely from my family’s tradition. I still have an attachment to Islam because I was born into it. I’d have to tell my husband about it but I really hope he is someone who will accept me and be understanding about my spirituality and faith life. I would even like to introduce and have our children learn about Islam so that they know about their family tradition. If they decide to choose another spiritual path when they are older, I’d be ok with that. 

I love reading the Bible and praying to Jesus, it’s become routine for me now. I do it because I love it. When I had to read the Koran, I did it out of obligation or because it was something every other Muslim did. 

Hope you enjoyed reading!",20Nov2020,1
883,"Hi, I'm 17 and i'm already in Uni. My parents pay for my Appartement in a big town where i would go to study, but because of quarantine I've been staying at my parent's house. But I have a huge problem, I hate what I study but i'm trapped.

Basically, my parents pay for everything, but as it turns out i'm completely failing everything and i've had zero motivation ever since I actually started my actual classes. Now, that's a huge problem because I'm late on basically all my assignement, and I have so much to do, but zero motivation to do them, i'm basically in a contant state of apathy where I just do nothing all day then go to sleep, rinse and repeat. And I can't just tell my parents because if I do they'll scream at me because a lot of money went into the appartement and everything related to it and my studies. And I don't want to disappoint them because i'm already a huge failure when it comes to school and studies. I really need some help because I don't think I can handle the stress of it for much longer...

When it comes to me wasting my youth, failing school is one huge part of it. I've never had amazing grades, but I always make it. However I would not have been able to go into any other studies path because of my low grade, and as a result I feel like I can't actually do what I want to do. And While I chose to study in Arts, it drained my motivation to draw anything because it now feels like a chore rather than a hobby. And with Covid, I haven't seen my friends in months and it's soon going to be my 18th birthday but sadly I won't be able to party (that is, two years in a row) and it's getting extremely down on myself about it because I miss my friends so much, but the condition since the beginning of the pandemic made me extremelly tired, to a point that even texting my friends requires a lot of energy. i'm just asking for help because it's all just so exhausting and I feel like my Youth is being stolen from me.

After Lockdown Level 4 my bandmates and I mutually decided we weren't into it anymore (although the thought of making regular money was spurring others to keep going).

She won't take a day for herself I wish shed fuck off, Then she asks me to mow the lawn when I worked all work outside- Doing the lawns and gardening! 
I am 26 and I think it's unfair as I need my own life too! My sister had a whole week off holiday! 
I get nothing,  even though I live at home still unfortunately. I'm stuck in the family business and sje always expects me to do chores on the weekends when I'm over exhausting myself. She never takes a break, this seems madness to me, I'm a crack",20Nov2020,1
891,"Hey gang, looking for advice when it comes to editing workflow. Just ordered a new MacBook Pro and looking to clean up and tidy my workflow for editing photos. Any advice would be great as to how to best utilize using an external hard drive. Do you save only RAW original files to the external? RAW original and final edits and keep the computer clean of photos? Whatever tips are greatly appreciated!! 
Thanks again. 

Bonus points for External Hard drive recommendations! Haha",20Nov2020,1
