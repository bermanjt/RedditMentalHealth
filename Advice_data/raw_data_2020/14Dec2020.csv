2,"Hi, I am a 14 yr old Male, unlike most of my family I’m really on to ‘geeky’ stuff like comics, dungeons and dragons, games, and high fantasy/sci-fi movies, I am always mocked by them for it and they are always calling me weird and other names, they always make mean jokes about me and it has really made it hard for me to make friends and talk to people, I have become really introvert over the years and I’m starting to really sick of the jokes and harassment from my family who doesn’t listen to me, I’m sick of it and I don’t know what to do.",14Dec2020,1
3,"(I'm new here so forgive me if I format something off)

I have been taking AP Calculus 1 at my Highschool all semester so far. It's been rough, really rough. I've been failing the class almost all semester and last quarter I only passed by .1 grade points. With my school, I can't graduate with Academic Honors like how I've been working towards if I have any classes with a quarter grade lower than a C (73). 

Next semester I have tons of extra curriculars, its my senior year and between Track, Robotics, and tons of other extracurricular groups (that I'm not naming as to not give away where I live), I'm not sure if I have the means to continue it.

I'm just worried that my school might not let me end my class, plus the pressure from my peers that it'd seem like I'm giving up. I'm just not sure, and Calc has progressively gotten harder. 

Do you guys think I should continue or find a way to not take it?

**TL;DR** 

Calculus is hard and with my extra curriculars coming up I don't think I can continue it.",14Dec2020,1
4,"Wednesday just before 3 a.m. our kitchen caught on fire. The fire along with the smoke and water damage destroyed/ruined everything but the clothes on our backs and our vehicles.. minus all of the keys to my wife’s car. Thankfully we were insured and the in-laws live 30 minutes away, and are will to put us up for the time being. We have already had our insurance agent out and he is working on an estimate, but he is 99.9% sure it is total loss. Does anyone know if any proceeds from insurance will be taxed? My wife’s cat (her baby) passed away, should I get her a new one once we have a more stable place to live? We are unsure of if we want to re-build or sell the home, can we sell the burned out shell as is? There are a million questions but these are the ones currently on my mind.

6,"Hi people of Reddit, as my true friends I'm quite the character and quite a psyco/ they don't want people to mess with.
First of all, only a few close friends know me( 1 housemate that know my past and 1 classmate that know my past and how I act). 

I'm 18 years old, christian (Jesus is our Lord) taking a degree in History but I'm going to drop out and join the police. History is cool and all but isn't for me, I'm more into crime investigation.

So now to the part, the mental part, I'm just not like everyone else. So, let's describe me and how I think/act. 

First of all, I analyse/read everyone I meet, do a small mental list of how they act, how they are, what to wait from them, strengths/weaknesses and how to take them down in case of they atacking me. In question of places/ walking on the street, I do a quick reading of everything, draw escape routes if I feel like I'm in danger and am more aware of the surrounding s than the average Joe.

Then, how I act with people, I basically put up a character according to the people that I'm talking to, only the 2 people that really know me are the ones that I really don't worry. With everyone else, I could be a junky, a really high class person, a party type person, the average guy who really cares about politics and such things, the guy who just want to find a girl, etc... I also use this to get to know the people around me. 
All the character obviously have traits from my own personality, I don't really lie in this matter I tell who I am but the character is just more to connect and get to know the people and earn their trust.

Third point, I really have a hard time connecting to people, I think I have a natural lack of empathy with people my have and a bit older (mid 20s to late 20s), their to much party like people and almost everyone seems a bit imature, they drink to much and want to get me drunk or high (I'm more the kind of guy that likes a cup of whiskey with a teaspoon of melted honey in it than the guy who drink a bottle) and sometimes I end up drinking a bit to much with them. I'm also really the type of person who is a bit of introvert and have to put on a character when they have parties here in the house, wich sometimes lead me to sinning with the alcohol and lies wich I don't like and hope that God forgives me but I have to relate to my housemate in some way. Other negative point of to many people and partying is that I can't analyse everyone and everything that I need so I end up beeing always worried and feeling unprepared and that, plus a little of trouble with the ladies sometimes lead me to overdrinking.

Fourth point, why I only trust that 2 guys and an ex girlfriend that I just can't stand anymore, my housemate is in is mid 20s and kinda adopted me, he had is fair share of trouble going up and we just go along very well. My classmate, we were drinking and talking, he is christian and we were talking about that to and he said that I'm weird and that I seem to always be prepared, well, he seemed (and his) a thrustfull and can cause me no harm and his a bit like me in question of some political ideologies and in most spiritual ideologies to (in relation to churches and religion) even though he is chatolic and I'm protestant, so I told him how I am, he said that that sounds like a psychopath to him with a bit of a mixed Sherlock Holmes or Archer, I told him that I'm probably not a psychopath even though that it is hard for me to like or create a connection with humans (I connect much more with animals and nature, they show they're true feelings and don't really want to hurt me). One point that my classmate said is that I'm quite a controlled person and that I don't let my emotions show up because of the characters. My ex girlfriend his just a sad and stupid story of one more person playing with me, she got to know me a d I had a really great connection with her, I knew her, she knew my story, but when I told her about how I act and that I truly trusted her, she became weird and things went with the river never to come back, she said I have problems and should see a psychologist, we remained friends for some days, now not even that.

 A bit of my background: I grew up in a rural area etc, had a hard time growing up, took my fair share of beatings from my father and my mother, sometimes to the point of not being able to sleep on my back because of the belt whippings, but lets not talk about my past that much, in resume I had to learn to read people, and play around/manipulate them to have a easier life and my father as a ex military and detective thought me how to read people and how to always be prepared since very little, I also learned many martial arts, including krav maga, muay thai, kickboxing, aikido and a fair share of self defense that my father learned in the army and national guard.

So I need advice on what should I do with my life!
Fell free to make questions to.

God bless you all.",14Dec2020,1

8,So I am 21 college did not work out for me as I do not think it was the right learning environment for me. I am not sure what is the right learning environment for me but it was not put a book in front of me and teach me hardly anything verbally. Maybe the material was too difficult. It was from a comptia practice book. I took notes and passed the tests up until the last one I was doing ok and then all the terms were sort of blending together once I got to the test I bombed and I basically was forced out of school (It was not your typical college). Maybe I didn't study the right way or long enough or both. But anyhow I would like advice on general courses to take at least to figure out what I want to do later in life. Or some that help with how to study. I have udemy through my library and a few other sites with courses through my library. All i have currently is my Smartphone my computer is out Of order probably permanently .,14Dec2020,1
9,"About a year ago, I (30M) suddenly started to pick up on all sorts of low frequency hums in and around the house. It started with me noticing the neighbour's subwoofer a lot more and I didn't think much of it. Fast forward to now and I basically hear EVERY low frequency sound in and around the house. Even the bass playing from my own music ""triggers"" me and makes my heart race.

I went to an ear doctor and he said he initially didn't see anything odd IN my ears (after an insanely quick look). He basically implied it was physiological (ie burnout) that triggered this and that I needed to find ways to relax. And trust me I have tried. At a lowpoint I ever tried to self medicate and got way too drunk on my own couch. I never drink! Needless to say it didn't work. The low frequency sounds won't go away. I hear my own fridge hum, the neighbours washer, the automated oxygen control system, damn it I ever hear the AC unit outside our house go bananas when turned on. It's maddening.

My doctors sending me to have a hearing test tomorrow. Not entirely sure why because I'm not deaf, but I'm hoping something will come out of it. When I look it up online all I see is some people suffer from it and it sucks but there's never any mention of a remedy. I'm afraid if this goes on I'll go crazy. Please is there anyone who has any experience with this who can at least give me some advice on the matter. I can totally feel my hearing had changed but I can't quite describe how.",14Dec2020,1
10,"(18m) Okay, so throwaway account because this is a subject I feel very embarrassed about and wouldn't even feel confident taking about it to anyone close to me or a psychiatrist about but I don't know how bad it is but I am very worried about it and the implications of it for what it means about my attitudes towards women.

When I was probably around 5 or 6 years old I somehow became aware of what boobs were and started to google them constantly. I don't actually remember this happening but I assume one of my friends told me. I then somehow eventually started watching porn. I don't actually remember the first time this happened but I guess that from 5-11 I probably encountered porn probably 10-15 times. when I got my own smartphone at probably about 11ish years old and learnt to masturbate I think I started to watch it weekly and from then to now I probably watched porn anywhere from daily to monthly. I had times when I was maybe 12 where I tried to stop watching it and masturbating at all because I thought you could go to hell for it in Islam but eventually became atheist and then thought it was fine so carried on but never considered that it was bad for my brain and my attitudes towards women and maybe future relationships until a few months ago. Since then I've been tried to stop but felt that the damage has been done and I don't know how to undo it, and also I think I may have become addicted and just feel slightly powerless and usually can't resist and don't feel like I have the willpower to stop watching it.

This is the part I feel very embarrassed about. I for some reason was such a horny child that I would be thinking about it constantly and couldn't stop thinking about it or wanting to look at it and was caught multiple times via browser history and drawings. I think there were multiple times that they found open tabs of porn that dumb me forgot to close. Probably a few times from ages 5-13 was confronted by my parents when they found something and I was told to stop. I don't actually remember what it was they told me. I feel like they told me it was bad or to stop when they did but I remember feeling very embarrassed in those memories and feel very embarrassed about how I watched it and they had to confront me about it but for some reason didn't realise that it was that bad for some reason and didn't think that I should not've been watching it and am worried about what it did to my head. 

I feel really terrible and guilty about this part. Probably on two or three occasions from maybe 7-9 I was visited by cousins I would be told to go to my room with one of my female cousins who was three years younger than me and when were alone I would ask her to take her clothes off and she complied. I don't think I ever touched anything but my memory is kind of bad with these memories but I remember my parents having to confront me about that too when my aunts and uncles found out and I feel very terrible that I did it and I don't even remember thinking it was bad for some reason until when I was around 13 or 14 and began to feel really ashamed about it and slightly feel like I'm a terrible person for doing it. This also happened once also with a neighbour's child who was probably also around three years younger but I don't have any memory of my parents confronting me on that so I don't know if she told her parents and I feel bad and worried that I might have really negatively affected her or made her feel weird. I don't think I've actually been in the same room with her since then so I think they may have found out though. I feel terrible my parents had to witness this and I feel like a bad child for this and how much I watched porn. I have a very terrible relationship with my parents and we hardly talk at all. Not even at meal times. I think when my aunts told my parents about what I did they told me to stop and I think I realised this was wrong because I stopped. The last time I did something like that was no later than 9 or 10 and I went to an all boy's school from 11 to 16 and didn't actually have much contact with girls. I would never ask someone to show any private to me or ask anything really sexual in nature to anyone and know that what I did then was a stupid thing to do and I was crossing a line. However, there have been more recent times where I might have made people a bit uncomfortable by asking for hugs a lot but realise now that it's a weird thing to ask but I didn't realise at the time I'm just worried about my attitudes towards girls are and if they are bad. I've never had a girlfriend and am not close to anyone so do not feel inclined to ask any sexual questions to anyone and I wouldn't even ask my friends if they masturbate and would never make any inappropriate advances to anyone because I am aware that would probably be harassment.

I didn't have any friends who were girls until I was maybe 17. I feel sure that I've never done anything sexual that was wrong or made anyone uncomfortable apart from those times but I have never really got on well with any girls but had probably around 10ish (very intense) crushes but I never really interacted much with them. I always had trouble making friends and was always jealous of them and thought they hated me for no reason and would be a bit mean to people (nothing physical or name-calling but just being a shitty friend) but try not to be like that at all now because I can how it could be toxic. I have a few friends who are girls now but I'm worried about what my early exposure to porn says about the way I might view women without realising. I tend to notice that I get crushes very easily and with some of the girls I am friends with I often get intrusive sexual thoughts and sometimes think about what it would be like to have sex with them and am worried that I objectify women in my head. I have always wanted to be in a relationship but am slightly worried that I will be a bad boyfriend and I will never be able to have a good relationship.

Thank you for getting this far. To be honest, I just need a second opinion because I've never told anyone this and am starting to worry. I have found that I always had a wobbly mental health, and I've had lots of problems with depression and social anxiety since around 13 and have been on three medications and had suicidal periods and am really struggling with self-loathing and depression at the moment. At one point at 14 was almost going to get a diagnosis for Aspergers' but there was a long waiting list and it never happened. I am worried that maybe if I am it means I might make people uncomfortable without realising and thinking I am being okay? I am sure this has happened in the past and feel guilty about it though I didn't realise but I do now. I still often wonder if I come across weird or creepy to girls without realising. I just feel like I'm not very good socially any way and people will always find me odd. I don't feel like I am going to abuse someone and would never because I know the damage it causes and don't have any urge to anyway. However I am worried I am a bad person or have something bad inside me that is a bit weird and perverted and will never be normal so I am asking if anyone has any advice because I don't know to deal with it.",14Dec2020,1
11,"I didn't know where else to really try to get advice for this first. 
Currently we own 6 cats the two affected are Koala who is nearly ten years old and Taz who is around 2-3 years old. 

A few days ago Koala suddenly started limping and after waiting a few days for her to possibly improve as well waiting for a paycheck we took her to the vet. He couldn't afford much beyond a general exam, which was already 200$ and even getting blood and xrays would be an additional 500$. But the vet said not to worry and gave us some pain meds figuring she just pulled something, and she got a lot better quickly. But a short while after she started having a runny nose and sneezing, but shed done this before since she has more sensitive respiratory so we cleaned and she was fine. 

She let us touch her leg no problem but just wouldn't put weight on it but got better after resting for a few days. 


However today when Taz woke up a bit ago, we immediately noticed she was limping on the same leg as Koala, same symptoms. No visible pain from compressions but not putting weight on it, as well being lethargic and not herself, then she soon began limping on both back legs. Right now she is sleeping on my bed beside me, but I'm worried about her. We have to wait until Friday to take her in most likely, since we just don't have the money to spend at the vet, and I'm worried she could get worse.",14Dec2020,1

Some of my friends shared it, and after a couple hours someone I didn't know messaged me and offered to send me money for the bill. I was a little skeptical, but they actually sent me the money and I was able to pay my bill. I was very grateful, and I let them know how much it means. 

Then they asked if I had any other bills that I was behind on, and I said yes. They asked if I wanted to work from home and make some money every week (huge red flag). I said no because that's sketchy. They then asked me for my Internet and phone bill login to pay those bills too. They explained that part of their business is adding iPhones to the cart, they pay for the phones, then they get shipped to me and I distribute them to customers. I said I am not comfortable with that, and I was just looking for someone to help with a bill. 

Now they won't stop calling and messaging me on Facebook saying that they're going to sue because I scammed them out of money. I blocked them, and they got tons of other people to message me and call me and harass me. I didn't do anything wrong, but I'm afraid I'm going to get sued.

19,"**Background and Prelude**

I’m a 15 year old boy who’s in 9th grade living in Sydney, Australia. I have been accused of many things that are not true but have however made everyone hate me. These things are, from my knowledge; said I was going to rape a specific girl (let’s call her Isabella), said I was going to pump Isabella with cum, that I pinned girls against the wall (not sure if people think I did it to specific girls or just “girls” in general), said I wanted to beat/bash 2 certain “eshays” (if you don’t know what they are please google them for better understanding and you’ll probably have an idea of what they’re like. They are like wannabe thugs and gangsters, chavs, etc). Let’s call these 2 “eshays” Cameron and Joel. People also believe I said I wanted to kill myself. These are just the things I know and there is a pretty good chance that there could be more that I am not aware of. These incidents have happened around 3 months ago but people have still not forgotten. It is an endless cycle of people not caring then caring again. So far I have been called a pedophile, a bitch, been punched, been constantly physically harassed (sprayed with a water gun, had the back of my shoe stepped on, etc), pushed and shoved; trapped and sieged in my school’s bathroom and math block, etc. All-in-all my situation is bad and it never gets any better in the long run. What makes it bad is that for a long time I have had a bad, unlikeable, annoying personality which made many people dislike me from the get go. In Australia we have Primary School (K-6) and High School (7-12). There were many rumours albeit not true circulating about me doing perverse stuff especially in 7th grade, things like looking up girl’s skirts, watching girls change at school camp, etc. These days I never go outside because I always have a fear of being caught by my grade and getting into a brawl like during a previous incident. The problem about this is though not my whole grade bullies me, a significant plurality friendship group (the “Eshays” including their girls) make up over 25% of the Grade (57/~310 people). They will always back up each other in a fight. These days there is not much I can do when the Eshays harass me, they are usually between okay~skinny to muscular, somewhat know generally know how to fight, and are in at least packs of 3 wherever they go. I want to do things with my life like get a job, hangout with friends, etc but can’t because my mom doesn’t have a car and I have to take public transport. The Eshays are a common sight in public.

**Timeline**

On September 1st I started texting this guy, let’s call him Lachlan. Around 2 or 3 months ago before that me and a girl fell out (we were friends) mainly due to my behaviour. After some back and forth talk he offers to send messages to her. I take it a step further and ask if he can pretend to Isabella that he’s sending the messages and not me. He agrees and I ask him to tell her that I regretted messing up with her. He offers to make it “I regretted fucking up with her” for authenticity. I agree, he sends it. In the meantime I tell him I have a plan to get my high school social life back on track with a plan. I say I need to sort out stuff with Cameron and Joel (I was unaware that sort out meant fight). He then asks why I said I wanted to fuck her, I then realise he made a mistake and said I wanted to fuck her. I then joke “Oh no, now she thinks I want to pump her with 20CC’s of liquid dream killer”. She questions this and I tell Lachlan to fix it and say it was a mistake. He doesn’t reply. As the final message on this day I say you can’t leave me hanging like that. On the 2nd of September he says yes I can, I then proceed to start sending fight threats jokingly but according to his friends he thought I was being legit. On the 3rd he informs his friends who are close with the eshay group which makes up 25% of the grade that I said I wanted to rape and pump Isabella with cum and many other things that I have mentioned before and things I’m unaware of (he said a lot but I don’t know all the rumours). I was then approached by a small group which escalated quickly into a medium-sized crowd which the day ended in my whole grade finding out about me and a fair portion of grades 10 and 8. That evening, I leak the messages to some people to prove my innocence. With limited success it spreads. I faced harassment for around week until my messages reached Cameron (one of the top dog eshays in their group). He then thinks I want to beat/bash him (up). With me trying to lay-low it takes a long time for the eshays to find me. Eventually a crowd of 100-200 people were going around the school searching for me while spreading the news about me on how I said I wanted to “rape a girl”. They find me and it’s bad, I need to be defended by 4 teachers. After that it’s only the eshays are at least physically harassing me. But it ain’t over. Throughout the 2nd-crowd incident until now I’ve been again, constantly harassed. For example a few key incidents are the multiple times I got shoved in the hallways by a specific kid who we’ll call Noah, when I was trapped in my stall by a Head Eshay who we’ll call Tyson, when I got punched on the holidays in public around 2 months ago, etc. It just never stops and always seems to get worse no matter what I do or how low I lay. School will be over in 3 days and then a month and a 1/2 vacation will insue.

**Plans and Goals**

In my situation I don’t care about social reputation anymore, it’s beyond repair I just don’t want to be bullied anymore. But it still hurts to see everyone dislike me, it’s worse than before this incident. I sit alone or with a loser in most classes (the losers are chill though, I like em’). My Mom emailed a report/list I created to the principal with people I do not want in a class with next year and she said she’ll try her best. The list totalled to 57 people out of approximately 310 people. I also asked the Deputy Principal if I could have any potential end-of-year awards handed in private instead of going up stage infront of the school. I just want to be a low-key kid in the background for a year or two and then I’ll try fixing my reputation. But I don’t know how to do it because everyone keeps shining attention at me by either calling me out for being a pedophile or a bitch, etc or bully me. I plan to stay away from the Eshays during recess and lunch but they are spread out everywhere making it difficult to find a place to hangout. Other than that, I plan next year (10th Grade) I’ll focus on studies and get good grades and stuff.

**Mental Health**

When people bully me there is nothing I can do because they have a massive group to back them up and they are usually aggressive, sporty, athletic, and muscular. For example, today (Friday) I was called a pedophile and a bitch by a guy we’ll call “Riley” in the office and that Tyson guy flipped the middle finger at me when I was walking into the office. Thankfully it wasn’t that bad today but days are sometimes better or worse. But it usually follows a pattern where things get and feel better overall and then it gets worse and the bullying gets worse and then it gets better and repeat. What hurts the most for me is how everyone in my grade are starting to become friends with everyone and each other while I’m practically a social outcast. I can’t hangout with the people I want to because the Eshays hangout very close to the areas where the people I want to hangout with hang. I’m the anxious type and even if one person just flips the middle finger at me once I think about it anxiously for the rest of the day. I just want to be accepted to be down to heart honest and I hate being outcasted from pretty much everyone. That Isabella girl used to be kinda close with me and seeing everyone being super nice, friendly, and friends with her kinda hurts, a lot. Makes me feel like even more of an outcast and a hated loser. It’s very easy to tell that everyone dislikes me but no one says it. I can see it in the way EVERYONE looks at me and talks to me. Even though no one says it, I’m always “that guy, that kid”. Even before these series of incidents I was always treated as the weird guy. When the door is locked to the classroom and I have to knock when someone finally opens the door and sees me they sigh loudly and say something like “ugh, it’s *him*”. This isn’t a school thing either, at home my family always thinks of me as that kid. I hate this so much, I just want to be accepted and I know it’s bad. I’m also an attention seeker and I do things for attention to be brought to me (not the incidents, bad boy attention, or bullying attention but little things like talking loud, being a bit of a “rebel” (using phone in class, listening to music), etc. I’ve been kinda stressed from my mental heath knowing everyone hates me and sometimes in class I lose it when I can’t take it anymore. I have these “drunk moments” where pretty much I have zero control and responsibility over my actions and I tend to do and have embarrassing moments. It’s usually from my mouth that gets me in trouble in general but it’s especially the case for my “drunk moments”. I wish I could just be truly chill and be quiet and not care about wanting attention and wanting to be accepted and liked; and wanting to be included with everyone (because everyone are becoming friends). I want to be the chill kid with a couple boys by my side just going through high school being low-key having fun. But unfortunately, I don’t think that will ever be the case ever again.

**Update**

I’m home today but a friend at school are telling me that his entire math class is talking mad smack about me and even sent an audio recording. I used to be such a dumbass and do a lot of stupid and weird things in the past grades that again already made everyone dislike me. That list I made on who I don’t want in my class next year got leaked by a guy I thought I could trust. I was so stupid to trust him and he asked for the names and he recorded me saying all of them. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m planning on reporting the guy who started all this and who was one of the main smack talkers, Lachlan. I swear to myself that I’ll never trust anyone again. I know I’m whining about all this happening to me but I’m pretty sure it was coming my way. After all people thought of me as that kid for a reason. I just don’t know how to fix myself, I don’t know what to do what to think. I just want to be chill and genuinely nice to talk too. I also didn’t mention that my parents have been separated for a while planning a divorce once COVID-19 is over and how I dislike my Dad because he pretty much has all my bad traits but on a worse scale. I’m also kinda poor and these conditions just doesn’t help at all. Leaving a hardship of school just to come home and deal with the stress of home. I would really appreciate a comment with a strategy to deal with school and these “Eshays”, and how to fix my character and become a better person.",14Dec2020,1

24,"My younger cousin (21M) and I (26F) are very very close. I don’t think I have a childhood memory without him or his elder brother (23M) in it. I moved to another country about 4 years ago and we’ve been in constant touch through out the four years. 

Earlier this year their father passed away and it’s been a huge loss in our family. My uncle was such a bright man and his loss is so unbearable for us. I can’t even imagine what their going through because I’ve not been able to fly back home due to corona. I started talking to him a couple of days a week and helping him through all of this. He barely mentions his father anymore and whenever I do he goes really quiet. So I just talk to him about anything he’s comfortable with. I heard that he’s been acting out at home with yelling and acting stand offish with his family. I genuinely think I’m one of the very few people that he thinks is a safe space.

I’m really bad at figuring out if someone’s drunk or high, especially through the phone. My cousin admitted that he’s been experimenting with alcohol and weed but today he was really off on the call and I knew something was not right. 

I’m not really familiar with drugs and he said something along the lines of using something called Ambien. He admitted that he’s been doing this and other drugs on and off. He kept repeating that he’s not addicted and he can get off it anytime he wants to. He told me that his drug dealer got caught and he longer has access to drugs and he’s just finishing up his stash. I know in my heart that all that was a load of crap. 

I’m incredibly worried about him. I told him that I would tell his mother but he said she’s already depressed because of her husband passing away, that this news would just devastate her further. I agree with him because she’s been having a very hard time coping with the loss. I don’t think he’s addicted yet but he’s definitely on the path. I don’t know what to do or who to call. Does anyone have any advise on what I can do to get him off drugs? Is there any intervention I can do? Should I send him to rehab? I’m not above talking to his mom about this but I want to know if there is any other way.",14Dec2020,1

heard people say it’s a glitch from the big recent update yet this problem has been happening way before the huge recent update.. it’s fishy almost right? i don’t understand and it’s making me crazy, i tested it out to see if it was happening to my other friends, nope there snap scores are fine, and they have no answers to my problem, i deleted snap and added it back, still the same problem, any answers?",14Dec2020,1

I’m in my 30’s now and my family still doesn’t know I don’t believe in god. It would kill my grandparents and only as an adult have I had a good relationship with my mom. We just weren’t very close when I was growing up. It has been my excuse to not rock the boat so I never told my parents my beliefs. I’m agnostic and I’m afraid of my family’s response.

31,"My Dad lives 180 miles away, and I (23M) miss him a lot. He lives alone, but has a lot of friends and enjoys an active life. He’s a dialysis patient, has been for 5 years as he has kidney failure from an inherited kidney disease, Polycystic Kidney Disease, passed down from his Mum. 
My Dad raised me after my Mum abused me for most of my childhood. I still have some trauma but my Dad raised me to be a strong, hardworking person and I am so happy that I have got to spend some of my adulthood with him around, after his kidney failure. 
He’s recently been approved for a kidney transplant and is now on the waiting list for a deceased donor (when someone who was kind enough to be a donor passes away he will maybe receive their kidney- please be an organ donor if you aren’t signed up already as you can change someone like him’s life). 

I am hoping after his transplant he will have a long and happy life, maybe another 15-20 years! He wants to go to California someday, I already took him to Italy but we couldn’t stay long or do as much because of his dialysis. 

What would be some things I can do for him to show him how much I love him and help him to be happy and look even more forward to the future?

but that made it all the more awful when i came home today to my almost year old puppy with.. problems. specifically, it seems she started out with some kind of diarrhea and now she’s got something closer to constipation. 

appetite is fine. behavior is perfectly normal. even energetic. she’s still bouncing around like normal. i had her drink some water and come lay down for awhile. she seems alright.

but when i came home i found dog doo in multiple places and she’s a potty pad trained girl. (and it was in weird places)
now she keeps circling her pads trying to go potty but all that comes out is a bit of liquid. i don’t see any blood at this time. 

overall i just wanted to see if anyone knew if this was something i should be able to hold off on. i’m not sure what she got into, likely some kind of dessert good that my nephew left lying around while gaming. i just got off work and she seems over the worst of it but.. i’m worried.",14Dec2020,1

How we would beg our parents to let us hangout and spend the night. How we used to fuck everywhere and all the crazy sex stuff we would do. He told me he still has my sex toys in his closet hidden. He told me how nice it would be to fuck outside and that’s kind of his thing. He said he’s been hiking lately and it would be nice to have sex on the trail. I asked if he got to do that nowadays and he said he didn’t. That it wasn’t fun with someone who wasn’t down for it. 
I said we probably just fucked a lot cause we were young and horny but he was like no it also was just amazing chemistry. 

We talked about old trips together. Like details about our trips and he said it was so fun to have such a good time with a partner and fill in the gaps we had in each other’s memories. We Swapped pics of places we went to in the past. He earlier had told me that he has been on extended vacation solo and that it is fun but it is so much better to be with someone who actually appreciates the types of trips and that is hard to find. He says it’s better to have a shared experience with someone who really appreciates it. 


I told him I’ve had partners who requested I didn’t sleep naked in bed and he said “what? I would def want you sleeping naked in bed”


He said he misses me and loves hearing my voice and can’t wait to talk again after I am done with a long stretch of working.

52,"Like, i feel like i have to write it down and get some advices.

To start with: There is that one goth girl (lets call her L, 18) in my school that asked me (m, 19) roughly about a month ago wheter she could join us in the free time. Since then, she is a part of our (4 men, 2x16, 1x17 &amp; me) group and sits around with us every day.

She eventually started to write me dms and we even went out to eat smtg after school. She also told me that she has a boyfriend, but her relationship is worthless and she hasnt even seen him in months.

Even after we went into homeschooling, she talked with me in discord while and after classes.

Now i thought: Well, shes cute and all, but she has a boyfriend and is going to friendzone me for sure.

Now yesterday happened: She wanted to smoke some weed with me, since i smoke kinda often. We also invited one of our group (lets call him K,16.), cuz i didnt want her to think im going to flirt with her or smtg.
Then she traveled by train to my hometown, which she had to hide, because her mom is kinda crazy (checking her location via smartphone and shit), and then we went to the dealer. He agreed to smoke a joint with us and im hella glad he did.
He is an old friend of mine so i knew i can trust him, which is going to be important later. 
After only 2 hits, K (which smoked 3 times before) lost consciousness twice (which means he fell to the ground). A second after that L started freaking out. She said she couldnt hear and we stood in the dark in a field which was kinda nasty and wet. She then grabbed my jacket and i took her hand so i could guide her. 
She wanted to leave fast, which is why i left K with my friend and went with her into the light. She then heldt onto my hand, while K and my Friend came around. K btw. felt awesome lol.
We then tried to take the soonest train possible, bcs it was cold and dark and all the 40 minutes (even after she stopped freaking out) it took to the train station she still heldt onto my hand. 
At the train station i threw my jacket around her so she doesnt catch a cold and after we were back in my hometown, we went into my room.

In my room i got a couch (one of thos expandable ones) and a mattress. I then suggested that L could have the mattress so she doesnt feel weird, but K said he wanted it. And well, since she and i were fine with it, we shared a bed and because i have a TV in my room, she moved her pillow to my side and we laid there watching movies till 4 am while K went sleeping. She then fell asleep next to me. 

Today morning, she and i went up at the same time and watched some YouTube videos on her smartphone, before i brought them to the train station and made sure, they caught their train in time.

And now im hella confused. Although it might not sound like it the way i wrote it down, i feel like she might be interested in a relationship, but i could also be overthinking shit, which is why i ask for your advice. 

She now also thinks that it was a nice night and she wants to repeat it, when we have a better setting. 

So what do you think, dear Redditors, how i should go on after this situation?",14Dec2020,1
53,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this, but as the title states I’m really lonely. 
I know a lot of people have felt this way due to the pandemic, but I have felt and lived this way for years. You can say I’m the lonely hipster. (Sorry that didn’t make sense.) 
It all started when I went to grad school and I moved back home to the suburbs, where there is nothing to do. I finished my studies, got a meaningless job, got depression and now I feel stuck. I don’t really have anyone to talk to. I can’t really go anywhere. I try to make online friends, but it’s not the same as having irl friends. Plus, the online relationships don’t last.

55,"Hey everyone. I’m in my first year of college and looking to become more adventurous and have some fun. I’m 18, and I’ve mostly been confined to my home for most of my life, but the sugar baby lifestyle seems appealing to me atm. College is online so I’m bored out of my mind, and I finally have a chance to rebel. I know that this lifestyle is not always super glamorous, but I’m willing to give it a shot.

Here’s one problem. I’m a virgin, but I’m willing to let a sugar daddy take my virginity. It’s just something I know that I want to do. Is becoming a sugar baby for the first time while still a virgin a problem? Let me know what you think.",14Dec2020,1
56,"I've posted about this earlier and got great advice, the girl who I was talking to was troubled/depressed and suffered the whole 9 yards. I was concerned because I wanted to help but I also genuinely liked her, I didn't know where to go or how to help. I was fairly convinced she liked me as well, she seemed to trust me more then a lot of people and cheered up while talking to me. About a month ago I noticed that there would be periods of time where she would shut herself off from everyone. I used the advice and told her I'd be there for her but didn't force anything. Shit would clear up but I grew a bit weary. Around a week ago she told me she didn't see it working out, ever. I've been facing a problem and that is I don't know what to do. We both weren't prepared for a relationship but it just seems like friendship fell out of contention as well. If you were in my situation what would you do. I personally narrowed it down to just turn around and look somewhere else or just wait and work until you both are older and more prepared. I didn't know feelings could fall so fast and it makes me suspect that it wasn't us not working rather it was her state of mind. I really hope this doesn't sound creepy above all else, I don't want to be one of those guys just being a creep and going after this girl like my life depends on it, and if that's the vibe this gives off please tell me. I just want to know in general if faced in a situation like this do you turn around, keep going or something else that I haven't mentioned.",14Dec2020,1

58,"Cross-posting this from another board where this didn’t get any traction. I have had a beard pretty much my entire adult life. Even when I was a boy/adolescent and didn’t yet have one, I knew that I wanted one. I have been going through the hiring process for a police department, and will be starting the academy soon. This department has a no facial hair policy, so I’ve recently shaved the beard that I’ve always had. 

Whether it’s a good thing or bad, I have always placed a lot of value on my looks, and I feel like my beard has always been one of my strongest features. I have always gotten compliments on it, and women loved it. I would be lying if I said that I didn’t enjoy the attention I have received from women based on my looks (I hope this doesn’t come across as bragging. I’d just like to provide what my experience has been for context). For the past ten years, everyone I know has only known with a beard. 

Ever since I’ve shaved it clean off, I haven’t felt the same. My confidence has taken a hit, as I absolutely do not like how my face looks without it. My jawline is not as sharp as it was with the beard, and I feel ugly as sin. Unfortunately, this will not be a “wait and grow it back out” situation as I will have to shave my face from now on due to the job. I understand part of the price to pay for my chosen career is this, and I’m not trying to skirt around that, I’d just like to see if anyone could offer some advice as to how to reframe my mindset so I don’t mind it as much anymore. I’m having trouble moving past my new look. Have any of you ever had a similar experience? Do you get used to it? How can I feel confident again if I don’t look good?

62,"I was the reason behind the breakup I let my OCD, dishonesty, trust, and jealousy ruin our relationship and LDR(nevermets). I proposed not to talk in sixty days so I can change my ways through therapy and listening to podcasts. She said she will never get into a relationship like we had ever again and she even told me that I'll contact her within those sixty days because she doesn't believe I'll change, she is also free to do what she wants

Anyways, I feel like this is all for nothing. If I push through those sixty days of no contact, she'll just tell me she moved-on and that she doesn't feel the sameway anymore.

I also saw her spotify account and she has been listening to happy music which makes me think she met someone new.
However, I get this gut feeling that she will come back because I'll change for the better. Especially with therapy helping me. 

Now, I'm faced with a couple of choices:

**Go apeshit, close the spotify account I gave her(where she saved a lot of songs), unfollow her on social media, and never contact her again**

**Hold onto sixty days and hope for the best**

63,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place for my problem but figured I'd give it a go. Sorry if my english isn't great.
Last february I started a working a new job. The boss was a really nice guy, the coworkers were cool and everything was going well. Two months later, my coworkers suddenly disappear and get replaced with new ones. Boss said they quit and although it bothered me, I believed him and kept on like before. A month after that, the boss fired another coworker and then decided to give said persons work assignents to me instead of hiring someone new. I was okay with that, because with covid around, I really needed the extra money we agreed on. Everything was going good until my payments started coming in late. First month it was a day late, next 3, the month after that a week etc etc. I talked to the boss about this and he just said he had a lot to do. This gave me a bad vibe so I started sending CV's out, looking for another job. Now last november, I get a call when driving to work that I don't have to come to work and I'm fired because he found out I'm looking for another job. How he found this out I have no idea but whatever. In the country i'm in you're not allowed to fire someone on the spot and you need to give them two weeks notice so I told him that but he shrugged me off and told me we'd meet up so he could give me documents and my last paycheck + money he needed to pay for firing me and money for a phone he had bought from me (got gifted a new one for my b-day and he wanted to buy my old one) We met up, I got the papers only find out that the extra work I had been doing had not been registered by him, so I had been working those illegally and therefor he'd pay me less money. I agreed on that however, being desperate for money because he hadn't paid me my last paycheck and I really needed to pay rent. Before parting ways he showed me a screenshot of the payment he had done to my bank and told me I'd have the money the next day. Next day comes, no money. I call him, he tells me wait for the next week because his bank ""is slow"" and after waiting..still no money. After calling him for a week he told me that something had gone wrong with the payment and wanted to meet me again. We met again a week later and the same happened, he showed me a screenshot of a payment he had made to my bank and same happened again.. I waited two weeks and nothing. More phonecalls, more excuses about the bank being slow, something had gone wrong blah blah blah. Third time, had to call him 5 or 6 times, he tells me he will make the payment and if something goes wrong, he'll give me the money in cash. I was upset with him and told him off that he needs to pay me the money and that what he's doing feels intentional but he called me crazy and that I'm impatient and he's working a lot and doesn't have the time but will contact me when he does... anyway, two weeks later and here I am, no money in my bankaccount, I'm getting kicked out of my appartment. I feel so stupid and naive. I want to report him but after doing some research, I need a lawyer to do so and I don't have the money for that.. What can I do to make him pay me?

We have been casually chatting since then but he has not mentioned a second date. He starts conversations, sends me music etc, so I am pretty confused.  I want to see him again but don’t want to push for it... I think if he was more interested in me, he would try to make some more tangible plans.

Hello everyone. I’m in need of advice. I’m on mobile &amp; english is not my mother tongue, so apologize if any mistake. 



The last five years, I have been working for a friend creating lesson plans for teachers. The first year, I did half she did half. The second year until this year I did all. The first year I got 10% commision, now working up to 40% commision after I asked to get 50-50 as I have been doing all the work, yet she get the credit. 


This year, I tried to be proactive and send her 1/10 of my work, just copy and paste which I gave her 6 months ago to complete. We should sell the lesson plan at 12-12. She didn’t complete any of it until last week(7-12) and then she got warded from burn. This has been an issue since day one. Each time her turn to do work, she’ll get sick, her family members get sick, her laptop freeze off, she forgot to save it. 

As a friend, I am sympathize for her conditions right now. As a worker/partner, I am livid. I have to do all her work in 2 weeks time and the sale is already on. I have to apologizes to those who bought from us. 

I’m thinking of walking away and started on my own but I feel like stabbing her in the back. But all the work is all mine and she took credit for it and got 60% by doing nothing. I already started doing my thing, and already told her next year she need to pull her weight( customer and sending emails) as I’m going to take a long off tp focus on my new project.

My parents and I came to Switzerland when I turned 7, through primary school I have been bullied and never been accepted by literally any person in that school, not even the teachers. 

Then junior high came and although it got a bit better because I was to some extent accepted into the group, but there was a lot of backstabbing going on, so in retrospect not really better. 

Now I am in my second year of high school, since last march, when we went on lockdown because of covid, my social life has been paused completely.

You cannot talk about feelings, the only 2 answers you ever get is either: ""man up"" or ""stop being such a bitch"". I really can't take this testosterone fueled who's the alpha male bullshit anymore.

89,"I apologize for the formatting, as I’m on mobile.

I (F18) recently broke up with my girlfriend (F20) after learning that she was unsure if she could mentally handle a relationship. While we have only been together for five months, we both struggle with mental health issues that cause us to not have proper emotional regulation. I grew incredibly attached after a short amount of time, and we were so eager to say that we were in love that we rushed through a lot of our time together. We did normal relationship stuff for the beginning of it, but it quickly turned into something less-than-ideal with tons of arguments and hurt feelings. During one particularly intense phone call, I let myself get too upset and decided to end the relationship “for both of our sakes”. I was absolutely devastated by this and let myself get incredibly depressed. I found myself texting her and apologizing for breaking up with her after realizing I didn’t actually want to separate, but rather wanted to get out of the argument. I told her that if she wanted to take some time apart to separate ourselves again and work on ourselves, I would be waiting for her.

However, now I’m not so sure I would. I recently re-activated a dating profile that I hadn’t used since we first started to talk just to take my mind off of her. I still have all of my really intense emotions for her, but have accepted that we probably aren’t going to get back together. She seems to be okay with that. However, I have heard from some of our mutual friends that she might be absolutely devastated by this, and that I should wait around a bit longer to see if it fixes itself.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I absolutely love and adore any time I get to spend with her, but I am worried to get back with her after seeing how I react to something as small as an argument over the phone.

91,"My (19M) girlfriend's (18F) stepdad constantly goes out drinking when her mom isn't home, drives home drunk and starts yelling at her. It doesn't matter if I'm there or not, he just starts yelling for no reason at all. He has never yelled at me, but I really do not like how he talks to her or her mom when he gets drunk, he just starts talking about stupid shit like who changed the channel or whatever. It has been going on for years, starting way before we were even dating, which was around July. I told her I wanted to say something to him, but she told me not to because he doesn't want him to get mad at her. He also owns the house they live in, which makes it kind of difficult as just a visitor because he could easily keep me from seeing her, but I don't want to have to leave her there with him on the weekdays when I'm away at school.

Well I followed her and about a day later she followed me back. But she hasn’t said anything. Only posted a pic of her outfit on her story nothing else.

As her protective older sister, I’ve always been in denial about it. A year or so ago, a handful of people close to both her and I pulled me aside and talked to me about it. 

Even after they talked to me, I denied it, and told myself that it was just a part of her personality. However, I recently moved away from home, and now that I’ve had some time not living directly with her, I’m beginning to feel more and more like she may have some underlying mental illness. 

For the past 3 or so years, she’s struggled with depression and anxiety, but I feel like those may be symptoms of something larger at play. I tried talking to my mother about it, but she’s in denial and thinks that the way she acts are just personality quirks. 

I’m not exactly sure what to do. I want my sister to get the help and support she needs if she truly is mentally ill, but I’m not sure if it’s my place to talk about it more with my mom. Any advice?

I’ve had heaps of romantic partners, friends and close friends but I could never say that my love for these people actually consumed me, more of a ‘you’re my friend so I have to love you’ sort of thing, which sounds psychopathic but trust me when I say I’m not one. One of my brothers best friends and I have become inseparable, smoking weed, telling each other about our trauma, secrets and I can say I’ve never opened up to anyone in my life like I have this individual. I love him so much that I physically feel the distance when we’re not together, when he’s at my house I hate when he has to leave, I just want to touch and be on him in the most non sexual ways possible. I’ve never had to deal with these feelings and it’s making me a wreck. He told me afew months back that he had a crush on me (we would never do anything for fear of my brother) but I didn’t like him at that time so I sort of brushed it off. I don’t even know what I’m typing except to express how annoying and painful it is to love someone when I’ve never felt this before. What do you people do that are in love all the time? I’ve never wanted to hug someone before but when I see him I physically yearn and I hate it. I just need to type something out admitting this for closure I think. When I hear him talk I actually want to cry. I have never felt love, if this is what love feels like. I know I care for people around me but I don’t know this feeling and it’s tormenting me, I think about him while I work, if I buy clothes I think about him seeing me in them, if I do something I’m proud of I only want him to see it. I don’t know how much longer it’s going to last but I want it to stop.just getting something off my chest

The worst thing about all of this is I don’t know why I would ever love him. He’s a short guy that talks a lot of shit, is super emotional especially for a guy, is the biggest shit stirrer and gets into a lot of fights because he’s such a smartass, he eats like a dog, makes gross noises and simply is everything any chick wouldn’t want. I’m 5”7, in the most humble ways possible I am beautiful, I don’t mean that in any other way then being factual because of what people are like around me.

I'm young, like pretty young. I realize this can sound like I'm a 10 year old crying about how I'm mentally 35 but I'd like to take it more seriously then that... When I make friends with people under 16, or my age, (I'm a minor, under 16), I feel weird. Most of the time the friendship will start off well, then I will distance myself after a month of it because of this overwhelming feeling that I'm a predator. I feel like a 24 year old making friends with a 14 year old, but I'm not 24. I'm their age, if not, I'm a couple months younger. It's difficult for me to be impolite or to speak to people my age outside of school or personally like in texts. I treat my relationships with people under 16, I'm 14 btw, like I'm an adult to a child. I hate it. It's not a conscious thing I do. I've tried consciously fighting off the intrusive thoughts that tell me I'm a predator and I'll be arrested or charged by the police if people found out about my friendships with minors, but it makes me so uncomfortable it results in ghosting them completely.

I always got told that she liked me by her friends but she never told me if that was true or not again probably for the best as it would have been a bad time also a lot can change in 5 years. I would even go as far to say we were friends we got on well but sometimes we would act like we hated each other (playing hard to get or whatever, atleast I was bc I was a stupid kid lol) but we still got on well.

6 years later we both go to different schools and this girl is even more beautiful. We both follow each other on Instagram we've liked each others posts and all but we've never actually talked.

I think her attitude is a public health concern. She is a nurse and needs to follow medical science in order to do her job. If a child in her school comes to her with COVID symptoms, she needs to take appropriate action and not just send the kid back to class, because she thinks ""COVID is just a cold.""

So I need advice. Should I contact her employer and inform them of my concerns? Or am I overstepping? She works in a conservative small town so her employer may actually agree with her, but I feel that I need to say something.

So do I report her or just consider it none of by business?",14Dec2020,1
128,"So this girl [20F] and I [21M] have been platonic friends for a long time. I even went to prom with her but I wasn’t interested in her romantically at the time. Over the last month I’ve thought about it more and more and realized that I think we’d be great together and I’m attracted to her. I’d like to let her know and see how she feels but my biggest fear is ruining the friendship.

So I have a few options I’m thinking about going for. 1. Asking her cousin (my best friend for 8 years) what he thinks about it) 2. Asking her older sister what she thinks about it (I’m pretty close with her too) or 3. Telling her directly how I feel about her.

I’m trying to not put any pressure on her and if she doesn’t feel the same that’s totally fine, but you only get one life and I just want to know.

Any advice on how to move forward from here would be greatly appreciated!",14Dec2020,1
129,"I've just pulled myself out of a four year destructive episode. During that time I stopped taking care of myself emotionally, mentally, and physically, destroyed every friendship I've ever made, gained almost 100 pounds, and developed such severe agoraphobia that I wasn't able to leave my house for months at a time. Throughout this time I  wanted to get better but didn't know how, so I kept signing up for community college classes and then not going because I didn't want to do the work or couldn't leave the house. After a few years of that my GPA is 1.53. I can't see myself getting accepted into any school to finish my degree and I don't even know if I should bother trying anymore. I don't know if I can not bother because now I can't get any jobs because of the large gaps in my resume.

All of this is completely my fault and I really wish I could go back and give myself the help I needed instead of being depressed and doing anything I could to wreck my future so I didn't have a reason to keep going. I finally found help and have worked through a lot of my issues, and am so much healthier and happier now. I also now have a reason to keep going but I feel like I've dug myself too deep. 

I finally have aspirations in life and I feel like because of my mistakes I will never be able to get there. I feel lonely and ashamed that I have no friends because I wasn't worth helping at my worst, and now lack the social skills to befriend anyone. Most of all I feel so incredibly embarrassed that I let myself do all these things while looking and acting like Jabba the Hut. I don't have the option to give up anymore and I don't know how to move past this.

How do I make something out of my life with no degree? How do I forgive myself? How do I make friends in my mid-20's? I would love any piece of advice to help me get through this.",14Dec2020,1

Some of these people have been my friends for years and one of them, who initiates these calls and stuff, is pretty new to the group. My friends talk to me less and less and to him more and more because of the calls and group chats, etc. Whether or not it should, it really upsets me. My house is often where group hang outs happen but they'll sit and talk without me in my own house. I'm almost 100% sure that they aren't meaning to upset me because most of them have been my friends for a while and been very close ones at that.

I couldn’t do better when I was younger I was too afraid to call cps or tell anyone. I had to make them grow up the same way I did and I hate myself for that. Now I can get them out since I’m older and have more courage to stand up to my parents. 

Yesterday my father crossed the line by hurting both of them badly and making them sleep out in the cold as punishment. He didn’t let them talk to me for days and whenever I try to bring it up that they can leave he retaliates and punishes them even more. 

I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’ve made everything even worse. My brothers are dead set on living a couple more years with them because my parents are the best at guilt tripping. How do I fix this? Would involving the cops make this worse? I don’t want them to get split apart I’ve always heard stories about that which is why I feared calling cps in the first place.

145,"My ex and I broke up in early July, after dating for 3-years, and living together for 2-years.   
I immediately dated someone, the week we broke up, that lasted 1-2 months and ended with very hard feelings.   
I tried OkCupid, where I literally got 100s of likes, dozens of matches (and  the whole thing just made me feel really anxious and overwhelmed). but I met up with one really kind, handsome guy with a great job and who I could have open conversations with. For some reason that scared the hell out of me, and I spontaneously reached out to someone I had strong chemistry with who I met 2 years ago - he lived far away but I went to see him, we spent days together and I fell the hardest I've ever fallen for someone, and by early September I had jumped on board with this person for a committed long-distance relationship. I told all my friends and parents about this person, I was already putting up pictures of the two of us in frames. Then as time played out, he was too busy to prioritize me in his days, he texted me everyday, but our conversations felt shallow to me, 1-2 weeks would go by without a phone call, even when I asked for more calls, and he stopped saying he loved me. So November came around and I asked for a break, so i can focus on myself. 5 weeks go by of us not talking during break and I reach out to him again, and ask if we can try again. He says no, he doesn't see our paths aligning and doesn't want to be on my emotional roller coaster, but he's still down to see me while he's in town. Then I feel sad, I don't want to be just a booty call, and I watch myself re-profess my love for him, that I don't mind bending my path to be with him long term, and I don't want him to slip away. He doesn't really address this, we agree to still see each other since he'll be here in a few days, but I think he senses my deep insecurity issues, and is probably going to reject me again. and I just see myself falling apart.   
And outside of him, other guys just terrify me. Lately I have been approached by men while I'm walking about to the mail box or at the dog park (not even dressed to be alluring) and it throws me so off center. One very good looking guy, looked me dead in the eyes and asked me a question at the dog park the other day, and i was literally speechless, I couldn't even answer, he just ended up walking away. I felt strongly thrown off center, I couldn't even think, it was the strangest feeling, it was actually concerning me and made me anxious. This single life is just weird and strange and I want this one person who I may see in a few days, but I am like fumbling the ball on this guy. 

Any tips for dealing with any of this??? I am already running everyday, I am eating well, I started seeing a therapist, I am generally taking good care of myself. But I just still feel out of my mind, what the heck do I do with all this fear/insecurity around men I am at a loss.",14Dec2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

lately my sister ""Quinn"" (16F)  hasn't gotten along with our parents very well. Sometimes it seems like every other day she is yelling at them and while some days I agree with her other times I really don't and that causes me to start acting apathetic.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Our parents aren't the best people my mom drinks quite a bit  and  most of the problems I agree with her on is when she starts yelling at us for little to no reason late at night someday. On top of that our dad can be pretty passive aggressive and both can be overprotective  sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is Quinn  loves telling me about the issues she has with them but usually while yelling a lot of the time involving tears and to be honest I find this very stressful to deal with and lately this has happened a few times a week where she'd be yelling at me about her issues and I start getting apathetic and eventually start yelling at her for talking to me about her problem when I've always told her she can tell me everything but deep down I feel like that's not the case anymore because of how I act when she starts doing this

162,"  Hey there guys, sorry for the length of this post, I tried to edit it down a bit. So I’m a 20 f and my boyfriend is a 23, last night we had a discussion that I brought up about sexuality and gender. I wasn’t expecting much from this conversation but I got a lot out of it, and I’m now feeling some what of a moral upset?
 

  I identify with she/they pronouns and am mostly only attracted to woman or feminine presenting figures. My boyfriend is a cis-gender heterosexual male and is an incredible partner, we’ve been together nearly two years. During this conversation, was the first time he realized/had heard aloud I identified more as non-binary. My boyfriend is a very kind country/mountain folk man, so I always understand when we talk about the lgbt and gender disconforming community it’s a subject he doesn’t fully understand but accepts and supports.


   I started the conversation by asking if he has ever questioned his gender or sexuality, and he said yes and has watched some male porn and it just wasn’t for him but he’s never questioned his gender at all. Which I mean good for him of course haha. But then he asked where my preference is and I answered honestly and said woman. He has known since we started seeing each other as he said, “I knew what I signed up for when we began dating and that your sexuality wasn’t something I was used to.” After I think he was trying to get me to push to say why I brought it up. So when I said nothing further he then told me that he had admittedly had a hard time at points with us dating due to the fact I’m not overwhelmingly attracted to male genitalia. Also that it makes him feel as though I am not attracted to him at times. Which kind of takes a stab at his confidence on occasion.


  He told me he is not comfortable with my friends because majority of my friends and I have kissed and he feels that the majority of them have lusty acts towards me and that they tend to make sure to bring up sexually charged stories about them and I in his presence. Which I didn’t know before that he had felt challenged by those moments, I am quick to shut people down when they disrespect my partner with sexual stories and always feel it’s pushed passed after it’s shut down. I’ve never really even asked him how he felt about those situations which seems bizarre now. 


  My boyfriend said that he didn’t want me to feel like settling. To not choose comfort over happiness, and that no matter what he loves me and understands. He went on to tell me that if I ever felt I wasn’t living my truth that he would understand because he loves me and only wants absolute comfort and love for me. Because of this comment I assured him this wasn’t me opening a conversation of breaking up. Which he thanked me for telling him after. That I was sorry for my lack of emotional intelligence. He is so kind and wonderful but admittedly there’s been times I’ve really felt that I’m in a romantic friendship. When those times come, they are long. 


  After all this talk he told me to think about everything because if it’s something we are talking about, it could be a more significant thought than I had previously thought. Then asked me if I thought I’d miss men if I ever had the chance to date woman again, he found my answer very telling as I hesitated for a long moment then said, “I would miss you and I having intimate moments.”


  So to the point of all this back story now, this entire talk made me pose the question to myself; is it right to continue a relationship where my partner may not be fully satisfied, but is comfortable? Or am I overthinking and ruining things because of that now?


Nothing in me wants to discontinue this relationship, but I’d end it if it meant he didn’t settle on comfort over happiness.

163,"I shall elaborate now. I live with my mom, grandma and brother.

My mom is very busy (she is a surgeon) and she goes to work all day before coming home and spending all of her time with my brother. My brother is my twin and it’s so unfair that I get no attention. I know that life isn’t fair, but this is excessive. My mom doesn’t even know basic things about me like my favorite color. She promised she would watch a movie with me today and then went with my brother to hike without inviting me. She doesn’t do anything horrible, especially compared to my grandma, but it’s definitely not okay.

My grandma though, is terrible. She will project negativity and anger at me for nothing. If I drop something she will sigh loudly at me. Like a sigh in a bad way, not relaxed. If I don’t put a water cup in the dishwasher because the screen said that it’s clean, she will yell saying that I’m trying to make everything so difficult and I’m so lazy and “back in my day....”
Also, she doesn’t care about my interests, activities, hobbies, at all. If I made her a house by the beach decorated with seashells in Minecraft (I did that because she loves the beach and the ocean in real life) she will tell me she doesn’t care about Minecraft and why do I try to tel her things that I know she doesn’t care about. This is true for all of my hobbies. She doesn’t even talk to me except to yell and scream. She is also convinced the old way of parenting was the best. E.g. hitting children, commanding respect via fear. So of course, she constantly threatens to slap me. If I have so much as a single molecule of being sad or angry on my face, she tells me to wipe it off before she smacks it off. If I’m even the slightest bit rude, it doesn’t matter why, she will take my phone when that’s not even related to the situation. She’s also a hypocrite but that’s a whole other story. She doesn’t care that I have feelings or emotions, and she doesn’t let me express them. She treats me like I’m not a person.

My brother does anything he can to annoy me, like pull my hair, embarrass me in public, literally anything. My grandma does nothing about it except tell me to grow up and stop complaining or I’m too sensitive. Once she told me that if he pulls my hair I should just turn around and pull his hair back. So when I tried that, my brother punched me in the arm three times and my grandma yelled at me for pulling his hair and “instigating him” meanwhile not caring that he hit me in the arm and it hurt a lot.

I can’t stay here but I don’t know what to do. If I could live with my friend that would be the best thing to ever happen to me but I don’t know how I could actually have that happen. 

Help please I don’t know how to escape this living hell",14Dec2020,1
164,"It's 2 weeks in. I'm currently an intern at a financial services company, and I want to quit.

I've thought about this long and hard, and I'm still indecisive as to what I should do.

The reason why I'm deciding about quitting is because the internship was not what I expected and I constantly feel stressed out and anxious about it. I dread going to work, and whenever I'm there, I look at the clock to see when my shift will be over.

At my internship, I'm basically cold calling local businesses and generating leads for the next businesses I try to target. Then, I'm advised to schedule appointments with potential clients before/after work hours to initiate/follow-up on a conversation about the services that I pitching to them. *I was told to do this on my 3rd day there.* Most of my stress comes from figuring out how I am going to meet with clients around my current schedule in addition to this internship. My stress increased again when I heard from other interns going out of their way (out of state) to pitch to potential clients. I don't even know how the heck I am supposed to meet with potential clients locally let alone out of state. Furthermore, the idea of having to go to businesses in person to pitch and before/after work hours unsettles me. When I asked my manager about whether I would have to pitch out of state or far from where I live(2hr+), she gave a vague answer and said that the company could schedule time for me and another employee to pitch out of state.

I had spent many months looking for an internship, and when I finally got an offer from for this one, I felt ecstatic. I didn't have internship experience, so I was trying to be as open as possible when I was applying to internships. I felt like I needed a foundation to grow my work experience from so I decided to take on this position. I am appreciative for the opportunity given to me, but I'm not sure if I should continue on with the internship.

I'm working tomorrow so I will be talking to my manager about this when I arrive.

**tldr:** I'm a current college student studying computer science and I want to quit this sales internship that I started 2 weeks ago. The internship is 6-months long.",14Dec2020,1
165,"Hi! I am a fifteen year old turning sixteen in a few days. I’d like to know how I can get my mother (and step father) to let me have a device in my room at night. 

I am the best kid I don’t do drugs or drink, I have good grades, I’m polite, I have never had a boyfriend, My mom checks all my messages, I don’t swear etc. Despite all of that, she still takes my phone away at 8pm every night. 

All my friends only text after 9pm so I never get to talk with them, I never get to watch movies or comfort my friends if they are very upset about something which leads into them thinking I don’t care about them and me not being invited to this. 

I’m so frustrated with this because all of my other friends and everyone I know doesn’t get their phone taken away everyday. I have asked her to please just let me have my iPad or laptop in my room at night but she won’t do it. 

She hides all of my devices and chooses when I get to use it and for how long. 

She takes away my devices before I do my chores and won’t give them back to me until she checks that my chores are done the way she wants them done. 

I am so sick of it, she didn’t even buy my laptop, iPad or iPod my real father did and she still takes them and hides them. 

Her excuses for them not being allowed in my room is that it will disturb my sleep pattern, and I’ll be texting my friends at night?? 

Please give me tips on how to keep my stuff in my room.

168,"I'm a 17m and have been talking to this girl for a couple months now and I really started to like her. She had her issues, she talked about all sorts of trauma or depression and such, this progressed to me helping her a really wanting to do anything I could for her. We ended up getting pretty flirty, her wishing she could be with me (can't cause of covid and a couple hour drive) and showing very obvious signs of her liking me. Then it came to my birthday, she sent me this big paragraph about how she was so thankful I was in her life and how I made her so happy, so the day after my birthday I basically ended up confessing and asking how she felt as well. She responded with something along the lines of:
""I really like you too, although I'm not ready for a relationship""
She continued on to explain about mental health, which I completely accepted and understood however we continued to talk. Before this however is when I started to notice she had became a little more distant and after she only got worse. She was still quite flirty, sending posts about this and that saying she wanted to cuddle or kiss and all of a sudden it just stopped. Replies ran dry, one word answers, 1-6 hours between responses, for every message, and an outright refusal to speak to me about anything that's getting her down (which really hurt to hear).  This had happened pretty soon after me, her and her friend (that she thought of as a brother) played a game together. When we had all got into a group call together she was essentially ignoring me and I was heavily third wheeling, it's understandable but still felt uncomfortable. So now after all this it's like she doesn't care about me at all. She even ignored my request to play a game together then went and played with someone else.
I guess I'm asking advice on what should I do?
For anyone wondering, I'd like to fix things if at all possible. And it does feel somewhat obvious that she's trying to push me away however I'm just wondering what changed from ""waking up to talk to you is the highlight of my day"" to nothing in the span of just over a week",14Dec2020,1

That there really isn’t that much that I have to do. That it will only get worse as I get older. That stress is part of life and I need to grow up and get over it. 

I’m in both in person high school classes as well as an online college class. I am doing okay in my high school classes, but I failed my college class. (end of semester, too late now) They ask me why I can do my high school work but not my college stuff. I tried to explain that I have a limited amount of energy each day, and sometimes I have more and sometimes less, and I use it to wake up, take care of my dog, get to school, do my work there, get home, do chores, etc. if I have the motivation I’ll even try to do my laundry or shower. But sometimes I just can’t seem to get up.

Honestly, if I had answers to why I am like this I would tell them, but most of the time I just don’t know. I have a decent life. We are middle class, I have a phone, and clothes, and 3 meals a day. I have a large family, a few friends, pets. Yet I am still like this. 

I don’t know how to explain this. They say don’t play the victim, that I need to own up to my own fault in failing this class. I replied that I am well aware it is my own fault, and that I blame myself for that, no one else. I didn’t say this to them, but how is that playing the victim? 

I don’t want any replies that just say, “Yah, your parents are crappy, everything will be better once you get away.” Because that isn’t helpful. And everything won’t be magically better.

178,"I only have my friend group as my companions. We’ve known each other since primary school, and before COVID, we spent every day, every after school activity, every weekend, and every holiday with each other. Even now during the pandemic, we text each other constantly. I leave my phone for about an hour and I have 200+ texts from them. We’ve never really branched out and honestly only have each other (besides family).

Here’s the thing. We prioritize the group over the individuals. It doesn’t matter if we don’t have other friends because we have each other. We shouldn’t do any activity without at least one other member of the friend group. We shouldn’t keep secrets from each other. We can’t get into conflicts even if we’re upset at one or more members of the group. We follow each other everywhere, including our school choices and the bathroom. Most importantly, we can’t break the system. Things have been how they always have and that won’t change. Mental health isn’t discussed the group because it disturbs the dynamic. My role in the group is the funny one with smarts and that means I always have to crack jokes, laugh a little louder than they do, never take things seriously, yet still do well in anything academic. I felt an immense pressure to keep the act up because I wanted to stay in the group. Whether that meant pulling all nighters studying to do well in an exam and playing it off the next morning, or telling jokes right after a panic attack in the bathroom. They’re all I had, after all.

But I want to change. I’m an awkward loser with a personality of a wet cardboard and social anxiety. I don’t know who I am or what I like because I’ve only been doing what the group does or what the group wants me to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so this is a really long post but I'll do a TLDR at the bottom. Although I recommend reading to get full context of my issue. I'm They/Them pronouns. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a friend who I've known since High school. I think I've now known them for 10 years or so? I'll call them Kat. (Fake name). Kat has always had significant mental health and physical issues that effects their life. It's a regular occurance that they'll go to the hospital due to trying to kill themself. It happens so often that it doesn't surprise me anymore and I don't get upset about it. A month or so ago, they had to move out of their mothers house (I think this is the 4th time.) due to their step father harming them. They moved into another family members house. 

I've tried to be as supportive as I can throughout this whole scenario. Meeting up for lunches and letting them vent, bringing them food when I can afford it, inviting them over for dinner, etc. Things were tough but they were okay. But last week the s\*\*t hit the ceiling and I'm about to go no contact for a few weeks. 

Kat is extremely allergic to Strawberries and Mangoes and their family member they are staying with, does not understand cross contamination. He brought Mangoes into the house and left them on the bench. That night I had planned for Kat and another friend to come over for dinner. Kat messaged me in the morning and asked me to rescue them from the shops nearby. I left the house and picked them up. I forgot to take my important medication because my morning routine was interrupted. I have bad memory issues and get very easily distracted. I picked up Kat and came home and had them over for dinner. Half way through dinner in front of my partner and friend, Kat discussed how they couldn't live with that family memeber any more and asked me if they could stay the night. I don't like being asked things short notice because... I can't say no. I feel pressured and stressed when people ask me things short notice. I said yes. Partner said ""Only one night.""That night, they were up laughing and making noise very last into the night. They even PM'd me at 1am asking if they could come into my room to hang out, I was already in bed. I didn't realize until it was too late that I hadn't taken my meds and I was in a LOT of physical pain. I take my meds in the morning, I took them late at night. 

The next morning, without warning, I was asked to take Kat to an appointment. I drove Kat to the mall so they could get to the doctors appointment. I checked in with them ""Do you have a way back to the house?"" (Her family member's) ""Do you have someone to pick you up from there?"" ""Are you good?"" They told me that they had plans and did not need me again. Myself, my partner and my sibling all went to collect our groceries, it was super busy and we got tired very quickly. When I got home, I sat at my computer and saw a message from Kat ""Are you home?"". I asked why and they said that ""I am too physically sore to catch the bus back, can you please pick me up? I have no one else to ask."" Once again.. I couldn't say no. I got up and drove to the mall and picked them up. I started driving them back to their family member's and when we were just AROUND THE CORNER, they said ""I am scared he will yell at me and use passive aggression. I can't deal with passive aggression, i'll shut down and not be able to pack my things. I don't want to tell him I'm moving out on my own. Can you stay with me and talk to him with me? I give you full permission to yell at him if he gets mad. I've never given anyone permission like that before."" 

I was put on the spot. I couldn't say no. By the way... I am like... Super nice. I hate yelling and I hate violence. I get so stressed I get chest pains. I am in no way the person to ask to ""support someone in a dangerous situation."" I'm weak, I'm frail and currently going through neurological issues that are leading me to believe I might have a tumor on my brain. I'm going through a LOT right now. I say yes. I go in with Kat and they tell their family member that they're moving out. They don't say why or anything. They say they're leaving that day. THEN after all that worrying about this person being aggressive, THEY LEAVE ME IN THE ROOM WITH HIM. They go away to their room to pack and are gone for an hour and a half and I just sat there awkwardly. I've spoken to this guy a few times, he's harmless and awkward. He just doesn't understand new things. He turned to me and just sadly asked ""Did I do something wrong?"" and it just broke my heart. While I was here in this stressful situation, I got a message from my puppy breeder who told me that my puppy who was sick was that day admitted to the hospital and might not make it. (He's okay now and I pick him up on Boxing day) To hear that whilst I was already in a stressful situation really hurt me. That night when I got home, I got really really sick and I couldn't move out of bed the next day I was in too much pain... I also forgot my medication again due to morning routine being interrupted again.

All of this was approximately a week ago. Yesterday, they really made things incredibly worse for me. I could have lost my license, been in a car crash and/or more. 

They wanted to collect their 2 cats from their mothers house but their mother did not want to give them up because the cats would have been staying with friends, not Kat. But these cats are legally Kats. Kat made it clear that we needed to get the cats though and wanted to get them yesterday. A bunch of people hyped this up and we originally had a plan to take several cars and make sure that no one got hurt or anything. I had volunteered my time since I have a wagon and I like long drives. (90 minutes away.) Yesterday morning came and I showed up at the meeting place. I was the only one driving to get the cats with Kat. My partner and I remembered almost too late that the step dad was in the same house so we made a plan to only enter and go through with the plan if we could have a police escort us to make sure no one got harmed. I thought it was fair. The step dad had been arrested before and Kat assured me that they knew the officer and would be able to get them to help.

The previous day I got asked to bring my dog crate I have, It's fairly large so it took a lot to get it into the car and tie it down. When I got to Kat, I ordered myself breakfast at Mcdonalds. They chose not to eat. I was asked to drive to a pet shop to buy 2 cat crates. I asked about the dog crate and they said we didn't need it. \*sigh\*. We drive to the pet shop and get the crates. We leave and Kat asks me to drive back to Mcdonalds near my own house so they can get breakfast and water for the drive. We drive there. Then we go to the Petrol station and they pay for a full tank of fuel. When we are done, I go ""Let's get this show on the road."" And they go ""I don't have water bowls for the cats. We need to go back to the pet shop. \*sigh\*. We get to the petshop where they ask me to go in and get them because they're in too much pain. \*sigh\* I get the bowls and we finally start driving. 

When we originally planned this trip, I asked someone to come in the car with me because I wanted someone to talk to on the trip so I can focus better. Kat said that they'd be in my car to do that... Almost minutes into the drive Kat goes ""I'm gonna sleep. Wake me up when we get to \_\_\_\_\_."" \*sigh\*. We eventually get to the town and go to the police station. We go to talk to them and they ask if Kat has a restraining order. They say ""Kind of. It ran out."" they tell us that they cannot help us unless the step father does something wrong. I get in the car and Kat looks like their about to cry. I call up my partner and we plan that we go to the house, we ONLY get the cats (no belongings, etc. We make it quick as we can) and I stay in the car in case we need to leave quickly.... You can guess that didn't happen...

We get there and I park reversed so I can drive straight out. Kat gets out of the car and immediately goes ""Get the crate, lets go."". \*sigh\* I can't say no. I get the crate and walk to the front door. Kat immediately walks to the left of the house and SNEAKS. THEY SNEAK AROUND THE HOUSE. In my head I just panic ""WHAT THE HELL ARE WE BREAKING IN?!"" They sneak and try to be quick about it and whisper yell at me to get down and be quick about it. I don't. I just, ignore them. I follow and stay standing in clear view of the windows because I was done. I was tired and done and I didn't want to get in trouble. I hate breaking the law. Even if it's a family members house. Kat sneaks around the house to the back garage and opens it and goes in side and tries to usher me in as quick as they can. They close the door behind me and find their cat. They put it into the crate and I am looking out the window. Kat's mother walks past the window angrily and looks at us. I just lazily wave at her because we are on good terms and I like her. I don't want to ruin my relationship with her. I tell Kat ""there's your mother."" and Kat quietly yells at me to hide and i'm like ""She's already seen us."" Kats mother shakes her head and walks back inside the house and locks the door. 

We take the one cat to the car and Kat grabs the other crate. Kat's mother is sitting out the front and I go over to talk to her. I tell her that Kat needs the cats and that it's important, blah blah. She finally agrees and gives us the other cat. We thank her and she gives us a bunch of Kat's plants that were left behind. Kat asks me if they can keep one of the cats crates on their lap when we are driving. I hesitate but I agree and we take off. 

Not 1 minute away from the house, Kat releases the cat from the crate. I say I am uncomfortable with this and Kat goes ""Oh it's fine, he's done this plenty of times."" I'm getting really worried and frustrated. The cat is super anxious from the car ride and is meowing loudly and looks like their going to vomit. We pull over and the cat sits in Kat's lap, wrapped up in a towel. The crate just gets hazardously thrown in the back of the car... We find out that the crates came with coup cups.. So we didn't need to buy food bowls for the trip. We take off down the road again and most of the trip was meowing. It drove me crazy. Eventually the cat gets up and goes to walk around the car. I said it made me uncomfortable and I was worried he would get hurt. Kat said it was fine. I said that if the cat got hurt, it was not my responsibility, it was theirs. We drove past a cop and I told Kat to grab the cat and put him on their lap and they flat out just once again ""Don't worry about it."" At one point Kat says ""I'd put him on your lap but he's fluffy."" And I did snap ""Do not put that cat on my lap."" I am very short and sit super close to the wheel so I already have no space and cat in drivers cat is super illegal. (But apparently walking around the car is not illegal???)

Then it happens. The cat starts retching and Kat panics ""HE'S ABOUT TO VOMIT."" I pull over as quickly as I can safely and just silently wait for Kat to deal with it. He didn't end up vomiting. He decided to take a s\*\*t in my car on the floor. There was still half an hour left of the drive. I tell cat ""Put the cat in the crate now."" and they do it but they aren't happy about it. We finally get near the cat drop off location and finally get told by Kat that they aren't home. I can feel a migraine coming on which is super dangerous. Every time I get a migraine, I need to go to the hospital because I get Hemiplegic Migraines. They mimick strokes and every 14% of the time, it could actually be one. I see the next location is only 5 minutes away and the migraine isn't affecting me enough yet to be dangerous. We have time to get to the place safely. We get there and I run to the door and ask to sit down and for some water and I tell them about my day. This is a great chance for Kat to clean the poop. They get asked to. They do not. We wait for a little bit to see if I'm okay before I try to drive again. It seems as though I won't get the migraine. We pick up the person who is going to take care of the cats and we finally go back to their house. 

I get there and I feel feverish and really unwell. I drop off Kat and the cats and go ""I really feel unwell, I need to leave."" (definitely not Covid, this is a regular thing for me right now.) Everyone wishes me farewell and I go to leave. I get a few feet from the door when Kat runs out and yells ""My stuff is still in the car!"" I sigh and ask them to go get it, I need to sit down. I walk back into the apartment, sit down and then get REALLY dizzy. One of the issues I've been having lately is Dizziness to the point of nearly vomiting. (I have the rod in my arm so i'm fairly sure it's not pregnancy, but i'm going to check anyway.) When I've been getting dizzy lately, I can't stand and it takes hours to go away. So I'm stuck now at this friends house with Kat. Kat goes through the effort to take half the stuff out of the car and then gives up. We try to organize Kat a lift to their new home and they keep putting it off. I think they were waiting for me. Eventually we do convince them but it takes 3 hours for the person to show up. I get my chest pains and I just get really really stressed and frustrated. Kat at some point threw a tantrum because a powerpoint was turned off. 

When their lift finally arrives, I ask them to clean the poop and get the rest of the belongings out of my car. I stay upstairs while they do this because I'm too unwell. I might have to stay the night. They finally leave at 11pm. I left my house at 11:30am to do all of this. I'm exhausted and I'm drained beyond all belief. I talk to members of the house hold for a while and destress and vent about my day. They agree that Kat is walking all over me and asked why I didn't say no. That's because I can't. I tried really hard but I just... can't. I am going to ask my psychologist for help. I am a people pleaser and it's really bad for me. Especially with how it caused me so much stress I got sick. Today I am still unwell.   


I finally feel well enough to drive very late into the night and we all go get Mcdonalds again because no one wants to cook, we're all too tired. We get to the car... We open the door... AND... IT.... SMELLS. KAT DID NOT CLEAN UP THE POOP. After they were asked FOUR TIMES. They did not do it. I'm done. I can't do this anymore. They just keep taking advantage of my kind nature and stepping all over me and it's tearing me apart. I need a break for a few weeks to figure out what to do with my friendship but my partner and sibling saw how much I'm affected by this and they're both cutting off the friendship from their ends. They're furious. Due to all the stress Kat caused me, I was too sick to drive my sibling to their very first job today. Their very shift shift. I asked EVERYONE and in the end had to pay my ex (nice person though) to pick them up. I'm very upset about this. I was so excited to take my sibling to their first shift and I couldn't do it because I got too sick from the stress... I need to say no. But my chest hurts every time I even think of the word. I've been in too many abusive relationships with family members, partners, friends, etc. I don't want to cause drama. I don't want to upset people. I just want to keep everyone happy. And it's potentially killing me. I don't know what to do...  


p.s I do have a referral for the neurologist but it may take a year or so to see them.

The person who raped me has been threatening me from the beginning to keep my mouth shut by threatening to ruin my reputation with lies and even threatening my life. about a month ago i attempted suicide and i was hospitalized, where i confessed to what had happened to me to another patient. 

long story short my rapist found out i had told someone and has been harassing me with phone calls and fake social media accounts , saying he is coming for my life and he would make sure the police would take his side.

i have ptsd from the incident and i have non stop flashbacks and panic attacks. after recieving these calls and messages i am extremely suicidal yet again and questioning my own sanity.

he tells me im a slut and it's my fault he did what he did because somehow i  ""couldnt keep my legs closed."" now all i can do is sit here and blame myself, i want nothing but to blow my fucking brains out because no matter how hard i try i cant lose this trauma, he has ruined me, and i cannot even have kids anymore because of how violently he used my body. 

i am in a constant state of paranoia that he is going to kill me or ruin my reputation (which is what he is already trying to do by telling everyone he knows I'm a schizophrenic)

The veterinarian gave her some cough syrup thats really helped her over the past three months and she's been her normal self since then up until recently. Yesterday and today she's deteriorated rapidly and sounds worse than ever before, going through bouts of strained wheezing/coughing every ten minutes. She sounds awful and its so emotionally taxing to watch her struggle like this. Even though she's her usual self between these bouts, I don't know how much longer she can keep living like this. 

She sees a vet again tomorrow who will hopefully be able to help her or even make her better again, but for how long will she be okay before the fits come back even worse than before?

200,"
I shall elaborate now. I live with my mom, grandma and brother.

My mom is very busy (she is a surgeon) and she goes to work all day before coming home and spending all of her time with my brother. My brother is my twin and it’s so unfair that I get no attention. I know that life isn’t fair, but this is excessive. My mom doesn’t even know basic things about me like my favorite color. She promised she would watch a movie with me today and then went with my brother to hike without inviting me. She doesn’t do anything horrible, especially compared to my grandma, but it’s definitely not okay.

My grandma though, is terrible. She will project negativity and anger at me for nothing. If I drop something she will sigh loudly at me. Like a sigh in a bad way, not relaxed. If I don’t put a water cup in the dishwasher because the screen said that it’s clean, she will yell saying that I’m trying to make everything so difficult and I’m so lazy and “back in my day....”
Also, she doesn’t care about my interests, activities, hobbies, at all. If I made her a house by the beach decorated with seashells in Minecraft (I did that because she loves the beach and the ocean in real life) she will tell me she doesn’t care about Minecraft and why do I try to tel her things that I know she doesn’t care about. This is true for all of my hobbies. She doesn’t even talk to me except to yell and scream. She is also convinced the old way of parenting was the best. E.g. hitting children, commanding respect via fear. So of course, she constantly threatens to slap me. If I have so much as a single molecule of being sad or angry on my face, she tells me to wipe it off before she smacks it off. If I’m even the slightest bit rude, it doesn’t matter why, she will take my phone when that’s not even related to the situation. She’s also a hypocrite but that’s a whole other story. She doesn’t care that I have feelings or emotions, and she doesn’t let me express them. She treats me like I’m not a person.

My brother does anything he can to annoy me, like pull my hair, embarrass me in public, literally anything. My grandma does nothing about it except tell me to grow up and stop complaining or I’m too sensitive. Once she told me that if he pulls my hair I should just turn around and pull his hair back. So when I tried that, my brother punched me in the arm three times and my grandma yelled at me for pulling his hair and “instigating him” meanwhile not caring that he hit me in the arm and it hurt a lot.

I can’t stay here but I don’t know what to do. If I could live with my friend that would be the best thing to ever happen to me but I don’t know how I could actually have that happen.

201,"22F, 1 month from graduating engineering undergrad. Had Summer internship with great engineering company in small town, but terrible gender disparity (\~15 women in various roles to 200 men). Boss's wife asked me to dog sit for her when she went on vacation months before it happened, I agreed casually. Date comes, I'm taking full courseload remotely, I have my own dog now, she gives me the details that it's actually unpaid house sitting, 24/7 monitoring of her dog and I can't bring my dog to her ""mansion"" or bring him to my house. I have to decline and she verbally abuses me over the phone, calling me ungrateful for the opportunity and her friendship. I  told her I was sorry and could help only as much as my bandwidth allowed. Mind, I'm 22, she's 55. Couldn't help but feel she was taking advantage of me and pretending she had impact on an eventual job offer for me as boss's wife.

Recently they faced a family crisis, he had to leave town. Finals are these two weeks. She contacts me, saying she's going to visit him in another state, and needs help with chihuahua. I explain I'm studying, can't sleep there etc, but can do walks. Sounds good. She leaves me with a laundry list of 3 walks a day, waking up at 7 am for this dog and a 1.5 mile walk, preparing wet food, picking up poop. It was only 4 days, but when she came back, no payment, no real thanks, just statement that I had allowed him to knock down the curtains. 4 days of lost studying time. 

Clearly I can't say yes to this ever again, but I'm baffled. I don't feel she's valuing me as an engineer, and employee, and doesn't ask these tasks of the 5 male full time young engineers on the team that live down the street from her.

I fell asleep.  Dead asleep.

It was late at night.  I am pretty sure (but not truly sure) that a client was at the door and may have been aware that I was asleep.  I work at a shelter for adults (with a very specific focus) So my manager may learn of this fact. that a client was at the door and that I did not  respond. OR they may not find out because they might not bother to take the steps to check into things and look at camera footage.  Or they may learn about what happened but let it slide.  The other fact is that they may not be able to \*prove\* that I was sleeping.  They could certainly decide to reach that conclusion as camera footage will show someone at the door, and I am not to be found, not answering the door, etc.  So it would be hard to deny.

My whole life if she didn’t get what she wanted she would pull stunts like trashing the apartment, beating the shit out of me and my mom, attempt to end her life, or something like that. And after witnessing the way she behaved and how it hurt my mom I developed such a fear for asking for things, when at others houses I can go days without eating. Even when I’m offered things that I want or offered food I absolutely refuse to get it. She completely changed me by behaving that way. 

But recently she’s really been making me feel embarrassment and guilt on her behalf. My mom is really struggling financially so obviously we can’t do much for Christmas. I know that we don’t have much so all I asked for was cheap canvas shoes to paint on, a few pairs of jeans and a Walmart eyeshadow pallet. My sister sent my mom like 20 things she wanted, all expensive. 100 dollar shoes, band T-shirt’s and hoodies, things like that.

208,"TL/DR: Girlfriend lost her job and can’t function without crying hysterically. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t know what to say, and don’t really want to talk to her because there are no conversations. Just her crying and repeating the same negative comments and questions for hours. 

It’s been a rough year for everyone, no doubt. My girlfriend (late 20s) has been having career issues for the entirety of 2020. This is the 1st job she landed after completing all her education and it’s her dream job for a huge company. But they have treated her like shit and she hasn’t been herself the entire year. Foggy, crying distant, things like that. All year!

She is exceptionally good at what she does, top of her class, raves reviews from clients and colleagues. But she had a very bad wrap at this place. They promised all sorts of things that never came to pass. It came to a breaking point about a month ago, she finally had enough and made the decision to quit. She started looking for other options, but no less than a week later, they let her go. 

Since then, responses from companies have been minimal and she has gone off the deep end. Her anxiety about being unappreciated, lied to, and not being able to find a new job has caused her to be crying everyday, lose appetite, nausea, cramps, migraines, etc. It’s bad. When we talk, it’s just her crying and saying the same shit over and over again for hours. Asking me ridiculous things like “am I really this worthless?”. Come on? How can I have a talk like that? How many times can I just say “I’m sorry. That’s horrible. It’s going to be OK”. How many times before I start to go crazy?

I don’t have much experience in dealing with anxiety, but I have been through a divorce so I know how it feels not to be wanted. I know that the last thing I need to do is to try and fix it, which I have definitely been guilty of in the past. I lover her and want to support her. But “I” have always had a problem watching people just feel sorry for themselves. It’s almost as if she wants to be sad. She wants a pity party. Call me an asshole, I don’t care. I’m there for her all the time. But I can only take so much too. 

I know this won’t last forever and I’m sure once she finds a new job, this will get better. She mentioned seeking professional help when she becomes employed again. But god damn, it’s so tough to see her like this knowing I can’t do, say anything to help.

She is not a super active person which means she is in the apartment, literally, more than I am. 

She and my roommate also create a lot of clutter and generally do not clean up their spills, used plates, etc. sometimes until days later. I spent a week by myself over Thanksgiving that confirmed that the messiness of the apartment is definitely not because of me. 

The complicating factor is that I feel close to her and consider her a friend. But I feel like I have limited access to the kitchen, bathroom, living room, and even the cat that I am fostering because she is a de facto third resident.

When memories resurface they hit harder than when they happened. Trying to find friends online ruined me a lot more than I thought. I’m not perfect. My whole life is a plethora of imperfections and shit like that. I just hate having to try and fix my brain. I feel like something is keeping me alive out of spite. Idk what to do with my life. If I continue to fight on. Just to be used by people again. Or to be treated like things are always my fault. As if I don’t already blame myself for fucking everything that’s happened thus far. I want to help everyone. I want to make it seem like I’m so kept and controlled. I’m some strong person who has everything under control. Just looking back at my life. The things that I’ve seen. People ive lost. I’m a cog in this machine. And I’m wearing the fuck out. I don’t want to die. I’m not going to sit her and insinuate that I don’t appreciate the life I have. But it’s just living with the pain. There’s no way to do it and I feel like I’m running out of options. People don’t need me in their lives they only want the best parts of me. They only come back to ask for the good things. And at my absolute lowest. I’m left with a kick on the side and even more repressed feelings. I’ve been doing better than before. But I haven’t been happy at all. And I’m scared that I’ll fall back into the same pain that’s been fucking killing me for so long. I’m just scared that I don’t have a path. That I’m just meant to suffer like this. Not because the world is unfair. But because I’m not strong enough to give in to the pain. And I’m too weak to fully lose myself.,14Dec2020,1
213,"So I'm transgender right? I've been looking up this same thing for so long and I can never find any helpful results. I'm trying to find out how to text like a guy. How do dudes text?

I really hate it and I've been really trying to fix it. Whenever I search up how men talk it's just fake conversations about a guy and a girl flirting.

My dad is lucky, because his father is rich. He's not wealthy, but he's pretty rich. He had his own company and it was pretty successful.

She also got with my ex who was a cheater, and still is. She definitely misses her ex) back to the main story.

Then my boyfriend came out of the store(the right door was open) and yelled ""HEY"" ""STOP IT"". He became a barrier, and stopped her from doing anything else. Then my ex ran out of my boyfriends ex grandmother's car, and took her back to the car. My boyfriends mom then called the police, and a cop car stopped their car. Then more law enforcement came.

224,"First off, this is a throwaway account to hide. I feel so lost in the world. It’s honestly weird, because at one point i felt so successful and things were going so well. I started smoking weed when i was about 16. That turned into an 8 year habit that ends today. It was always there to help, whether it was family members passing away, pets passing, ect. I can name so many things weed helped me get through along the way, but I don’t want to get into dark memories. These days, i realize that weed was/is my “copium.” (Lol) When I was 18, i met the woman i expected to spend my life with. Things changed. I might sound like a pussy with this, but women can be mentally abusive in relationships and ruin someone mentally, just like men usually do. Playing the victim and making me feel like the terrible person for simply hanging out with my other male friends (who were good people, its not like they were shady people who caused trouble. They were probably better people than myself.) Her parents were extremely religious and sheltered her throughout her life. So, being the actual fucking moron that I am, i dropped out of college and quit baseball and got a full time job and eventually moved up to management so that we could get our own place and she could move in with me. Between working 40-60 hours weekly, and trying to keep a controlling person happy, I quickly lost all my friends from high school. There is so much more I could get into, but its incredibly depressing and manipulative and I’m just not willing to type all of that out and relive it. About a year ago, she cheated on me with someone she didn’t even know. If you’ve ever given your entire life towards making someone happy and they throw it away, you know how worthless I felt.... if you know you know. With all of that said, I feel like that catapulted my depression to unreal levels. I’ve been sad on and off throughout my life, but i always had help. Whether it was my parents, friends, my exs, someone was always there that i could talk to. Now, I have no one. And I’m lost. A few days after my relationship fell apart, i quit my job. I couldn’t properly manage a team while being in the mental shape I was in. My uppers begged me to stay and take a leave of absence and even offered a paid vacation to clear my mind. I refused, and walked out. Haven’t been back. Haven’t talked to anyone from that job since. I fell into a cycle where I was smoking constantly and staying in my apartment in the dark every day. Eventually, after paying rent monthly with no job, and paying my other bills, i eventually exhausted my checking and all savings accounts. My parents knew nothing. They thought i was still employed and thriving. They didn’t know i quit or even lost my girlfriend. It was almost like it was embarrassing to tell people i got cheated on. My parents know now, but i still don’t tell people the truth when asked. Now, I live with my parents at 24 years old in my hometown, with a dead end job and no college degree. I would love to go to school, as I have a university about 20 minutes from my house, but it’s almost like I’m embarrassed to do that at 24 years old. I feel like a failure. I can’t smile, and i talk extremely monotoned now and cannot change that. I’m starting to gain weight, when all my life I was active and fit. I haven’t had a haircut or shaved my face in over 6 months, which isn’t a problem since i wear a neck gaiter at work, but it just shows how much of a mess my life is. I was always so social as well, and now I go to work, get fast food, and come home. If I am off, I never leave the house and usually don’t even get out of bed. I feel shattered. Is this how my life will be? Because it sure feels like I will never accomplish anything or even genuinely have fun or be excited for anything again. My mom loves me and knows something is wrong, but doesn’t press me about it. I wish she would because i’m so lonely........ It’s such a debilitating feeling hating yourself. I would never ever harm myself, because i have my cats that i love and they need me (they were my exs, but after her saying “I never loved you or these cats but I guess I’ll take them,” they are mine. I love them more than anything) However, I do wish sometimes I was dead. Life feels not worth it.

This would be taking place in Europe. He has stated that he is ok with me going but he is worried.

I finished a phone interview with a recruiter this past Friday. He mentioned that I would have to tell my  current manager that I am interviewing with them before I get an offer (assuming I get an offer). My company and this company \*used\* to be under the same portfolio of companies owned by this private equity firm. I don't think the recruiter knew this but this is the reason why he told me all this. I forgot my current company got sold to another private equity firm so we are no longer under the same portfolio/private equity anymore. He basically ended up telling me to send an email with my availability for this week and I have yet to do that because I want to tread lightly.

They welcome me to their holidays and parties and everything. Having a family became like an addition to the point where I didn’t know what I would do without them. During quarantine I realized that I didn’t need a family and that the only reason I had suffered through the way my bf treated me was so I could have a family. I recently have thought back to times where she would ask me questions about my family in order to tell me how sad it is that they don’t want me. Times where she took my phone away and tricked me to go outside to lock me out with no phone and no stuff. I realized that she hadn’t treat me right and that I can’t be friends with her anymore. I have not been talking to her and she randomly keeps inviting me places and I have said no but today when I said no she said “did I do something to make you mad at me” “please please tell me if I did I didn’t mean toooo” I can tell she is being manipulative again but I don’t know what to say.

235,"So I went asking for advice in relationship advice and people were either “supporting” me or shitting me, so I am asking for honest advice.


Last year I met my boyfriend on the school bus, we go to college but we live far away and we take the school bus there, not now because we are taking our classes online.


I used to see him from afar, he was always with this very pretty girl, let’s call her Rachel, so I thought she was his girlfriend, so I never made and effort to talk to him, until my brother (who goes to the same school) started talking to him because he wanted to know if Rachel was single.


What my boyfriend, let’s call him Harry, told him was that he met Rachel when they were 15, and that he had a crush on her, but never made a move because she was “unreachable”. Then he switched schools and never saw her again until freshman year of college, were they became really good friends.



Later on he confessed his love to her, and Rachel admitted that she liked him as well but wasn’t ready to be in a relationship and that she was hung up with another guy, this was in February 2019.



In March we started being friends, and began casually dating in late June. Fast forward to September, he tells me he has to sit next to Rachel on the bus everyday now, because on the night bus a guy sexually abused her, and none of her friends go to the same bus.


So there goes my asshole move, after a couple of weeks I began feeling uncomfortable of them spending time together, specially because it felt like nothing had changed between them, even if they were apart for months. So I told him he needed to chose, me or her. The day after that on the bus he picked me, I saw Rachel shed a couple of tears, and I felt bad honestly, I can’t erase that image of her off my head.



I really thought he had stopped talking to her, but turns out that he was with her through the whole process of her therapy and her pressing charges against the guy. So by December she gave him this really fancy medical dictionary but he completely lied to me about how he got it. I just found out it was a gift from her, and plenty of messages between them in the last months.


I didn’t say anything to him, but I don’t know if he has unresolved feelings about her. Our relationship is strong I think, but I feel really insecure about it.



People on other subreddits think I should apologize to Rachel, because I took her only friend away from her, and also made my boyfriend feel bad about helping out a friend in need.

238,"To start off with this post, I know and presumably should go to a therapist or someone similar, but I’m writing this as I(M) have trouble with expressing emotions in general. 

I can express them when I am with my girlfriend or whenever I feel strongly, but I generally feel fake with my friends and family, often forcing fake emotions and hurting myself. This has les me to being essentially a blank face, and whilst I do feel bothered and show emotions at times, I don’t do well expressing it regularly throughout my day.

I play video games almost daily, as well as am involved in a dnd game and gurps(for those who know what this is). I won’t disagree that I lack a lot of hobbies or past times, but I’m getting off track. Just for a little bit of more background, I have an extremely realistic perspective on life, and have gotten over my emotions to keep that pace.

My issue more or less is that I can express myself. A lot of emotions feel forced and fake, and especially during the season we’re in currently, don’t feel much to any joy, happiness or what you’d expect. When I’ve gone to family gathering I’ve always felt isolated from my cousins, albeit I feel I am part of that reason.  So if anyone has any ideas that might help or suggestions I am open to them.

239,"My (31) friend (30) has been a bit shady and i don’t know if it’s just me thinking negative. For starters we’ve been friends for almost two years. We recently started to hang out more than usual. Here are the things i notice her doing that’s making me question her friendship: 
- she indirectly puts down my beliefs and what i enjoy to do. For example, I’m a Christian and she doesn’t believe in God. Which is fine for me but she will put down Christianity. I use a vape pen and she suddenly calls it the glass lung after several visits with me to get one. 
-i told her something personal and she completely threw it back in my face (i think to see my reaction). 
-she thinks she knows EVERYTHING but she’s wrong about a lot. 
-I’m not as successful as she is so i was asking for advice about a business venture online. She basically told me to stick to school because social media isn’t the way to do it. (Fair, i thought. But after a while i started to think maybe she doesn’t believe in me like i do myself).

Her friend doxxed her and I called the police about her friend but she said she was suicidal and going to kill herself later today so I called the police to check on her. 

These are not US police for reference.

I say friend but this is honestly the only person I have ever loved. I’ve been in relationships before but never felt this way about anybody and I lost a friend to suicide recently and many more have died without me being there for them to respond when they needed me. I’m tired of letting people who I know are special go. I’m tired of letting people get hurt by others who want to exploit them and treat them like a piece of trash. I worry once they show up she will never talk to me again. They have not yet.

I feel like I betrayed her by using her address to get the police to come help her. I feel like even though my intentions are good, I was wrong. This is someone who I love more than anything, more than I have ever felt for anyone and I feel like they will hate me forever now. This person was addicted and is being enabled by parasites around her and I feel like even if she chooses to remove me from her life she needs better friends. She’s the only person I can write songs about, she’s the only person I cry myself to sleep often thinking about and worrying if she is okay, she’s the only person I want to get off my ass and improve my life to help. 

I feel like she’s trapped and I can’t do anything with words. She’s too important to me to allow her to kill herself or die from a drug overdose. She’s like a flower that is waiting to bloom but things keep getting in the way, addiction, people mistreating her, and being homesick.

I’ve never wanted to try and do anything for anyone, I never cared before I met her, never like this.",14Dec2020,1

248,"I posted this in r/relationshipadvice but I figured getting a bigger selection of people to help would be good.

This is going to be as simplified as I can make this, there is a lot of information and I'm very emotional as I just learned the meth thing a few moments ago. I'll try to be as ""in the middle"" as I can per the rules of this sub. Also, this is written on mobile.

Backstory:

My step mom (50) has a rare neurologic disorder and has a lot of issues with walking, but is an absolutely brilliant woman. My dad and I(24), although having our issues in the past, over the past couple years have been gaining a relationship that allows me to feel much more comfortable around him. My dad and step mom have been married for almost 8 years. I have a step brother and his girlfriend that are currently living with my step mom and dad due to the pandemic and financial reasons. I have two uncles (my dad's brothers) that currently live 10 minutes away from my dad and step mom.

A few months ago, my step mom was contacted by my one uncle's ex girlfriend stating that about a year earlier my dad got blackout drunk while at my uncles' place and cheated on my step mom. During this time, my step mom was in the hospital recovering from a back surgery that turned out in sepsis. Had she come back to the hospital any later, she would have died.. It was confirmed by my dad that he did indeed get blackout drunk at that time, but doesn't remember cheating. My uncles hid this information and have been hiding a lot of my dad's actions for at least a year now. They would enable him to drink a lot, I've seen this first hand and would try to get him to drink water whenever possible. I can't say if there is anything else they've been enabling him into doing. Over the past few months, my step mom has been finding out more and more information about my dad through searching through his phone, with his permission, and other means that, at least for several months now, he has been talking to and showing himself off for people on the internet. They had a few conversations where my dad apologized profusely and said he'd stop. A few days before Thanksgiving, they had a fight that even my step brother had to come down and get my dad to go calm down. What was the fight over? My 8 year old sister saw my dad ""talking to women on an app spelled 'K. I. K.' We even had a huge conversation during Thanksgiving because I was completely hurt by him and these actions.

Now:

My step mom couldn't sleep last night, so she went to clean and stuff. She saw his wallet and a small baggy sticking out of it. Low and behold it had a white powdery substance in it, so she held onto it, decided she'd look through his phone while he's still sleeping and found omegle and some other things. When he woke up, they had another conversation where he didn't deny anything, even admitted that the baggy had meth in it and was talking to a woman from the UK, but also avoided some questions. (""How long have you been on meth?"")

How do I deal with my dad, what options do I have, where do I go from here? How do I get him to understand he needs help? How do I get him to understand that he's about to lose the best person that could have ever been his wife, and his two kids? And how do I make sure he doesn't kill himself (by drinking and doing other stuff until he ODs) if and when that happens?",14Dec2020,1

I just can’t. I lose every emotion I had. I used to come several times as a child and now I just don’t even get half as on.

251,"Ok so me (m22) and this girl (f20) were looking to hookup, didn't happen, some context first. 

Met this girl in high school and we kinda hated each other at first, but it lead to a friendship, as she was going through a hard home life during that time. We stopped talking after I graduated high school Fast forward a couple of years and I get this random message from get on instagram asking if we could talk. We chat, catching up or whatever. Then she asked if we wanted to talk on Snapchat. Then we talk on Snapchat for a bit. And then after about an hour or so of talking, she admitted to me that she had a wet dream about me on more than a few occasions over the course that we didn't talk. After she admitted that she asked if she wanted to hook up, though on that day I was kind of busy but she insisted and she also said that today, on that day being a Saturday, that it was her only opportunity and then I eventually said yes. So she came over to pick me up and then we went to the hotel but on our way to the hotel she had second thoughts about it and eventually she took me back home (didn't have a car, totaled at the time, if it means anything).

So we talk after that day, a few times a day, and then after about a month or so she asked me to question again and said that she wouldn't bullshit me, this time I did hesitate but said yes but the same thing happened and didn't she took me home. 

The next month or so she did the same thing but bailed again. Gave her an ear full of it.


And just last night she contacted me on Snapchat with kind of a different tone but we talked as usual and didn't question it. And then it occurred to me to ask her about why we didn't go through with hooking up, and then she just kind of snapped at me and telling me that I shouldn't bring up past mistakes (I did do this in the past, albeit on smaller things) and just completely snapped at me. I did tell her that I don't like my time being wasted and I let those two times slide because something did come up with her, those past two times. The third time was a tipping point but didn't tell me why. 

She did block me after an argument on Snapchat but she didn't block me on Instagram. Also for further context, I call her out on a public Instagram post a couple of years ago about her doing me dirty in regards to a girl that I liked. 

Should I just let this go?",14Dec2020,1

253,"Hello y’all! I’m not sure if this is the right sub but I’ve been struggling with this for some time. I’m very addicted to food. I never considered it an addiction until I went through nicotine withdrawal. I quit cold turkey and the cravings were intense. I realize now that I have a very similar craving for food and my behaviors are the same. If I ran out of cigs I used to go out, no matter what time of night or what I was doing, to buy more cigs. I do the same thing with food. If I get a craving for Doritos or McDonald’s or what have you I will go out and get it. Sometimes I can ignore the cravings for a few days but eventually I always give in, which is what I used to do with nicotine. I feel like nicotine and food addiction feels very similar. However, breaking a food addiction has been much harder for me for a few reasons:

1) I still need to eat, and once I start I don’t want to stop. It’s not like I can “quit food cold turkey”.

2) I don’t know how long the cravings will last. With nicotine I knew it was going to be a really shitty 30 days. So I promised myself that if by day 30 I want to have a cig, I can. Of course, day 30 came and since my cravings were infrequent and leas intense I was able to avoid buying cigs easily. Never smoked since. But food, there is no time frame (or at least not that I know of). I don’t know how long I’m going to have to fight the cravings. It’s like running a marathon in the dark and having no idea if you’re near the finish line. And will the cravings be different depending on the food? Will certain food cravings last longer than others? Bc that would feel like quitting multiple drugs at one time.

It’s just very hard for me to break this addiction. But it is by far the most dangerous and destructive addiction I have.",14Dec2020,1

257,"So today was a really confusing day. It left me (f)(20) feeling uncomfortable about my standings with my step sister (f)(17). So just for backup story: 
Around February my step sister, I’ll call her Hailey, had moved in with us as her mom was irrational and just effecting her mentally. My stepdad introduced me to her when we were younger so I was already friends and familiar with Hailey. Well there’s a saying you get to know more about a person when you live with them and I found that to be true. I always liked Hailey when we met up on vacations or rare days when she would come and stay over for the weekend. We always had good conversations and in general I liked her.

The first week she moved in with us, she had forgotten to pick up our younger sister from school because she was hanging out with girls she met from schools This rubbed me the wrong way and I started to get the feeling she was someone who was irresponsible. She had only known these girls for two days yet chose them over picking up our sister. 

I remember the first two months she was living here she would help us clean on Saturday’s and I would also see her helping out with dishes. This was a big relief for me because before she had come I was stressed out as I was the one in charge of cleaning the kitchen, doing the dishwasher, emptying the garbage etc. And now I had someone to help me split and share the tasks with. 

Immediately after I think she got use to the idea of living here, she stopped cleaning completely. The only time she would clean is when she invited her boyfriend over and now even when her boyfriend comes over she doesn’t bother cleaning up. 

I’ve been frustrated because we would be in the kitchen in several occasions and the kitchen sink would be full with dishes. She finishes drinking and she washes her cup and then leaves. This made me upset because the sink is clearly full so she could’ve at least bothered to help, or just add her dish to the sink. It seemed really petty and self centred, and just pointless for her to wash her single cup while the sink is full. This would happen many times and so I just decided to hint at her one time to help out and I said, “Hey the dishwasher is empty, you can put your stuff in there”. For some reason she thinks cleaning up after herself is contributing to the house. 

We have 5 other household members in the house, one does all the laundry for every member in the house. I just always had a mentality where if you live in a home you treat it like a home and not a motel. She just sees this place as a pit stop for when she leaves for university and it has began to bother me how selfish she has been living here since she doesn’t contribute in any way. She’s hinted at it numerous times in conversation as she says things like “in ten years when we have our family reunion and I see you all again.” We have always treated her like family and it seems she just came to live here to be in her own world and not help out in any way. 

She also does things with ulterior motives and acts as if she’s being nice and that I should be grateful for what she’s done. For instance, since she’s gotten here we split up who takes out the garbage/recycling for pickup every week. The rotation were on is that I do recycling and her week she puts out recycling on garbage. I woke up 6 am on my rotation week to see she had already done it. And I was quite upset about it because I knew she didn’t do it to be nice, but so I could be on her rotation where I put out garbage the next week. She confessed that was her reasoning for doing it so I wasn’t “grateful” or “thankful” like she expected me to be. She was acting like she did a good deed when she just wanted to make it harder for me the next week and that rubbed me the wrong way. 

I don’t want to get into all the self centred things she’s done while she’s been here, I just wanted to give a gist of her character and why I’ve been so frustrated. My stepdad and mom have been upset with her about this as well but they don’t let it show and neither do I. Since she’s gotten here I’ve tried my best to be welcoming (because I know how awkward it is in the beginning to move into a new environment) and it’s to the point I put my pride away to make her feel comfortable. It’s exhausting to be honest and I found I wasn’t able to grow close and connect with her because I was too busy making sure she was comfortable and not letting myself breathe. 

My mom had sent a indirect message @ all of us siblings in a family chat saying we should all contribute to cleaning and assigned us the tasks we should be doing. I guess she didn’t like it so much because this morning she told my stepdad that she’s moving back in with her moms because she feels antagonized, feels she cleans up just as much  as I do (not true at all, she has never touched the dishes since her first two months here), and he has heard me talk about her to my mom). 

Now I feel uncomfortable and now sure what I should say? I’ve only vented my frustrations to my mom about how she doesn’t clean up and only invites her boyfriend all the time. She doesn’t contribute and I’m a university student myself and am just as stressed meanwhile I have to make her feel comfortable and it’s all suffocating. 

I feel upset with her because she doesn’t help out at all and has the nerves to say she cleans up as much as I do when both my stepdad and my mom disagree with that. Now the air in the house between us is going to be awkward. I don’t even know what to say. I’m just angry and feel like she doesn’t have the right to be and is being entitled.

263,"
So I’ve been excited to get into digital drawing and was really happy about getting into it, I’ve always been passionate about art and it has always been a way that I feel I express myself best with and something I would feel I was best at. Recently I have joined reddit and a couple of art subreddits mainly looking to see what I can learn from others, over the past few weeks I’ve been looking through and just admiring how amazing and talented people are. I find myself even staring at their art for 10 minutes straight just admiring it, now what I’ve realized ever since I’ve been gazing at others talents that now whenever I draw I have felt differently about it..I tend to erase my work or delete it because I feel it doesn’t look the best, or I look at others and just think “wow I could never draw like that, I should just quit” it’s gotten to a point where I haven’t drawn for days, I know it doesn’t sound like much but this is coming from someone who would spend hours and hours just drawing, I’m not entirely sure what I can do about it I’ve asked my friends what they’ve thought about my art and family as well hoping that maybe their nice compliments would help me feel better about it but even after I do I’ve found myself thinking that “they are just saying that because they’re being nice” it sounds insanely stupid and trust me I know, art has just always had a place in my heart, it’s the one thing I’ve always loved and now I’m not sure if I’m starting to lose it, it’s not something I want to lose but at this point I’m debating whether I should quit or not and I honestly don’t know what I can do to prevent that, I’ll just keep judging myself harder and harder if I keep trying...

If anyone maybe has any advice or has gone through this and knows any type of way I can just get over it the advice would help me soo much! 

Thank you!",14Dec2020,1
265,"I am 19 male, I have always been thinking and reflecting on my own actions. Asking myself where did I go wrong? Since I was around 8 years old when my mother gets mad at me on something, she makes me go outside. I often sleep in the backyard till morning, whenever I try to get back inside again she will yell at me again. I was starving at that time since I couldn't get any food. I still remember when I was eating, and some of the grains of rice fell down on the ground and she made me eat it again. When I tried to stood up from her, she will say hurtful things like ""I wish you were born dead"" or ""If I know that you'll be like this, then I could prevent myself from giving birth on you"". I am an INTP, and yes I am more happy being alone. I know some INTP reading will probably relate that we are often misunderstood. I am also not confident to say if I have friends. Anyway, I think I am becoming more and more emotionally numb. Up until this day, my mother still gets mad at me on every little mistake I have made and getting yelled is common. I think there's only a few parts of me that are still here, and everyday I am gradually dissipating. 

Flashback, I was born with asthma. I became a burden to my parents since then, our daily expenses would be used for hospital bills, even our appliances was sold at that time just for me to survive. Yes, I am truly grateful to my parents, even though I couldn't feel their affection towards me since then, they provided me shelter and food. But still, I think it will be better for everybody around me if I was gone. I just thought that being hurt multiple times will ease the pain. It's not just about my mother, there a lot of other factors affected me to let go.

266,"I’ve been experiencing a lot of anxiety lately and even have had some panic attacks and my boyfriend always makes me feel like a burden when I tell him how and why I feel sad. 

Today, I was crying because he got extremely upset because I said “hey Siri” 3 times and he told me not to be annoying, I started crying because I was previously upset since I don’t feel like he really loves me, he came into our bedroom and said we needed time alone (a few hours) and left me crying in the bedroom because he had to keep watching a show, then he saw  me crying again and started complaining that I was too sensitive. 

We were going to sleep just like an hour ago and I couldn’t fall asleep and he told me to stop moving and I was still crying and he said “I can’t, I can’t” and went to sleep in the living room. 

I don’t know what to do, I feel extremely depressed because I feel like I’m maybe wasting my time with him (we’ve been together for 4 years) and we moved in together not long ago. I hate feeling like a burden or listening to his complains when I feel depressed.

267,"Please hear me out. Since graduation (~3y) he's been doing less and less school, he's basically stopped completely, failing everything and wasting the parents money. He's becoming a NEET and needs to be encouraged to better himself.

Here's the worst of it. His IG feed is filled completely with pics of 10ish year old blondes, and nothing else.
He's been following this one girl, 13year old Disney channel or something kind of girl. I'm pretty sure he's trying to jerk to that. He's been kinda creepy towards the cousins gf, watching her account like crazy, followed her family. He's even messaged and tried to video call a few girls (age idk) on IG saying ""you're so beautiful"" and such. 

Through IG he was able to message an old friend, they go way back and haven't talked in a long time. You'd think he'd ask about normal stuff like how's life, how college and the fam, but no. He asked about girls who he could follow. Only girls. No guys, no dude friends, just girls. I'm also pretty sure he went through all of our school yearbooks and tried to follow every girl from school that he could. 

He's also been listening only to Shape of You, Despacito, and Love me Like You Do non stop for over 6 months, just with some cover variation -all of which are done by very young, feminine voices. He plays too much candy crush at full fucking volume. 

His YouTube is filled with death penalty channels, true crime channels, guys coming out as LGBT clips, vids of pedos getting caught, bank heists, and Young girls. You know, YouTube picture perfect young moms with perfect little girls and such. And young girls who are into dance and gymnastics. Why? I have no idea. He's not obviously gay, or conflicted in that way. People often get fascinated with crimes and serial killers simply, mostly for how the killers mind works   right? And girls, he probably thinks that nobody will want him as a partner, no matter how much he may want a gf. He doesn't realize that he need to better himself to become even considerable to be interested in. 

It doesn't help with all this lockdown and family health concerns that he can't hang out with anyone, but he was never one to be found in a social group. No sports, no more band practice, no video game chats, nothing social of the sort. 

Wtf is up with him? How can I try to help him? 

I told the parents about it, but they don't want to be too harsh. Their thinking more or less is: he's an adult, he should be grown up, and its now time to the laid back parents they always wanted to be. So they just told him to purge his subscriptions and the like, but he won't. So I went through his IG and blocked as many of the young girls as I could. He's mad of course. But I can't do anything else without being an invasive ass. 

What can I do? How can I make him stop? How can I help him realize he needs to focus on education and find ways to move out?",14Dec2020,1
268,"Hey reddit. This is also posted in r/school, but I figured.someone here might.have a good answer. 

My brother is a Junior currently doing online classes in the US. He is so behind on homework that he spends all day and night working on his projects and assignments, but just can't focus or work as quickly as his peers. Last night he got 5 hours of sleep only to wake up and start classes again. 

He never complains about it, but this is ridiculous. No one should spend that much time on homework everyday, including weekends. It isn't like he's just procrastinating, either. Everytime I check on him or ask if he can do a chore, he's working on things or in a class. 

He has diagnosed ADD but refuses to take medication for it because of how severe the side effects are for him. He's tried several over the years.

270,"Hi, I've never been the type to ask strangers online for help, and honestly I feel stupid coming to reddit for this. I just don't know what else to do. If nothing helpful comes of this I hope it'll at least be therapeutic for me to let it out.  


  
Here's some background info:  
\-I'm a gay (I promise this is relevant lol) 18 year old boy asking for help with my friend Adam

\-Adam (fake name) is my 22 year old friend from across the country.

\-Brian (fake name) is my 19 year old friend. He's from the same town as Adam, and they're friends from their high school days.

\-I met the two of them through the online game League of Legends back in August, and we quickly became good friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though we've only known each other for a few months, I would consider Adam my best friend. I've always had poor social skills, so I never made many friends in my life, but when I met Adam we had this instant chemistry. He was kind, funny, sensitive, caring, and he liked spending time with me. We started talking daily almost immediately, sometimes for hours. Over the next two months our friendship grew, it wasn't all perfect, we'd fight every few weeks (both of our faults), but we'd confide our hardships to each other, and I quickly developed feelings for him. I knew he didn't feel the same way, and I was so scared to tell him because of that. I was terrified that telling him would make him uncomfortable, and he'd never want to talk to me again. After tearing myself apart with anxiety, I finally decided to tell him. To my surprise, he took it extremely well. He comforted me, listened to me ramble about all my fears, and he even cried with me. I told him how scared I was that he'd be upset by my feelings, or one day he'd just think I'm too much of an emotional burden and be done with me. He did his best to lay those fears to rest. He told me about all the times him and Brian have gotten into fights, how he'd block Brian on everything, yet they still always made up afterwards. I held those fears of abandonment with me for the next few weeks, but every time I told him about it he always laid it to rest, and after a few weeks I finally felt secure with him.

&amp;#x200B;

That was the backstory for our friendship, now I'll start getting into the backstory of our current problem. Starting a few weeks ago I noticed Adam's mental state declining. First he got Covid and had to quarantine at home for 2 weeks. During his quarantine we got into a stupid fight over a game and he wouldn't talk to me for 3 days. After not talking for 3 days, I sent him a message to make amends, and he apologized to me. He said being stuck inside for over a week had taken a toll on his mental state, and that's why he got so mad. I forgave him and we went back to talking like normal. I figured once he could go back to his normal life he'd start feeling better, but sadly that isn't what happened. More and more stressful shit just kept happening in his life. He had to spend Thanksgiving completely alone, after he could finally return to work he had to work 11 hours a day 6 days a week, and he began having major issues with a coworker (more personal things happened I won't go into for respect). Like I said, over these last few weeks I noticed a deterioration of his mental state. He'd get so angry so much easier than normal, he seemed so sad so often (a lot of the time he wouldn't talk to me (or anyone about it), his insecurities increased dramatically, and he became paranoid all his other friends, like Brian, didn't like or care about him. I tried comforting him through it, but he was going through so much, and nothing I could do would help him. Me and Adam had been planning for months for me to fly up there  to meet him and Brian irl. About a week ago Adam told me to ask Brian if he'd want to meet up with us when I fly up there. At first me and Adam wanted to surprise Brian (and everyone else), but out of respect because of covid we thought to ask if he wanted to first. Brian said yes and I was extremely excited, I messaged Adam about it and he seemed excited too. However the next day everything changed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Adam messaged me while he was at work saying he wanted to change plans. The original plan was. I'd fly in to Adam's city, stay with him for a few days, then together we'd drive down a few hours to his hometown to see Brian and everyone else, and then drive back where I'd fly home. Now he wanted me to fly in to see him for a few days, then drive us down to his hometown where he'd LEAVE ME for days with no one to stay with (can't stay with Brian bc of his living situation), while he'd drive back home and I'd fly back from a different airport after a few days. I wasn't happy with his new plan, and when I asked him why he wanted to change plans he said it was because he didn't want to see any of his high school friends. He said they don't care about him, they aren't good friends to him, and that they should go fuck themselves. I told him that's not true, but he didn't care what I had to say. At this point I was extremely worried for him. He'd been through a lot of shit the last few weeks, and I'd seen his mental state decline throughout it. Now he was trying to push away all of his friends who care about him. Adam already doesn't have too many good friends, and I know these people really care about him. I didn't know what to do, so the next day I talked to Brian about it. It was a really good conversation, I said I was worried about Adam, that he's been all over the place mentally, and that he thinks Brian and all of his friends don't like him. Brian listened to me, told me he does care about Adam, that he's worried about him too, but he doesn't know how to fix it. We came away with a plan to set up a 3 way talk about it between the three of us, but we never had the chance. I don't know how, but later that day Adam got the impression I had talked to Brian about him. That night he messaged me from work asking me about it, he told me to be honest, so I told him the truth. I told him I was worried about him, and as his friend I couldn't let him push away all these people that care about him. He did not take it well. At first he was mad, said it wasn't my place to reach out to Brian, that he had to watch what he said around me now, but he still ended the conversation saying he'd talk to me tomorrow. However, 10 minutes later he messages me again FURIOUS, telling me to go fuck myself, saying I showed him I'm just like the rest of them and he has no friends, and that he'll never go to me for anything again. I went back and forth arguing with him for a bit before cutting it off. I told him I love him, and that I'll be here when he's ready to talk. However, after we fought he left all the discord servers we're in together and stopped talking to me, Brian, and everyone else. I've tried messaging him multiple times since then, but he's ignored me almost every time. Last time I messaged him I begged him to say something, even if he was mad at me, I just wanted to know he's okay. He replied saying he didn't want to talk, and that was it. Brian has had the same results every time he's tried reaching out as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been 4 days since we first fought, that's the longest we've gone without speaking since meeting. We normally talk every day for hours, and hearing nothing from him is just tearing me apart. No one else seems that hung up on it though, I know Brian is upset, but he's content waiting until Adam comes around. I just can't do it though. He's my best friend, I love him so much, and not talking to him while knowing he doesn't want to talk to me is just so painful. I want to keep reaching out to him, but I don't want to anger him. I'm worried if I try too much he'll just block me, but waiting is so hard when every time I'm alone I think of him. Plus Adam is the type of guy who will NEVER be the first one to reach out, so idk if waiting will even get us anywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so confused how we got here, he's told before me he loves me \[as a friend ;( \], but we fight so frequently, and every time we do he seems perfectly content not talking to me. I understand why he's mad, I knew he would be when I went to Brian, but he doesn't even want to try to talk through it. I just don't know what I should be doing when he doesn't seem to care about fixing this. I know this has been extremely long, and I thank anyone who read through it all. I appreciate any advice someone might have on what I should do here.",14Dec2020,1
272,"So, a friend of mine reconnected with me recently after moving back to my hometown. We picked up our friendship where it left off, and then joked about having sex, and then had sex.

It was entirely experimental for me because I pretty strongly identified as a lesbian beforehand. I had a sexuality crisis, blah blah blah, we decided to not have sex in the future, and instead just keep our friendship.

The issue is that he's really depressed. He lives by himself, and has some other friends other than me, but for the most part he's pretty lonely and barely gets out of bed most days. I've pushed him to see a doctor, get on antidepressants, apply for uni, the works. He's still really fucked up, and I know that he wants to have a s/o. Him and I talk every day, and sometimes he'll have really bad nights and we'll go to bed on facetime together. I'm pretty sure he's into me, romantically (and sexually).

Anyways. I want to have sex with him again (pretty sure I can't call myself a lesbian anymore lol). I'm pretty sure that he'd be down if I said anything. But I'm worried that I'm leading him on (I don't want to be his girlfriend), and that I'm taking advantage of the fact that he's depressed. Idk, I feel just a bit scummy about it.",14Dec2020,1

Don’t get me wrong I’ve tried especially this year extra hard on myself to feel okay and it was going good but then I fell back down again so I picked myself up like I always do and fell back down again even worse. I know progress isn’t linear but I’m at my breaking point where I don’t think I can do this by myself anymore, I can’t pick myself back up,  I need help but I have no one to turn to. I’m looking to seek help professionally before it gets worse and before I do something that hurts me. I can’t stand feeling like this anymore, I feel tired, useless and just a bother to everyone . I feel small. I’m only 18 and unfortunately my parents don’t take me serious so I don’t know what else to do. I’m just really tired of this.

I feel like I should've gone with a science-related major instead like stem or biology. it's impossible to change majors now because I'm already in the third year. my grades are slipping because of this constant regret. how do I convince myself to rise up from this? now I feel like the phrase ""follow your passion"" is kinda stupid.",14Dec2020,1
277,"This isn’t a ghost encounter, but it still has been strange that I need to find some sort of reasoning or explanation for. Idk if all of these instances are related/connected somehow, but these are just some things that stood out to me. Are we potentially being stalked or recorded by someone in our apartment? 

I’m the kind of person that loves creepy stories of stalkers, ghosts, murders, encounter, and so on and bc of this interest it makes me have a pretty bleak view of humanity and always think that people are generally horrible and always up to something which makes me always be prepared to defend myself or loved ones. Maybe bc I read all of these stories that I’m looking for it. So, maybe I’m just quick to think that something sinister is going on when it may just be something harmless. I’ll let you decide.

Anyways, I’m a college student and I basically live in 2 apartments. I stay at my brother’s apartment alot, but i mostly stay at my own apartment that I share. I live with my friend who is a pretty attractive girl who is basically a pixie fairy, which as a guy I know older men love to drool over. So, I always worry that since she’s not as vigilent as me and really weak that she would be an easy target for a stalker or creep which there have been some weird “suitors” in the past couple of years, but nothing like stalking.

So, today we got a Christmas tree for the apartment and we were just chilling in the living room when we hear a sound from a device in the kitchen which is like 2 feet away in the next room make a “swooshing sound” and then an Alexa-type male voice recording saying the word “Venus”. It sounded as if a device was turning on or off or something like that (we don’t own any Alexa products or anything like that, we both have the female Siri on our iPhones too) We both look at each other and say what the fuck made that sound? She kind of chuckled and said did it just say “Penis”, but I heard “Venus”. I go over there and see if one of our phones were over there, but there wasn’t any mobile devices or speakers in the kitchen. I go back in the living room and we check our phones to see if one of us got a message on one of our phones, but neither one of us did. She asked me if I was fucking with her, but I was going to ask her the same thing. This kind of freaked her out, and with my paranoia I immediately think if it could be some sort of recording device or something to spy on her cuz I’m not there alot, and I was actually about to leave too. The only devices in the kitchen are a Consori air fryer, the microwave, oven, and a Veken water fountain for the cats.

I search on the internet about anything that could have made that sound and said “Venus” or even “Penis” (which wasn’t a helpful search.), but nothing useful showed up.

It’s exam week and I usually go study at my brothers apartment, so I had to leave, and I didn’t want to freak her out with my conspiracy theories, but I did. 

As I was driving to my brother’s, I was thinking about it and remembered that about 2 weeks ago we were talking in her room for a second when we both hear buzzing from a phone. I said someone’s calling you, but she had nothing on her phone. I even look at mine and there wasn’t anything on there too, but the buzzing was still going on. There are upstairs neighbors, but they are short term occupants (Airbnb guests). But the phone sounded like it was in our apartment but couldn’t pinpoint where. It wasnt from upstairs bc we only usually hear faint footsteps, loud bangs, or yelling &amp; such bc they are old New Orleans wood floors, but would not be able to hear a phone buzzing that clearly even it was laying bare on the wood floor above us.

In my research the only thing I could come up with that could have possibly made the “Venus” noise was maybe an LG Venus phone turning on. It’s a burner phone that has a decent camera, but still shitty. When you turn it on it makes a swooshing sound that may be similar to the swooshing sound recording we heard but I don’t remember it specifically, but the only thing is I haven’t found a video of the phone turning on and making the swooshing and then saying “Venus”. Maybe it says it in a new update for the phone, but idk. That’s the only thing that I could come up with which could potentially be terrifying if there is a cellphone turning on in our apartment that we have been living in for 5 months. Neither of us own an extra phone, especially a burner.

One last weird occurrence at this apartment was when I was about to leave I heard a weird noise come from the upstairs apartment, as if somebody dropped a bowling ball on a slanted wood floor causing it to bounce then roll. I just brushed it off as it was probably just some Airbnb guests making their usual stomps and bangs from upstairs, but I didn’t know that there were any guests staying that day bc it was 7pm and I hadn’t heard any noises besides that all day. Not even footsteps. As I was driving off, for some reason on that night I was curious if there were even any guests staying there at the moment. I decided to just drive around the perimeter of the apartment and noticed that all of the second floor’s lights were completely off as if nobody was home at all. Which was kinda weird cuz what made that noise 5 minutes ago?

Let me know your thoughts on what could have made the “Venus” noise?",14Dec2020,1
278,"Hey! So I'm almost 18, and I have a really good job offer in another state..I've always wanted to move to this state and it's literally my dream, I've struggled with depression, anxiety, adhd, I grew up poor, I've been bullied, and I have had no friends growing up...I'm not trying to give you a sob story, but these mental issues are important to why I feel so guilty! Having no friends growing up made me independent....maybe more independant than I'd like, but it's what I'm used to, I just wanna move away from my family and live my dream life by myself..but I've always been super sympathetic and worried for everyone and I dont wanna leave everyone behind, yeah I'll be making a lot more money, but then my siblings have to grow up poor just like I did, and they'll have a high chance of turning out a mental mess just like me. Where as, if i stayed, I'd be able to help out financially and give them a better life. But as I stated before, I dont wanna worry about anybody other than myself..I'm scared to have kids, I dont wanna be responsible for anybody else's life.

I’m the shy smart guy who doesn’t do a whole lot of talking, and gets embarrassed easily. I’m not involved in sports really because i’ve discovered it’s clearly not my thing (8th grade and 9th grade “B” team starter for basketball, felt like shit the whole season, made me depressed). Huge fan of the NBA though! I’m here because I don’t know what to do, and am looking for advice. I’ve been very introverted my whole life and never developed many strong friendships with a group of people I can truly call close friends. Now, it looks like it’s too late. Everyone has their little groups that have their own schedule and their own agenda, and it just doesn’t feel like I can do anything. I want to have a girlfriend to talk to, who I can love and be loved by. I want to have the joy of looking at my phone and seeing a friend invite me to a party, and confidently accepting the invite knowing that I wont be standing in a corner afraid because I don’t know if anyone will accept me. As much as I would love to be involved in a friend group that I can trust and feel welcomed in, there doesn’t appear to be any clear path to achieving that. I fully admit it’s my fault that I didn’t get involved in stuff in the past, but am I really this screwed over?

282,"First a little background, I met my now best guy friend in college last year. We started to get close around August of this year. He was very flirty, I asked him if he liked me and he said yes. He assumed that met he and I were 'talking'; I went with it because he is a nice guy and I wanted to see where it would go. Fast forward about a month or so and he had a female friend that really liked him, I told him that if he was interested in her he could pursue it as we weren't dating, and in my book, we weren't exclusive. He told me that he wasn't into her and they have only ever been friends. A ton of drama later I found out that he was leading her on the whole time (cuddling with her, sleeping in her bed, etc),  but broke it off with her when I brought it up. I broke it off with him because I don't date people that lie to me. He stopped flirting with me for a few weeks then it started back up again, I had to explain to him that I only viewed him as a friend now.

Now present day, he and I are still very close. The flirting stopped, up until recently, one night I was drunk and I sent him a Snapchat selfie. He told me that I was perfect. I said 'How so?'. He said all these nice things about me and I replied ""awww I love you man (as a friend of course)"" and he said I love you back but without the friend part. Just a reminder I was drunk. So I ask him how he meant that and he told me that he is romantically in love with me. I rejected him in the nicest way possible telling him that he is a great guy but I don't feel that way and I value our friendship etc. Now he keeps flirting with me. I don't know what to do I thought I made it clear. I am starting to see someone new and I have plans with him tomorrow. My guy friend coincidentally asked me my plans for tomorrow and I told him I was hanging out with new guy and he got mad at me. 

TLDR: I rejected my best guy friend 3 times and he continues to flirt with me. He is now getting upset that I am seeing someone.

What do I do? Should I cut him off? I don't have many friends so ideally, I would like to keep him in my life.",14Dec2020,1

Now I find myself wanting to break free of the digital enslavement we suffer under the internet. This is the last and hardest frontier of isolation to accomplish.

Recently I've been having heart pain and I want to research to find out if it's a concern but I don't know how to describe it so I'm hoping someone better with words can help. It comes randomly but it will hurt when I breathe in and if I keep breathing shallow it continues to hurt but if I take a deep breath it feels like something moves almost like the feeling when a tendon in your hand moves or something and then it stops hurting. I have no idea how to describe this to find results on the internet though. Is there a term for something like this I can use? Thank you.",14Dec2020,1
297,"ok so I am 19f and in my second year of college. I know a lot of people but don’t feel like I have any real friends. To be fair I went to community college for a semester and lived in a new city where I knew no one then covid happened and i took a semester off and went back home. Now i’m in another different town with roommates and online school. Every “friend” I have is from high school or my roommates (3 of them) which in the back of my head I know I won’t talk to them once I move out. I have had convos with one of my roommates where we discussed how we wanted more friends etc but with covid it is hard and i guess i said something along the lines of “I feel like i don’t have real friends i connect with” I think she took it wrong and thought i was making a diss at her (which I totally wasn’t in my head i thought we mutually agreed we are nothing alike) anyways today i came home after hanging out with a high school friend and was talking with the same roommate and said “I love (name of high school friend) but it just feels weird” anyways long story short she pointed out tht i talk a lot about feeling like i “need new friends” etc and i started to feel bad because i was like am i the problem why do i feel like the friends around me are never the friends i need. Is it because i’m just self centered and think they aren’t good enough? and that just isn’t it. I have been going down this rabbit hole now and realize i’ve always felt like this. the feeling of having friends but not really. thinking my real friends are out there or my “group” is out there. Why can’t i connect with anyone. I just wish i could find ambitious driven creative people who didn’t party all the time and wanted to grow, and now i feel like crap because my roommate probably thinks i’m narcissistic and don’t think anyone is good enough for me. but that is not what i’m thinking i just don’t know how to describe what i’m feeling. Am i a bad person ? I just don’t know how to separate these people from my life because then it gets lonely or they will judge me. like I want to work on my hobbies etc. and shut out the world but there will always be a roomate barging in to talk about how bad their day was or a “friend” calling to rant about something else negative and i would rather be alone at this point but i’m scared of backlash and judgment how do i slowly remove myself from being friends with this roommate without seeming like mean or upset because with quarantine we have become “close” or at least to her, but to me it feels superficial. I don’t want to chat for an hour about her problems or even mine i’d rather work on my life. Anyways i’m just sad and confused because i feel like i will never meet people and all of my friends are so different i couldn’t even bring them all in one room it would be so weird and at the end of the day i don’t feel like any of them “see the real me”",14Dec2020,1

Here’s the scenario, pls let me know.

We were just in a car accident, we were sitting at a red light and someone hit us from behind at a decent rate of speed.
Damage was minimal but all of us who were in the vehicle are experiencing whiplash symptoms, sore/stiff necks, back pain and tenderness.

Police were called and took statements and information was exchanged.

We were able to leave and drive home,vehicle had minor damage but now I have to go to work tomorrow where my job is labor intensive.
I am worried if I wake up too sore or unable to work,and I don’t have any sick time or vacation time I will not be paid.

Tonight she told me that when she went to the police, he beat her up for doing that. He has told her multiple times he will ruin her entire life. 

I said, ""why are you staying"" and she answered she is afraid of him. I asked ""so how is leaving worse than staying, you think hes going to hurt you anyway"". I said ""how can you do this around your daughter? How can you show her this as an example of how you allow someone to treat her mom""

I have never been in this situation.  She told another friend and he had her call the domestic abuse hotline and she said they were completely unhelpful.  

I haven't been in her shoes, but i know some redditors have been. What does she do?  She's really afraid of her life staying with him.  I think you are afraid staying,  then also ne afraid leaving. At least leaving hes not around you or your child.",14Dec2020,1

305,"*Throwaway account, all details and names are anonymous.*

Since April 2019, I have been working in a web development company. I'm self taught in front-end skills (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and I was lucky enough to score an interview. While I did not get the job as a web developer, I was offered a simple administration position at $30k. Given that this was the best chance I had to get my foot in the door, I accepted.

Since *day one* I have been wanting to become a web developer, and I've made this explicitly clear to my boss since they interviewed me. They told me that I would be in the admin role for about 9 months, and then they would ""move me up the ladder"" to a support tech role, and eventually into a web development role. Around the 7 month mark, I successfully moved into the support tech role, but only part-time, so I still had to do my administrative duties. So at this point, I'm working two job roles. My boss and all my coworkers are amazing, and I absolutely love the company and work culture!

A few more months go by, and before I knew it January 2020 arrived, which was officially 9 months since I started. In addition, I had completed a coding bootcamp I started a few months earlier to help sharpen my skills to become a developer. However, I was still working in the two job roles, and was then told by my boss that they wanted to wait ""a few more months"" before talking again about moving me up.

At this point, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, but I suck it up and kept learning everything I can about being a developer. My boss and coworkers are mentoring me in so many different ways, and I'm very happy to have them as teammates.

*Then March 2020 roles around, and so does the COVID-19 pandemic.*

We are all ordered to work from home until further notice. The company quickly underwent changes to accomodate the new world we're living in, and I'm still working as the jack-of-all-trades. 

Recently, in addition to the two job roles I've been doing, I've been voluntarily taking on more and more sales duties as well to help save more money, meaning I'm essentially working three jobs at once now. I now realize that this may have been a mistake, because while I'm staying productive and making a little more money, none of my duties are web development related, which is what I need to grow professionally. (Plus, it feels like I'm going to burn myself out.)

I've been wanting to talk to my boss about these feelings I've described, but I can't muster up the courage to do so. They've been working extremely hard to keep the company going and making sure we are all taken care of, so I know they must be tired as well. At the same time, however, I've got to think about myself and what I should do next.

I’m terribly conflicted if I should say something or keep my mouth shut and continue grinding.

306,"Ive been in a long term relationship with all of my friends and all they have ever done collectively is harm me emotionally. Ive stayed with them not knowing much better. I always thought that they were my friends and at this point it was like I considered them family because we have all been friends since teenagers. 

 I reluctantly agreed to go to Cancun with them in the summer back when I was still working but everything went downhill after I entered in that contract for an all exclusive resort. I paid $335 including premium insurance as my down payment and I lost my premium insurance after my hotel canceled on us due to Covid 19. I still owe $730 and I havent worked since I booked the trip.  I didnt realize how much I really didnt like some of them until a family member had pointed out how bad they were treating me. 

I asked my friend If I could have any money back and he laughed and told me no. Im not laughing, Im actually angry and I feel like crying. I panicked when he laughed. He never bothered to call me after I told him that I wasnt going to go. He didnt even reply to my text afterwards. I wouldnt want to be friends who pressured me into going on this trip with him. He kind of screwed me over. Why go on another trip with him after this? Why be his friend? I called a travel agent after my friend was unresponsive and after being on the phone for awhile with a rep, she confirmed that I still owe $730 whether I choose to go or not.

My home life isn’t that good and don’t have that good of parents. Ive been aware of this for quite awhile but I’ve noticed I’m only ever truly happy when with my friends. When I’m home I’m either just meh or miserable because of this. 

Now about my friends. It’s weird because I have friends but only have like 3 friends I talk to outside of school. This has started to get me because I genuinely fear that I’m going to lose them as friends and then if I lose my friends then I will be completely truly not happy at all. One of my closest friends has a huge friend group who I also get along with but don’t know them that well and only hang with them if my friend invites me. He’s always in discord calls with them and playing games and I’m here all by myself doing nothing and it’s started to affect a lot more because it’s the holidays so I’m not st school with my friends.

I wouldn’t call myself anti social I just blame my lack of friends on my school because it’s not a good school and all the students are just genuinely bad people doing drugs and wagging and doing other stupid shit. 

My other friend who goes to my school who im also quite close with has found this other friend group and has been playing games with them a lot more as well. We normally talked a lot more but now that’s just stopped. So now I’m just kinda sitting by myself messaging them from Time to time throughout the day and just kinda gets me down.

I think I’m just having a shit day today but want to use this to get my thoughts out. My friend can do this thing we’re he ghosts you maybe to surprise you or as a joke and was really really hard today when he was doing this and I needed someone to talk to about some sort of problem I had. Especially when I felt like I was completely alone this shit feeling was amplified.

There are a lot of other smaller factors like family but kinda a bit too personal to get into.

My next thing is this girl I like
She is also a friend of sorts from my closest friend and just started to really really like her for some reason. When I asked to hangout today she said yes and then when we organised a day I said any day was fine with me and she left me on seen. I don’t really know why and when my friend stopped ghosting me said it probably cus she forgot to respond but since the holidays started I’ve wanted to get closer with her so then I can focus on school work when that starts. I get this feeling that she doesn’t want to talk or hangout even though there is tons and tons of evidence that she does. I get this feeling with everybody but is even stronger with a person I like and just don’t know what to do next.

I think a mix of not hanging out with people this much these holidays and my lack of friends, and this girl I like + other personal reasons is the feeling I feel so shit and down but don’t know what to do. Don’t want to talk about it with my friend cus It just seems cheesy and a bit stupid and don’t feel enough support from parents to feel good enough to talk to them. What do I do",14Dec2020,1

317,"So I work with kids and there’s a woman (about mid 20’s) who is super nice and everyone, especially me loves her and her way of teaching and interacting with the children. She loves working as a team and knows how to be a good leader during times when it’s necessary like when our boss is gone and we all have to work as a team to get things done and have the day run smoothly as if she’s here. My co worker is good at those things and she is very verbal when she needs help or when something happens and has to be taken care of immediately and she’s unable to do it. My co worker was never demanding or rude about it and would politely ask. 


Despite the fact that she believes in working together as a team and helping each other out, some of my co workers have talked about her behind her back and said she was “bossy”. They’ve even said that they were extremely angry with her even tho I believe what she did was considered right and not bossy at all. I asked them what she did and they explained that she refused to change a baby and that she was just “standing there” at the doors during drop off. I was super puzzled because that doesn’t sound like my co worker at all. Turned out, she was busy taking kids to their parents and she was the only person there so she asked someone available to change a baby since it was time for the baby to go home. After that I was even more baffled since in my opinion, she wasn’t bossy over that. I just think that my co workers are either misinterpreting or they just claim she’s bossy when she really wasn’t? My concern is that drama might raise from this and I believe in a peaceful work environment and I thought everyone would believe in that as well. Especially since last year we had someone start a shit ton of drama in hopes that people would quit. 

Is my co worker just doing something that is considered right? Or is she really bossy? Every time I think about this, I get super confused and sometimes I would wonder if her asking us to help her when help is OBVIOUSLY needed is bossy since others have interpreted that as being bossy. So it confuses me. I’m just worried that everyone is gonna start gossiping about her constantly about being bossy when she clearly isn’t.

321,"As background information, I come from a family that is upper middle class, and my cousins are definitely upper class.

I recently graduated high school, and my cousin wanted to buy me a pair of shoes as a gift - I gave her a few options ranging from $80-$200 AUD, but she rejected them and told me to find some more expensive ones, as this was a graduation gift.

I asked her what the limit would be, and she replied with $600. I was shocked (as any normal person would be, as my shoes that I currently have are around $100-$150 in price) but I believe understandably excited, as this would be the first actually expensive thing I would personally own.

So I did my research, and ended up settling with a pair of shoes that came to around $570 (in hindsight, I definitely should have chosen something maybe around $300 but I can’t do anything about that now). I sent it to my cousin, and boom boom, now I have a new pair of shoes being delivered to me. Bear in mind that this was during Black Friday and cyber Monday sales.

My parents were aware that I was getting a new pair of shoes, but I think I neglected to tell them the price. This was my fault.

Today, the shoes arrived and I eagerly opened up the packaging to have a look at them - my parents were present. They asked how much they were, and I replied saying “Less than $600” and they flipped, telling me that I wasn’t allowed to accept them, and that I have to find a way to return them for the money back.

Here’s the issue - because this was bought during sales, and online, nonetheless, returns are not accepted, and my cousin is adamant on my keeping the shoes.

We typically have funny engaging conversations, however he then asks me how I feel about him masturbating. to which I respond that it is good healthy and normal but porn can get in the way of relationships and intimacy he then confesses that he was watching porn as we were talking... I SWEAR TO GOD.  he asks me if I felt that he changed after he came LIKE WHAT... im in the middle of finals week I could be studying but I felt guilty for not talking to him and he does this someone help .",14Dec2020,1

327,"
He started out by saying he remembers the first time he met me so vividly and when we first started to date. Like he told the whole story of waiting at a friends house for me and my other friend to come over and he immediately was into me when I walked in the door. We talked about all the cute things and jokes we used to do. How we used to face time all night and fall asleep together on FaceTime. How we would beg our parents to let us hangout and spend the night. How we used to fuck everywhere and all the crazy sex stuff we would do. He told me he still has my sex toys in his closet hidden. He told me how nice it would be to fuck outside and that’s kind of his thing. He said he’s been hiking lately and it would be nice to have sex on the trail. I asked if he got to do that nowadays and he said he didn’t. That it wasn’t fun with someone who wasn’t down for it. 
I said we probably just fucked a lot cause we were young and horny but he was like no it also was just amazing chemistry. 

We talked about old trips together. Like details about our trips and he said it was so fun to have such a good time with a partner and fill in the gaps we had in each other’s memories. We Swapped pics of places we went to in the past. He earlier had told me that he has been on extended vacation solo and that it is fun but it is so much better to be with someone who actually appreciates the types of trips and that is hard to find. He says it’s better to have a shared experience with someone who really appreciates it. 


I told him I’ve had partners who requested I didn’t sleep naked in bed and he said “what? I would def want you sleeping naked in bed”

We also talked about life goals, nature, travel goals, life philosophies, exercise, the first few years of us dating 

He said he misses me and loves hearing my voice and can’t wait to talk again after I am done with a long stretch of working.

We stayed up till four AM and he always talked about how he was on such a good sleep schedule nowadays and always went to bed at ten but he kept saying it’s ok I can stay up later. No big deal. I can stay up. I kept making sure he didn’t need to go

I barely use it unless I’m really bored. Now this one guy I matched with is really cool.

336,"Hi, so I actually just made a post a few days ago about a situation between my roommates (who are also my boyfriend and my friend) and things have actually gotten about 100x worse since then. Not sure how to link the other post for context on mobile but TLDR: my friend wanted my boyfriend to pay extra rent for having his desk in the living room &amp; taking up the common area.

We’ve been in the apartment for about 4 months now. Backstory, we found out our university wouldn’t be giving us housing over the summer. My boyfriend and I knew very little about what apartment hunting in a big city would be like, and we were also staying together far outside of the city so we couldn’t go look at places ourselves. I was really stressed because I also had to concentrate on finding a job for the semester to pay rent, so my boyfriend told me he’d handle it and not to worry about it so I pretty much checked out of the process to focus on finding a job. My boyfriend’s dad put him in touch with a realtor that he knew, and he sent us a bunch of places, where we ended up finding our apartment. He also took our friend around the city (she lived closer) to view the apartments. 

I know I will sound like an idiot, and I admit that I am for this, but I had no idea that this is what brokers do and that we would be charged a fee - I thought it was just someone his dad was connected to and didn’t question it because I was focused on other things. I had no experience apartment hunting and didn’t plan to be doing it until I was out of college. My boyfriend and friend didn’t communicate much with each other though this viewing process - I basically texted the group chat like “hey, bf found a realtor guy who will help us find a place!” And my friend went around with the realtor and sent us videos before we settled on somewhere.

My boyfriend was under the impression that because of new legislation in the city, the landlord would pay the broker fee, not us. The broker was also very vague about this when asked, saying himself that typically the landlord pays. We never signed a contract or anything, and the situation was quiet until now. My boyfriend’s dad just emailed him and told him that despite trying to arrange things to have the landlord pay the broker fee, it actually fell on us and we each owed the broker one months rent. My boyfriend’s dad paid the lump sum already, and it would just be sending him the money at this point. This is a LOT of money for me, and I cried for hours when I found out, but ultimately I knew that it was my mistake in not making absolutely sure there would be no fee. I also know his dad well and he has been very, very generous toward me in other capacities, so I wanted to pay the money back no matter the circumstances. I suggested a payment of $100/month, and his dad said I could pay whatever I could contribute and not to stress about it. 

This news came out right before my boyfriend was leaving for the holidays, so essentially, he had to bring it up right when they were already discussing the issue with the living room. My friend said that according to the math, he should pay an extra $300 per month if he wants to keep the room - he said that he would pay $100/month extra but anything above that was asking too much. I suggested moving the desk to my room, but they kept going at each other over numbers and things were already getting heated. I was essentially just sitting there watching them argue. Then my boyfriend breaks the news about the broker fee.

Essentially, my friend says she was under the impression from my messages about setting us up with the broker that my boyfriend would be covering the entire fee if he was the one bringing the guy in. We all agreed that we would have never used the broker had we known we would be charged. She says it’s not fair for her to pay the fee because it’s been sprung on us 4 months later. I completely understand where she’s coming from - I know that I would’ve never signed on to taking a $1200 fee, but it was my mistake for not asking more questions at the start and my positive relationship with my boyfriends father makes me more inclined to work things out with my own funds and find a way to pay it. The arguing gets worse, and my boyfriends temper comes out and he says he’ll just “fuck off and move out.” They’re both very angry at each other and at this point I consider the minimal relationship they had with each other to be done. Then he has to leave for the airport. 

He sent an apology text to the group chat (I suggested it, but I didn’t make him or write anything for him) and my friend didn’t respond. I talked to her after he left and I told her I talked to him about apologizing and that he shouldn’t have gotten angry like that, so maybe she didn’t respond because she thought he only sent it because I told him to (that wasn’t the case). 

He’s now back with his family and I’m in the apartment with my friend. I’ve just been avoiding the topic entirely to not make things awkward. My boyfriend called me today and said he spoke with his dad, and he said that he’s not going to do anything about the desk in the room until my friend agrees to talk about paying back the broker fee. I really don’t want to live in a hostile environment, especially since I have personal relationships with both of them, but I don’t know what to do. I asked my boyfriend to try to be a peacemaker and not let his temper get the best of him, but he only promised to “match her tone.” He also mentioned he even looked into the cancellation terms for the lease in case things got really bad. I don’t see this ending well at all - my friend seemed adamant about not paying the fee.

What do I do, if anything? How can I make this situation better? 

TLDR: Live with my boyfriend and friend. When we were apartment hunting months ago, we didn’t know the broker fee was getting charged to us and just found out now. Friend doesn’t want to pay because she would’ve never agreed to a broker if she knew the fee (none of us would have) and since it was my boyfriend who set us up with the broker, he should be the one to cover the fee.",14Dec2020,1

348,"Hello. It's my first time posting and this issue has been occurring since the beginning of the pandemic.

You know how the older generation likes to peep on facebook and somehow fake news is shown to them? My parents fell victim. 

They started to beleive in it. Anti-vaxx, conspiracy theories, and recently fake news about COVID-19. 

Since the vaccines are currently under development, some even in late stages, we're close to getting it. Theres videos of some quack doctors saying how the vaccines aren't effective and how people will develop negative xyz symptoms. I know it isn't true. Even if people say its ""rushed"", it had to be because of the urgency of the situation and the effect it has on the livelihoods of people. I tried to explain how it got more funding by donors to develop it quicker, even though a regular vaccine takes 2-5 years (or more). 

My parents called me ""bullshit"" and kept saying that the younger generation ""is so full of themselves because of the amount of resources we have nowadays"" and I'm like??? Yeah?? We should be grateful for the amount of information we can get our hands on, but we should also be wary of the amount of false information too. No matter how hard I try to convince them out of the fake news they spread, it doesn't work. Even if I present them with facts. They won't listen to me because I'm ""young"". I'm not even a kid. I'm 17. 

I asked my friends for advice and tried to explain to my parents about the false information they receive from facebook but they just won't beleive me. I've asked a friend of mine to ask his mom (who is a general physician) to explain to my mom about vaccines and how they work. They're friends too. I'm worried it might cause a fight between them, but I don't have any other choice but to ask an adult to correct them since they won't listen to me.

353,"My relationship with my parents is fine. Except when it comes to emotions. Whenever I talk to my mom about something like stress, I get so annoyed when she immediately jumps to solutions and I don’t know why. 

Like when I tried to talk about school stress after I broke down crying in my room, I talked to her and she started talking about making schedules and plans. I don’t know why but this annoyed me so much. I told her that i just wanted to be sad for a moment and that the plans weren’t helpful to me at the moment, but she got defensive immediately. I acted out in emotion and told her not to say anything to me. I cried and cried until I just wanted to be comforted, and I went back to my mom. But this time she just stared at me. I begged her to say something. I pleaded and sobbed and she just stared at me. 

She does this thing a lot during arguments or when i cry where she says that “she’s concerned about me” and she is “mad at herself for being such a bad mom”. Both of these statements just make me feel worse. I tried to confront her about the latter one today, saying that I didn’t understand the purpose of her saying that, it just makes me feel worse and like it’s my fault she feels bad. I also said that at this point, I didn’t even know if she was being serious or if she was intentionally trying to make me feel guilty. She started speaking in a really soft voice and said that by telling her this, I was accusing her of conspiring against me or something, I didn’t really follow. I feel pretty guilty now.

I am just so confused and I’m not sure if I’m constantly in the wrong here. 

I don’t talk about emotions with my dad because I never have. A lot of times, it’s hard for me to even look him in the eye. When I was crying about stress as aforementioned, all he did was stare at me and say “cornflowergoose, don’t cry. it’s just stress. everyone is stressed”. 

I just... don’t know how to talk to them ability this stuff anymore. I think it’s worth mentioning that I live in an Asian household, so there is more of a taboo around the conversation of mental health and people are encouraged to keep their feelings shut down. Now all I talk to them about is stupid stuff like animals and cat videos, I don’t even like to tell them much about school. I don’t know what to do.",14Dec2020,1
354,"So my dog is acting super weird, as of the past hour and a half maybe. She suddenly is in her bed which is in front of mine and she is just staring at me then looking away repeatedly, looking around erratically btw. She seems jittery, she licks her tongue out every once in a while, when I call her to my bed she comes up to me, but hesitates and then goes to lay down or go back in her bed and whimpers a little bit. Her pupils are extremely dilated, she allows us to pick her up and pet her but she won’t move around much without having to suddenly lay down on the floor. I have no clue if she possibly ate a pill or something, maybe she is contact high? I smoked weed in my room maybe a hour or more ago,but she wasn’t in my room at the time and only came in after I had smoked, plus I have my window open the whole time to let out the smoke, so I’m not sure if she would have gotten contact high.

We've put our roots here, the walls are covered in photos of my family over these ten years and now we probably can't even afford to stay in Washington. 

Everyone floods in messages offering to talk to them if we need anything but you can't ask someone to pay your mortgage. All of our extended family lives in Oregon, and they've got no more money than we normally would. We've got no family we could stay with, fuck I've got probably $200 to my name, I don't even have an ID cause the places in my city wouldn't let me book an appointment. 

Fuck 2020, Fuck Cancer. Fuck. I don't know what to do, I don't know where to start, I can't afford anything like a realtor or therapy, idk if we even have insurance anymore or if that ended yesterday when my dad passed. It's so hard to stop and grieve when I'm worried if we're gonna have a home in 6 months. I just want to go fishing with him again, sit at the lake and catch nothing, talk about the birds flying around and the clouds, listen to a rant about politics. He always knew what to do",14Dec2020,1

I am selfish and childish and I dont listen to what they say fully and only get hung up on details. They dont hate my feelings they hate the way Express them in a childish way and in the non communicative way. 

They told me we should go on a break for a while. I know friends dont do that.

How can I change and how do I apologize? And is it to late to amend for my previous behaviour?
I really understand how they have felt. I told them I'd contact them in january again but is that to late or early?
How should i approach the apology?

But she’s straight (20) and i’m bi (19).

Cait had a boyfriend! We had a little flirting time for about a week and she thought she liked me and wanted to kiss and see if there’s anything. I said no. We flirt for about 3 more days teasing and stuff. Then we kissed. Made out. Then after she says “i didn’t really feel anything.” i told her i felt something. she stays with her man and im still her best friend. they break up. we start doing things like making out, sex.

361,"I strive to be logical and emotionless about all my decisionmaking, although I do things like weigh emotional factors into value estimates. I'm entirely selfish. My goals in life do not involve enjoyment, they're quests where I have to get specific things done and then can pass away gracefully. 

For many years I've gone back and forth between being good and evil, and I have very personal feelings and complexes of longing for either. I'm not expecting anyone except a sinister best friend to advocate for evil, but I hope someone in the comments of this post can convince me to be good, despite being who I am. That is my purpose of making this post. 

I know morality not only as restricting oneself from intending to do unjust violence but also being cautious to uphold some respects for just people. Respects like agreeing with what they proclaim about their ownership of property, being cautious to not invade their privacy, and holding oneself accountable to providing reparations if you break their property. With morality, you wouldn't just do these things to not get in legal trouble or have a good reputation. I believe morality is a curtosy and, therefore, all people who are moral are nessesarily altruistic. 

When I asked people why I should be moral, they mainly touted the fun, safety, and health benefits of it. These aren't valuable to me because I don't live for fun, believe a sufficiently-smart evil person can avoid danger, and believe optimizing my health by getting proper nutrition/exercise/rest/etc is enough. 

So, have we been evolutionarily hardwired to be addicted to doing things not in our best interest? If that's what the delicious warm feeling that comes with altruism is, then it's literally more sophisticated to be evil than good because choosing evil involves forsaking instincts to make a value-oriented intelligent decision. I also reason that if selfishness is the utility-function of humans, morality is irrational. This is why I believe it's paradoxical to attempt to convince someone to be selfless by explaining the personal benefits of it. 

Then, if not for personal benefit, do people who choose to be moral do it for (or out of) love? I ask myself ""why is that important?"" and the answers I repetually get seem like they're self-evidently correct, as though love is, itself, correct. I love the anime No Game No Life, but I'm disgusted by the ending song of **No Game, No Life the Movie: Zero** because it implies the philosophical 'reason for living' is love. It seems to me like everybody who's in love is too drugged up to have rational ideas about love. 

With what I currently know, I have almost no hope of living out the 'epic anime hero' fantasy I had as a child. This is funny because I literally believe in the possibility that I'll be able to cast spells more than the possibility that I soberly choose to be moral. 

Finally, I add to this discussion that if there's no logical way for a person of my archetype to be moral, this has a lot of bleak implications. One of which is that the only intelligent species we'll probably ever get to interact with is made up of creatures who are almost all either devoted fools or predatory. Is this where the heros come in?",14Dec2020,1
362,"Ummm so I’m 25 M and my psych who must be mid - late 30s lives in the street behind me. 
I found this out because I recently moved. Now, I knew she lived in this general area because well, she did disclose that to me which is ok because the town on a whole is quite large. 
Then when I moved I had a phone appointment. There was a familiar dog barking in the background. She asked me how I was going and I said I moved, I described how much I liked living in close proximity to X,Y,Z and she said “oh, you must not be too far from me” (and obvs couldn’t say more than that) although she didn’t say, I could tell from the tone that I may have been uncomfortably close. She asked me if it’s ok if she says hello if we bump into each other. I said yeah it’s cool. 
Then this morning I saw her dropping her kids to school at the end of my street on my way home from the shops...
That’s when I did something bad, I followed (at a distance) and saw her turn down the street behind mine. 
Later today I decided to do a sneaky drive by, and yep. 
Yep. 
She lives behind our next door neighbour. It was our neighbours dog barking. 

Um.....
Right so. I kind of feel compelled to keep driving past, but I know that’s wrong. But now I am SO FASCINATED. 

Would she have access to data that says I live here? Did she know this the whole time? She works for a big org so I wasn’t sure if those details would be kept with admin. 
I feel like I need to drive past a lot just to suss... but I know that is weird!

Now I can be friends and I don’t get shy with women but when I start to find them attractive is when I start to choke up.

366,"Some backstory, my best friend is staying at my familys house temporarily because he and his parents got into a big argument, as of now he is completely avoiding his parents and doing everything he can to (in my opinion) not solve the underlying issue.

While he is staying at my house he secretly began dating my sister behind everyones back which makes me feel like they both betrayed me.

Even if I did support their relationship it would be a super toxic one as my friend is not one to talk out and solve issues but will use other methods to try and psychologically get baxk at the person he is mad via different means.

Right now i really dont want to talk to any of them and when i do i just get a sinking feeling in my stomach. He has been living here for some weeks and is starting to act like he owns the place.
It would be hard to somehow force him to talk with his parents because my sister would try and stop it abd everything would descend into chaos.

**What is Pink Clouding or Pink Cloud Syndrome**

Pink Clouding, or Pink Cloud Syndrome, is a phenomenon many recovering addicts experience when they first recover. When the pink clouding, they feel a sense of euphoria which is then followed by a shock once reality sets in. When you are in phase of pink clouding or pink cloud syndrome, you feel safe and excited for recovery in life.Feelings can vary from person to person. For most people, feelings are short-lived. After the detoxification process, many recovering addicts feel very good about their recovery.They see how their life is possible without drugs and alcohol. But they must realistically channel their feelings to continue their sobriety. At this stage the problem with pink clouding or pink cloud syndrome is that it doesn't last forever, and sometimes getting out of this stage can have a negative impact on your recovery.......

Keep cash, if you have a bike get on it. Pack a bag and don’t take anything you don’t need.
Leave a note in your house that’s not too easy to find but you have to leave one so they know you weren’t kidnapped or killed
Delete social media and contacts
keep a weapon
If you make it don’t go by your real name make a new one
I told them to pack canned food and warm clothes check the weather, couch surf and keep quiet.
They have money and everything I said but I never really tried to talk them out of it.
They said they were running away and I told them what the needed. Keep in mind I’m a kid, not even 16 I am a child. And they are a year younger and they are running away

They called me a ni##er on multiple occasions and I just ignored it because my boyfriend is close to them and they made him happy but it’s getting annoying.

376,"The biggest issue me and my girlfriend have is my issues with jealousy, almost every time my gf and I go out or she goes out alone I seem to get really jealous of anyone she’s overly nice to anyone and I assume she’s out flirting with everyone this causes a lot of fights where she says whiny like
 “why don’t you trust me”
 “So I can’t have friends” 

So my first question is am I being an over reacting controlling bitch because that’s how I feel after we fight. 

She has cheated on her exes and she dows this thing called dissociation a lot she has a lot of mental health issues and I try my best to understand and help her cope although sometimes it’s hard.

She’s from another state and she’s going back home visit family for Christmas and she has lots of friends their and old exes and I just don’t know how I’m gonna cope. 

She says I have no reason to worry but She told me she’s kissed her old best friends partner and doesn’t really feel bad about it, and every time she is out I just picture that scenario but it’s her cheating on me.

2 of My best mates from highschool admitted they had a crush on her one of them actually asked to fuck her and “just don’t tell her she doesn’t need to know” 

Our old mate we met him together (we knew him for like a month 2 max) always wanted to hang out with her alone or while I was at work and when we would go out he would tell my gf it’s free but the next morning he would come to me and ask me to pay he would call her babe and it would hurt my feelings a lot I could feel my heart hurting every time they were alone but I knew it was important to her,

One day he took her somewhere while I was at work and they were supposed to go back to his instead after she messaged me saying hey he wants to take me somewhere so we are gonna go their first and I got shitty coz why he gotta take my girlfriend places ya know.

I told my gf multiple times I didn’t like it and every time it was “I can’t have friends” “I can’t do this anymore” 
“Why does it matter” then she would say fine I’m not talking to him but continue to talk to him and every time I had an issue it really upset her and I would think why are you so connected to this guy we met so recently. 

Also am I overreacting? Do I have reason to get upset?
How do I cope with her going away and not be an asshole?",14Dec2020,1
377,"I’m a 22 year old female, and my life is pretty decent actually. I have the loveliest boyfriend and family that I’m forever grateful for, but I feel very unfulfilled.

I’ve been unemployed for most of this year because of corona, and after graduating uni last year with a media degree I’ve lost my purpose. I’m still skilled in this area, but unsure if I want to do this as a graduate job. I don’t have any long term aspirations either except to travel in a few years time once I am financially stable.

I’m currently working as a supermarket temp. In these times I’m lucky to have gained a job and I do enjoy it, but it’s a bit mind numbing and I often think to myself there’s got to be more to life than this.

I love having a positive impact on others and making my mark on the world, yet here I am repeatedly scanning items at a checkout for those who don’t even remember my name. I’m an adventurous person so my boyfriend and I occasionally go for roadtrips, theme parks adventure activities etc. which is amazing, but I feel like I’m constantly chasing these temporary highs.

I keep telling myself that where I’m at at the moment is just a stepping stone to a better future, but I’m so unsure of what that is and where I want to go next.

378,"I'm a 19 year old Indian girl who resides in the Arabian gulf. I'm not a good narrator and it's lengthy so please bare with me.
I was born and raised in the UAE. I don't have a lot of friends. My family comes from a conservative South Indian Locality. 

Both my parents had a terrible past. My father's relatives were alcoholic and my mother's family didn't have sufficient money to maintain. Her dad died when she was 13.
My whole(dad,mom, bro and I) family is introverted. We don't talk much to others,attend parties or even invite them due to a certain incident that happened 13 years ago.(My dad was betrayed by his cousin).All seemed fine until I reached my teenage years.

I don't have much hobbies. I didn't even bother to try some.But I do like learning new info back then. Studies were my pride. I held it like a trophy case.

When I was 14, I started being sensitive for strange reason. I start crying when someone scolds me. It's irritating....

Indians treat 10th and 12th grade like a life or death situation. Even though I'm in the gulf , I go to an Indian affiliated school. So when I was in 10th, I cut myself thrice.(Just a small line).After my 10th, I got my results... 10 pts (This was 2017). When I got it... I wasn't happy. I wasn't able to get the same score in 12th. Just 81.6%

When I was in 12th I had a huge crush on this guy. I always run early to the buses just to see him after school.But then I found out he was dating someone...that quite had an affect on me. I thought he'll be my shining night in armor who'll rescue me from this shithole life I got. A year later I messaged him( I believe he broke up), but he seemed to take no interest in me. So I thought it's best to leave it be.


Things went South when I came to India for my higher studies. I struggled a lot trying to get new friends. My anxiety always kicks in when I talk.The culture is so different. I'm always in the lower ranks and sometimes even fail.The teachers force me to attend remedial classes or they'll threaten my attendance.(Attendance affects grades).This took a stroke in my pride. And it started affecting me. 

Around the time of my internals of second semester , I panicked. I couldn't face it , I felt like throwing my books whenever I start studying. My uncle suggests to go to psychiatrist and when I went there I found at I have depression.

That's around the time when the pandemic began. Lockdown was a nightmare. I kept contacting my old school friends but I feel like I'm annoying them despite them saying I'm not. I tried to make new friends but they always seem disinterested.( I'm terrible at conversations so I understand.) I can't stand some of my relatives in India. They are very envious, loved to guilt trip my father , selfish and had a strange addiction to making rumours. My father would take all their bullshit despite  me and my mom raising concerns about them. He always lend them money, buys gifts whenever he comes to india.

After lockdown, I was able to return to the uae and reunite with my family. Things become a lot better for me but I have these horrible thoughts :

Will I get a job?
Will I forcefully get married? Would he abuse me?Would he force me to have children?
Will I pass my Under graduate?
Am I burden to my family and friends?
Am I horrible being ? Then why can't I have new friends?
Will I ever have a boyfriend?
Am I ugly?
Am I crazy?
Am I a good for nothing human being ? Am I worthless?

I look up and I see him intensely looking at the tv  behind me. And he started jacking off himself harder and harder. I look up to see a girl on the tv who was in lengerie being seductive with another man. He than says he’s gonna cum and which he did. 

She was a quite pretty girl, great body too. Anyways... while we finished and put out clothes back on... I made a remark. 

I said “wow I noticed you were really horny this time” and he said “well is usually am” (that is true so I let it go”

Than I mentioned how we wasn’t looking at me and looking at that girl on tv and he said “what? She’s not even that hot”

I laughed and let it go. He left my house now to go home. But I can’t help feeling sad and

So I cant go around sleeping with random women or get on social dating apps.

Just know people get cheated on and girl cheat on guys to get good or great dick. Im not blind. And as far as marriage.

388,"Kind of a long read, sorry. About three years ago, a close friend of mine got me a job at his workplace, we were daycare teachers. After a year of working at different locations, he ended up transferring to my location, something I was initially happy about, but I knew that with him transferring to my site, I’d become his superior. Regardless we were best friends, spending pretty much all of our days together. 

After some time working together, he would start to become upset or question my authority if I tried to ask him to do a task or if I asked him to do anything at work, which would start to get me upset and angry and made me slowly stop wanting to work with him. It eventually blew up into this awkward power struggle that our other coworkers would often become witnesses to and it was just a mess. I’d chat with him about it, and how I’d just be doing my job and he’d seem to understand, but the following days after our talks, nothing would change, he’d still combat whatever I’d ask of him. Keep in mind I would always be professional when asking him to do stuff, as I was with all of my coworkers.

Last year in November, there was an occurrence where he was talking shit about me to a coworker and that coworker ended up approaching me and telling me about it because she felt uncomfortable. I pulled my friend aside and told him that I’d appreciate it if he didn’t start bad blood amongst our coworkers. And he agreed, but then the following week he ended up doing it again. 

In a fit of annoyance on my end, I ended up telling my supervisor about the occurrence, to which she chatted with both of us together, afterwards things were fine for about a week. Then out of the blue, she moved him to a different work site, randomly. Since that day, he has refused to talk to me and has proceeded to ignore me to this day. I haven’t heard him talk or had a convo with him in over a year and we were best friends. 

Knowing him as I did, I knew that he would hold grudges and get upset and stay upset at people.
Chatting with my wife, she says that I’m probably better off not having a friend like that, but it’s been so tough. I have very few friends now, and I’ve been feeling lonely in terms of friendships since Covid. The thought that things ended so abruptly has always been hard for me. 

I texted him in June wishing him well and I texted him today wishing him a Merry Christmas but with no response.

Should I just let it go and move on, or should I keep trying to reach out in hopes to fix our friendship?

Thank so much",14Dec2020,1

390,I just started a new job at a corner store and it’s family owned by a married couple. I get paid under the table and it’s really chill I like working there. The husband (my boss) is a very nice guy. He’s a little touchy but not in a rapey way. He likes to hug a lot. He’s middle Eastern and I know that’s culture. But today he kissed my cheek while I was sitting down writing something. Like he tried to hug me and I moved my face away from his because I felt him trying to kiss me and it landed on my cheek. I’m kind of confused right now this just happened.,14Dec2020,1

393,"Yesterday , my friends and I were supposed to start working on a project on campus at 11-11.30ish , I told them I would go earlier as parking was less of a hassle then ,and I would study until they got there . I called them at 11.45 to ask where they were and they were still getting dressed , then they ran into the campus parking line which made them late another hour so they arrived at 1.30 , they didn't even apologise and we had to go to class and didn't get to work on the project.
I tried telling them that it feels like they don't respect my time but their excuse was that I was already at uni so they assumed timing was flexible , and I really don't blame them for the delay of tue parking but me waiting 1 hour is still too much , and it messes up our progress in the project which they also aren't taking seriously .

They're not friends but the usual lads I see around the streets. I guess it was because I was the canny kid that could talk things through all the time and I'm friends with many well known people in our area. But people will leave if I'm there or anytime I laugh a lot they up and leave. Yeah I laugh a lot before I fight. I don't even question why I do it. I make eye contact pretty much all the time and others look away. Me other m8s gets treated normal even though they've hit more people then me. Yeah so I don't want to the intimidating hard lad.

395,"Okay, that title is pretty bad. I'll try to clarify.

So, I have enjoyed writing ever since my older childhood/young teen years. I knew I was not good at it per se, but that used to never bother me all that much. At that age, I just enjoyed the act itself.

But, now, I've entered the stage of adulthood. And throughout the years, things have shifted. Things lead to another, and I, unfortunately, develop depression. For the sake of being truthful, I will admit that it is undiagnosed, as I never decided to get checked out for it due to personal reasons surrounding my family. But I've suffered through enough sadness to understand the difference between ""feeling down"" and having a constant struggle throughout long periods.

I know this is somewhat irrelevant, but if I'm going to seek out advice, I'd like to be sincere.

Due to that depression, enjoying hobbies is a battle within itself. A lot of my activities were affected, but my joy of writing had been hindered the most. I loath the act, and everytime I attempt it, it just shoves my failures of trying to appreciate it again in my face.

I've discarded most of my early works, only a few left uploaded on a forum I barely ever come back to or somehow remaining on my device. I can only ever really complete small poems, which feels like mockery, as I'm unable to complete something bigger than that. My attempts at creating short stories or concepts for future novels are either scrapped, abandoned, or scorned by myself for their lack of quality.

I don't know how to enjoy the process of writing a story anymore, and whatever I put out, even if liked by others, I cannot stand to witness without criticizing for being amateurish.

I could chalk up my disliking of my works as me just needing the experience to get better, although my self-deprecation would still hinder my capability to approach my works fairly. But, what am I supposed to do about fulfillment? If I'm not having a good time writing it, is the slow improvement even worth the hassle?

The easy answer would be to quit writing, right? This is where the crux of the problem stands. I hate writing, but I like creating characters, key moments in a story, timelines, dialogue, etc. I enjoy developing a story more than I do actually making it.

I want to write, because it brings these ideas to life. These ideas that I enjoy and wanna see happen. But I hate writing.


I wanna learn how to care for writing again and finally break this pattern of trying, failing, trying, failing, and onward. But I just don't know how. If I can't learn how to, I'd at least like to find an alternative. But, I'm either too ignorant to know of a solution, or there's not another act quite like it.

I'm sorry if any of this is unclear or seems like ramblings. I'm wanting advice, of course. But I'm also using this as an opportunity to cope. A way to express my dissatisfaction.",14Dec2020,1
396,"So a little back story...I'm 18 and still in highschool. I lived with my dad, step mom, and step mom's family (which is my niece, two nephews, brother in law, and granny) I'm pretty much my step mom's right hand man. I help clean around the house sometimes, watch kids while she runs errands, take care of animals, and help with granny...
 My niece and older nephew have to do online schools since covid and I do as well. I said I would help my step mom with that but for about a week straight I was doing all of their homeschooling with them. My granny was in the hospital for some of that week and i was watching 4 kids at the time and I simply asked my step mom, ""when are you coming home?"" I told her I'm a little bit behind on Spanish and she said earlier it wouldn't take long...she snapped at me saying, ""I'll just take the kids and put them in the hot car while I'm in the hospital"" I told her please dont, if you come back, dont take the kids with you. They are fine. She ends up coming back and putting them in the car and yelling at me how I'm lazy and selfish and I stay in my room all the time. (Side note, i try staying in my room as much as i can cause 1.i have school work and google meets, 2.ive been so depressed to the point I dont want to socialize with the family, and 3. She's always asking me to do stuff as soon as I come down) she told me my phone bill is due and to have 40 dollars on dresser or my phone and left. I didn't put my phone on the dresser and I couldn't even do my work after that. I packed my things in fear she would kick me out cause she was like ""go ahead and live with your sister""cause I talked about moving in with her after I graduated. 
So next day I had act precoding and I decided I'll take the bus and just walk home. My step mom said yesterday, ""I won't ask nothing from you ever again""...ok I won't ask nothing from her again, I'll walk home. (Side note again, I never cause any trouble in the family, I make As and Bs and never had gotten into any type of trouble, I do what my parents tell me and that's that) so my dad ends up driving me to school cause he has work around the time the bus comes so he dropped me off. I go take me act and walk home. It was 2 or 3 miles so wasn't long, my step mom messaged me when should she pick me up and I didnt reply cause I didn't know what to say I got home where she drove by me asking why didnt I call her and all I could say was idk. I end up taking a shower and leaving my phone upstairs in my room and headed downstairs. My step mom instantly said give me your phone and I said why, what did I do? And I ended up heading upstairs cause my phone was upstairs and i was worried about my safety and getting to my phone. She followed me upstairs and I ran and locked the door. I called my sister screaming and crying to get me while my step mom is breaking down my door. I yelled at her to leave me alone and why cant we talk it out and she wasn't having any of it. She broke my door down and tried taking the phone while I was still on the call with my sister. She tried pulling me off the window seat but failed cause I'm much taller and bigger than her. At one point I said she was hurting me cause she clawed me and she said she didnt do nothing and kept trying to grab the phone. I said ""can my sister pick me up"" and she said, "" Go ahead, BYE!"" So I told her to pick me up and then my step mom snatched my phone and left...my dad came home few mins later screaming my name and I instantly fell to the floor and covered my head (I was scared he was gonna beat me cause I never done anything like this and I never seen him so pissed, plus my mom told me how abusive he was years ago) and for the first time I peed my self a little from being so scared. I never been so scared...he screamed at me to the point i could feel his spit hit me. He constantly said, ""Fuck you, OP!"" And he said,""I own your ass till you graduate!"" He even said that my sister is not getting me or it would be trespassing and he would call the cops...my sister actually had to call a police escort to get me out cause my dad also yelled at her. When the police officer came, my dad tried whatever to make me stay. He even told a lie that my step mom told him saying I pushed her down the stairs....I got a few of my things and left...it doesn't end there though 
He's ""acting civil"" with me while I try getting the rest of my things. I have to make a few trips cause my sisters car cant hold that much. So we made one trip so far he had all my stuff packed in black trash bags in the van...none of my furniture is there. The thing is...I ALREADY PACKED and so they unpacked my stuff and pretty much took whatever they pleased. I could even keep three totes or containers I had my stuff in. I bet my xbox or ps2 is not in my stuff either...but we made 1 round and one of the things i grabbed was my guitar that my mimi bought me....well they broke and now i cant play it. They also put a piece of my FUCKING DOOR my step mom broke! The sad thing is i have to act civil just so i can get all my stuff. Pretend like i didnt see it...some other stuff was broken to which was my two pig banks which one of them is plastic and so they torn the head off of it....I also planned on taking my cat but my dad said, ""she's the family cat and the kids and your step mom like her so she's staying"" BULLSHIT...he never wanted that cat and I was the one who took care of her. Yes he fed her while I was gone but really?!?! I already cant have my dog cause ""family pet"" and I was already fine with that cause he pays for her vet bills  but my cat?!? She was a stray and stayed outside but did really well inside and I love that cat. He didnt even like her. He would scare her all the time. I planned on taking her to the vet when I get a job and money. All of a sudden, they wanted my cat...COOL!...they just keep taking it's to the point its affecting me mentally. I never have nightmares until that stuff happened to me. I get really depressed at random times and I cant sleep at night. Couple years back I said I wanted therapy cause stress and also we found out my dad cheated on my step mom with my step sister (she's 25)...I never got therapy though...I tell them I'm depressed and they throw it in my face saying, ""I dont get depressed. You're a teenager going through hormones."" Before I left I cried myself to sleep a lot...but yea I say my parents are entitled and honestly I have no clue what to do anymore...I get really depressed some days and sometimes feel like I deserve this punishment...idk...I need advice.",14Dec2020,1

400,"My boyfriend (22M) refuses to drink water unless I (24F) dye it blue and call it gamer juice.

I know that this post seems completely ridiculous, and trust me when I say that I think the same. I'm at my wits end here.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year. I'm a casual gamer (I play just a few hours a week) while he's much more invested. He dropped out of college, and when he's not working at his part-time job, he's playing video games. This usually doesn't bother me, as he often invites me to play with him. He's a good boyfriend in every other way, and always manages to make time for me despite his gaming ""addiction"".

My boyfriend is about 50 pounds overweight, and I'm sure this can at least partially be chalked up to his lack of a healthy diet. He rarely eats anything actually healthy, and while the two of us have tried to go on a diet together, he quit after about a month in, and gained back the five pounds that he lost within two weeks. He very rarely drinks water, and usually prefers soda or Redbull. Needless to say, he's really unhealthy.

Recently, one of his online friends mentioned something called ""gamer juice"", and my boyfriend asked me to make it for him. All it consists of is water and food coloring, and I assumed that he was just memeing, so I figured ""why not"". I made him the water, and to my surprise, he actually drank it.

The next day, I tried to give him some actual water, and he completely refused to drink it. I feel like I should at least be trying to get him to drink some water, because it's incredibly unhealthy that he never drinks any, but I think it's totally ridiculous that I have to do this for him. It seems childish, and while I chalked the first few times up to a joke, it's pretty clear that he's serious about this. He doesn't want water; he wants gamer juice.

So, Reddit; what do I do here? Do I keep giving in to his gamer juice demands, or do I be honest about how insane this whole thing is? Help me!",14Dec2020,1
401,"hello, long one ahead

so one of my friend (say A) went back home due to covid. So,A says my other friend (say B) and me, to pack all his leftover stuff and hand them over to his relative who lived about 1-2 hrs away from the place i live. 

so i say ok to my friend, and so does B. but B lets me to ask A to buy dinner for us . he said that , he doesnt want to work for free. initially, i hesitated, but then asked A, and he agreed. was this correct on my part?

So we pack everything, take the things that would be useful for us (obviously only those that A allowed). and his relative comes, and takes all the goods and B hands over the keys to the landlord.

A also pays a dinner amount to our bank accounts and he messaged me thanks.

TBH I felt that he should have told us that all of his valuables were handed over correctly and thanks on call directly instead of a message,

and 2 days before l my thought to B. and he says that you should not expect for free, and you got a dinner for the work done. then i said ok. I wanted the thanks but I was not angry.

today, in the evening, A calls me , and asks me whether i am angry on him. which I was not .he asks a sorry for not saying thanks and i understood that B would have told to him about this. and i confirmed from A , that it was B who told him. i just told A , not to worry and i am not angry at him atall .

however , i dont like what B did, what should i do next .do i confront him for telling the comment that i made about A to A himself.???? and 1 more thing , if he was going to say this to him , then y the f\*ck does he say that i received the money for the dinner and i should nt expect the thanks. is this called hypocrisy???.",14Dec2020,1

Me refusing the job won't even work. She still wouldn't get it. I've thought of every thing.

407,"My master's thesis is a group thesis and we are three students. We just had to submit our research questions and methodology last night. I worked really hard to come up with the variables and research questions with our limited data, read many papers, thought critically, did everything you're supposed to do when you know, working on a thesis.

My team mates, on the other hand, despite me asking specifically no less than _three_ times 'can you work on the classifications and the methodology', decided copy and pasting methodology from the study we're considering replicating, was enough. Before that, they had essentially written 'our methodology is we will use python' and i had to nudge them and tell them, no, this isn't acceptable for a methodology so they instead gave me plagiarism.

And this isn't all. I do all the talking with our supervisors each meeting. Not because I hog the microphone and I like to hear myself speak, every time I arrive they're like 'oh gilgameshen had things to say' so I'm forced to speak. I purposefully go silent many times but literally no input whatsoever. Because they're not even thinking critically or analysing or contributing anything that isn't me assigning tasks to them. And what's even _worse_ is while I'm doing all this fucking talking and they're just listening, they don't even take NOTES. I still have to provide notes at the end of the fucking meeting. 

Our supervisor asked us to send a summary of what we talked about, I had only had time to write down answers to questions so I asked the others if they had taken notes, and said no but they remembered everything. Asked them to send summary but they didn't. 

When we had to submit our literature review structure and overview, we sat in call and I had to come up with 6 ideas to write about because they weren't contributing anything.

I believe this was just a simple unfortunate disagreement that went way out of control (They thought I was furloughed, but I wasn't eligible for any government help).

Offered  to fix my mistake for free &amp; start over.

I'm planning to spend time with a romantic interest tomorrow, which I am looking forward to. On the other hand, I have severe generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, and know with 99% certainty that I will have a crippling anxiety attack. When I have anxiety attacks (once every one-two weeks) I feel a build-up and then vomit the contents of my stomach. I'm filled with such pure terror that nothing can seem to stop it. I can't control the vomiting, and I am fearful of the reaction other's in public may have (rightfully so) at the sight of a stranger throwing up.

In short, I really need to know how to mitigate such anxiety in this situation. 

I have medication, which helps to some extent, but I have ran out. I've seen this person romantically once before however am certain that I will experience the same anxiety. Our last date went very well, but I still have large concerns and fears surrounding the impression I might make.

Are there any things I can do that may assist me in the moment? I just want to mention, breathing exercises, lavender, and other conventional anxiety-reduction techniques are not an option. I am filled with such irrational pure dread and terror which nothing but time can stop.

416,"Recently I have been constantly thinking about how I've wasted my life. I was one year behind in school. It took me 7 years to finish college and now I'm struggling to get by at gradschool. At 26 I never had a job, a girlfriend or any life experience. I'm getting closer to 30 and I have nothing. I keep seeing 20-23 years old excel in life and here I am, unemployed having to live with my parents again. I don't like anything about my life or myself, I feel emasculated for being so useless and dependent. Now I've started to smoke and drink heavily because honestly, when I'm drunk at least I don't feel like such a failure. 

I feel like I wasted my prime years inside my room, studying and playing videogames. I have friends from college who have now stablished careers in high paying jobs, where I spend my days drinking whine and eating noodles. The more time passes the more pathetic I become, stuck in in passenger's seat of my own life, to scared to take the wheel.",14Dec2020,1
417," (Warning - I'm still not that good in English, so please excuse any grammar or punctuation mistakes if you notice any.)

I have an embarrassing confession to make that is related to my thoughts, fantasies and life in general. So, I'm going to spill each of my dirty secrets and mortifying life incidents in here today.

I'm a 16-year-old Asian girl living in a strict and conservative family. A bit overweight people might say cause my body is, I don't know, curvy or big maybe? Well, a few days ago, I weighed myself and turns out I am 132 pounds already while my height is still the same - 157 cm. Though I did lose a ton of weight, compared to how I was one of the obese kid growing up in the family. People even predicted I had some sort of disease.

I never considered myself beautiful though, but I don't hate myself for it, and instead of starving myself or doing any kind of self-harm, I flourished my personality and attempting to maintain positive energy around people. But deep down, it's suffocating to have these negative thoughts screaming in my head. They restrain me from being open and confident about my body. Looks like just accepting the fact that I've got no good looks is not enough for me to not fear people's judgements. Also, if this wasn't discouraging enough, my acne just got severe this month, to the point it turned into an infection. Now that I am on my medication, my face has healed a little, but not entirely. After all this, it should be considered a crime if I call myself beautiful.

Now coming to my awkward life incidents - So, I’ve always been more of an outgoing and extroverted kid who loves to make others laugh with her witty comments and quick tongue. However, with one cousin brother (six or seven years older than me) it would often be a little awkward. Like I need to be really protective and careful about myself while acting casually with him at the same time. Considering how, when he was 13 or maybe older, would try to check me down there at every now and then and even touched me once. One of the few things I can remember from that night is the pain; he pressed on the wrong area and it was fuckin painful. I was young enough to understand anything, so that incident died in me in silence. No one knew. Year's passed, and it remained a bit awkward between us, He acted like nothing happened and I did the same. Like, even if his hand would unintentionally touch my body, I'd immediately predict it's intentional.

In this post, I don't wanna lie at all, so no matter how offending it sounds, I still wanna spill it all out. When I turned 14, I started fantasising about him doing his way to me. Not only him, but I also fantasised myself with older people like one of my teachers. It soon stopped, though.

Now I don't want any kind of sexual interaction at all, and as I started getting my life together, my other relative brother started acting weird. The only kid who’s younger than me in the family, so of course, I adored him to bits. But two weeks ago, he tried to touch my breast, pinch nipple and even tried to stuff his face in them, it took me a few seconds to realise what he was trying to do and I told him off immediately and he stopped but before I could tell him why it's wrong to touch someone without consent; we left from there due to an urgent meeting Dad had. A week later, his parents called us over for dinner again, which I refused to join and my parents came home telling me how much he missed me that night.

But after this incident, my fantasies are going wild again. I daydream about getting manhandled by my uncle, and that's terrible! I don't know what's wrong with me. Now that I'm putting these on the Internet, I feel like I'm decorating my pain. It feels like I'm craving for attention.",14Dec2020,1

420,"So I've been living in a shared student housing apartment and while I generally expected sub optimal conditions, I didn't think I'd have to deal with my utilities being decided they are unnecessary and being shut down.

 I live in FL, US so the temp here has only been cold a few nights this month. Tonight the low was 67. This is pretty regular, and its safe to say basically every commercial business still has its AC on cool when you walk in the door. Needless to say it gets stuffy in an apartment with no crossbreeze ventilation, even during December, especially if youre using the oven.

So. Last week on wednesday, the AC stopped working so that only warm stale air blows through the vents. I immediately went down to the office and submitted a work request to have it fixed, I thought to myself maybe it just went out. After returning to my unit, less than 15 minutes later I feel the cold air come through my vent, and promptly after a knock on my door from the maintenance guy. I open the door;

Maintenance: ""Its fixed.""
Me: ""Alright thanks. You guys working on the systems or something""

And I shit you not, the guy replies

""You don't need AC.""

I was absolutely dumbfounded. I tried to begin with ""Hey man..."" and he cut me off saying ""its fine now!""

All I could do is slam my door. I wasn't even ready for that. Like how the living fuck you gonna tell someone what they do and don't need. I literally pay for the rent and the electricity here.

So anyway, air is fine rest of Thursday and part of Friday. But by Friday evening as the warm air came in it was clear they had actually turned that shit off again. They don't work on the weekends. 

Its Monday morning, and I'm gearing for battle with the office staff when they open. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I could proceed here? I plan to look through the contract literature to see if there's anything about maintenance in there. Apparently FL doesn't have a law for requiring landlords to keep AC running. But still the lack of fairness in this situation is killing. I've never dealt with shit like this before",14Dec2020,1

424,"So my friend offered to watch a movie with me. And he wanted to watch a Star Wars movie. I recommend the best movie and most iconic on in the saga which was Revenge of the sith. He liked it. He said it was decent. So he wanted to watch the next one with me. I was very busy but we finally got time and we watched the next movie which was the first movie in the Star Wars saga.  He kept complaining about the characters. It was kinda funny but he just kept going and going. Kinda made me feel shitty. He suggested watching this one so it wasn’t my pick. But still. So I suggested that if he doesn’t like this one we can watch the more action packed ones. Cuz he said the one we were watching was boring. He didn’t wanna watch the more interesting ones I suggested. He said we will do it later. But he kept complaining and complaining. So I said let’s just change the fucking movie. And we watched the more interesting one. 5 mins in and he’s already complaining asking “What is going onnnn” in a bratty tone. I didn’t answer cuz u knew he’d just keep complaining. 

Idk if I should ask him what’s up or what cuz he sounded mad agitated too. He asked about the character he hated if he’s gonna be in this movie. 
 I said he won’t be shown in entire movie but shown towards the end as a clif hanger. He said “Way to spoil the movie” I said “you don’t even care for the character” he said “True” I just wanted to leave. He kept bitching about how boring it is.",14Dec2020,1

426,"A couple of years ago I had to let go of one of my then best friends. We were about 18-19 at the time, and we'd spend almost every minute of the day either hanging out or texting or communicating in some degree. We played Yugioh together competitively and we'd stay up all night very often just hanging out and whatever. But then I found out that he was abusing his girlfriend at the time. And my entire scope of him changed. He would show her pictures of other girls he knew and threaten to leave her for them. He would make her change her clothes if he didn't like what she was wearing, and if she refused he would make mean comments about her and the clothes until she went and changed, he would tell her where she could and couldn't go and who she could and couldn't be with, and on a few occasions, he hit her. He mentally and physically abused her. As soon as I learned of this (his girlfriend, who I was friends with at the time, told me it all as she ended up cracking and pleading for help. I saw the texts, the bruises, everything) I cut ties with him. There was no big blowout, I helped her break away from him and find somebody who could help her, and I cut all ties to him.

But 3, approaching 4, years on and I still can't let go of it all. He was my best friend and to go from seeing eachother everyday, to not having spoken in almost 4 years, fucking hurts. There is nothing he could say or do that would make me consider being his friend again. I'm not saying I want to get back in touch, but I would be lying if I said I didn't miss hanging out and the laughs we had.

428,"My close friend, who I really love and appreciate, is gradually showing more toxic signs. 
It makes me scared.
I’m not really sure what’s considered toxic or not, but this just gave me that vibe;
Whenever they’re in a bad mood, or sometimes just randomly, they start turning seemingly harmless things we say or do (usually which is not directed at them) against us to start an argument. They subtly play the victim card whenever we disagree, and they complain all the time. Lately about a game we play not going the way they wanted. When I try to brighten the mood with positivity or try to console them they immediately shoot that down and find any reason to disagree or argue about it. They always have to be right, if they’re wrong they refuse to acknowledge it and will keep shooting down any sense of reason in order to come out on top. Because of this, I have no idea how to interact with them anymore.

Of course this could all be the result of some mental health problems, but they seem to be fine most of the time. (I know you can’t really tell from an outside perspective).

434,"I'm not looking for legal advice, just curious about good ways to set and keep boundaries with roommates. I am renting a room in my house out to a new roommate. I have had prior renters, but this one is slightly pushing boundaries. Before she moved in we talked about how being quiet and not using storage space outside the room was important. She agreed, but when it came time to move in she slipped it into a conversation that she would probably be very loudly gaming late at night. I said that would not be OK, she reiterated that she was a big gamer and tried to change the subject to what types of games she played. I brought the conversation back to keeping it quiet and again stated that she needed to keep it quiet. So far she has, I just felt like the conversation was a battle. Then there's the storage issue. She had agreed not to store furniture or boxes outside of her room, yet when I came home from work I found a ton of large boxes and totes filling a good part of my garage. She claimed she just couldn't fit them in the room and pointed out that garage was mostly empty. I told her that just because it was empty does not mean it's up for grabs, I still need to park. She kept pushing the issue with it and then finally agreed to donate some things and buy a bed frame to store stuff under. Tonight was the third incident. My mother who also lives in the home with us was talking about my brother coming to visit us and stay the night on Christmas eve. The roommate chimed in saying she would like to know when he's coming and how long he would stay. She went on to explain that she didn't appreciate when her past roommates had people over without telling her how long they would stay. My mother flat out told her she was just renting a room and that we could have whoever we wanted over at our own home and did not need her permission.

436,"TL;DR

29F, business went bankrupt due to covid, looking at alternate business ideas. Have two financially dependent autistic younger brother to look out for as well. Please help!

——-

Hi everyone, 29f this side. I was operating a Restrocafe in my hometown since a while, ran into losses due to COVID-19 and then decided to close it permanently. I couldn’t have recovered it no matter how much I would have tried. My city was particularly hit bad by covid. I am currently unemployed and have some savings which I can probably use to start a small business post COVID-19. Need an urgent source of income once the pandemic is over.


I can’t decide on what to do now. I want to open a small quaint jazz cafe but I am not sure about the dynamics. Live music and alcohol seems like an exciting job to get into but I have no experience handling a place with music being the main agenda (after food of course). 

I am being requested by my family to open a small boutique for fashionable western clothes but I am honestly done with the entire fashion thing now. I had a bit of an influencer phase in college which resulted in me getting a diploma in fashion styling but I later dropped it as a career when I opened my cafe.

I loved my work. Everything about it. It was very difficult, managing the kitchen and the employees, the entire politics of it but I still liked it. I would have opted for a bar license but the pandemic killed my business. 

The food and beverage industry seems to be saturated in my city at the moment. The population is around 800,000. The income sector is mostly middle class with a lot of prominent boarding schools and colleges in the outskirts. Expect a lot of student crowd as well. 

Do you have any other suggestions? 
I really need to start earning some money. I have two younger brothers who are autistic, so that makes me the sole bread earner anyways.

Over the past few months he has spoken less about his wife and more about an ex from years ago. He said she was murdered the day before her birthday and he was suppose to be there that day but wasn't and it really gets to him (of course it would!), I've told him he should look at going to therapy which he has agreed to do. 

About 3 weeks ago, John and I were talking about a lot of personal stuff, he told me there was an update in her case and that the case has been closed, he didn't give me the details (I honestly didn't want to know) he then told me that he ""has a way out"" . My heart broke as I know that feeling very well (I've got my own plan ready). We talked, we cried and it seemed like he was going to get the help he needed. 

Fast forward and he has been really rude to me the last week or so (kinda started giving me the cold shoulder when I went on a date and hasn't been pleasant towards me since. Sidetrack: Over the weekend he was really rude, I called him out on it over DMs, he still hasnt apologised.) But a new girl has joined our little bubble (not really knew, I've known her longer then I've known John) and on Friday he told me and her that he had just been given an update on the case and that the case was now closed, that day... I didn't say anything, but was definitely suspicious. 

He had previously told me her first name and sent me a photo of her, which he told me specifically, that they used for her obituary. Unfortunately I also have her birth date and death date as it has all come up in previous conversation before. 

So I searched them all, nothing comes up. Not even with the photo he sent. (I'm really into family history so I'm pretty good at finding this stuff) but theres just nothing about her anywhere.

444,"So I have this friend and we've been friend for a year and a half. I used to hang out with her and sometimes with our group circle before, but when quarantine started , I found a new group circle that I get along with more. I haven't been able to interact that much with her and the group circle in messages like before ( it's probably because I forgot how to talk to people except my friends now ).
When she private messages me I only reply with few words and end the conversation immediately. It's not like I hate her or something, it's just that I don't feel like talking to other people.

One day she messaged me that she's making brownies for everyone and she's sending it to her friends so she's asking my address. I replied I don't know our address and that I don't know how we get shipments, she just laughed or something in the chat and ended the conversation. I really would be glad to get the brownies but It just feels wrong that I get presents from a friend that I don't talk too much and kinda cold to

Then today she told me that she doesn't know how she'll send the brownies to me and I don't know how to reply to it.",14Dec2020,1

He won't open any one on one messages so it would have to be under one of his public posts or on his wall. I am in good grace with him we let him stay at our place for 3 months after his girlfriend of 10+ years separated with him. She took him back only to immediately kick him out and now he decided to move across the country, 

I suspect he is drinking again he is an ex alcoholic who cannot have alcohol or it turns him into a toxic person. He is posting low blows and untrue things about my entire husband's family. It does irk me when he posts about his mom because i've seen his mom interact with him and she's bene nothing but nice. I think he spins the narrative to bet he victim in every situation always.

He says things like TO (this family member) and list really personal things or their problems and issues, and then he says they are pathetic and need to f themselves.

Or how everyone in the family has wronged him and they should know the first born hates them and will never speak to them again how God will see how horrible humans they are.

About how people view him as the bad guy but are the same people are the ones that damaged him and turned him into it.

448,"My job voted to unionize last year. I started working there six months ago. I am currently at risk of homelessness. This job is one that requires qualifications/high degree of knowledge, but pays very low.

I was initially told ""it's still being hammered out"" whether I can join, when in fact I was always a union member simply for being hired.

My union is about to call for a strike. It was never explained to me that if we get higher wages, layoffs are a possibility, and I'd be on the chopping block because I'm a newer hire. Furthermore, the person who's been there the longest acts like he's my manager when he's not and is generally an arrogant dick...unless he's trying to convince me to support the union. He's also the person who erroneously told me I wasn't really a union member.

452,"So I've been living in a shared student housing apartment and while I generally expected sub optimal conditions, I didn't think I'd have to deal with my utilities being decided they are unnecessary and being shut down.

 I live in FL, US so the temp here has only been cold a few nights this month. Tonight the low was 67. This is pretty regular, and its safe to say basically every commercial business still has its AC on cool when you walk in the door. Needless to say it gets stuffy in an apartment with no crossbreeze ventilation, even during December, especially if youre using the oven.

So. Last week on wednesday, the AC stopped working so that only warm stale air blows through the vents. I immediately went down to the office and submitted a work request to have it fixed, I thought to myself maybe it just went out. After returning to my unit, less than 15 minutes later I feel the cold air come through my vent, and promptly after a knock on my door from the maintenance guy. I open the door;

Maintenance: ""Its fixed.""

Me: ""Alright thanks. You guys working on the systems or something?""

And I shit you not, the guy replies

""You don't need AC.""

I was absolutely dumbfounded. I tried to begin with ""Hey man..."" and he cut me off saying ""its fine now!""

All I could do is slam my door. I wasn't even ready for that. Like how the living fuck you gonna tell someone what they do and don't need. I literally pay for the rent and the electricity here.

So anyway, air is fine rest of Thursday and part of Friday. But by Friday evening as the warm air came in it was clear they had actually turned that shit off again. They don't work on the weekends. 

Its Monday morning, and I'm gearing for battle with the office staff when they open. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I could proceed here? I plan to look through the contract literature to see if there's anything about maintenance in there. Apparently FL doesn't have a law for requiring landlords to keep AC running. But still the lack of fairness in this situation is killing. I've never dealt with shit like this before.",14Dec2020,1

459,"I many not explain this exactly right, but I'll try my best. 

My personality is optimistic, super weird sense of humor, and nerdy as all hell. I'm proud of those things. My sense of humor absolutely does not jive with everyone, 

One of my passions is that I lead social and travel groups, and in that position I am the best, all-around likable version of myself. I've also been a teacher. For the sake of the group getting along in harmony and flowing well, I am constantly in that ""likable"" state.

But when it comes to dating, I stay in that mode. It's still me, sure, but it's only one side. I keep my jokes universally appreciated, my swear words lessened, my references to things I find weirdly funny off the table. I'm not bland, I'm just not...fully myself. And I don't mean to do it. It happens on its own. My regular jokes and such just aren't there.

As a result, it's hard to make a real connection with another person, because they're not seeing the core of who I really am, not after weeks of dating. The feelings for that person just don't come.

It's not hard for me to figure out why I do this. I have been a people-pleaser all my life. My parents were both distant and critical, so it does make sense.

It's not that I don't WANT to. Or actively try to. But there's something blocking it, to where those thoughts and feelings just don't occur in the first place, so the relaxed, comfortably weird parts of me never have a chance to come out. 

Given that it seems to be subconscious and not something I'm actively doing, how do I get myself to stop?

Leave a comment if you have any questions or want to speak your mind ! Much love ❤️ 


MY STORY (TDLR AT BOTTOM)

*However, to become fullest engrossed in understanding my mindset, I suggest you take you endearing personal time to read this*

What is truly the meaning of life? Why are we here? Why am I alive? Do we exist for a purpose? Is there a god? Well what if I told you I can answer those questions with full certainty, from my own life viewpoint, knowing it is in fact the correct answer? From experiencing almost two years of homelessness.

-MY FIRST MEMORY IS THE 
REASON I WAS HOMELESS

        To explain how I became homeless due to my upbringing environment, I must rewind back a few years. My childhood is extremely foggy, which I’ll explain why a little later. So I will give rough estimates (first age I know for sure the rest I don’t). 
At age 8 years old, in perfect reality, my mother and father sat me and my three half siblings down in the living room of our lower middle class home in Florida. The tension was most likely incredibly high in the room as my siblings were older and picked up on the social cues, but I was very young so I imagine I was still playing around. Until the explanation. I don’t remember any of the full conversation. AT ALL. I was fucking 8 who would. I remember one specific exchange.. maybe 5 seconds.. of that life changing conversation. My father was talking. The tone was calm yet obviously too collected and reserved within his behaviors. I didn’t see this as a problem at 8 I figured he was tired. I continued to not pay much mind to the conversation, as many 8 year olds do. Until I hear, in the most calm, well mannered, thought out way ever uttered. 
“We are getting a divorce”.
 The tone of the room shifted and I see this memory and imagine the whole room consumed in a dark shade while every face but my smiling happy one, is dropping. I picked up on this..
“What’s a divorce?”, I asked in, I’m certain, an extremely wrong pronunciation. 
And again, in the same calm tone, 
he explained in one sentence to me why my life was changing forever. I just didn’t know it yet.
“Mommy and I are breaking up”.
I’m sure as young as I was, I was emotionally devastated beyond belief and most definitely bursted in tears full of confusion and fear. However I don’t necessarily remember any of that. I remember hearing it, and then... well I suppose nothing. It was just. My reality i guess. And that is where my memories began.

-AGE 8 - 10

Fast forward about a year. I was 9 years old. This is where the ages and memories become extremely disconnected and hard to follow. I know things that happened. The age exactly? Not so much.
Repressed memories are a bitch.

I was living with my mom. My brother Ethan, two years older than me, my brother Brendan and sister Tessa were both 4-5 years older. All half blood siblings are also in custody with my mom. I grew up with them from age 1. They’re my family. But technically I’m my fathers only son. That’s important for later.

My mom was showing plenty of signs of depression after the separation. She was a stay at home full time mom, who left work as a phlebotomist to raise her children. My father was national guard and worked at an airport. Being the sole provider. Both having me when they were 19. Respectable of my father. When he left, I was too young to be told the true reason why. I found out at 16 it was because she had become addicted to OxyContin she was prescribed after a very bad car accident. I don’t even remember her being in a car accident. However, my mom disagrees. She explains that the addiction and abuse started after the separation and how my father was actually cheating on her but would not admit it even though he was legitimately caught red fucking handed. Whichever perspective is true, is of no importance. Looking back at a memory I have of her doing nothing but sleeping on the couch or crying for two-three days with one day intervals... I can see how an addiction could’ve been almost obvious to an addict. But I’m still very young and naive. I just saw it as her being sad when I was younger. She never watched my every move, or was down my throat at all, on certain days wouldn’t even feed us. She was an extremely inattentive mother however I was so deeply in love with my mama. I was, and still am, a true mamas boy. She is my hero. While arguably inattentive occasionally, she was the shoulder to lean on. The person to teach me emotional intelligence. She has been sober for years now. Anyway... 

I don’t quite remember how many times we moved. I believe the last time I counted we moved about 2 times from florida to Michigan. At different times. The first one was when my mom lost the house or I remember got evicted. My mom and my entire family including me, destroyed that house. Every light fixture. Everything in that house. Then we left to Michigan. I don’t remember much of this first visit to Michigan but I do remember going back to Florida, livinh with an abusive boyfriend of my moms. Then I remember a specific happening....

- GETTING KIDNAPPED FROM MY MOM

No. Not kidnapped literally. Hear me out. I was 11, and my mother is being carried by the old 70 year old neighbor trying to be nice by letting us live there. She screams run to the car open it and get in immediately. Granny hops in driver, puts my mom in passenger, I hop behind my mama, my brother Ethan hops behind granny. She floors it. I’m confused and unsure what’s going on, already knowing ok my moms not acting right. What’s going on? I asked her with no reply. As we are speeding down the highway to the closest hospital my mom does something I will never forget.
Going probably 80+ mph, my mom, ENTIRELY OUT OF THIS WORLD OFF PAINKILLERS DOCTORS GAVE HER, OPENED THE FUCKING DOOR AND CASUALLY ATTEMPTED TO GET OUT! 
I, as her 11 year old son, had to reach over her seat and close it. Granny puts on child lock.
We arrive at the hospital and they rush my mom inside. She’s gone I’m in the waiting room for maybe a few hours but what feels like eternity. 
I got told I must leave, and because I was a child, they called the next emergency contact. My father.

-AGES 10 - 13

I am going to speed run this time of my life as it wasn’t much besides emotional abuse from a stepmom for about a month. My dad was overseas so I met my new stepmom at the hospital. She picked me up. Eventually they decide that it’s best to send me to my moms again (based on the notion she was sober and I don’t think they knew about all the details at the time). He had just got back but they had set their honeymoon cruise for a certain date and couldn’t get me on it. Typical. Wack. So I flew my first plane to Michigan the next day. I was actually quite excited to see my mama again. She was still my hero and I missed her. Even after my dad said many mean things. I arrive to the airport. She’s late. She shows up and here’s the wrap up:

I live in Michigan for maybe a few months until I eventually get sent back down to live with my father again. My mom was barely around us while I was there. Rarely got out of bed. But was still a loving mom. Brendan and Tessa took care of us. I didn’t know why at the time still. I was oblivious to the world. 

Living with my father who I haven’t seen in what seems like forever, a new stepmom I’ve never met, and a step sister a year older than me. It was hard to not feel like the outcast. However after the constant emotional abuse from the stepmom, I finally convinced my dad to save me and leave. They were having personal problems as well. He leaves and we go to live with his friend Scott. Who I consider now a close relative. 

-THE TRUAMA BEGINS TO BREAK ME",14Dec2020,1
466,"So last night around 11pm I have a niece (4) and a son(6) I went to go help my fiance with something because he couldn't find it. So there's a step. I took a step and I stepped on a toy. You're thinking probably kids should have cleaned up. I know that but when I stepped on the toy I felt my knee go to the back and like lock in place so I had to bring my other foot down so I don't fall. My fiance asked if I was ok. Normally I brush me getting hurt off I told him I'd be ok and I asked if I broke the toy. Yeah I did. So my son is upset so I called both kids to come pick up the toys then I told my son he needs to go to bed he has school in the morning. But my fiance and his mom was talking she said with a smile was ""maybe you should have looked where you were stepping."" So I told (yelling it to her) ""it doesn't matter the toys should be picked up if they weren't playing with it. Also if you were step on the almost dislocating your knee, I wouldn't be laughing, I'd ask you if you were alright. "" Then she was defending her granddaughter ( always have and doesn't do the same for my son, I think it's favorites.) Saying ""they're just kids"" that all she could say. I feel like that she was more focused on the kids having to stop playing to pick up the toys, then seeing if I was alright. I literally feel like I can't feel my knee. Like it's not there. I couldn't sleep well because of my knee. So am I wrong for wanting her to apologise to me for disrespecting me. I mean I will apologize to her for yelling to her, that's all.

469,"Throwaway  time: I'll do my best to keep this to the point.  I'm unsure if I crossed a line in the sand and I need some outside opinions.   A semi-recent ex (23M) of mine (25F) started a conversation with me to tell me that he recently found out he is Covid positive, and later in the conversation I joked about it.  I probably use humor as a tool to evade serious conversation a little too much, but I truly did not think it was that bad until I got his reaction.  To my knowledge he is  exhibiting relatively mild symptoms and has not had to check into the  hospital for an in-patient stay.  We have been broken up since the first  of November.

Today, he texted me  to tell me that he received a positive test for the virus.  He said that  if anything were to happen to him he wanted me to know that we had a  good time together and he was sorry to see the relationship end.  I  wished him a speedy recovery and happy holidays.  The conversation then  transitioned into him apologizing for the events that led to the  eventual end of the relationship, asking me to give him a second chance,  and then my request that he respect my decision to keep the break-up  final.

I said that I was tired.  While I meant that I was tired of repeating the same cycles that were  the ultimate downfall of the relationship, it probably came across as  physical tiredness given the late/early morning hour.  He said that he  was tired too, and my stupid brain decided to try to use levity to take some weight off of the conversation and say ""That's probably due  to the corona"".   This resulted in a very nicely (/s) worded wall of  text followed by exactly 21 missed calls, which I did not answer.  I don't understand the strength of the response, especially because I did try to tell him and make him understand (before the joke) that the break-up was not out of ill-will and I really did want the best for him.  Did I  make a heartless joke about his infection, the same virus of which has  killed a truly staggering number of people of all walks of life?

I'll  add that I was specifically tired of putting up with many of his  personal issues that I would inevitably get blamed for, and that I  didn't think he was tired in the same way, as my personal fountain of  patience has officially dried out when it comes to him . . . but I know that I  didn't exactly say that, and that my curtness and sometimes mean sense  of humor probably came out this time.  So I will admit that while I do  hope that he will recover and do well, like I said a few times during  the conversation before the joke, and that any risk of transmission to his family is  minimized, I am not here for a source of pity or attention, or someone  who will drop everything and rush to make sure he is OK, and at the  moment I truly lack the emotional capacity to be there even in the same  way that a friend would.

470,"his is my first time posting on Reddit so I apologize if I miss any rules and such. Looking for some support with my story on blood clotting. Not sure where to post but this seemed the best I could fine. Also longer post sorry! 

My first clots happened about 3 years ago while I was in Thailand. I had been traveling the country for about 3 1/2 weeks when I woke up and felt an excruciating pain in my left calf. I tried to take some pain killers and stretch but nothing seemed to help. Even took 3 Vicodin and it didn’t cut the pain even a bit. This was my last full day in Thailand so I spent the day trying to ignore the pain and tell myself I just pulled a muscle due to how much walking and stairs we were doing. 

Flew home the next day and the pain didn’t get any better. Two days later I had an intense illness set over me that felt like the worst cold I had ever imagined. This prompted me to go into Urgent Care to get my ‘cold’ under control. I believe everything happened for a reason, as had I not been ill I probably would have ignored the pain longer. My dad has had clots, but I told myself that couldn’t be possible for me at age 27.  When I went in to medstop I was soaked in sweat and the Dr instantly knew something worse was wrong and that I was having a clot. I was sent to the ER right away where I was diagnosed with DVT. 

The next few days were rough, accepting I had a clot. I found out I have Factor V Leiden and a Protein S deficiency which contributed to the clot. However my ‘cold’ never went away. Finally after about 5 days of this my Dr finally ran some test and found out I had Mono on top of the clots. The mono then caused my liver to shut down, spleen to enlarge, and my resting heart rate to sit at about 160bpm (tachycardia). At this point I began to refer to myself as ‘patient 0’ and I couldn’t imagine what more they could tell me was wrong. Once finding this out I was relieved to at least understand why I felt like shit for lack of a better word.  And why I was in such intense pain all over my body. 

A few days later I began coughing up blood clots, some about 7-8cm across. This prompted a CT scan where it was found that there were numerous clots on both sides of my lungs. I can’t even describe the pain these caused and the effect it had on my breathing. As well as the emotional toll this took knowing how serious my situation was. I was on blood thinners for about 8 months before I was taken off. My Dr and I weighed the risk and he felt this was ok. 

About a month and a half later I started to get back to normal and move on with my life. I suffered from some depression after once it hit me how serious this was and that many Drs telling me I was lucky to survive. I went to therapy, got my life back, and even moved to a major US city to fulfill my life long dream of adventuring out of my hometown. 

It’s been three years and on Monday I began to have intense pain in my abdomen. I tried to chalk it up to gas or bloating, but by a Thursday the pain was unbearable and had moved to my back so my roommate took me into the ER Friday morning. They found I have clots on the veins of my small intestine, which is causing the severe pain in my back and abdomen. This pain is so much worse than my before clots. I can’t even describe how intense it has been. I was admitted to the hospital Friday night and have been told I’ll be here until at least Tuesday pending if I need surgery. I had no risk factors for this clot, I hadn’t flown, changed to non hormonal birth control, and use compression socks. Which caused more fear that my body just spontaneously crated these clots. 

I am now 1,700 miles from family, alone in a hospital, where I have been staying the night for the first time. It has been such a scary experience and by far the most painful I have ever encountered. I feel like a baby every time I ask the nurse for more oxy or duladid but I seriously can’t even think with this pain. I am now on blood thinners for the rest of my life which I feel good about. But I fear my mental health coming out of another major blood clot. If you had made it this far thank you for reading, looking forward support from anyone who has been though this or has any advice. 

Has  anyone else had experience so young with multiple clots? How did you handle the mental side effects?",14Dec2020,1
471,"Hi, everybody. I wanted to ask if you thought it was appropriate to gift a $500 bracelet I bought for my ex-girlfriend? She did wear it a lot at first, but stopped wearing it for nearly a year and it has been collecting dust at my house. 

I tried selling it when we first broke up, but it was hardly worth the drive. Now that I'm in a new relationship, I feel like getting her jewelry, and this bracelet kind of fits the bill for what she likes. Now with all that said, I may be bothered by her wearing it at first because it brings up memories of my ex, but it's in good condition and I know she would absolutely love it. 

I was thinking about giving it to her around Christmastime, so it's coming up pretty fast. I guess I should make a decision soon. Do you think I should gift it to her? Thanks.",14Dec2020,1
472,"So with this girl I’m talking to, we’ve both made it clear that we like each other and are trying to build a relationship. However I constantly get this vibe from her that she doesn’t care about me or the relationship as I constantly get this nonchalant attitude from her. However I’ve already expressed this and she has made changes to accommodate me, (mainly being more affectionate and showing ways she cares) and expressed to me that she really does care and loves the way I make her feel and wants to work on appreciating me more. Despite all this, I still constantly feel like she’s losing interest but logically I can see signs that she isn’t but the emotional feeling of this is too strong. But at the same time, I feel so weak by repetitively bringing up how I feel about our relationship and I wanted to ask, what can I do to move forward, and would I be a bitch for asking for more emotional assurance.

P.S.  I really like this girl and this has been a frequent problem in many relationships I’ve had where I’ve felt someone was losing interest and they were but I never communicated about it. Now I’m trying to do something better and different through communication but I feel like a pussy because I feel like I’m communicating too much.",14Dec2020,1
473,"So yesterday my best friend and I were talking about this guy I liked yet relationship wise I can't see it going far. She's the one who brought up the conversation by ""I don't think he's ready for a relationship but if I were you I'd just fuck him."" During this conversation she said I can't ask any questions. 

Now this left me confused because I'm extremely curious to know. Yeah, I'm a emotional person who tends to overreact but I don't want my mind to think the worst. Like since I told her that I liked him she suddenly has the eyes for him. I know if I bring it up, she's going to try and change the subject. Or say ""We're still on this topic?"" And the sad thing is I wouldn't do something like this to her but to see that she would possibly do it to me hurts. The reason why, I'm always there helping her, I'm always breaking my back for her when her other friends don't. So maybe that's stupid of me. I have been by her side through everything so for this to suddenly happen and to know she's willing to hide something from me. Regardless if it involves her or not hurts. If she's interested in him or has an eye on him, my thing is she can do whatever she wants with him. I'm not going to risk a 7+ year friendship over a guy but if that's what needs to happen then so be it. The odd thing that also happened was that he spent the night over her and her baby daddy house, which he never does. I was going to give him a ride home but he said ""that he was good"". Which I found slightly odd because I was hoping to have a conversation with him and figure out what he wants to do. But at this point, I'm over the guessing. 

And she's always wondering why am I so insecure. Yeah I am very outgoing person yet I know who to show that true side too. I don't like when someone has a one up on me. She's a pretty curvy girl who has a very flashy personality. With me flirting, I rather play hard to get, to me it's fun. So I can see why people are more attracted to her. 

So in the situation, what should I do? Try to bring the conversation back up to her and tell her how I feel or be the same understanding person that I always am?",14Dec2020,1
474,"Hello, I was abused a few years ago from a past boyfriend. He broke my finger and would constantly tell me to kill myself.

478,"Throwaway time: I'll do my best to keep this to the point.  I'm unsure if I  crossed a line in the sand and I need some outside opinions.   A  semi-recent ex (23M) of mine (25F) started a conversation with me to  tell me that he recently found out he is Covid positive, and later in  the conversation I joked about it.  I probably use humor as a tool to evade serious conversation a little too much, but I truly did not think  it was that bad until I got his reaction.  To my knowledge he is exhibiting relatively mild symptoms and has not had to check into the hospital for an in-patient stay.  We have been broken up since the first of November.

Today, he texted me to tell me that he received a positive test for the virus.  He said that if anything were to happen to him he wanted me to know that we had had a good time together and he was sorry to see the relationship end.  I wished him a speedy recovery and happy holidays.  The conversation then transitioned into him apologizing for the events that led to the eventual end of the relationship, asking me to give him a second chance, and then my request that he respect my decision to keep the break-up final.

I said that I was tired.   While I meant that I was tired of repeating the same cycles that were the ultimate downfall of the relationship, it probably came across as physical tiredness given the late/early morning hour.  He said that he was tired too, and my stupid brain decided to try to use levity to take some weight off of the conversation and say ""That's probably due to the corona"".   This resulted in a very nicely (/s) worded wall of text followed by exactly 21 missed calls, which I did not answer.  I don't  understand the strength of the response, especially because I did try to  tell him and make him understand (before the joke) that the break-up  was not out of ill-will and I really did want the best for him.  Did I make a heartless joke about his infection, the same virus of which has killed a truly staggering number of people of all walks of life?

I'll add that I was specifically tired of putting up with many of his personal issues that I would inevitably get blamed for, and that I didn't think he was tired in the same way as I was, as my personal fountain of patience has officially dried out when it comes to him . . . but I know  that I  didn't exactly say that, and that my curtness and sometimes mean  sense  of humor probably came out this time.  So I will admit that while I do hope that he will recover and do well, like I said a few  times during the conversation (before the joke), and that any risk of  transmission to his family is  minimized, I am not here as a source of pity or attention, and at the  moment I truly lack the emotional capacity to be there even in the same way that a friend would be.

480,"For the last few months I’ve been feeling regret. Like I haven’t been doing enough with my life in general. I’ve picked up a few hobbies like playing guitar but I can’t seem to get out of my rut. I really long for some company, someone to talk to, for how cliche and stereotypical is sounds, I really need someone to point me in a direction. I can’t keep going on like this, not suicidal or anything I promise you that; however, I feel like there is more out there. I’m still in high school and feel as though I’m missing out on key years of my life, I should be making memories not sitting here. I can add that it’s not always been like this but most of the friends I’ve known since 7th grade have graduated. All I can think about is how good those years were, like I’m stuck in the past. It also hasn’t helped that my grandma passed very recently due to covid and she was one of the last few people in my life that I reminisced about being with when I was younger. All the thanksgivings at her home, warm memories now kinda feel cold, somber. Christmas doesn’t even feel right anymore and I know this year won’t be any different. I want to have genuine enjoyment. I miss driving around in my buddy’s s car, the “Shitplow” we called it, but now he’s changed. And the only times I’ve gone to hang out with people was to do stupid stuff to distract myself. All the memories of my friends makes me want to cry. And sometimes that’s the worst part, for so long I’ve always held myself back from tears, even when I’ve been alone, and when my grandma passed I couldn’t even cry. I wanted to, but all I could get was a small sensation and a lump in my throat. I feel so much emotion that I fail to describe every time when I think of the years prior and I’m scared. One of my friends greatest fears was that he was going to live the best day of his life and every other day after that wouldn’t even come close so he’d be always thinking of it, never in the present. Has the happened to me? Am I living his worst fear?

484,"*** Sorry for long post.

I’ve been dating an introvert for close to three months now. He’s not my type at all so I was very surprised that I was falling for someone that is so different from me. We talk everyday but only have managed to see each other once a month in the span of the 3months we’ve known each other... And not seeing him has been super hard for me! 
He’s studying and has a one year old son that he has every weekend or so when he’s free. So his time has been understandably taken up by focusing on his studies with late nights and quality time with his son. I have a 7yr old daughter who I have shared custody with and currently jobless due to covid. So our schedules are pretty hard to link up to hangout and also give each other time to be alone and unwind from the craziness. He’s finished school for the year about a month ago. And within that month off, he’s been at his mum’s house helping her clean her home to sell on the market and help pack up her furniture etc.

So here’s my issue. 
I’m an extrovert, he’s an introvert. I love talking to people and meshing in groups. But he’s reserved and I understand possibly he doesn’t know social cues, how to open up and just the act of talking throughout the day. When we txt he wouldn’t reply back to me for a couple of hours, eight hours at most because he doesn’t like to be on his phone and he’s constantly caught up in doing something or deep in his own thoughts. So he doesn’t pick up his phone usually. So I wouldn’t ever double txt because if I see he hasn’t replied in a long time, he must be busy so I’ll leave him alone to do his thing. It seemed he’d message me at the end of his day around 11pm.... 
I noticed a lot of the time it was me carrying the weight of the chats and he’s hardly taken interest to ask me anything or pick up a topic to talk about. Anything he put forward was just redirecting the question back to me. So I stopped putting in effort into our chats. I’ve tried my best at reading a lot of stuff about introverts/extroverts and it all said was: ‘it’ll take time for them to open up, so keep pushing the conversation and questions’. So I tried and felt exhausted after awhile. So I stopped once again and I held off to just see what would happen. And he became less and less present in talking, and in return I started to mimic his behaviour of being absent. It was really making me feel super under valued even though I know he has very strong feelings for me. I just wasn’t getting what I needed in terms of attention and depth in our talking. 

I’m just drained from trying to play patient and give him space to be present in his day, and then feel neglected and want to talk but I don’t want to disturb him etc.. It’s just that the bare minimum of dating him isn’t even being achieved that upsets me. I mean we hardly talk. And it just sucks. I’ve mentioned his absence and I’ve mentioned how I don’t understand how he can’t pick up the phone when he thinks of me and act on sending a message to get this thoughts across. And he’s always been very very generous on receiving my frustrations and apologises for not being around and says everything will get better once he’s not busy.
And I believe him like I do but, I just don’t know how much longer I can continue to go along with it.

I figured out that the phone is a big barrier for us because while I’m here loving and awaiting to talk, it’s not in his mind to pick up the phone and send a message. Being right next to him physically is so different because he’s just so lovely and present in spending time together. 

But like, is there more I should be doing? Do I need to take a different angle? Is this doomed? I know he genuinely really really likes me and he’s so lovely and different in a good way compared to other guys I’ve been with. He’s so forward with his affection in person but is absolutely terrible at giving us the right amount of attention to grow in dating if we can’t meet up and he knows this and he confessed early on he knows he’s terrible with his compromising and often neglects. I just..... ugh! 

TLDR: bf is often busy doing things and goes hours without messaging me. I feel like he doesn’t make time to talk with me even when it takes minimal effort to say hello and continue on with your day. I’m not asking for constant messaging, I just get ignored for a whole day and I don’t want to disturb him either.",14Dec2020,1
485,"Hello everybody I hope this was the right place to post, I just don't know what to do. My older sister has been diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis (a lung disease leading to shortness of breath and a compromised respiratory system) since she was 12, and I'm happy everyday she's still with us. She's been taking trikafta the last few months and was laid off by her job back in March so she's pretty much just stayed in her house homeschooling her son (who does not have CF). The problem is that her husband is a COVID truther, he doesn't believe the virus exists, thinks that the whole idea of the virus was made up to control people, and thinks me and my family are crazy safety nut jobs for caring about my sister's health. Well I just found out today he is taking my nephew with him to do a cross country road trip, beginning in the New Hampshire, down the east coast, through the south, and back up through California to get home in Oregon. Because my nephew's winter break begins next week that's the excuse her husband is using to take this trip (oh and keep in mind they are bleeding dry on money for rent and yet he wants to do this trip). He talked to my nephew behind my sister's back about the trip to hype up my nephew up, who's only 8, to guilt my sister into letting them go.

Its bad enough he wants to do this trip now, but again because he doesn't believe in COVID he refuses to wear masks and is planning on making all these stops on their trip. Not only am I worried about my nephew's health and safety, but what about my sister? Maybe I am overreacting, but this could kill her. And if it didn't kill her who knows what kind of damage it could do. She of all the people in our family should never get COVID. Almost all my immediate family including my sister live in the same town, but yet I have no idea what to do to stop this. My sister has crippling anxiety and her husband has learned how to manipulate, guilt, and gaslight her into doing his wishes. So far she is not fighting him on this trip.

487,"So here's the setup:

I (f) love my work. I do recieving in a warehouse that regularly deals with sheet metal and construction. I'm grabbing boxes, driving forklifts, helping the field guys out, it's great!

BUT

Ever since before I began work here, there has been a petty feud with the sheet metal foreman. We share a warehouse building with the sheetmetal fab guys, so it's constantly loud due to the air hammering. The guys on this foreman's crew are great, taught me much of what I know. 

This foreman is awful. We'll call him Mark. He thinks that everyone in the warehouse is too young and petulant to have the positions we have. He HATES all of our team. He walks through our shop at  least ten times a day, handing out glares like candy on halloween. If looks could kill, Mark would be a weapon of mass destruction daily. He disrespects my foreman, talks shit constantly, tries to get us fired, complains about our work ethic. Mark takes pictures of us when we leave and come back from breaks, he waits in the bathroom next to our offices to eavesdrop on us, he's even sabotaged my ability to receive items properly by constantly walking away with boxes and ripping labels from others. He's had a complaint from every female worker in the building, and multiple write-ups.

I stood up to him months ago because I was sick of his nosey attitude and glares. I packed up a coloring book and crayons with a little note that read,"" I worry you are bored, as I see you around the warehouse a lot every day! Here's something to keep you occupied, dear.""
The following week was MAYHEM. Mark, however, kept his job somehow.

The thing is, I can't handle the radio any more. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. They turn up their radio full volume on a classic oldies station. For over a year, I have listened to the same 40 songs, every workday for 10 hours. I used to adore Queen. I loved AC/DC. Even the Beatles have lost their special place in my heart. If I hear Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap one more fucking time, I'm going to go postal. 

It is, however, illegal to scramble authorized radio communications in the US. 

Their radio is a large work radio with multiple powering options. I can't plug in a aux cord to silence it, and water, sprayed on all thinkable parts, does nothing.

491,"I'm 18N-B (Non-binary) AFAB.

I feel empty, unmotivated and like dead inside. Idk why I feel like this and honestly I feel guilty and shameful because I'm not going to college when I should be because I feel this way. I've not been at college for around 2 weeks and although I'm only supposed to go in 3 days a week, I don't have the energy, the motivation to go and I don't understand why. Although the first week and half I wasn't at college because I was unwell, the other half was because I felt the way I do.

I also feel insecure about how I look and that if I go to college, if I attend class I'll be made fun of by people even though I might not and have not experienced this in college, I did experience this is high school where students in my year would comment on how I looked and that wasn't nice and although I always made sure I attended high school, that can't be said for college. My attendance is bad, I don't exactly know what it is but Ik its not good or at least it shouldn't be good.

This year hasn't been the best, its been one of the worst by far for me. I've felt like as the year has gone on the more energy that was drained from me. I wish I could be more open but when I try to be more open my mum isn't exactly the type to sit and listen. She'll say what she wants and the type of attitude I get from that is that if I bring up that i wanna go to the doctors and get tested for depression, anxiety and get an official diagnosis for gender dysphoria then she'll say I don't have those and there's no point but there is, especially for me. Especially since I've been feeling more empty and unmotivated than ever before.

The pandemic hasn't exactly helped at all and its maybe because of this unorganized way of living with college that affects how empty I feel as well. On top of the pandemic, my college's electric based things like our badges have not been available since it got hacked I think and so I can't necessarily access places/spaces I want to use. An example of that would be the gender neutral bathroom/toilet, I can't access it since I don't have an eletric badge thing to open the door to get inside so I've had to use the female/girl toilets when I've needed to use the restroom and that isn't exactly the best feeling for me especially since I feel uncomfortable being associated with being a girl or a lady. 

I think everything has just been piling on top and its causing me to have less and less energy, especially for something I'm not enjoying like college so because of that I'm like not pushing myself to go even though Ik I should be.

I don't know what to do to make sure that I do go. I don't know what to do to have energy again, to not feel empty, to feel motivated.

I was crying this morning cos I don't understand why I'm feeling like this.

TL;DR: I've been feeling empty, unmotivated and dead inside as well as insecure and anxious which is causing me to not go to college. The pandemic and undiagnosed gender dysphoria also hasn't helped.

Can anybody help me understand, please?",14Dec2020,1
492,"Long story short, I sort of Sprained/twisted my knee. I’m an athlete and this morning I was training on my own in a basketball court.

Didn’t feel like a broken leg or anything. I personally don’t think I dislocated my knee since it went back to it’s place. I can walk, but it hurts so much when I’m moving my knee too much.

Question: 

1: Is it an ACL or anything torn in my knee?

2: What other things can I do to fix my leg before considering getting a loan from others and go to the hospital?


Now before people judge me. 

First, I was all alone in the court. Was wearing a mask the entire time, it was 5AM in the morning and barely anyone was awake.

And second I’m a broke college student and I don’t think I can afford medical assistance and go to the hospital as of the moment.",14Dec2020,1

496,"I'm in 12th grade. We started doing online classes back in March and I have had constant online classes for 4-8 hours a day depending on the day. My school year has almost come to an end. Our school system is like none of the homework and stuff matters except the finals which is conducted by an education council.

Online school was fun in the beginning, especially for an introvert like me. I did well for maybe till July. From August, I kind of lost it. I just sit in class and my mind would wander. I would be on Reddit or listen to music or visit some other site on the internet. I seriously don't know what got me, but I can't do it anymore. I really don't want to be this way. I have stopped doing homework and assignments. I don't do any studies on my own during the rest of the day after I turn off my laptop when the classes end. My scores are slipping. I scored 97.6% in 10th grade and now I scored 73% in my mid terms. A literal 25% drop(nearly). I really want to get back on track and do well. I don't want to be the way I am right now.

My school has finished teaching the syllabus and we're doing revision. The finals should have been in February, but has been postponed to a date yet to be announced due to COVID-19. How do I motivate myself? How do I get myself to concentrate in class and study after school hours? I literally don't know many stuff in some subjects.

499,"A senior coworker/manager of mine, who I’ve had a casual but sometimes problematic friendship with (context: no romance or deeper relationship there, but work problems and ethical issues have often seen us on opposite sides), got into writing some years ago. I’m one of the few people who he listens to and asks feedback from/discusses his ideas and life with occasionally, despite my far younger age (he’s close to retiring, while I’ve been with the company for 4 years). Therefore, he also asked me to read his finished first work and tell him what I think. I have experience with literature reviewing so I guess I’m also a natural person to ask. 


I don’t know what to think. It’s...weird, if I’d have to describe it. I would assume it’s poetry. It reads like poetry. I know poetry well enough to usually have a clear view of a new text. But I can’t form any unbiased opinion about this stuff. It seems like a lot of our discussions about ethics in the past years have influenced the book, so I understand why he wanted me to read it. There’s some stuff in there occasionally that’s good or deep but I just can’t say anything concise about it as a whole that’s not going to either crush him or make him angry. We aren’t close enough these days for me to want to discuss the deeper details and work through any anger of that kind. What do I do?

I feel like she is quite a judgy person and very feminist. She hates men or just hates my casual perspective around relationships. For example, I find casual sex to be pretty decent and I have been dating a guy who went through a busy period so he ignored me therefore she thought I should discard him even though he apologised and asked to see me again.
I enjoy sex and I'm speaking about it whenever, I'm very open and I chill but also I am not desperate for relationships so she thinks I'm lacking self respect for forgiving this guy... I thought is weird.
We don't share similar values and it feels like whenever we get together we just rant or she is giving me unrequested advice.

506,"Way too often it feels like during my studies, I accept awful grades just because an assignment feels inconvenient or tedious, or I'm not invested in a class enough to do any work beyond cramming for tests or exams. My grades often suffer because of this, especially in classes where assignments are heavily-weighted. One of my worst examples for this behaviour was a class where one essay was worth about 40%. I didn't want to write an essay, let the deadline fly by, and just busted my ass on the tests and final for a barely-passing grade during a time where I needed to get my GPA up.

Another time, I realized all the assignments were due on the last day of classes, didn't follow the course at all, and then tried to start the work way too late. Twice, I didn't buy my books and failed because of that. Several other times, I just plain didn't absorb anything during lectures and went into denial over the problem until the F was on my transcript. This semester, with online classes being seemingly-easy and distraction being accessible as all-fuck, I managed to nosedive again. You see the pattern.

Sometimes in a class I'll get my shit together, or find a spark of interest that motivates me, or happen to have a friend who keeps me on track. Sometimes I just do well anyway by some fluke.

Sometimes, the problem gets worse as I fall into denial or convince myself that a class is easy and that I can catch up. A lot of the time, soon after this point I hit a ""deer in the headlights"" threshold with how much work I'd need to do and just eat the 0. If I hit this point during finals, especially, I get into some pretty bad thought spirals.

The result is that my grades have a pattern of wildly yo-yoing between semesters. Every break, I tell myself that this time I'll get my shit together and be a good and consistent student but all that resolve crumbles the milisecond classes start. I've tried planners and being more organized, but I barely touch those things and they never help, anway.

So how do I break this pattern?",14Dec2020,1

My mother died when I was young. Addict and schizophrenic. Went in her sleep. I ended up alone in that house with her corpse for a week. If I think about that week for too long even now, I feel weird as fuck. Just dread. Constant dread. Then I got to live with my uncle. Guess he could have been worse, but the guy was feral. He fed me, cleaned me, gave me a roof, helped me, whatever - but he would also beat the shit out of me on the regular. There was some weird sexual shit too (I always got the sense that wasn't normal). I'd get to constantly listen to him hurting whatever poor unlucky woman he'd managed to convince/payed to join him through the walls. He was arrested for murder eventually.

I got the position as Projectmanager for a real big, technical/engineering project in the university.

Since I am a student myself I am not really trained as manager.

The big problem is: people are always complaining about how much time they need to invest for the documentary and planing. (it´s kinda set from the prof)

I made templates for them so it would be easier to write down daily/weekly reports and the plan for their work order.

Well they always complain how much time they have to invest but honestly their work seems really bad and wrote down in like \~15 minutes - I am dissapointed, because I am working for so long to make it easier for them and they still dont deliver anything we can work on.

How can I motivate them more? My Prof thinks he should come out with some bad part-grades - but I think this is could easily go in the wrong direction (it is an elective module, no obligation).

521," at the beginning of the school year, I (18F) made friends with this girl (19F) who we’ll call A. I enjoyed spending time with her at first because we have similar interests, it was both our first semester of college, and were part of the same friend group in campus. Throughout the course of the semester, my relationship with her started to get weird: A was always making uncomfortable sexual comments towards me, always trying to spend as much time with me as possible, and isolate me from our main group of friends. She removed herself from that main group and since then she’s hyper focused on trying to spend time with me and only me. A consistently blows up my phone, tries to get too physically close to me in public, and forces me to spend so much time with her that it has started to mess with my sleep/study schedule. She says that I’m her “#1 best friend” and that we should be doing everything together. I also noticed that A has a few pictures of me in her dorm, and kept some of my jackets I’ve left in her place by accident during the semester. I also heard from her old roommate that she once planned to “push me” to have sex with her, and that she talked about me to the point of obsession. On top of this, whenever I comment about how I enjoy my friend group (the group she left willingly), A is quick to criticize them and claim that she is a better friend. I’ve since been avoiding her as much as I can and I’ve stopped responding to all her texts. Several days ago, I posted something on Instagram about how much I missed my group of friends. Within minutes, A made a post about how lonely she was and that she intends to harm herself. Because her knee jerk reaction to any mention of me with other human life is self-harm or self-hatred related, It’s gotten to the point where I’m scared to confront her about her behavior. I thought I had made myself relatively clear by ignoring her texts and rejecting her advances, but she still finds a way to make me feel bad about not hanging around her. I want to tell her that I can’t be friends with her anymore, and that her obsession with the two of us alone is getting out of hand, but I’m afraid she might actually hurt herself and put the blame on me.

524,"So, going to get straight into it

I was on a dating app, and this dude texts me. He's really cute and he thinks the same of me. It got sexual in chat very quickly and eventually we exchange snapchats. 

Once we add each other, he tells me he isn't 18, but actually 17. He asked if that was okay, to which, it wasn't for me. 

However I'm ruminating on this because for one thing, I did actually contemplate it (and I conveyed that I was thinking abt it in chat). Its legal where I am. 

I still decided against it but I felt bad for him and generally, I didn't wanna take it from 0 to 100 so quickly, so I was pretty non-confrontational about it. 
Which is another reason why I'm ruminating, I feel like I didn't deal with it properly or as swiftly as I should've.

I explained that he had a great ass n' all, and i really thought he was chill, but it was too close for me even if it was a small age gap (though, I will be 20 in January. However he also said he would be 18 in a couple of months so, idk how much that changes things).

(For a moment, I also contemplated waiting until he was 18. K even suggested that but as ill say again in a minute, I thought about it more and I just felt uncomfortable and gross)

He didn't quite get it right away and wanted to at least keep talking as friends. Again, I contemplated it all over again. After all, I do like having simple mutual friends, with possible sexual opportunities.

Ultimately I still decided against it, and kinda continued that back and forth until I expressed my discomfort more clearly. The more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I felt. I told him that I was just gonna block him (and I did) and that I wished him well. 

I dont know. It's a small age gap, people in that range are still very similar and I don’t think its anything predatory. Hell, I've only been out of High School for a year and a half. 

He's not the first 17 year old I've spoken too sexually (though, nothing ever happened in person. It was an anon sort of thing cuz I was bored) but after that other time, I didn't like how I felt afterwards and haven't really done much with other 17 year olds since and have only been with people I knew were 18 (and they were all going to college). 

I feel like a predator.

I've never thought I'd have to deal with something like this.

I know that lots of people dream to be in my shoes right now for that i have money opportunities and materialistic things, i know a lot of people will judge me negatively, however i dont care, it's my life and it'a my decision. 
 
Here it goes:

I've been suffering from severe depression for a while now, i have tried everything to fight it, all the bullshit that exists such as gym, meditation count my blessings be positive, and all that crap. But there's this inner urge in me, that inner voice that keeps telling me that i don't belong here, that's why I'm always unhappy and sad. 
This inner gut feeling is pushing me to get out and leave everything behind and start my own life, my own story, my own adventure. Flee away from home, family and friends. Explore new places, experience new feelings, and try to enjoy the beautiful world we live in. 

I want to leave everyone behind, i know it's 100% selfish but for me, my happiness and mental health should come before anyone's needs. So I've decided that I'm going to leave, with just a backpack and some money, maybe a car. 

I already closed all my social media accounts, and im planning to create a new identity for myself, away from the city and away from the negative environment that has been surrounding me for years.

My wife and I don’t share a credit card so she can’t see it but she does ask to see my account from time to time. As soon as paid I felt sick in my stomach. I even vomited at the thought of myself being so dumb. I still feel terrible and I don’t know if I should just leave it and hope she doesn’t find out or if I should just come clean and see what happens. I really do love my wife and this moment of weakness has really messed me up. What should I do?!,14Dec2020,1

532,"Hey everyone,  
I'm 24 and i'm in my last year of electrical engineering studies. I had a hard time getting where i am right now because i suck at this. In a few months I'll be working somewhere, and it freaks me out because I know  I'm not suited for this. My mental health is getting worse  because of this, i even spent a month at a mental health facility because of how worthless i feel every year. Now i'm wondering about the next step, do i try to get a job (because i need money right now) or try studying something else? (Education is free in the country i'm in so i won't loose that much money if i decided to do it.)

533,"It seems like the only two good looking people in my family are my brothers. Me and my sister aren’t deemed as physically attractive. And so while my brothers get invited out places and have girlfriends and are talked to by extended family members, me and my sister are only talked to by immediate family members and I’m barely even talked to by anyone but my mom. My dad is a jerk and has always been. I live with him in the same dingy apartment i’ve been living in since I was 7, rent free, and he pays my phone bill. So that’s a blessing. But he doesn’t care about my mental health. He barely talks to me. One time, I heard him tell my mom that we were ugly. And she said “those are your ugly kids”. That was when I was really young. It didn’t effect me much back then because I didn’t care so much about my appearance. But I’ve seen how my dad acts towards my brothers attractive girlfriend. He has never acted that way towards me. He calls me retarded and nappy headed. He’s extremely neglectful when it comes towards being a father. He never has told me that he loves me. He never has called me beautiful. He likes my sister better than me. He talks to her way more. And he named the wifi after her lol. Also, it hurts me that none of my cousins, aunts, uncles, ever talk to me.

534,"I’ve just lost my best friend

Soooo today is probably one of the worst days I’ve had of 2020. Me and this girl have been friends since year 3 but when I left primary school we started talking every single day for about 3 years straight and we never had any problems with each other at all. 

However 2 weeks ago she said she was going to take a break from her phone due to exams which I understood and gave her space but after she left my parents were on the edge of divorcing, I started losing more friends and started having an identity crisis, I almost died by getting run over but every night I still said goodnight to her and updated about my day and wished her good luck for exams and that she’s doing well while being left on delivered .... 

But I can see she’s ghosting me by liking posts, her friends posting stories of their dms and leaving me on opened on all snaps whether I say hope you had a great day or asked a question. On Friday it was her graduation and I delivered a letter to her house which is roughly 10 minutes away to congratulate her and thank her for being my best friend for the past 3 years. 

Then today she texted me for the first time in 2 weeks and said I’ve been creeping her out and making her feel uncomfortable because of the constant goodnights and updates and the letter which I completely understood and said she wants to take a break and remain not talking until next year and I was about to buy her a bday gift since her birthday is on the 19th. 

So now I’m stuck here thinking should I say happy birthday to her or just leave her alone completely and also not knowing how to talk or care for my friends and whether should I be checking on them regularly or just leaving them alone and I obviously never want to be toxic. I understand why she would be creeped out and I’ve said I’ll stop saying goodnight everyday and that I’m still always here if she needs me and she also said she will be there if I need her.

I don’t want to be toxic in any sort of way but also find a way to make things better whether it’s trying to talk or leaving her alone til she wants to talk again. What can I do?

TLDR: best friend and I stop talking for 2 weeks because of exams and I said goodnight to her and updated her about my day everyday and sent a letter to her for graduation. Told me I’ve been creeping her out and wants to remain not talking til next year. What can I do?",14Dec2020,1

It all just seems very, very suspicious to me and my coworkers as well. Management is telling us that Dunkin is doing a “routine” deep clean (but it never closed down before...) and at the same time we’re experiencing a “shortage in staff”.

542,"Hi everyone,

Hope you’re all safe and well, I live in the uk and I was wondering if anyone has ever gone through anything similar.

So I’ve always had quite a quiet time on Instagram, never really had any trouble with it. When we went into lockdown 1, I (f30) started getting these weird messages from clearly fake profiles (weird username, no photo and no friends/following) saying how I was a slut and that should stop messaging married men (I’ve been with my boyfriend since we were 15, I’m now 30 and I’m pretty sure he’s not secretly married). Anyway that’s about as abusive as the messages get, name calling and accusing me of having these affairs. I ignored and then blocked and then a couple of weeks later another fake account would show up and say the same thing. I confronted one time and they said they would tell my boss and I was like ok sure would you like his email (I said this because I know I’ve done nothing and also it’s obvious these trolls are just bluffing because if they wanted to say something they would have done so by now). Anyway I was just wondering if anyone had been through anything similar themselves and what they did, did you just carry on ignoring it? I did think about going to the police but apparently if they are totally fake profiles it’s very hard for them to track down.",14Dec2020,1

544,"Are my parents toxic.

I’m starting to think my parents are toxic. Whenever I screw up my mom constantly reminds me and my dad yells at me. My mom never focuses on what I did good but what I messed up. I keep getting honor roll after honor roll at school but it never feels like it’s enough for my mom. I’ve devoted so much of what I do to make my parents proud. I try hiding my emotions that aren’t happiness so they don’t worry. I put my school work above my health. Last year my mom saw scratch and stab marks on my hand from me self abusing and she scolded me for it. My mom scolds me for really pretty things (hanging my clothes up facing the wrong way, accidentally making my clothes wrinkled when I put the in the washer, etc.)I don’t remember what she said too well since it was a year ago but for some reason the words “And how do you think that makes me look?” Come to my head. When I wanted to quit marching band because it was making me stressed my mom wouldn’t let me because she said it’s good that I’m getting out of the house. My mom will yell at me for playing video games and then wonder why I don’t play them when she’s around. My dad would yell at me for talking about video games too much. If my dad knew I was hesitating are nervous he would yell at me and tell me that if I’m so timid that I’ll never get for in life. I’ve tried to k*** myself over a hundred times to get away from them and I’m only alive because I could never get the knife through my chest, I couldn’t find anywhere to hang myself, or I couldn’t get the knife to cut my wrists enough. My parents don’t live together and were never married and I eventually stopped talking or seeing my dad two years ago because I started to break down because of him. The problem is that I keep telling myself that I’m being selfish. My parents love me and take good care of me. I can’t tell if I’m in the right or wrong. I call myself selfish but it’s because of my parents that I I hurt myself until I ache or don’t have the energy to move. I feel like I have all of these problems because I don’t talk to them about anything. There’s so much about me that they don’t know. They don’t even know that I’m trans and gay. They think I’m a straight dude. I already told my eight closest friends but that’s it. I don’t know if they’re toxic or if I’m just a terrible person. I’m only posting this because my mom got me to break down crying (she was at work and I have online classes so no one even knows that I cried). When I was crying I ended up shouting “All she cares about is how I make her look.” And “I want to k*** myself so I can get away from her.”",14Dec2020,1
545,"Hey all! I'm renting privately and as you can tell in the title I am on the 35th day without a working oven; hobs are fine but most of the food I had in my freezer needed the oven to cook. My landlady ordered a new one that should have arrived on the 20th of November, but there was an issue with the delivery which wasn't necessarily her fault. Then another delivery was arranged for the 24th, but there was another issue with the pipes or something with the connection, so the oven she had originally ordered wasn't suitable. She ordered a different one on the 24th and we weren't given a delivery date until the 2nd of Dec, and I should have a working oven tomorrow hopefully!

546,"I am female, 22. My boyfriend’s (22M) cousin was killed exactly 7 days ago. She was only 18. Her &amp; her friend were parked up at the traffic lights and a car just sped straight into them, instantly killing both girls. My boyfriends cousin was the passenger, her friend the driver.

Of course my bf is devestated, they were really close and she was like a little sister to him. They spoke that same morning, by the afternoon she was killed, its truly heartbreaking. Honestly my bf has been completely destroyed by this and has just lost himself, he isnt communicating, he isnt eating or sleeping. We dont live together, but he has told me he dosent know how he is living with this pain.

For the past week, he has completely stopped texting, calling me. Other than the few odd messages after I check in, he has stopped commumicating. Of course, i understand this, though I dont also communicate in fear of overwhelming him or annoying him. In the first few days, i sent him some mesages explaning how I would be here for him day &amp; night, and together we’d get through this. He replied with just the love heart emoji. a few days later he explaimed they had burried her, and he was feeling so heartbroken. I then gave my support as much as I could, and told him I would help him get to a place where he could celebrate her life, as hard as it may seem. Mistakingly, I asked how she was died, like what happened exactly in the collision (It was only 3 days in at the time and I did want to know the details) He then kinda lashed out &amp; said ‘Can you not use the word died!!!’ i apologised and he ignored my message. I assured him his mental health is my priority and it really is

Honestly I dont know how to best support him rn, I feel like all I do is ask stupid questions , Say silly things and just come out with cliches. He dosent want to see me at all, though this morning he text me saying ‘Good Morning’ and I replied saying its good to hear from him, and how is he? He then replied agressively saying ‘How do you think?’ i said I understood, and what does he intend to do today? He could go out for a walk or drive to  clear his head. Then I said do you want to talk? He said ‘well why do u think I texted you?’ I then apologised and said sorry i just didnt wanna overwhelm him. He then completely ignored my message. I think he feels like i just ask stupid questions. 

Honestly i want to be the main pillar of support for my boyfriend, but its like hes not accepting the love I want to give him. I dont know what to say except hold him and assure him he is loved and im here for him to vent 24/7. I feel like an awful useless partner, we are both 22. I feel like I have made mistakes in supporting him, maybe being too nosy and too invasive at times, but I am also learning on this journey too. Iv never supported anyone grieving and iv never experienced a close loss. I cant tell him all this because its like he’ll say ‘stop making it all about yourself’

How can I best support him? I honestly dont want to doubble text now hes ignored my message, i feel like i let him down this morning as he wanted to talk, and I just said dumb things which he thought I cba with this. I have been researching how to support a grieving partner, can anyone offer their first hand advice? I dont know whether to text him everyday to check in, i dont want him to feel im neglecting him?

557,"Saw an AITA post regarding something similar so I figured I would reach out here. Title is worded weird but I didnt know how else to put it. I'm thinking about leaving my BF, whom I'm madly in love with, because of his newly found lifestyle that I want nothing to do with.

Recently my BF got into an already formed band. He is a great guitarist, as well as having a killer vocal range. Him being in a band all of the sudden is not the problem.. its everything that comes attached to it. Everyone in his band is very vocal about being drug users. The only thing they dont touch is heroin. They use coke, mollie, shrooms, ketamine, nitrous, acid, ecstacy, etc. So their band practice is mostly drugs and very little playing. None of them are serious...with the exception of *maybe* my BF, whom claims he wants this to go somewhere but doesnt put in initiative to have it go anywhere. If that makes sense.

Originally I didnt care too much that his bandmates were using drugs. Their life, their problem. However, recently my BF has been outed by one of their ""groupies"". She goes to every practice and every show and has since the band formed pretty much. She is really off, to say the least. She does the drugs with the entire band. Pushes the drugs on them too if we are being honest because she is always supplying free shit and offering it up to all of them.

So, in a fucked up stupor (2days ago) this woman came to me and basically told me that I needed to let up on my BF when it came to drugs. I honestly had no idea what she was talking about because drug use isnt something that my BF and I discuss but maybe once a year, if that. Now, the conversation has a lot of holes because she was really fucked up and kept ending the conversation to dance. But from what I've gathered, she has offered my BF drugs multiple times and he always says ""my ball and chain wouldnt like that"" or ""my GF would kill me"". However, she then screamed out across the entire room saying ""Hey Trevor! I know your GF is here and it's supposed to be a secret but I have coke over here with your name on it."" His face fell. Like, instantly dropped. The entire room stopped what they were doing and just looked from me to my BF several times. And it was in that moment that I realized my BF has been doing drugs behind my back and from what it seems, has been telling people to lie or hide it from me. 

I ended up leaving, with my car that we drove in there together. I didnt stick around because 1. I'm really hurt that hes been using drugs and 2. I didnt feel like I could stay there a moment longer without causing a scene in front of everyone after finding out I've been lied to for so long. Two hours later he calls and asks me to come pick him up. He was silent the whole ride home and for the rest of the night. The following morning I picked up a shift at work because I wasnt ready to speak to him. I didnt know what to say. When I came home, he was gone. 

When he came home last night he was fucked up off of something. Drove home while fucked up, no less. His speech was slurred but he didnt smell like alcohol at all. Everytime I said anything, his response wasnt something I could understand as he was basically talking backwards. His sentences were all over the place and his word placement was terrible. He kept complaining of a massive headache by saying ""head...."" pointing to his head and then ""hurts"" but wouldnt talk about anything else. He kept spacing out and staring off into the distance extremely wide eyes but his pupils weren't dilated at all. And he was being kind of a jerk.. really sarcastic and making snippy, snide comments (when he was actually able to speak normal again). And then, an hour or two later, he was right back to his normal self. Laughing, joking around, smiling, etc. But it really made me think about all the times he has come home and been acting the same way. This time I knew he was fucked up because he has been outed at this point for his drug use. Prior to this I chalked it up to him being tired or in pain because I was naive and blind to his usage. 

I havent said anything to him. Every drug user I know has a mean streak and to be honest, I feel like I dont even know this man anymore and I dont know how he will react if I do bring it up. I dont even know what drug causes someone to act like that and I don't know what to do.",14Dec2020,1

He is short with replies now and obviously not that interested in what i have to say it seems but yet again idk him it’s been a week. I made him this really cool earring of one of his favorite artist logos because i know he has his ears pierced and it’ll also match something he just bought. 

He actually really liked it and i was saying “hopefully one day i can give it to u” and he was like “yes i’m so excited” and then i asked him how his day was and he was nice about it then i tried to start a convo but he just kept replying shit like “ah i felt that” or “yeah me too honestly” and i just stopped replying because i felt annoying. (this is so middle school esque i’m sorry but i cannot understand men for the life of me and am wondering if i should even like him anymore if he’s already weird with replying and seems annoyed but then again he talks to me on his own but i don’t want to reply if he’s going to take like 22 hours to respond or b dry)",14Dec2020,1

564,"Hello! I am 21, female and live in a small town in Britain (think, population of 10,000). 

I have an arts undergraduate degree, which I did pretty well in (I got 1.6% away from a First Class Honour, how annoying is that!!). Despite doing well, getting scholarships and having good references from lecturers, my degree is pretty useless so it doesn’t help me much (Philosophy &amp; English). 

I tried to get into a teacher training masters, but failed the interview. So, I started a philosophy masters instead, so that I wouldn’t feel so useless, stuck at home with my parents at 21 during a pandemic. 

However, I really hate it. I thought I would enjoy it because I really enjoyed philosophy during my undergraduate degree. But unfortunately, I’m just not interested or passionate enough about the subject to be able to write extensive papers on it, not to mention the thesis. 

I am going to try and apply for more education masters. However, even if I did manage to get in, these courses won’t start until September. I can’t sit around doing nothing until then. 

I’ve been looking for jobs in my local area but, I’m pretty useless lol and I think interviewers can see that. I’m a hard worker but I’m not very clever in a practical sense. Plus, all the jobs that require no training that I’m actually eligible for (waitress, hotel porter, cashier) either specifically ask for mature applicants or ask for experience, which I don’t have. 

I feel like I’m being backed into a corner here and running out of options. What kind of jobs can useless people do? The only job I could ever be called suitable for is working in a bookshop, since I love books and have an English degree. But there’s only one of those in my town, and they’re never hiring :(",14Dec2020,1

Now it’s gotten really bad and idk what to do. He’s always pushing and kicking me. Even when we’re not arguing.

He hits me in the face. Sometimes for no reason. He leaves marks on me. Mum dosent care when she sees them she just gets angry because we’ve been fighting.

I don’t hit him I only yell at him. I tried to push him backwards before but that only made it worse.

I even told Benj ( his dad and my stepdad) that he was hitting me and all he did was tell us both to stop arguing and get along.

I’ve tried minding my own business and just ignoring him. That dosent work. He picks at me until I get annoyed with him. If I completely ignore him he’ll get in my face pull my hair etc

575,"Hi! So this is my first post, and its about something going on in my life that I need advice about. So, to start ill describe what is happening, im a 22 years old boy that has never been in a relationship, this is because im a very shy guy with people I dont know and the fact that ive rly never been actively looking for it, I thought that ill eventually find someone that I rly like, and indeed, I found  her.

 She is a 20 years old girl and we are both in a shared appartament with 2 other companions, we meet this year in June when I was looking for people to share the appartament. At the beginning I saw her like a friend and all 4 of us did things together like watching Netflix and going to take a walk or a coffee, but lately I've realized I want to be with her all the time, that I like all about her and that I'm always thinking about her. In summary, I like her a lot XD. 

So, the problem now is that I don't know if she likes me, the only thing that makes me think she maybe like me too is that she get really close to me when we are together, like when we are watching something on TV, and that we spend a lot of time doing things together when we are not busy studying. 

And another problem is that I don't know what to do at all, I mean, I'm very shy, and the only time that I tried to tell a girl that I liked her it didn't end well and it was rly hard to me (tbh thinking back I rly didn't love that girl that way but I was pretty stupid at that age like everyone XD) 

I cant ask my friends for advice in what to do because they'll know right away who I am talking about and it's pretty embarrassing XD So if someone have some advice for me about what to do it would be rly helpful :D

Thanks for taking the time to read my problem and sorry about the bad English if there is any :3 (btw this is a secondary account because I don't want my friends to find this post  XD)",14Dec2020,1
577,"So my 6 week old daughter has been regurgitating her milk and throwing up since she was 2 weeks old, no matter what I do. We're on our last resort of Omeprozole for 2 weeks before going for a referral for a consultant. The doctor has told me that I need to feed my daughter 2oz every hour rather than the 4-5oz every 4-5 hours that she was having. 

When I say I have tried everything, I mean everything:
-infant gaviscon mixed into her milk
-Changing brand
-anti reflux milk
- burping her in between each ounce I feed her
-letting her have a few swallows then having a breather before giving her a few more
-infacol
-gripewater
-the bottles I use have anti colic teats
-keeping her upright for half an hour after her feed
-elevate her while she sleeps
-sit her upright when she feeds

Nothing has worked, she is still throwing up, she'll bring her milk back up even 2 hours after feeding. I know some babies are vomity babies, but if she was truly a vomity baby, she would have started off like this. But this constant throwing up started when I fully switched my daughter to formula due to me losing my milk supply to an infection and fever. 

All I keep hearing is ""this is parenthood I'm afraid"" ""this is what you signed up for when you became a mum"" ""some babies are vomity babies"" "" welcome to motherhood"", which I'm already aware of and I don't need to hear it. It's upsetting because I'm worried for my baby and I'm not getting much support bc I signed up for this as a mum. I'm a first time mum so I'm being brushed off even more, all I want is for anyone to tell me I'm doing a good job and not what I keep getting told by the experienced parents (including my own) and the health visitor. I'm at a loss until I know if the Omeprozole is working.

And to top it all off I now have lost any time in between her feeds I did have to do anything including sleep, I don't do well with next to no sleep and I don't have a partner to take over at any point, it's just me, my parents and brother who all just leave me to it at night.

581,"TW: self harm and suicidal thoughts 

What a way to start a post. 

A little context:
I’ve been trying to get help for my mental problems for over 3 years, almost 4. My mom dismisses all of my problems both physically and mentally because she “doesn’t feel that way” therefore I “don’t feel that way” I shit you not she has said that multiple times.

Recently my mental health has taken a hit because of the stress caused by her (and the US education system). I’m not doing great in my classes to say the least, this is because of multiple problems (that I’ve had for my entire life) lack of motivation, not being able to focus, and not being able to remember anything. The memory part is the main problem, I’ve spent this entire year trying to train my brain to remember anything by starting a diary. I spend a good 15-25 minutes every day just trying to remember something, anything, but I’m lucky if I remember just one thing. It’s honestly scary to not remember anything and it’s adding to the anxiety I already have to deal with.

I finally put my foot down this week and told my mom that she needs to get me assessed for ADHD or something similar (as recommended by a doctor). After 3 days straight of fighting with her she finally said that she’d schedule an appointment. Great, right? Kinda? Maybe but I don’t have high hopes. Like I said, I’ve been trying to get help for over 3 years, I doubt she suddenly had a change of heart. I doubt the appointment will ever be an option in her mind because she thinks she can “fix me” by herself.

This is where this gets serious. If you do not want to hear about self harm and suicidal thoughts please stop reading.

I have a record of self harm and suicidal thoughts in the past, but none as bad or serious as they are right now. I harm myself almost every day and constantly obsess over death and how I could do it. I bury myself in fantasy worlds to try to ignore my problems, but I can’t stop. I keep crying out for help, but instead I keep getting ignored and ridiculed. 

I feel like I don’t have a way out, if I leave then who’s going to pay for my college. Do I even have a future with the grades I have? I just have to make it 3 more years until I can go to college, but I’m starting to think that I can’t make it that long. I don’t think I’ll ever get help, I feel like I should just give up. 

How am I supposed to deal with this if I can’t get help? All I want is help, recently I’ve looked back through my past posts and I’ve realized nothing has changed, and I’m starting to think it never will. My mom keeps me as her little puppet to brag about to her friends, but ignores me when they leave. I don’t think she even looks at me as a person.

586,"I got a job at a small family owned retail store through an old toxic friend of mine named J. When i asked for the job i ignored red flags because of my desperation in the middle of the pandemic. As i began to work more, i was able to keep my distance from him.

Our department downsized and our old manager left and J became the manager. He proved to be fickle and draconian and we frequently butt heads. I managed to ignore him and kept my head down because I was desperate and our department was small and we couldn’t afford another manager.

Then something kinda cool happened. J hired other friends of his, Q and W. We naturally got along and they became my support system as we found ways to get around J’s bullshit. We had similar interests and hung out on Zoom after work and on the weekends.

However, what bothered me about them was their unwillingness to challenge him to his face, and the ways in which J still found a way to fuck up everyone’s mood. For example, J took out his anger on one of the cash registers. Our boss, who’s old as dirt and incredibly negligent, yelled at us and I was the only one who was willing to say it was J who broke it. They discouraged me from doing so out of their own desperation and fears of upsetting J. I ignored it to be diplomatic but I’m still slightly resentful. 

W, Q and I have a bond but there are days where I’m scheduled to work with J and it’s just soooo fucking draining. A coworker in a neighboring department caught COVID two months ago and he was really nonchalant about it and expected W, Q and I to just show up. I was the only one that challenged him and said we should stay home until we get tested. Q became similarly nonchalant and that angered me. I won, but only because I talked to the boss more directly and kiiiind of lost my cool with J. Q and W are kind of pushovers. 

For the majority of our shift, Q, W and I work, but J never helps us with our tasks. He literally watches us, then gets antsy about productivity and how fast we’re working. When I brought this up to J’s face, Q chimed in and said, “oh well, J must have so many other responsibilities!” I dropped it but when I brought this up to Q he said that he was just trying to smooth things over, but he still frequently rants to me about J’s bullshit. It struck me as kind of two-faced. 

And now I’m confused. A spot opened at a Burger King nearby and I’m tempted to leave. I don’t want to lose W and Q but their tendency to be too nice with J is making me reconsider the strength of our bond. I know that they depend on me to be courageous but sometimes it feels like a one way street when they don’t back me up when I call J out. Furthermore I hate working with J alone which I have to do two days out of the work week. 

I think this is hard to reach a conclusion on because I met them at a time when I was really lonely and my birthday’s coming up and we made plans for various holidays. I’m still lonely but I don’t want my desperation to compromise my willingness to call out my manager, and Q and W don’t back me up. They justify their submissiveness as attempts to “mellow things out,” but I’ve dealt with that growing up with my parents and I’m sick of it. 

I was about to quit but our boss gave Q, W and I raises. We now make 17 an hour but it still doesn’t feel like it’s worth it. I don’t know what to do.

TLDR; toxic manager J hired two of his friends who recognize his toxicity but aren’t as willing to challenge him on it as i am. I don’t want to quit because I’m lonely and his friends and i get along, but our relationship sometimes feels one-sided because of their willingness to ignore J’s mistakes.",14Dec2020,1

I did not show my face since I felt really uncomfortable while doing it.

590,"18 M here. Like every single one of my friends use Tinder and brag about the no. of girls they had sex with.

Personally being an LTR guy i’ve never felt interested in hookups or any of these things, i’ve never had a desperation for sex instead i am a more ambitious career/hobby minded guy. But i kinda feel hopeless now. Who am i saving myself for? 

Everybody is out there hooking up. It feels like its just me who’s an outlier. I’ve started feeling a little envious now. Like is the fuss around Tinder real? Like is everyone having fun and is it just me who’s sitting back grilling through his hobbies? Am i just out of the loop? Is this the norm? This are the stuff running across my mind. 

I’ve got a pretty solid package for a Tinder profile so that just keeps me from being ultra insecure or obsessed about others. Because i know i can be successful if i try. But i am not really interested.

I never wanted to hookup or engage in an FWB tbh. I just wanted a genuine relationship. But its looking like i’m on a hopeless journey and i may very well have to hookup out of interest to keep up with the trends and prolly to not regret later in future. I don’t even think anyone’s gonna be interested in LTRs in future. Or at least Tinder culture is gonna go so mainstream that finding one who wants a genuine LTR is gonna be a herculean task.",14Dec2020,1
591,"My concerns are legitimate and you will think so too after reading through. The two women in question here is a 49yo and her 16yo daughter. My BF hangs out with this womans 20yo son, who still lives at home with her. Let me just clear the air here by saying I actually really like all three of these individuals and have since I met them. However, some things have been said that are way too concerning to me within the past 3 visits to their house. 

So, the comments started small. Things that could easily be overlooked as something stated with poor judgement. However, I soon realized that the comments made truly express who they are as people and its intentional. This is a very overly sexual family. The mom has gone around to us discussing her 16yo daughters sex life multiple times. Keep in mind that my BF and I are both 28 and have no business knowing what this 16yo does in her spare time. Not to mention the fact that we have only known these people for maybe 3 months and are definitely not connected with them to a point of knowing such details. 

They are really big on nudity. They often talk about how all 3 of them go to festivals and dance naked. Including this womans 16yo daughter. She has said that they have been doing nude festivals since her daughter was 11 years old and they have told me multiple times that there are a slew of older men who also dance naked, with her daughter, at these events. They say it's all innocent and that it's a safe place and nothing has ever happened that could potentially cause harm or get anyone in trouble.

Now, she also makes a point to tell us her daughter is a lesbian. Her daughter does have a GF currently but has told me that she has lost count of how many men she has slept with. Most of them being 10+ years older than her. I'm sorry if this is all over the place. My fucking head hurts just thinking about this. But with that info, I know her daughter isnt a lesbian and that this family basically just loves sex and doesnt care who it's with or anything.

Anyways, so the comments started small. However, these comments soon jumped into a much larger picture and the 49yo woman has started to (seemingly) start pushing her daughter onto my BF. I'm not sure how to explain it other than her just always wanting my BF around and when he is, the mother tries directing his attention to her minor daughter. She wants all eyes on her daughter at all times. That's when I started noticing how weird her relationship actually is with her two kids. They are always hugging eachother, kissing eachother, rubbing each others back, etc, on top of always talking sex. 

I havent spoken to anyone about this because I feel mildly disgusted and honestly, who the fuck is going to believe me if I did spew it anyways? Well.. this is where my mind gets fucked.. originally this woman had been inviting me over damn near constantly. She found me on FB, added me and started calling/messaging me daily asking if I wanted to come over. Her messages randomly stopped coming to me and I later found out that she had been messaging my BF directly, saying ""Come hang out with me and Stephanie!"" He never did but still. 

So the end is this.. last night I went over there after she had been harping on my BF for a couple weeks to visit. I hadnt technically been invited but he said he wanted me to go so I did. When they saw me walk in behind my BF their demeanor changed. Like, they saw him and ran over to hug him and were all excited. They see me and instantly tone it down and say ""Oh I wasnt expecting to see you"" and gave me a one armed hug. At one point she said ""Well I was going to have Stephanie show you something but we will just wait until another time"" while talking to my BF and giving me random sideways glances. It was quite obvious that she had not wanted me there; which my BF picked up on as well and we soon took leave. 

Maybe I'm overreacting here but it feels so fucking off that I can't even sleep because its eating at me. I dont feel comfortable with my BF around this woman or her daughter and it's not because I think be will do something but I have a feeling that this overly sexual mother and daughter are trying to slowly work their way in to his life with motives that are unclear but dont appear to be good. How can I approach this without looking like an insecure control freak? Because technically they have done nothing thus far that would suggest anything but as a whole, its territory that I feel very strongly is a bad one.",14Dec2020,1

I met him a few times moving in on moving day and he’s super cool. We even had a beer. I saw him the other day and was thankful I hadn’t said anything to him yet, since it would’ve been awkward—and again, super cool dude. 

I don’t think he’s meaning to be so loud, it’s more footsteps (I think?) but it sounds like bowling balls and like he’s just up there stomping around with his feet. I can’t imagine being up as much as him, I mean I’m working from home (high school special ed teacher) and I sit all day. Even when I’m not working, I usually sit down at home and relax. He is up 24/7 unless he’s gone for what I’m guessing is his work? Other than that, it’s all day stomping and loud banging of drawers (again, guessing) and it’s almost to the point where I can’t believe someone would be moving around so much and being so loud at the same time. 

I’m at a loss of what to do, how should I approach him?",14Dec2020,1

597,"If you all had committed suicide instead of acting out it would have had the same effect on your life. Why come to me? Why have I given you this impression you are welcome to do so? I have blocked you all years ago. I have asked you to go no contact. I have reported you to police. Everytime I hear you talk my serotonin drains till the point I have to avoid you but then you also are obsessed with what I am doing, to like give yourselves ammo to self harm. You are walking depression by proxy. 

Your vibes are so toxic and so bad. It's not even better when you are being nice. It's just your aura is disgusting. 

If you had killed yourself two years ago, or four years ago, your parents lives would be better off. Everyone around you would be happier. Atleast get and commit to therapy and get on medication, what is wrong with you, why can't you see how much deadweights you are. I'm not an alternative for medication. It should be heavy medication, like you are 3 hour awake zombie. 

And please stop projecting. I am so happy. There is nothing wrong in my life for the last four years. If I didn't have your shitty lives to deal with and your acting out, I would be 30% happier. My life is absolute bliss. Your lives are so tragic that charities will pass your case. Literally with you all suicidal asses gone, my happiness level would be 100%. Guess you can't have everything. 

Why can't you die somewhere in peace and quiet where no one can see you. Who gave you permission to be seen? No one wants to see your ugly asses. I don't want to date you. I don't even want to be around you. I can't stand your personalities. You kill people and then cry victim. I just feel this urge that something should come and lock you up immediately and put like 100 tranquilizer   darts in your butt to stop you from showing your ass on camera to buy drugs.

Why are all you all so pathetic.

Whatever impression I have given you that I am your solace from your shitty circle and I will unconditionally care for you, is bs. I want you to go away. I hate your guts, and more like it makes me barf. You are all disgusting.

You should attempt to kill yourselves every time you want to reach out to me or anyone, no one deserves this. If you make an attempt everyday, you will die. That will be a positive net impact on the world.

You have no value attached to your lives. Stop the covert narcissism bs when you are all manic depressive and just die already.

Somebody put these people on medication, and either knock them off 24/7 or just euthanize them already, it would be a mercy killing at this point.

Like seriously, be born a cat or dog next life. Whatever you are, you are all going to hell.

Atleast harass all people you know in your life uniformly so that I have to see your suicidal homeless ghetto asses on drugs and doing cam work only once a year or something.

I don't know you. I don't want to know you. I want you to stay as far as possible to me and kill yourselves over there while you are at it.

If you get in a bad accident and your parents don't have money to save you (they don't), they might opt for euthanasia. A mercy killing.

If you swallow cyanide, you will die in 10 minutes. If you could find a hacker from the dark web, you can get cyanide, and within a month I bet you will try to kill yourselves. Keep multiple bags just in case. 

You can drop from a tall building head first. 

You can simply starve but also take cyanide. Easy death. Your body will not fight it. 

Have alcohol with weed and cyanide, easy death. That and drop from a 'tall' building, head first. Just die already, stop acting out. It's been years it's pathetic. 

Everyone lives would be better without you in it. 

You can commit to therapy but it will take 4 years to get okay, you could do that but you could easily also die. No one will miss you. You already say that yourselves. 

Go with that. Everytime you want to reach out to me, drop from a building instead. Let's try that for a change.

Like I have a life. You should have been dead when you were born.

There are starving kids in Africa/Asia /Europe who deserve more attention and money and resources and a fucking hug more than you. I want to hug them than deal with your barf worthy asses. Just die already. I will feed a village of 100 kids incase I get bad karma when I find out you all ended up dead. God will forgive me. Your parents should have aborted you when you were born. I am sorry for the kids you lost but they didn't deserve you as parents.

They were better off being born to starving kids somewhere.

Just kill yourselves already or get medicated so hard you never wake up for more than an hour in a ward.

God forgive me for saying this, but I swear if they kill themselves, and you bless me so, I will volunteer for the rest of my life for a village of 100 kids teaching them and feeding them. It will be a positive influence on the world. Those kids will be as ugly as these people. I shall atone for all my possible sins. 

I swear, as ugly as them kids, kids no one wants. I shall be kind and patient and treat those kids well and raise them. Ghetto kids born with fecal alcohol syndrome or something. Really kids no one wants. 

They miss you since they were born, take them back to your holy hands. Take them, they are already committing slow suicide just kill them and I swear I will be a saint.

God kill these people already. They want to die so bad. Take them.

Whatever you do, can you not make it my problem? Just die early already and stop lying to get into my life, don't want you around.",14Dec2020,1
598,"My partner of 2 years is usually the sweetest but we’ve just had the worst arguement I’ve ever had in my life. 

He’s usually always laid back but he was the angriest I’ve ever seen anyone get. I still don’t believe it happened because this is not his usual self at all. 

He was talking to me about something I couldn’t really hear because the tv was up. And I was trying to read something in my phone at the same time. 

He got so angry said I was ignoring him and never listen. He got real up in my face about it grabbed my face and forced me to look at him while he was literally screaming right in my face. Obviously I immediately went to remove his hands cause who the hell does he think he is ! And he grabbed my face harder digging in so hard it bruised. I have finger marks on my jaw and cheeks and it’s bruised. How the hell am I gonna go out like that ? I’ll have to cover it with makeup which I’m terrible at. 

But he was yelling in my face it was the worst feeling in the world. What did he think that I would listen to what he was saying better if he was screaming it in my face ? 

This has made me so angry. I’ve never treated him like that or grabbed at his face like that why would he do this.

I (19M) haven’t many friends I’ve got about 4 near my age (18-20) from collage/high school and a handful more that are older adults (22-40) they come from volunteering and work and they aren’t really close.

My I used to have quite a lot of friends I always saw myself as a a good friend to have and I really enjoy company of others I want to get back in contact but a lot of them have made no effort to stay in contact with me, it made me wonder if I should try making new connections v difficult these dark days.

So my question is how do I make friends outside of work/education as out in the world you aren’t forced to work projects with strangers and to sit next to them during classes, or should I try harder to get in contact with old friends again it’s hard to approach others due to the virus but I’m starting to feel alone I think.

600,"I'm a gay man and have a thing for older men.

I've been seeing a guy who's 19 years my senior, it's a lot of fun and we get on great. We've been together for about 18 months.

Before lockdown hit, we decided to live together so I got footed it to his place asap. We had a great time together, lots of time to explore new stuff and try stuff out. 

Part of the attraction is the fetish side of stuff, we are in a dom / sub style relationship - me being the sub. This usually involves me being restrained and pleasuring him in some way. (Always consensual with boundaries respected) 

However, a few weeks into lockdown his brother moved in with us due to mitigation circumstances. His brother knew our living arrangements and said he'd be cool with us doing it. We used to garage outside as we had insulated and soundproof it for this use.

His brother is a nice guy, but not my type physically. 

However one night me and my partner had been having a few drinks, been fooling around and I was restrained when he decided to nip off to the shop to grab some more beer leaving me tied up as part of a power play (again, this was consensual). Would usually be about 60 minutes due to him walking and playing a powertrip on me

When he disappeared out of the house, his brother appeared in garage stating he was bored and wanted to chat. Due to the compromising position I was in I kindly asked him to go. But he just stayed and we got chatting anyway, a couple of minutes in he told me he was actually bisexual and said I was very attractive. I told him he was a bit ugly for my liking but he would make someone happy, but I could see the bulge in his pant. I asked him to drop them which revealed the biggest penis I've ever seen which I openly told him. After a few more minutes talking I told him to start playing with my whole as he was making me horny, to which he just replied by entering me fully causing me to say ""let's stop messing around and fuck me like your wh*re"". Which he unduly did before letting me swallow the contents of what was on offer. Before smiling at me and leaving the room before my partner came home. 

About a week after this encounter, he repeated it again when my partner had to nip out for a while. Only this time I did about more such a rim him, play with his feet and let him film us doing it. Something I've never done with my partner. He's even brought one of his mates around to join in

I'm now put myself in a situation where I don't know what to do, as I love my partner but his brother keeps threatening to leak the videos of us if I don't keep playing with him

Do I just come clean and admit it all, or just keep playing to his demands for sex?

I was making ‘poor’ life decisions by my fathers account so he sent me to meet her for the first time. Upon meeting her she tore my appearance apart and any pain I experienced was solved with cigarettes or alcohol. Not a great influence as you can see. Current relationship is I try to see her once a year and along with my brothers (so Im not left alone with her). My father pushes me to uphold more of a relationship with her— since she is my mother.

604,"So, I really don't know how to say this and it might sound really trivial (which it honestly might be) but I've just been feeling horrible these last 5-6 months. When it comes to stuff like this, I am usually able to deal with them myself but this time I've just been falling short. Whenever I feel that I've solved a problem and start feeling semi-decent again, the next day I just wake up feeling like absolute trash.

I do know a couple of stuff that are ""problems"" so I wanted to mention them.

1. This virus situation has made me realize how bland my life really is. It's not like much has changed from before the virus btw, the only main difference is that school is online now but I think that this is what made me realize. When I went to school, I at least socialized a bit with people, even if it was mandatory. But now that I've lost that I don't really speak with anyone other than my family. I do have friends but (even though I didn't want to admit this to myself for a while) I don't even feel happy talking to them anymore because there really isn't anything to talk about.
2. School and assignments lately have really not been helping. It's not like they're difficult or anything, It's just that whenever I want to sit down and relax a bit or want to do something else I subconsciously remind myself that I have work to do and then I start feeling awful again. Also, whenever I actually finish my assignments I just remember that there's way more to come.
3. I've been feeling really disconnected from my emotions and memories lately. I'm a person who really relies on their good memories when going through tough times but I just haven't been able to do that for so long now and I honestly don't know why.
4. Things that usually cheer me up like watching anime or playing games have started to seem like chores and just this fact alone makes me feel bad.

There's probably more but I just can't think of them right now.

I know that I sound like a spoiled brat who's expecting too much from life at once (because I probably am) but I really just want to get to a point where I don't dread waking up in the morning. Any advice would be really appreciated but at the same time, the main reason I'm making this post is really only to talk with people.

p.s. I didn't want to mention this in the ""problems"" part because it really isn't but I still think it'd be cool if people had some advice on this. I don't have a gf, never had one, probably never will have one... What I wanted to know was, not how to get a gf, but how to meet new people, I guess, especially during this pandemic.

606,"Hi I own a marketing agency. A few months ago we created a video for one of my clients. This video was about 1:30 seconds and it was basically a commercial that told a story about their company and services. We also created a 59 second version. My client reached out to me a couple days ago asking if I could send said the working files of the video to another marketing agency he’s working with so that they could trim it down to 30 and 15 seconds, as well as add a new voice over so that they could get it on a local news website. 

The issue is that, I’m wary of this other marketing agency. I don’t see any reason as to why they have to be involved when he could have asked my team to make those changes. I have a feeling that the marketing agency approached him and offered him a good deal on something and he just went along with it. But on my end I’m not too into the idea of handing over my intellectual property to another company to do with what they want and alter how they’d like in order for them to eventually take the credit for the video. I have a feeling they’re poaching my client and trying to gain the upper hand with new footage only they have access to.

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t tempted to go back to FL. The other thing I have to consider is that I wouldn’t get to see my BF which would suck but I know he would be understanding and we’ve done distance most of our relationship so we can handle it. 

The reason I have to choose between one or the other is that my parents don’t particularly want me getting on a plane and traveling right now unless things get better with covid so I either pick to stay in my college town all spring or be prepared to stay in FL for my whole semester. 

What would y’all do?? I feel like FL would bring more joy but there would be cons, like missing my BF and some memories from my last semester of college....

617,"Hello!  

So, without going into too many boring details, here's my conundrum:

I am currently working as a paralegal making ""ok"" money. I know I don't want to be a paralegal for the rest of my life, or even for that much longer. It's fine, just not really for me. My dream would be to become a history professor. Now, here's the rub. 

Before I realized I want to be a history professor, I wanted to be a lawyer. I got this paralegal position to test the waters and have decided being a lawyer is not for me. In case I liked being a paralegal, I started taking a certification course at a local community college. I have one semester and two classes left for my cert. The problem is I now know I want to go get my Master's and then my PhD in something completely different.

Should I continue getting the paralegal cert. since my husband and I aren't making a lot of money right now and getting the cert. *could* end up in me getting a better job while going through a Master's program? Or, since the remaining classes will cost a few thousand dollars, should I give up on the cert. and use that time I would have been studying on a Twitch channel, since I have been wanting to do that for years now? 

I'm hung up on quitting because I already got this far, even though I know I don't want to work as a paralegal forever. But I will need to work while getting my Master's, of course. But what if my Twitch brings in some money? Who knows?

Obviously, this post isn't too serious, my husband and I just don't know if I should go ahead and take next semester's paralegal classes.

619,"I've been taking lessons for a while now, I've done all the mandatory ones(night, highway etc) and I've done almost 50 in total and I recently passed driving theory.

A few lessons ago, I asked when he'd think we should start looking for an appointment for the practical exam and he just said he might take it in consideration if I drive alright that day in a very demeaning tone of voice.

The lesson started out great, but half and hour in, when I made a couple of minor mistakes and was ""too careful"" in streets that were small and confusing, he got loud and annoyed much more quickly than he usually would and the more he yelled and condescended me, the more nervous and insecure I got. I tried to be less ""overly careful"", but then I suddenly wasn't careful enough for him.

The weird thing is that he told my best friend I was driving really good lately. His behaviour towards that friend is even weirder, they were driving and she didn't even have her foot on the gas, but then all if the sudden they got really fast and he told her not to go on the gas like that and when she told him she had her foot somewhere entirely else, he just seemed caught and tried to brush it off. When a truck was too close behind them for a while, with no warning, he just hit the break, cursed and said it was a shame it didn't crash right into them since that would've taught that driver a lesson. He tries to keep her from doing the mandatory lessons for a while now and he still uses the pedals a lot alone eventhough she's had quite a few lessons with him already and he reaches into both our steering wheel, even when it's not a dangerous situation and he could just tell us what's wrong.

He's technically old enough to retire and he insists I pay the lessons cash instead of via bank account, which my mother thinks is quite suspiscious.

I've heard from a few others that they feel scammed by him since they felt he just wanted to do more lessons for the money, so now I'm wondering if I should switch driving teachers. His son, the other teacher, is now in charge of the school and I've heard good things about him.

I gave her a second chance, it was hard building the trust back (it never did) , to try to make it easier for me she deleted her Instagram. It helped, but when the second lock down happened it all came back, I was really insecure again. 
She was the kind to get pissed at me for it, we've spent hours arguing because she would make me feel even worse. 
I tried to break up, she came back, she was sweet again and it all was good. 

About two days ago, she started acting weird, I started to freak out, so I checked if her Instagram was still deleted or not. 
Turns out ive reactivated it by trying to login, she saw it and got pissed at me. 

I went to far on searching, and invading her privacy, but I was freaking out and didn't really think about it 
We were supposed to see each other at the end of the week, she told me with a big smile ""im gonna keep my Instagram now"" As ""to punish you"" Knowing that would makes me anxious all day.

I went on her Instagram today to disconnect it from my phone, and saw two conversations with guys telling her they wanted to see her. 

I exploded blocked her everywhere. 
I'm tired of being a bitch. 

What do I do know? How can I get my stuff back (and give her back her stuff without seeing/talking to her)",14Dec2020,1
628,"Hi guys, I am a minor so please keep that in mind. My dad works away from home during the week and comes home on weekends. He can be very loving and caring one minute and violent and manipulative the next. He will get angry and leave the house to ‘blow off steam’. This time he didn’t come back, typically I will chose him over my mother when he makes me choose, but I never feel like he values my choice. I like to think I am a good daughter, I do my chores, get straight As, I have never dated anyone, done drugs, etc.. I do all of the conventual ‘good kid’ stuff but he still says I make him sick to be around. He says he dreads being with me and my family. I am the only one in my family who doesn’t get physical when I am angry and so I simply take the insults. He throws my possessions when he gets mad. I just don’t know what to do, he is my dad, I want him to like me. This is the last text he sent me, “ I am exhausted. I have given everything. I will never get any respect and no one will ever do anything to help me out.“ I am just so confused. In the last week I started going to therapy, but he has told me to talk about myself and improve and not complain about my family issues, he doesn’t want to feel like a bad guy.",14Dec2020,1
629,"So, I have had a few previous jobs that have had basically no recourse for workers being targeted by other workers but at my current one problem coworkers usually get 86'd or set straight pretty quickly. Our managers have very firm but very fair standards of workplace behaviour. Our rules, I find, are very reasonable.

But our managers aren't all seeing and all knowing, and they have human biases and human failures. I can see them very easily siding with a problem worker because the problem worker was more charismatic or the complaint was poorly made. I find management kind of likes me, I show up on time, I do a lot of favours, when I fuck up I fix the mistake, and I constantly get ""Oh you remind me so much of me when I was your age"" lines from some people. 

Nobody's had an issue with me to my knowledge, since I was first asked to train people on tasks. I was apparently too formal and the trainees would come back with lines like ""He's so fucking grim, does he have a problem with me?"" But apparently I've gotten better, I was asked to provide training this week and I followed up with the new guy a couple hours later to find that he thought it was wierd I was the only guy who showed up in a Santa hat (hey, I'm in the spirit) but other than that my training was a good experience.

That being said, there is this one guy. He hasn't been a real problem yet... But I'm getting bad vibes.

He stares at me when I speak with female coworkers and its like when a cat stares at a bird it sees through a window thinking ""Its neck is right fucking there"" He drops what he's doing and his head snaps to my direction. I understand that in a workplace there's no such thing as a private conversation, every wall has ears. The only secret I'm surprised didn't get disclosed was when I mentioned to my superior that I was seeing a mental health professional for my anxiety issues and that anyone writing up the roster should probably be informed and take that into account.

I tried to ignore the staring, thinking ""Hey, he's a dude on the younger side. Maybe he's just awkward and doesn't realize that staring at people is wierd.""

I thought that was the only thing that was going to be an issue, a small thing I could ignore until one of us leaves or until he grows out of it.

Then I realised his whole personality changes the instant he knows I'm in earshot. His sense of humor becomes entirely focused on me. Don't get me wrong, the jokes are pretty good natured, nothing you'd call line-crossing or harrasing but I'm really uncomfortable being the centre of attention in ways I don't think I've earned. Shit, I don't even like that much attention when I feel I've earned it.

Almost every female coworker I regularly speak to outside of work has confided in me that this guy has been talking shit. Saying things about me like ""Man he's such a wierdo"" and they've been shooting it down and saying things like ""Yeah he looks mean and his music taste is strange but he's actually a really great guy/got a really, really big heart/does a lot of favors"", to which he immediately changes his tune with ""Oh! But he's growing on me.""

The positive here is that I never knew how well liked I was until this dude started talking shit. I also noticed that he's not said things like this to our male coworkers or female coworkers who happen to be significantly older than us. It's a wierd thing, but I notice it.

Being well liked is honestly a surprise to me because of trauma scars from childhood.

I find this talking about me while my back is turned to be disrespectful to start with, creepy because of who gets to hear his grievances with me, but also cowardly because he can't even stick to his guns when it's challenged. And it's been challenged a few times so clearly I'm not *actually* growing on him.

Ive never been in a situation like this outside of school because I keep myself to myself too much, I'm one of those ""being alone but not feeling lonely"" types. I don't know what to do. In school the situation was easier, try and solve it with words, if that doesn't work avoid him. Don't invite him to shit, don't spend time around him, don't talk to him. Can't do that when you're being paid.

Previous workplace conflicts I've had were so much simpler, cut and dry cases of workplace harassment. But I was so bad at arguing them even when I knew that what was happening to me was outright illegal.

My previous workplace conflicts were all handled terribly. This is my first one at this job. I like this job, I like my managers, I like my team. I want to resolve this before making a complaint, if I can. How do I do that?

Moreover, if it gets to the point where I have to make a complaint, how do I do it in a way that my complaint is as ironclad as possible? That management looks at it and says ""Look, he's tried every recourse available to him, it hasn't worked. This is an issue we can't just tell him to deal with."" 

Basically, I want the opposite reaction to my previous workplace: ""It seems the *real* issue between you and X is that there's an issue. Have you tried not having those?"" Like, yes I have. That's why I am here.

I don't want to be working with someone who can smile at my face, then when my back is turned start talking mad shit. I'm insulted, I'm angry but I want to handle this the right way. A change in behaviour would be enough for me to consider this settled, I don't even respect that kind of behaviour enough to want an apology, just want it to change",14Dec2020,1

632,"I have had my current job for 6 months now and I knew I wanted to quit within one month. The reason being was because I got pulled into a room by my boss and she said that she doesn’t think I want to be there and that she was expecting more of me and that it looked like I couldn’t handle the work. (After being there for almost a month) I felt like I was doing ok? All I wanted to do in that moment was go home and cry. The times after that when I make mistakes I get a lecture. But when my boss or her coworker friend makes mistakes they laugh. 
I just hope I’m not seeming pathetic and weak. I know if I tell my dad he will tell me that sometimes in life we have to do things we don’t want too. And at this point I just want to quit but I don’t know if I’m doing it for the right reasons.",14Dec2020,1

634,"So I’ve been with my boyfriend for a little over a year now, at the beginning the sex was amazing, I got off every time and when we added a vibrator to the mix it was even better, but lately it’s just been boring. 

I’ve trying telling him somethings I’d want like more spontaneous sex, to be dominated,  choking, and what not, but he doesn’t want to do that stuff because it makes him feel bad. 

Last time we had sex it was so unappealing to me that my body closed up, and he got upset because he thought it was his fault. 

I understand that he doesn’t want to do those things, but is there any advice anyone can offer to make sex less boring me for me?",14Dec2020,1
635,"So I know this is quite a weird post title and obviously ultimately Reddit won’t make me choose but it might help me decide....

Context: I’ve spoken to two different guys throughout the lockdown and we got quite close. Honestly, we’ve become friends, and more? 

There’s N - I met him at a club before lockdown began, we scheduled a date and everything but then I had to leave the country due to COVID and ended up not seeing him until I was back. We’ve spoken for 10 months non stop, almost daily. At this point my family knows about him and vice versa. He’s fantastic. But sometime during the early fall we kind of stopped talking for a bit and my feelings - that have been steadily picking up dwindled. Not only this but I couldn’t really go out with him because we were both in different cities and busy. 

There’s V - I’ve met him at a house party around the same time as N, but we only started to speak around April/May - and while N and I were very close during spring/Summer, V and I got closer towards the end of summer/fall. We went on 3 dates and honestly on the third got close to sleeping with one another. At the moment I have the strongest feelings for him. 

They’re both super handsome, and smart - honestly I’m attracted to both of them and they have quite similar personalities. They’re the “smart athletes” type, and honestly I would be happy with either of them - problem is - a relationship wouldn’t work with any of them, and they’re both going to be in my city around Christmas time. 

I don’t want to be going into 2021 and still a virgin - honestly it’s not a huge deal for me in a sense that I don’t need to be in a relationship but I do want to feel safe. 

Problem: V - I told him I have feelings for him and he said he feels the same but can’t be in a relationship and honestly I think that if I were to sleep with him it really might complicate things. I really like what we have and I don’t want to ruin it. N - he’s fantastic so I’m thinking it should be him but right now, at this moment my stronger feelings are for V. 

What should I do?",14Dec2020,1

637,"To start with, we are together for over a year now. August 2019 we started dating. I love him very much and I am ver forgiving towards him. Let's get onto the good stuff.

About 10 months ago I was using his phone to browse reddit, my phone's battery was dead and I needed to go to the toilet. I asked him and he said ut was OK. As every normal human being I was curious about what he posted before. There was some really sweet stuff about things like me and his mom. But then he got a notification from Reddit, me thinking it was a standard 'we recommend this sub' looked at it. There I saw that he was logged on to another account. Of course I went to check it out. What I found there was weird. I'm not going to go into it but it is basically the same finding out he did p*rn on Reddit. I confronted him about it and he confessed. He said he should've said something about because he knew it would've come out eventually. We talked about it. All good end good. I didn't bring it up ever again.

A few months after that, I needed an SD card for a school project. I asked him if he had an empty one and he gave me one. I inserted it and found nudes of his ex girlfriend. He didn't know he gave them to me. So again, I said he gave it to me. He said he was sorry and deleted them. At the end he said he didn't even remember having them in the first place. I believed it because if he did remember he wouldn't have given it to me. So I didn't make a fuzz about it.

Again a few months after that he got a notification from reddit about a post he posted I saw it as we were browsing Reddit together in bed on his phone. It was a post about me. He mentioned all my feeling, my age, basically as many details as he could without my name. I was furious. I said in the beginning (still do now) that communication is essential. If you tell me about something big you did in the past its no problem. But if I find out myself, there are going to be questions. So we talked about it and I ince again said, communication is essential. Just talk to me about it. We did talk about it in the end and he felt guilty. He said he was sorry Etc. I forgave him. We never talked about it again.

Time for the bit I want advice for.

In the beginning of our relationship we made an agreement to not watch p*rn. He didn't until a few weeks ago. I only found out yesterday. 

I went back to my mom for 2 days after around 8 months. It was a Wednesday.
It was the first time in 5 months we had a night to ourselves. That day I went to work, played with my mom's dogs and watched a movie with her before going to sleep. My bf told me he did basically the same. Skip to yesterday. I was once again on his phone browsing Reddit on my own account. At this point we pretty much have an open phone for eachother. I don't care if he takes my phone and neither does he. I don't even use my phone that much. As I said I was browsing Reddit until he got, once again a notification about a subreddit I never heard of before. At first I just ignored it. After a minute or so I went to check it out. It was a p*rn subreddit. I was curious and scrolled a little only to notice that he had upvoted almost every. Single. Post. That was posted since the night I went to my mom. He also has joined the subreddit. This was on an alt account he recently made. I forgot to log out to hide it from me. I once again, confronted him about it. After a while lying about it he confessed.
He said he felt guilty immediately afterwards. The thing is, it's not the end of the world he watched p*rn. The thing that hurt me the most is that he thinks about p*rn before shooting me a message. We've done it over the phone multiple times, he always seems to enjoy it. But for whatever reason he chose p*rn above me.

I'm hurt and don't know how to deal with this, should I confront him again about it? Should I leave him? Forgive him?",14Dec2020,1
638,"So, my immediate family has kept on nagging me about being in a relationship/getting married, and I am starting to get frustrated and stressed out with them. They have even created an online dating account for me despite me saying no. I have no interest in being in a relationship. However, I understand that they are concerned because they believe that once someone gets to be in their 30s+, it is extremely hard and next to impossible to be in a relationship if I ever have a change of heart about the idea. Their reasoning comes from the many groups of individuals with whom they have interacted within their lives so far who are in that age group and are having a hard time finding a relationship partner. They just do not want me to end up like them and be lonely in life. The thing is though, most of the people whom they are referring to are people who share the same cultural ideas as them but not me. However, sometimes I feel that is just a façade and that their real reason is that they care too much about the idea that one of their two kids is unmarried and what other people will say about them. I have an older sister who is married for almost 3 years now, but the evidence that I see of her tells me that she is not that happy in her life as she claims she is. She lives in another state with a husband who is not home most of the day as he is a physician which is completely understandable. I honestly feel that she is pretending to be okay just because she does not want to dishonor or cause worry to our parents by telling them how she actually feels.

The three questions I would appreciate feedback on this are as follows:

How can I get them to back off from this and let me live the life I want to live? I honestly do not want to cut them off because they are just a few of the caring people in my life.

When I keep on saying no or if they bring it up, it really puts stress on me because I really hate saying no to them constantly because I feel that it puts stress on them and that in turn affects me when my immediate family is stressed.

If I were in a relationship this is how I would describe myself: I am a guy in my mid-20s who is straight but does not seem at all interested in having sex with anyone nor want kids. Therefore, I was wondering is it possible to be in a relationship with another guy who is like me and just wants to be in a relationship for companionship and helping each other reach our goals in life? If so, where would be a good place to find like-minded people like myself?

All help is appreciated. If it makes a difference, I am of Indian descent who was born, raised, and still living in the US whose parents came to the US from India.",14Dec2020,1

Then when her friend started sleeping round I started to feel weird and obviously hormonal as I an a teenager. Anyway many time I have tried to semi-flirt with her, I.e in a science class I sat next to her and brushed my hand in her leg which was awkward. Since then we have had close encounters but more like friendly encounters. I've been that close physically that I could of hugged her. And lately I've been having sorta secual dreams where I'm with her and we have sex, I'm trying yo brush it off but I can't. Now I love my girlfriend a lot. Shit, its the longest relationship I've had, and she is fucking pretty and amazing and caring. I feel like shig for having a crush on her best friend. In the past my gf has accused the best friend of liking me because we would always walk next to each other. On an off note, her ex which is my/her friend hasn't been the best first bf for her, and I felt really shitty for her, then I find out she has a crush on my other friend which in all fairness he is good looking and deserves her but plot twist he has a gf. So I'm just sat here in my girlfriend bed waiting for her to come home from shopping, I can't deny the feelings I have for the best friend but I feel so bad that I feel that way ever if I'm in a relationship.

642,"We just did what Ashoka and Buddhists were trying to do with North India. They had bloody massacres and destruction of temples too, cause it was important to get the message across. 99.9 percent of India was under slavery for thousands of years and only 0.1 % were actually benefitting from the Golden age of Hinduism.

Hindu kings were not united, and the country was fragmented till even Mughals came in. They massacred populations and destroyed temples all the times and sold their empires to other kings.

Mughals united the country and gave people a common language that is the official language of India. Even Sanskrit came from Syria.

Hindus had wars on racism with the Aryan Dravidian divide.

Buddhists had already converted 90 percent of India before Brahmins made it illegal to be Buddhists.

Brahmins before Buddhism used to eat cow meat daily cause it was holy. It is even mentioned in Vedas as a good thing to have.

The God's you worship are not mentioned in the Vedas.

There is no mention of dowry for men and sati.

Your Hinduism is not what is written in books.

I do not drive. Plus I rather find a work with my college degree in 2021).

So when my coworker found out my decision (she works at my retail job I only knew her for 2 months so far) she basically started telling me how she likes it and that I should go and do the job, its easy, etc.

There's a near infinite amount of movies to watch on Netflix and Amazon, and that fact makes almost none of them appeal to me, whereas getting something from Blockbuster was a thrill.  
    
I like the idea of disconnecting from the modern world and just focusing on what I think should matter, but the disconnection feels so severe that it's like complete ostracization. I don't want to fall behind industry trends but am sick of keeping up with them all day. I want to keep up to date with the news but it happens so fast and is so purposefully outrage driven that it becomes meaningless and useless knowledge. I want to read books or even just sit playing video games but I'm used to having livestreams open and checking my accounts and emails and social media pages and being swamped with so much (useless) info that sitting down and reading is boring.    
    
I just feel like I haven't adjusted to the modern world, or that I can't, and I also don't know how to fix the issue or get out of it. I am worried I'm going to live the rest of my life feeling purposeless and meaningless and it's only going to get worse, but removing myself from it could be even more painful than staying. Hopefully this makes sense. Thanks for listening and for any advice.",14Dec2020,1
654,"Does he like me or just friends?

Hi I am 25 F and there’s a guy I’ve liked for almost a year now 25 M. I’m just confused on whether he likes me back or if he just sees me as a friend?? I met him through my previous job and he would always invite me to group settings (pre-Covid). We would text every day, all day. Now we don’t text as much but we still talk often, we are each other’s best friends on Snapchat with the yellow heart 💛. He would give me compliments at work about my makeup, one time he wanted me to send him a selfie I posted on my story. 

Yesterday, I asked him if he wanted to go to Target with me (just me and him) and he said yes. This was our first time hanging out alone together. We went to a couple stores then he bought us pizza, we went back to his house and watched a movie. His dad was there, he didn’t introduce me which I thought was weird, I had to introduce myself. He has a lot of girls as friends from my old job and one of them facedtimed him during the movie. He asked if it was okay if he answered and I said yes, they talked for awhile he left it on speaker so I heard everything, they were just talking about what she should get her mom for Christmas but she was the one who ended the conversation, it made me wonder how long he would have stayed on the phone. He told me she’ll FT him randomly and then they don’t talk for awhile. After the movie he taught me a little bit of piano, he touched my hands a couple times to put them on the right keys. After that I went home. When he was walking me to my car I told him I would give him hug but I wouldn’t want him to get sick since I have strep throat. He seemed disappointed but he said okay and told me to text him when I got home. I told him I would pay him back for the pizza but he said I could just buy him ice cream for next time we hangout. 

He doesn’t really flirt with me but we get along so well, apart of me wants to tell him how I feel but I’m scared he doesn’t feel the same way and I wouldn’t want to ruin our friendship. I just wish I could know what he’s feeling or have a hint or something!",14Dec2020,1

657,"I grew up with a lot of trauma, so naturally I developed anxiety, became very shy and distant from everyone as the years went on. I was very awkward and at times I still am. I try very hard to fight it off and little by little my anxiety seems to get a little better. Every little thing I do In front of people I feel as if I'm making a fool of myself or feel as if I look strange. However inside I feel as if I want to talk and joke around. I just physically, no matter how hard I try, cannot do it. It's very frustrating. I want to be able to smile more and show my true emotions. When I do express them they feel forced, unnatural, and as If I'm fooling myself into trying to be more liked. When I am able to say something I want to, it usually comes out in the wrong tone so people think I'm rude or mean. Or I have intrusive thoughts that i'm like, "" that's messed up why am I thinking that? I don't think that about this situation."" Yet, I spit it out and I'm like ""well how the fuck am I gonna explain that? I did not mean that.""  It's just all so overwhelming. I'm in a constant battle with myself.

658,"HIii (F15) so umm when I was 4 I was sexually abused by my dad (we still live together) but never told anyone because he stopped when I turned 8, then at 12 I was repeatedly raped by my cousin and never told anyone so I assume that's why I suffer from both depression and anxiety.  I normally cope with it by making jokes and locking everyone out but it's gotten to a point where I can't sleep because I get nightmares where it's happening to me and I'm being degraded. I starve myself so everyone finds me weird and stays away from me. As a result of that I overthink a lot, and cut myself because I need to punish myself for happened to me. I'm drawn from sexual interaction (hugging, holding hands etc.) people who touch me or try to hug me tends to to freak me and then I get paranoid because I think it'll happen again. I tried a relationship once, but I squirm and feel guilty as well as awkward, Is that normal. I also need people’s validation is that weird or am I overthinking it.",14Dec2020,1

she’s super social and will talk to anybody and i barely see her it’s the only time i’m able to, yet she doesn’t give a shit it seems like,
and i miss her and confronted her about it last night 
and she begged me to stay because have to go to my hometown and sleep at my grandmas just to see her for an hour, and i told her i was gonna stop going .
she apologized and all that but i’m still still upset because it’s not the first time it’s happened
i remember i was sitting next to my really good friend and i was sitting in between her and him 
and she moves aside to talk to him about his teachers when she sees him at lunch everyday smh.

664,"I live with three other people, K, L, and M. I'm planning on moving out of my private student accommodation to take a leave of absence based on bad grades and worse mental health. I've been good friends with these guys for a couple years, we give each other a lot of shit and get it back. Typical dudebro stuff.

Apparently when I told them this in our gc wasn't clear. K and L called me a selfish cunt for leaving them to potentially deal with my portion of the rent if I left; after assuring them that that wasn't going to happen (I called our Letting Manager who said within reason I could reschedule rent payments if I couldn't find a replacement tenant), L understood and was fine with it. K on the other hand continued calling me a selfish prick etc while me and the others were trying to go through emails and find info that might help me figure out how to move forward.

Before we get into the meat, a little background: this year was tough on me as it was for most. I spent about 4 1/2 months alone in our house after my friends went back to their families. I have a history of diagnosed depression and anxiety. Coupled with substance abuse due to trauma, I attempted suicide by hanging a handful of times over our first lockdown period. The only reason I'm here typing this today is because, on my last attempt, the cord I was using snapped as I was gonna black out. This is a pretty sensitive topic to me as you could guess. I have joked about it before to put on a brave face but I make it clear that it's still something I'm not wanting to open up about.

K, on the other hand, is dating someone with a lot of followers on Insta (100k+). On a photo of them together, one person commented that he looked like Sid from Ice Age (he doesn't in the slightest). This dude has been considered a 10/10 by almost every straight woman that I've met that talks to me about him. He is clearly very attractive and knows people think this. I'm not saying that he isn't/can't be insecure about his looks, but he knows how other people view him even if he doesn't view himself that way. 

Back to the main story. K continued to call me a selfish prick a couple times and I just responded ""wow thanks"" or ""np"" every time. It was at this point K said, ""Hey, I wonder if we'll have to pay /u/ZWE_Punchline's rent if he kills himself this time?"" this annoyed me, so I responded, ""don't worry K, I'm sure one of your Ice Age pals need somewhere to kip this winter. Or was I not meant to mention your insecurities in front of others?"" He said, ""at least I'm not a selfish hypocrite with a messiah complex"" and I responded, ""so it's okay for you to mention my suicide attempts but not the cyber bullying you were pathetically worried about - and I'm the hypocrite? Damn man, your eyes must really be too far apart to see the truth properly."" He left the group chat after this and unfriended me on snapchat.

I wouldn't have said anything about it if he hadn't brought up my suicide attempts first. That was a dark place for me and he knew that, but I feel like I did twist the knife a bit. Thing is, now I'm slightly concerned that, out of spite, he won't sign off on the replacement tenant I find (if I do). Was I in the wrong here? How do I go about making this water under the bridge? I genuinely don't understand how he can make fun of something so personal but get offended when I compare him to a bloody cartoon character. It's some Xi Jinping level shit if you ask me but maybe I'm just up my own arse.",14Dec2020,1

He said he wanted to know what my body looked like and when I sent one he said I was “thick” I thought that was it but today he asked for another because he  “missed seeing me” I said no, I’m not that naive, and told him that I wasn’t comfortable sending him pics because I didn’t know him and didn’t want to be preyed upon. He said that was fine and okay, that he understood that, and he didn’t stop texting after that and seemed to be semi-embarrassed.

Before, I as trying not to get on his case. We’re all depressed with COVID and we each handle it differently. I also need him to keep his job and pay rent. But I’m worn out. 

He’s very slow and forgetful. If I need something from him, it takes longer because I’m a roommate. He doesn’t clean up after himself. He bills the company for afternoon naps. He threw up on our balcony on a Monday at noon and left it there for 7 hours. When I noticed, I gave him a hard time and he still had the gall to ask me if it needed to be cleaned. He’s since cleaned it twice and it still smells a bit. It’s not the first time he’s thrown up. It’s just the first time he was so blatant and negligent about it.

674,"Ok so a little more details about this my friend is 27 and works a fulltime job. But despite that he's always broke, he constantly asks people to lend him money. 

He lives with his family and told me he lives in a home that his uncle owns and was giving his grandpa rent money to pay his uncle and apparently he's telling me his grandpa was using his rent money for personal use and didnt give his uncle the rent. 

He's been telling me he's been having issues with his uncle for months and has basically telling me he might get kicked out for the past 2 months (more than enough time to find a new place to live) 

He kept bugging me about living at my place temporarily, (and rent free) so that he can have a place to stay until he has the money to pay his rent at this new place he found.

But in all honesty I think he's full of shit, whenever i hangout with him he always gets calls from bill collectors that he constantly declines. He also constantly changes his story about whats going on at home and I have a very deep gut feeling that he is lying about whats going on and wants to say at my place so he doesnt have to pay rent.

Last night i was hanging out with him and he was trying to play victim and was like ""man its hard being homeless"" basically trying to get a reaction from me. And i was just like ""yup"" and completely unphased by that statement. Then later that night he confronted me about not staying at my place. And i was basically completely honest with him and told him that i dont believe him and think that he's lying about whats really going on.

He got mad and basically tried to guilt trip me and revealed that he was crashing at another friends house and said ""i dont even care that he's homeless"" and i was like ""yeah, because i knew you were lying""... which he was. He literally told me he was sleeping in his car and then changed his story once i confronted him...

675,"So I recently bought a two-bedroom house (yay!) after living with my mother for three years to save up! Long story short, my mother wasn't a big fan of me hogging the living room or really spending too much time alone in the living room so I spent most of my time in my room and after months of quarantine, purchasing my house was supposed to be my space to use freely.  

The issue is my best friend was moving back from another country and needed somewhere to stay while she got back on her feet (we are from an expensive area, and without the ability, for her to move back in with her parents, it would have been really difficult for her to find her own place). I was happy to help and offer her my extra room (my boyfriend and I share my room). Overall, she's a good roommate! She's clean, shares, participates in the household chores, and pays on time. She's a big advocate for herself which is an awesome quality! But the shadow side of that can be she will be a little inconsiderate of others' comfort without it being explicitly stated to her. We've been having some issues this year (I posted about it) so handling things with her have had to be a bit delicate. 

**Issue #1 She doesn't spend too much time in her room and is very present in the shared areas**. Though she has a desk in her room, I find that she will work all over the house outside of her room. When she is occupying a space, she makes her presence very known. She listens to things without headphones, will be very sprawled out, or leaves a mess behind her for periods of time. It makes it uncomfortable to share a space with her, especially if I'm working or I'm in the mood to just simply get some alone time out of my room. Overall, I'm fine with these behaviors, it's really how long she will occupy the common areas. I don't want her to feel confined to her room as I know how horrible that can be, but the result is I'm starting to feel confined to my room and after working so hard to purchase this home, it doesn't sit right with me. Additionally, though it is small, she does pay rent so I think that earns her the right to roam the home freely. I want to know how to address it without it coming across that the expectation is she stays in her room like a prisoner. I spoke with her about the mornings as I like to have my morning routine alone and asked for the kitchen/living room until 10am but the result is she will stay in that space from 10am to 7pm or later depending on the day. 

**Issue #2 It seems to be clear that the time frame she plans on staying here versus how long I plan on housing her doesn't match.** Though I've framed it as temporary and though she sees this as a favor, there will be times she will chime in on conversations I'm having with my partner about long-term projects. For example, my partner and I have big plans for our backyard in the coming years and she will chime in with ""I can't wait to use \_\_\_\_"" ""we should really get\_\_\_\_"". I think the issue here is that she sees this as a roommate situation. I think it stems from how long we've been friends and how long living together after college has been a plan. I think she takes a little offense to my plans changing to include my partner a lot more, focusing more on building my future and less ongoing through adulthood with her (I mean we are a lot older than when a lot of these soft plans we made could be a reality, but I can still understand being hurt by it.) How do I set her straight compassionately? I also know that it's a hard job market right now, so it's no rush for her to leave, I just want to make sure she doesn't intend on camping out here.",14Dec2020,1

I literally coordinate every meeting assignment and have done most of the work building our product. I am the only dude in the group (of six), and I do professional-level graphic design so I designed all of the branding and presentation for our business's final presentation. This morning we met with our professor for some last-minute feedback on our presentation, and someone labeled each of the slides for each speaker and the professor interpreted it as who had done which slide (I did most of the slides but I am only presenting two of them).  Our names are not in alphabetical order on the title slide and of course, this one girl put ""specializes in brand design and marketing"" in her bio for the ""team slide"" and has her name listed first consistently throughout.  They NEVER have anything to say in our team meetings but were suddenly experts in our meeting today talking about all of my slides like they made them!! I developed all of the financials and our pitch (neither of which I am presenting) and he liked those slides most, the two slides that  I am actually presenting ( and that are labeled for me) are of course the two slides that he had the most criticism for. He had some anger towards me because when I showed up to the meeting (the meeting that I had scheduled) I said "" sorry I'm late (by 30 seconds) I have an overlapping final presentation for physics"" and he immediately flipped out and said that he wasn't going to give us advice cause it was disrespectful to my physics professor. I explained to him that I had scheduled the meeting knowing my other class ended 5 minutes before and that it had simply gone over, and then he repeated what I had said to imply that I was lying and that I was actually in another class; I just said ""no sorry, I just had trouble switching my Zoom"" and then he was like ""ok well EVERYONE else has their cameras on so put yours on"" (didn't realize mine was off because I was on my phone) and I just said ""of course, sorry"" and put mine on.

684,"Foreword: Asking strangers for advice is very unusual for me but I’m driving myself crazy trying to make decisions. I don’t know if all this information would be helpful but I will break down my situation in parts so you may skip as you want. 

Background: 
I moved to the US when I was 16. I came from a very, third-world-country-poor and very unstable family. Had to raise myself and support myself from 16 years old. I worked 3 low paying jobs at a time sometimes to sustain myself. 

College:
When I was 20 I decided I wanted to become a medical doctor. None of my family has gone to college so I walked into my local community college and asked a random lady what I need to do to become a doctor as this route in the US is different from how you do it in my country. I didn’t know much about scholarships, loans, or grants or how any single thing worked in college so I winged it and somehow ended up taking my first semester. I picked Biomedical Sciences as my major. I got a side job as a medical scribe in the ER as this gave me exposure and experience to/in the medical field. I got good grades. Until I had to get a third job and I started burning out. This cycle kept going for many years 20years old to now 27 years old. Try college again,need to work, burn out, drop classes, rinse and repeat. 

Finding family:
Two years ago I met my best friend and love of my life. I am engaged to a wonderful guy who supports anything I set my mind to and believes in me. He knows about my dream of becoming a medical doctor and, unlike my family, always reminds me if I really want to do it I can. He makes a very good living, has no student loans, and has even told me if I needed/wanted to stop working while I finish college that he encourages it and he will take care of us.  I finally feel the hope of having the healthy family I never had. I got diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I am going to therapy regularly and taking a life saving medication. My life is going amazing finally after struggle (alone) that I don’t want to fit into this post. I am turning 28 soon. My fiancé and I have talked about having two children after we are married. I am now a flight attendant- my schedule is incredibly flexible, I make a good living, amazing benefits: matching 401k, amazing health insurance, free flights, etc. 

Plans:
I know, more than most, that life doesn’t always go according to plan. We have made a plan of our lives but are aware that if things turn out different we will roll wit the he punches; however, it is good to have a blueprint. We would like to have two children before I am 35. Because of my upbringing, I want to raise my children well. I am not saying a working mother can’t raise amazing humans, but I want to be very involved in raising my children. One plan we talked about is me staying home as our babies are small and then maybe working part time as a flight attendant when our kids are school aged (he’s worried I might lose myself or resent just staying home, me too, also flight benefits...).

Now to the point, advise:
My dream of med school has become more hopeless with the years. When I first started, nothing could change my mind, I’d fail at college because of having to withdraw, and I’d try again over and over. Now I am more cautious. I know my limits when it comes to getting overwhelmed. I know I have a hard time going to school and working even a part time job because I get so invested in things and end up burning out. I can feel myself having less “brain capacity”. My untreated anxiety disorder has obliterated my retention. I have a much harder time learning than I did before. Still, my fiancé insists that I can still do it if I want to. That I’m smart and capable enough(which I don’t feel I am). Thought the childish dreamer in me, at some capacity believes I still could if I put my head in it because I’m pretty persistent. Also, I am worried about debt. I don’t know how worth it is going to college if I have to get into debt for it when I already have a perfectly fine career (However, COVID taught me how unstable the airline industry is as I am furloughed without a return date right now). My fiancé has no debt. We are both very financially savvy and conscious so that’s a huge thing for me. He, even being this way, still says I need to do it if I really want it but still tells me he’ll support whatever I decide to do. 
I can’t get medical school out of my head. I can’t. I’ve been at the point of “forget it, I’m not doing it, it’s stressful anyways, medical school is unhealthy, why would you put yourself through that, why get into debt, you really don’t want to do it”. Matter of fact, I advise people not to do it. Pre-med is hard enough as I experienced. I convince myself fully that i don’t want to do it. However, the desire always comes back to me. 

The reasons I love medicine: I do have a passion for helping others as most who go into this field should have. But then why don’t I go to nursing school? I love science, I love school, I love research, I love the books, I love the thought of the extensive training medical school provided. I don’t really look for the direct care that nurses give, I want the patient’s care management side, the opportunity to get into research, the learning. Maybe I am wrong. I have tried to get my head into nursing but I just can’t. Sometimes I wonder if I want this just to prove something to myself or someone else(family?)- maybe that I’m in fact smart, that I could’ve gone a bad path but look at me I’m a doctor...? I don’t know. This is something I am working on with my therapist. 

Something else i am worried- my future children. I could get my biomedical sciences degree before having children (I have two years of my bachelors left if I take all my classes as I should every semester). I could stop then and wait for them to be school aged to start applying to medical school/getting everything ready to apply, etc. so I can at least be more present for their important years of formation but then...how much will I be absent? Grown children also need their mother. Family is extremely important to me. 

Anyways, I’m not sure exactly what advice I’m looking for but please tell me your thoughts. 
I guess mainly- is it worth it? Is my inability to shake the desire to go to medical school legitimate? Am I going to go into debt getting this bachelors degree to then find myself doing nothing with it? Am I a bad future mother.

685,"My brother and his wife had a baby about two months ago. They have a house 10 minutes from us and have lived there for the past two years since getting married. We live in the suburbs of the capital in an affluent area.

Since the baby was born, my brother and his wife have moved into her parents’ house (40 minutes from us in a sleepy small town in the countryside) for extra support with the baby. My brother is back to WFH full time now. 

My SIL refuses to let our side of the family interact with the baby because she is scared that we will pass on coronavirus to one of them who could possibly pass it onto her grandmother (who is high risk and their household is in a bubble with).

Essentially, my brother has been banned from seeing his side of the family and none of us have met the baby yet. My brother confessed to my mum that he has felt trapped and very depressed ever since the baby was born. He doesn’t socialise with anyone and is pretty much stuck in his in-laws house. He hasn’t even been out to a cafe or had any social events since March. He says that no matter what he tells his wife she will not see any reason and it only ends in a row.

I am really worried about him and it seems he feels stuck in the middle between his (demanding) wife and our side of the family who feels hurt that we’ve been cut off and not allowed to see the baby or much of him.

Foreword: Asking strangers for advice is very unusual for me but I’m driving myself crazy trying to make decisions. I don’t know if all this information would be helpful but I will break down my situation in parts so you may skip as you want.

Background: I moved to the US when I was 16. I came from a very, third-world-country-poor and very unstable family. Had to raise myself and support myself from 16 years old. I worked 3 low paying jobs at a time sometimes to sustain myself.

College: When I was 20 I decided I wanted to become a medical doctor. None of my family has gone to college so I walked into my local community college and asked a random lady what I need to do to become a doctor as this route in the US is different from how you do it in my country. I didn’t know much about scholarships, loans, or grants or how any single thing worked in college so I winged it and somehow ended up taking my first semester. I picked Biomedical Sciences as my major. I got a side job as a medical scribe in the ER as this gave me exposure and experience to/in the medical field. I got good grades. Until I had to get a third job and I started burning out. This cycle kept going for many years 20years old to now 27 years old. Try college again, need to work, burn out, drop classes, rinse and repeat.

Finding family: Two years ago I met my best friend and love of my life. I am engaged to a wonderful guy who supports anything I set my mind to and believes in me. He knows about my dream of becoming a medical doctor and, unlike my family, always reminds me if I really want to do it I can. He makes a very good living, has no student loans, and has even told me if I needed/wanted to stop working while I finish college that he encourages it and he will take care of us. I finally feel the hope of having the healthy family I never had. I got diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I am going to therapy regularly and taking a life saving medication. My life is going amazing finally after struggle (alone) that I don’t want to fit into this post. I am turning 28 soon. My fiancé and I have talked about having two children after we are married. I am now a flight attendant- my schedule is incredibly flexible, I make a good living, amazing benefits: matching 401k, amazing health insurance, free flights, etc.

Plans: I know, more than most, that life doesn’t always go according to plan. We have made a plan of our lives but are aware that if things turn out different we will roll wit the he punches; however, it is good to have a blueprint. We would like to have two children before I am 35. Because of my upbringing, I want to raise my children well. I am not saying a working mother can’t raise amazing humans, but I want to be very involved in raising my children. One plan we talked about is me staying home as our babies are small and then maybe working part time as a flight attendant when our kids are school aged (he’s worried I might lose myself or resent just staying home, me too, also flight benefits...).

694,"Hi.  I'm a 17 yo in high school right now.  I would really like to move out for university and am planning to pay for everything myself.  My family will not be helping me pay for higher education regardless of circumstance but that's understandable imo.

I come from a very conservative asian family and my father is not keen on letting me move away.  He has a ton of prejudicial views and is particularly controlling and violent.  My older brother has autism and is probably 10x as aggressive as my dad, I've had to call the police on him multiple times for safety reasons.  My mom is kind of hung up with her own issues and while she also hopes I'll get to move away, she will not actively help me for her own safety.  I have really been looking forward to moving out, atleast for a few years.  I know I will have to take care of my brother in the future but I have been in the closet forever and am frustrated with the situation.  I know I'll probably get disowned by my dad eventually anyways, he keeps bringing it up.  I would rather not throw my family under the bus to go to university.  My other main option for moving out is joining the military which is okay I guess but kind of a last resort.  I would love any advice, thank you in advance.",14Dec2020,1

So, I (16F) was in an annonymous chat website and I started talking with this girl that said she was some age between (12-14) i don't remember exactly. We talked about a lot of random stuff and she said her parents took out all of her social media because she started talk with an older guy and send him pictures, I said her parents were right because there's a lot of dangerous people on the internet. However, she said she wanted to send me selfies because she thought I was cool and trustworthy. At first I thought it was a little bit strange, but she insisted and I was bored so I said that it was okay. She send me her email where we cold talk and I texted her on my main email account saying ""hi"". The thing is, after that she just closed our conversation and didn't respond to my email. Now I'm worried that it was some kind of double meaning conversation where the other person took it to the wrong side, althought I din't think about that possibility at moment, just now rethinking about what happend, since I was just bored and lonely and wanted a friend to talk to. I feel disgusted of myself and stupid for not thinking about that when I talked to her. I have anxiety and OCD so this triggers me so much.

I’m flooded with work and I check in with the project...it’s blank. I knew I’d be the one to do most of the work.

I’m 21, I’m starting to feel the pressure of being a virgin in today’s society. I’d love to have my first time with a guy who I can trust enough &amp; feel safe, but I haven’t met one like that who I’m attracted to. 

Despite having that standard, it’s getting frustrating as I’m physically 100 % ready to do it - I’ve learned how to get off, what I like and my sex drive is really high. 

I catch myself often in situations where I’m often like “Ugh I wish I wasn’t a virgin, so I just wouldn’t be afraid to go over to his place” after a party. I’m scared I’ll attach easily and over analyze if something goes wrong.

Basically I have cognitive dissonance 🤷🏻‍♀️ I kinda wanna do it right away, but I’m scared how my mind will react (attachment, etc). On the other hand, a guy I’ve known for more than 2 dates would be better, too.

701,"So, for backstory we dated a few years ago. He was in the military and i was thousands of miles away lol. It just wasn’t working and he said he saw me as more of a friend. He had plans to reenlist but ended up not doing it because of personal family issues. Even after he broke up with me, we stayed in contact and we’re good friends. When I got in my wreck he was the first person I called, even though I knew he couldn’t help me. He was just the only person who could calm me down. 

When he came home, we decided to hook up. It just became a thing. He’d come over once a week, sometimes once every 2 weeks. He would bring me snacks, and we’d have sex, then cuddle and sleep. The sex is phenomenal, for both of us. 

He’s always been there for me. In every way possible. He loves my kid, and they get along so well and my son loves him. They play video games together, play in the store while I shop, build little cars together and watch movies and play around the apartment while I cook or bake. 

It’s been a year or more since he got home. And now I live in my own apartment (he helped me move in lol) an hour and a half away from him. He still drives here once a week to stay the night with us. I cook him dinner and he holds onto me and talks to me while I cook. We take showers together and play games and he always goes above and beyond for me. I often times joke about marrying him, or living together. He says maybe one day when he isn’t needed at home he would consider living together. 

Hes so insanely patient, kind, understanding, funny, and caring. I know I love him. But it complicates a lot of things. I know for a fact - ive asked him - that he doesn’t see me that way, and that I’m his best friend, but that’s it. I’m fine living the way we are. Best friends and that’s it. Just continuing how we are. But sometimes I just.. want more. I’ve never, never had someone in my life I could rely on or feel comfortable around.

I’m here to ask for some general healing methods and how to  make the grieving process a bit easier. 

Earlier today, my girlfriend and I(M19) broke up, and right now I’m not sure what to do with myself. I get that this is young love and I’m going to experience it again, but I just need help to heal at the moment. This girl was and is my first love, and is also the only proper relationship I’ve had in my life. Yesterday was our six month anniversary and today we called it off.  

In short, I just need some coping mechanisms to help get me through this. Seeing friends and going out is not possible due to the situation of COVID in my county, so maybe techniques to help me deal with it at home and how to move on from this quickly.

I am so awkward sometimes, most of the time I let my other friends talk and wait until they say something that I can add something too. For a while, I have been struggling to connect with them. 

I just feel like I am just a burden and that they don't care about me. I mean, I don't drink or smoke but out of all of them, they all smoke weed and drink and I always feel like the odd one out. I hate not being able to drink, I always feel like a burden that I am also not drinking with them. I hate being called innocent compared to them. For fucks sake, I am the only virgin there and everyone always talks about sex sometime or another and it makes me feel so awkward.

706,"My friend stopped talking to me about 6 months ago over race (she is white, I’m not). We’d been best friends for about 6 years. She’s always touted herself as someone who shares a lot of interests with POC and “understanding them better than most white people,” in her own words. So much so when I would date, she would say “you need to date a white person who is cultured like me.”

When the George Floyd incident happened it was traumatizing. I didn’t speak to her or any of my friends for a couple of days because I had a lot of emotions to sort out. She and another friend were reaching out to me and slowly I started reaching back out to talk. When I talked to her, she called me all kinds of names and said I was a horrible friend (and that she thought that way for quite some time and pitied me) because I had expressed to her I wasn’t very comfortable talking to her about race/the situation, and frankly I felt that way about several other people in my life too because I felt like they wouldn’t understand fully. She made it about her and how I thought she was a racist (I didn’t) and said that she wasn’t a fake friend like the others that I had and that everything was always about me. I sent her screenshots of me explaining to our other friend the same sentiments and that it wasn’t a her and I issue, I was just overall having a hard time. She went below the belt a lot and started bringing up hurtful people in my past and said that all I cared about was myself because I didn’t even know she was depressed. I told her ass off because I knew I had been a good, devoted friend to her but clearly she never realized that. I felt confident that was her true colors and it completely being out of line. 

She apologized and said she’d been under a lot of stress and was in fight or flight mode and that I was a good friend to her. She opened the door to let me talk so she could listen and understand me, but still said some interesting things like how she has “multicultural privilege” and that I “only see racism” because of where I grew up (but we both lived in and came from conservative areas). She even pointed out how I’d been bullied by people at work who were of the same race and I explained to her that sometimes tokenism breeds nasty and unnecessary competition, which is what happened. She also apologized for some of her views, like her view on “Karen” being a racial slur because she didn’t consider that it was more about behavior and that calling someone that doesn’t have the same impact as, say an anti-Semitic or racial epithet. She said if in the future she says anything offensive to me to just let her know and I said ok. She also said if something is bothering me to not ignore her and check in with her, to which I agreed and apologized for. 

When we would talk, at first she was receptive and blamed a lot of her ignorance on her thinking that her high school (which was mixed) was one happy family. A couple of times she would criticize if an experience was actually racist or over explain a lot when I would ask her what she meant by certain statements, such as her saying she thinks the president is racist because of the immigration stunts he was pulling and how it affects her being paid at her job if people have to move out of her building because they can’t stay in the country. When she would talk about her dislike of the President on immigration issues, I would listen, but I noticed she started to avoid the topic if I brought it up what I wanted to talk about. When I asked why, she said I was getting offended by her and that I’m getting defensive so maybe that’s why I’m getting frustrated with her. I said no I don’t feel offended at all, but I’m a little frustrated because we agreed to talk about it and it’s like you’re avoiding me so what’s wrong? Maybe things aren’t coming across right in text, but if it’s not the right place then I understand. So then she tells me that if there is another way to support like having a phone call to let her know but all of this is so negative and that she’s very depressed and can’t handle it right now because I am pointing out her flaws. She feels like I’m constantly attacking her and that she doesn’t know what she said wrong because she didn’t say the right thing. I’ve never asked her to do that. 

I asked her what is she really wanting, because I’m confused. I laid it out to her pretty plainly you yourself offered this bridge and I thought we were on the way to amending after our fight. I haven’t criticized you as you have me and I’ve only tried to acknowledge and understand your perspective. I haven’t pointed out when I was offended at all but I did think we were in agreement with one thing but now you’re kind of acting and saying something different. All I wanted to do was to be able to express myself to someone I am close with. I’m sorry that the topic is negative but for me I do deal with it on a daily basis and I can’t change how I look. But since it’s so negative, ok then. I wished her well in feeling better and said I’d drop the argument because her birthday the next day and didn’t want to ruin it by arguing. I wished her a happy birthday the next day and she said thanks. She has not spoken to me since. 

I’ve tried to reach out in our friend group chat a couple times and she’d passive aggressively answer. I’ve asked our mutual friend if she’s doing the same to her and she said no, they still talk. I’ve seen that she still speaks to our other friends so I took it as she’s done with the friendship and that’s my signal. So I’ve done what I could on my end to distance myself from her online so I don’t get upset. I guess I am devastated because I thought she was a forever friend. And I started to think was I expecting too much? Was I pushy or something?

TL;DR My friend stopped talking to me after arguing about race. She feels I am attacking her and I feel like I’m not being heard. She asked me not to ghost her when I’m sad, but ghosted me anyway.",14Dec2020,1

Backstory, My friends and I have been playing on a realm for a couple of days, I've kept it on normal mode, so it would be a no cheats world, and the friend who this story is about has called me before, to come on the world, and save them. He then told me to turn it on peaceful mode, which I was against, but he eventually wore me down, I told him this would be the last time I would do something like this.

So, my friend and I was playing Minecraft together on our Bedrock Realm, and if you don't know, Realms back up your worlds around every ten minutes. So, my friend died, and he had netherite ingots on him. He told me later that he had them on him because he didn't want them to get taken, which is funny, because he has stolen a lot from me and my other friend. (Also this is important, but he has killed three of my other friend's horses.) He then told me an hour later that I could restore the backup of the world, then he explained how I could do it, and at this point, I had done a lot of grinding and material gathering over the past hour, so I said, ""No, I'm sorry but I'm not going to reverse it.""

I(22F) need some friend advice, during this pandemic a lot has changed for me like many people. Before I was very outgoing, social, life of the party etc. I have always dealt with some mental health issues but during this year they skyrocketed. 
It’s safe to say that I’ve neglected friendships that actually really matter to me, and I can tell some of my closest friends are upset by these months of me just not being the best of friend. 
Things like texts going unanswered, my friends inviting me to things but me not going, when I do go to hangout I know I’m not the same energetic person. 
Without going into too much detail I’ve been diagnosed with severe anxiety and BPD(manic depression), and it’s come to points where I can’t even leave my bed for days. Where I talk myself into these horrible lows where I feel like I can’t go out and talk myself into these reasons. My mind wonders and tells me every person I care about hates me and I annoy them. 

I have not told really anyone about this diagnosis.

It’s not their fault at all... it’s mine. I know this, but I really don’t want to lose my best and honestly only close friends. I feel like it’s confusing because obviously on social media we don’t post all the bad things going on in our lives so if they see me post things that are the positives that are going on I feel like they think that I’m just ignoring them or neglecting them which I guess in a sense I am? I just wanna know what I can do to try to remedy the situation I don’t wanna hurt anyone’s feelings anymore. And I really value these relationships.

Tl;dr Ive (22F) been having a really hard time in result I have neglected my friends and I need to save the relationships because they are my closest friends that I care about.",14Dec2020,1

719,"Hi all,

In October, for my birthday, my parents bought a set of guinea pigs off of Craigslist (Rita &amp; Rhiannon). My family doesn't get things that aren't necessary very often, so it wasn't just a gift to me. They have also brought a lot of joy to my brother and mom. On Thanksgiving, our guinea pig Rita gave birth to triplets, and since then, the dynamic has really changed. I'm the youngest in my family, and it's more often than not that my voice doesn't seem to matter. I have tried to explain to my siblings that these baby pigs are not toys, but I feel like my parents continue this narrative that they're only here for our enjoyment.

One example of this is just this morning. My brother had picked up the runt (his favorite pig), and he had flipped her on her back to ""rub her belly"". This poor girl is only a few pounds, only a few weeks old, and even an adult guinea pig should never be in this position. Not only does it scare the hell put of them, but it can cause serious physical damage to do this to them! So, I don't often raise my voice, but I got out of my seat and scooped the baby out of his lap. I told him what he did wrong and why. My dad immediately yelled at me for ""bullying"" my brother. He explained that I should stop controlling my brother. I wasn't able to tell him anything after that because he made me give the guinea pig back and take out the trash.

This isn't the only time this has happened. The worst it's ever gotten was a few days ago, when my brother was petting the runt and she bolted off of him (almost a five foot drop) and hid under the couch. I told my family to stay away, hoping I could track her until I could reach her, but instead my brother opened the footrest on the side she was under. She wheeked louder than I've ever heard before, and bolted out to the middle of the floor, where I was able to grab her and return her to her pen.

Of course, incidents like this are really affecting this poor girls personality. She has lost any sense of trust or enjoyment when it comes to humans. I feel so useless because I know that it's my job to protect her, and I'm failing. I have tried to make rules, but not even my parents will follow them. I don't have permission to move the guinea pigs to my room, so still, every evening, these babies are passed from person to person around a blaring t.v. and lit cigarettes.

One solution I've thought of is rehoming. I have yet to bring this up to my family, but I can't find peace knowing that these baby pigs are being put into such harmful situations.

On the other hand, no one is interested in handling our adult pigs, Rita and Rhiannon. I'm not sure if this baby craze will pass as the pigs get older, or what. I truly don't think I have enough respect to set boundaries with these pigs, so I have no idea what I should do.",14Dec2020,1
721,I’m 17 and I think I’ve been doing a lot better than when I was a lot younger. I used to be really angsty and severely depressed because of my family and school. I had trouble making friends because people have labeled me as a the weird kid since I don’t really communicate with anyone and I only talk to like a handful of people I’m close to. Im really awkward and have trouble talking to random people around the school so I just don’t even try anymore since no one really likes me or so I assume that. My problem is that people still assume I’m just a huge asshole because of some stuff I’ve did irrationally when I was younger I no longer do that stuff since I think I’ve been slowly maturing and thinking twice before I say stuff to someone. I would lash out irrationally because I had no way to cope with my anger since my family is really toxic and I’ve never been able to talk about how I feel since my parents will just use that against me and make fun of me for being “depressed since it’s the new cool thing to do”. I really wish I could go to counseling but like I said my parents don’t believe in that sort of stuff so I was wondering what I can do to cope with my issues for now. I am planning to get counseling because my depression has been spiraling out of control and I do a lot more effort to hide it from my parents.

723,"I saw another girl post about this here, and it made me think of my situation which is a little different. And i'm wondering if I have problems because I watched porn as a child?


When I was about 8 I discovered porn on my brothers laptop. It made me feel really horny, but like guilty pleasure horny. And I would also fantasize about giving falatio to older unnattractive men from 8 to 13, not because I found them atttactive but because it made me aroused. But I would only really think  about giving oral sex, because I don't think I knrew about vaginal. At the time, I was attracted to 'pretty boys' but didn't get aroused from them. 


I was most aroused when I had to pee. When my bladder was full, I would rub my lower stomach but it's like it wasn't enough. Then after I peed I would feel intense guilt and disgust. And from around 11 to 13 was also the time I was groomed by those kinds of men online. So I would play hard to get out of fear, then after they sent a pic I would get horny then feel really gross after like an hour or after I peed. 


I'm 22 now, and things are different. I've never mastrubated and don't see the point in it or why everyone does it. The most i'll do is fantasize about a guy that loves me forcing himself on me and get horny from that.  But I don't feel that really intense thing I felt when I was younger. I feel nothing from seeing porn or dick pics. I don't have that specific kind of lust for anyone anymore, like I did with those fat older guys. It's almost like I have no interest in pleasuring myself and I just want to use sex as a tool for a guy to love me more when the time comes. 


I may be wrong, but it seems like most people can feel the way I felt when I was 8-13, and that's why so many people have casual sex. And I lost the ability to feel that way, pure excitement and lust, and even the same type of disgust. Did I break something in my brain when I was younger?",14Dec2020,1

728,"So I (23F) and my bestfriend (23F) have been having arguments. We have been bestfriends for over 10 years and she's a sibling to me. She just recently got into her first serious relationship and she's been ditching me a lot. I am really chill, I will never be the friend to say you should hangout with your boyfriend less, or over me. I just don't want to be treated poorly. She has apologized for it before and said she is having a tough time juggling life with a boyfriend, she's struggling to even get a job right now because she's obsessed with spending time with her boyfriend. 

So, about 5 days ago we got over our little argument about how she was ditching me, she really didn't care and we just ignored it and went back to everyday conversation. Our other friend and I had a conversation the night before, she asked how my bestfriend was, I say good blah blah, and then she asked where her boyfriend lived. Common conversation. I let her know her bf actually lived near my other friend so she was curious about what high school he went to. My friend then assumes he knows someone she knows that went to the same high school (she doesn't like this person, thinks they are a floosy). 

During my bestfriend and I's conversation I say, ""Hey by the way \*boyfriends name\* knows \*girl our friend knows\* she was wondering how she was in high school because she thinks she's a floosy, but I doubt that"" (this is me suggesting I don't think that about this girl like my other friend suggested but was curious. This is just something random, girl talk, that I have always been able to do with my bestfriend.

My bestfriend seems to be handling her new relationship a bit crazily. She responds aggressively with ""are you trying to say \*boyfriends name\* slept with her?"" I was extremely confused and tried to explain the situation blah blah blah. She immediately asks her boyfriend if they slept together. Then tells me to not talk about her boyfriend and that it hurts her to think about people her boyfriend has slept with before. (They never even slept together, obviously. No one ever thought that they did) 

And here I am confused as ever. I tell her I think she's absolutely acting off the wall and that I need a break from her. I am not one to fight, I just think I need to take large steps back from our relationship, so trying to be the bigger person I apologize to her and tell her I want to make her feel comfortable. I barely want to do this because I feel like I should be apologized to in the situation completely. She still wont speak to me its been 4 days now, I obviously want to make our friendship work but everything that has been happening and me having to apologize just for the sake of it and still being treated like this makes me even more angry.

I know his partying doesn’t personally effect me, but I don’t know why it bothers me that he does it. Is it because I’m not like that? Maybe it’s because I’m also concerned that he’s gonna keep drinking / smoking to deal with his problems. He doesn’t party all the time, but when he does he gets extremely wasted.

735,"This is gonna be a long post, sorry. TL;DR in the end.

Ok so let’s start from the beginning. My mom and dad got divorced back when I was two in 2002. I’ve since lived with my mom but visited my dad two/three times a week and slept over. My mom and I then moved to a bigger apartment in May 2012, and in November for my birthday we got a Birma cat called Simba. He was the sweetest, never hissed, scratched or bit except for one time when he hissed at the neighbors hyperactive Jack Russel when we took him out. He was an indoor cat but the last owner used to take him out on walks a little now and then.

Then about half a year later in spring 2013 we got a second cat called Embla but renamed her to Nala since we already had a Simba. A lady had found her out in the streets when she was pregnant and took her in along with her other 15 or so cats. She later took her to the vet and got her chipped and ready to be adopted. She was an extremely shy cat when we went to check her out and bring her home, but we thought it was mostly because of all the other cats there. We brought her home and let her out in the bathroom so she could get used to her surroundings and then later introduced her to Simba. He was not very interested, just looked at her and yawned before he then left a few minutes later so he wasn’t really a threat lol. 

She was still shy and a little afraid of me and mom but after a few weeks she got more comfortable and used to sleep at the end of my bed. In late 2013 our little Simba got sick, I don’t remember what it was called but he started walking a bit wobbly and about a month later his hind legs were almost paralyzed so the vets put him down and ever since then we’ve only had Nala. 

In 2014 my mom met my stepdad and he moved in with us and in October 2015 they had a baby, my little sister, and then in summer 2017 they had my little brother, so now it’s been pretty crowded in the apartment, I have my own room and my mom, stepdad and two younger siblings share one room, so I was pretty excited when my father offered to help me buy an apartment last year, and last month I finally bought one and I’m moving in January!

So when I’m moving I’m gonna bring Nala with me, since she is my cat and I’m the only one taking care of her. I feed her, cut her claws, brush her etc. for example when I visit my dad and sleep over two days in a row and come back home the litter box hasn’t been emptied. And when I went on vacation with my dad she hadn’t been brushed at all and she has long fur so her belly fur was pretty tangled. She’s also getting a little old so I think some peace and quiet away from the kids would be nice for her.

Though I’m afraid that she will feel lonely when we move because now when I leave for work someone else might be home. I’ve wanted to get another cat since we had to put the other one down so that Nala would have some company but I lived with mom and she didn’t want to, then my stepdad moved in and then the kids came and all that. 

So now that I’m moving I’m thinking of getting a kitten after about 6 months or some time so that Nala can get used to the new place and feel safe and secure.

I however don’t want to get a full grown cat since she’s very shy and submissive and I don’t want another cat to make her feel unsafe and scared, so I think a kitten would be great since she’s also had kittens before and she won’t be “overthrown” by an older cat. I know that cats do want company and it’s best to have at least two cats if I remember correctly?

So do you guys who might know more about this subject think that I should get a kitten after a few months in the new apartment for my cat Nala so that she won’t feel alone?


Side note: If I should get a kitten, does anyone know a nice shelter where I can adopt kittens in Gothenburg, Sweden? I don’t want to buy from people who breed if I can save one from a shelter instead

TL;DR: Moving out and bringing the cat with me, don’t want her to feel alone so want to get another cat but she’s very submissive and shy so I’m thinking of a kitten and not a grown cat so she won’t get scared and get “overthrown”.",14Dec2020,1

English is not my first language to bear with me.

So I (21F) and my little sister (19F) live with my mom (55F), as the title suggests she is an alcoholic and drank since I can remember. My parents split when I was 4 and even my dad said alcohol has been a problem with her for a long time. She even went to work drunk already a couple of times and if this happens one more time she will lose her job. She goes to therapy once a week before work, not on her wish but on the will of her employer. But she fucking keeps on drinking! 2 weeks ago we found 5 empty vodka bottles in her closet and today she drank a bit again and even picked up my sister in the car and drove her home, she not only risked herself but my sister and other people and I’m just so fucking sick of it. My sister is crashed, she is crying every time this happens and we are at our ends. I will move out in about 6 months so I’m also worried what will happen to her after this and if she will drink herself to death when she lives alone.

1. I'm white and I'm not sure if it's okay for me to talk about racism as I haven't experienced it. Things like the atrocities committed by groups such as the one that came about in the 20's and wear sheets like the fucking cowards they are, slavery, or how stereotypes such as ""Black people like chicken and watermelon"" come from racist propaganda that was made to dehumanise people of colour from the 1860's. I really don't want to be disrespectful however I'll always try to stop racism if I see it.
2. I don't want to make anything serious issue related just to make profit. I'd be disgusted if I did that and I don't want people to think it's just for profit. Climate issues and Racism are still extremely prevalent and should still be known, even if the protests aren't happening or in the media right now.

I'm thinking that if we write notes with historical stories, facts, statistics etc. or we make a video talking a bit about the issues with Climate Change and Racism (separately) on Instagram where we'll advertise them it might be okay. Should I just skip issue based patches or should I go head and design them? If it's not okay for whatever reason I'm currently designing other ones and is obviously fine I just don't want to do the wrong thing and end up hurting anyone.",14Dec2020,1

I found out that she’s doing better than me in one of our courses, but complained about failing all semesters. she asked me to send her my notes, because she knows I make nice ones, and I’ve completed them.

746,"hi expert advice givers, i have a personal problem that requires tons of effort and commitment to make better so ill dig your brains for the most that you can give me

i am a very toxic person, not by nature, its learned. i speak without thinking, saying everything that comes to mind (including rude and mean remarks), i unknowingly belittle my friends and somehow seem to get into arguments constantly. i easily lose my temper and keep grudges for a very long time. “forget but never forgive” seems to be my motto.

i feel as if people come to me to start fights, to be toxic on purpose, but i know thats just in my head. ive had many fallings with old friends and it seems to keep on happening but i truly do not wish for fighting. many of these old friends have not been supportive of me, have been rude because of my absence which was initiated by anxiety and stress, and seemed to never take my side and never consider how ive felt in a situation.

their behaviors have infected me to be the same. “do unto others as you would have them do unto you” was erased from my mind since kindness never seemed to work out for me, or i just didnt know how to be kind the right way.

now i have new people around me who i wish to keep for a long time, they have never made me feel unwelcome or anxious and im always invited no matter how much of an ego i seem to have.

so i ask you this, what can i reflect on, what is it that i can do to make myself better instead of convincing myself that i am a good person when i truly am not. my friends always say that i am good as i am and that i dont need to change myself for anyone, but i feel as if thats not right for me. i want to be better and the best version of myself, even if others cant see the same faults in me that i now see.

ive cut off my old friends recently, i was not good for them and they were not good for me. i do not wish to speak ill of them or to belittle their troubles but the feelings that they made me have were ones that no one should get from being around dear people who you trust. they were not the only ones at fault clearly, i was an idiot and ruined the relationships i had with these people, but in my current state i do not wish to befriend them anywhere in the near future.

i have apologized for my actions then and i will not do it again for my efforts to become peaceful were in vain.

based on this, what do i need to improve and how can i become deserving of loyal friends.",14Dec2020,1

She does the bare minimum to keep the cat alive, only really feeding it when it meows enough for her to get pissed about it and then goes to feed it to get it to shut up and she never cleans out the litter box. She never brushes it, hasn't taken it to the vet ever, and won't ever really go near the cat because she's too busy playing on her phone at home when we hang out. I'm really worried about her cat because it really only ever gets attention when I go there to hang out like once a week or so.

751,"So, I've started university last year. There was no pandemic stuff so the classes were normal, in the uni. I had to go through 4 hours of transports everyday, 2 hours to go, and 2 hours to go back. Which means I would wake up at 5:45 am, and get home at around 7 pm. I'm a person that lacks motivation so I didn't study much / dedicate myself to projects. 

The semester was going poorly, so I decided to stop for a while. This year I got back, and classes are now online which has it's ups and downs. No public transport / 4 hours lost everyday in public transport. However, it seems like I can't learn as much. And because everything is so confusing there's even less motivation to do stuff. My semester is still not over yet, and I can still pass every single class. However today, I had an appointment with a teacher in which me and some members of my group would show our project and I didn't attend it. The teacher asked if I gave up on the class. I'm not really sure if I failed the class for not going. I think I didn't but you can never be sure. 

In high school, I wouldn't do much, but I would still do enough to pass every class with good grades. However, this hits different. I don't know if it's the format, the way they teach it, or whatever it is. All I know is that I can't find myself to do anything.

754,"For people whose parents worked a lot: what impact did it have on you? Do you wish they did anything differently?

Parents whose kids are grown-up: do you wish you spent more time with your kids when they were little? 

My situation: I have two little girls (ages 3.5 and 1) and a caring husband. But I also have an extremely demanding, high-stress job as a product director at a tech company. My life ""looks"" successful, but I feel like my days are not aligned with my values (being a caring person for my family and community). Most importantly I am terrified I am going to regret missing out on time with my children, or losing my relationship with my husband, whom I rarely see. 

What would you do? Stop working altogether while the kids are little? Find a less demanding job? Keep current job but don't try to ""coast""? Something else? I recognize I am very lucky to even have the chance to choose. I am very anxious about making the ""right"" choice. 

**Reasons to maintain the current situation:**

* Finances: Having a job period feels very lucky during the pandemic. And, this job is highly paid with good likelihood of equity payout in 2-3 years. If I can slog it out for that long, I'd be in a good financial position to switch to a part-time, low-stress job and be present for my family going forward --- but will I have missed out on the most pivotal ""little years"" of my kids' lives? Will my marriage survive that long?
* Remote work: I have approval to work remotely permanently, and a babysitter/nanny is here, so I can see the kids during the day (usually 1-3 breaks per day of 5-15 min at a time)  
* Work is fun and enjoyable with kind people
* Good stability and career trajectory

**Reasons to change:**

* Very limited time with my kids; I fear that I'm going to regret not being more present when they are little and really want/need me
* Almost no time with my husband; our previously-strong marriage is really suffering 
* Often very stressed, so I can be curt, impatient or distracted with my kids and husband - I'm not the person that I want to be
* Almost no time to sleep (\~5 hours per night usually, between work schedule and baby wake-ups) and very limited exercise - not great for my long-term health
* No time for community, friends, hobbies, faith - anything like that which makes life meaningful

**What my days look like:**

Weekdays look like this:

* 5:30am: Wake up 
* **6am-4:30pm: Work**  (husband takes care of kids in the morning - I only see them when I take breaks from meetings) 
* 4:30pm - 8pm: cook while kids play, eat dinner together, put kids to bed while husband cleans
* 8-8:30pm: chores
* **8:30pm-11:30pm: Work** 

Weekends are me taking care of the kids and doing chores (errands, cleaning, cooking), plus 4-12 hours of work either after the kids go to bed or while my husband watches the kids.

756,"Hello everyone. 

Today I need your advice. 

In 2007, when I was in grade 7, my family moved into another city. I lost all my friends and I couldn't make any for the next 4 years. Because every one was paired up and grouped up. I was basically the good outsider. 


Then when I got into alevels I made 2 friends. I had little to nothing in common with them beside school stuff. When I got done with Alvls we kept in touch and met regularly. With one friend I had really nothing to talk about so we kind of drifted apart and only met on big occasions like birthday or sickness. 

The other friend got me hooked up on ""Sheesha"". I didn't even like the stuff just did it so we would have a reason to meet up. 

And so the friendship continued till date. 

Today I realised something. We don't have anything in common. He likes different kind of music, like trendy stuff. I, on the other hand, like music that means something to me. Lyrically mostly. We watch different kind of movies. He likes action, thrillers and horror. I like drama and comedy. So on and so forth. He likes football, I couldn't care any less about it. I like cricket. 

We even study in different institutes, have different opinions about everything. Like he is against women empowerment and objectifies women. But he is a smooth talker. I, on the other hand, speak to the point and often disregard people's feeling. And he eat with his mouth open and smacks his lips way too often during eating. Its disgusting. 

I read when I have spare time and play World of warcraft solely. He hates mmorpgs and reading. He likes FPS and fifa. 

So I have invested about 9 years in this friendship and besides my family I have no friends in real life. It doesn't matter to me if I have friends or not. Right now I am asking for your advice if it is possible to keep this friendship going or if it is even worth it?",14Dec2020,1

I started earlier this year and a couple of months ago I started posting pictures of my progress on social media. It started with pole pictures but I’ve been focusing more on aerial hoop recently. 

My boyfriend has never been comfortable with me posting pictures, even though my Instagram is private and I only really have friends I know personally and family following me. I originally understood the discomfort with the pole pictures. While I kept it tasteful, pole does require less clothing to be able to stick to it and even though I do it for fitness, it will always carry the “stripper” stigma. 

To respect my boyfriend’s boundaries I checked in with him before posting and everything was fine. Recently, I wanted to post a hoop picture where I was doing the splits and he was very uncomfortable with it because he saw the splits as a promiscuous pose, even though I was wearing leggings and a long sleeved top in the picture. While I was respectful before, I started to question why this one made him uncomfortable and he was angry that I questioned why. After fighting he told me that I’m attention starved. I told him that there’s an element of attention-seeking to everyone posting things online—that’s just how humans work. Hell, he even posts stuff of his own. But he thinks that what he shows off (writing and music) is less attention craving because it isn’t body-focused. I see so many people posting dance and yoga pictures and videos every day and I’ve never seen them regarded as promiscuous.

769,"Hey all, new here, but I’m not sure what exactly to do about this. I left a toxic job earlier this year, after transitioning to working from home for a couple of months. I will not cover why the job was toxic, as that is a separate issue.

Part of the job included borrowed equipment (outdated iPhones). I suffered a mental breakdown connected to the job, and submitted an intent to resign. After wrapping up HR stuff, seeing a counselor to address my mental health, and now all but having erased most of this job from my memory, I find the phone.

Again, no one has contacted me to return it and based off of what I last knew while still there, they’d be upgrading the phones soon anyway. I have a feeling that even if I did (inconveniently, 2 hours out of my way) return the item, it’d just be sold, stored and never used again, donated, or thrown out anyway.

I don’t need a new phone, but it’s perfectly functional and I’d definitely be the type to give it to someone who needs it more than I do. Because I’m not sure, I neither want to say “forget those people, that job was terrible, the phone is mine” nor “no matter what, the phone is their property and it must be returned regardless of their intentions with it.” 

I suppose it’s also possible that they assume I have the phone, have accounted for its loss, and have written it off already. I left around early May.

773,"Hello everyone,

So I’m in this little group of layman musicians, we’re not big but we like the music we make and do stuff here and there for a while.

So far we had a great band leader/conductor, who basically made most of the decisions after asking for our opinions. But he’s been through hard times recently, and since we haven’t been able to meet in a while anyway due to coronavirus restrictions he told us he’s retiring. Now it’s on us to find a new band leader.

There’s a guy who said he’d do the job if we want him, he seems competent and all, an amazing musician, but the problem is he’s way more polarising than his predecessor.

He said if we’d make him band leader he’d try to get us more involved in suggesting new pieces and projects, would let players who were often just accompanying have solos from time to time, write parts so that everyone can join in to the best of their abilities. 

The levels of experience among us are pretty varied, there’s some that have just started their instruments one or two years ago, some that have been playing since they were kids, and so it’s always been the case so far that the same four/five guys were always going the solos for their instrument while others were stuck counting 150 bars of rests and playing a low note every once in a while.

The problem is some of the regular soloists are scared they’ll blend into the crowd if the roles are distributed more evenly like the new band leader wants to, and I’m afraid that even though most of us are absolutely counting on this new guy to save the band, we won’t stand a chance if they leave or we all break apart.

What’s the right path to take here??? I really don’t want to risk their reaction if we do make the amazing new guy band leader, but on the other hand if we’ll let them take the lead then eventually it’ll just be them making music and everyone else will be left out. Help",14Dec2020,1
774,"before we start i am 15 and from the netherlands so there are going to be millions and millions of spelling mistakes

so heres the thing. i live in the netherlands and the school grading system is different but i will try to summarize it

so basicly after you are done with your first school also called the ""basic school"" at around 12 yo, you have to do a big test called the CITO test. Basically this test contains math problems and just a whole bunch of questions you would get on a IQ test.
after the results come in you are sent to a second school also called the ""middle school"". the better you do on the CITO test the higher difficulty your middle school will be 

there are 6 difficulties and i will just be calling them 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 with 6 being the easiest and 1 the hardest

1 and 2 take 6 years to complete and is for the best of the best

3 takes 5 years

4 5 and 6 take 4 years

Technically there is a 7 but that is for *special kids*

so when i did the CITO test i went to the 3 difficulty

so after year 1 i didnt make it. i didnt really do anything for school becuz i didnt care 

so in year 2 i went to difficulty 4. then i Easily beat that so much in fact that in year 3 i could go back the the 3rd difficulty

year 3......i tried....the hardest i could, i really REALLY wanted to pass. i learned at what for me personally was my limit. i was about to fail but there was 1 test coming up, if i passed the test i passed the entire 3rd year, if i failed i failed everything. this was it. i needed to pass. and then i didnt, i failed miserably in fact olny getting 13 out of the 44 possible questions right. yet i still went to the 4th year of the 3rd difficulty becuz of covid 19. my mentor, my Parents, and every other teacher that i have ever had agreed that i could still pass because of corona.

year 4. this is a different year because every 3 months there is a so called ""test week"" where there is 1 week that is filled with about 7 tests. you have 2 weeks on the dot to learn for every one of the tests.....i learned more then i had ever learned before.....the entirety of year 3 was nothing compared to what ever in the fuck i was doing in these 2 weeks... i studied more than my limit, i started responding diffelently to people, i started eating less and more quickly, i basically went insane.........and i didnt even come close to passing ANY of the tests not any... i just could not possibly do more. maybe other people could, but learning 4 hours a day with normal school still going on. it was my limit and i stopped caring after that i didnt do anything for anything. i just want to stop and fail the year and go to the 4th difficulty. i just want to go forward in time to where i failed this year and to where i can start over better and easier. but my parents dont want me to. they said that after i fail the 4th year of difficulty 3 that i would try it agian. i have a test tomorow. and my dad i sure that i am going to pass and that i will finish all 5 years of difficulty 3. but i dont want to. i lied to everyone i know that i am still going to try to pass this year. and they believe in me. but i dont. i just DONT WANT TO. the job that i wanna do later needs me to have passed difficulty 5 of above anyway. 3 just looks cooler on a piece of paper. im done with everything. i want to quit. but my parents and everyone beleieves in me and i would hate to tell them upfront. they want the best for me but i already know whats best for me, for my mental health. but nobody will listen, they just think the best for me is to go for the top but it just really isnt. tbh i dont really care if noone replies or reads this i just really wanted to type my problems out and show it to people even if they dont care. thanks for scroling past and a double thanks for people that read this entire thing.",14Dec2020,1

776,"Just to give you a little more details. I’m 29(m) barber living in Orange County California. For barbers, this year has been tough, for barbers in California this year has been especially tough, our governor just keeps shutting things down. I understand there isn’t an easy way of doing this but at this point I’m just at a loss of how to move forward. Back in March I took the lock downs very seriously, never left the house except for essentials, wore masks in public places etc. I lost my first friend in June. That one hurt. It was an outcome of this I just didn’t even consider. I tend to do alright being alone and at home so lock downs weren’t tough for me, but I didn’t even think to consider how it might be for other people. Fast forward to September, I lose friend #2. Now I’m frustrated, I’ve been doing my part, making sure people can’t get covid now I’m losing friends to something I wasn’t even aware they were going through. The first two friends I lost I didn’t talk too very often, so “checking in” on them just wasn’t something we did. So I’ve tried not to blame myself on the what I could have done aspect. Fast forward to mid November and I lost friend #3, but not any friend. My best friend, a friend I talked to every single day for the last 15 years. A friend I was talking to the day of. He had been through some really heavy stuff a few months prior but seemed to be doing so much better that this would have never crossed my mind. I’ll remember getting that phone call for the rest of my life. I was sitting at my desk playing video games, had just texted him to see if he wanted to play and his brother messaged me on Instagram saying “hey what’s your number I need to call you”. I just knew when I got that text something bad happened. I just wasn’t ready for what did. I have never ever lost some that close to me in any regard, I’ve lost grandparents when I was younger. But nothing like this. I’m still having trouble processing it. The reason I’m bringing all this up is, I’m now angry, I’ve done everything that’s been asked of me to keep the spread of covid. And what do I get in return? Lose 3 friends to suicide? Why do we need lock downs if they work? Why are we saving some lives but ruining others? How do I know me doing my part is working? When the only reward I’ve been given is the death of my friends, who didn’t die from covid, but the depression of losing jobs and crippling financial situations? Am I crazy for feeling this way?",14Dec2020,1

778,"Hi, for a bit of backstory I'm a 15 year old guy who is concerned about something. Up until about November I was my normal self, I was talkative with my family and often spent time with them. But, as of recently, I've been, really fed up for no particular reason, I'm just irritated easily and that's affected how I talk to my family. I've become quite impatient all of a sudden and I find myself sitting in my room by myself more than usual, being annoyed at nothing. The same thing has happened to my friends, I've become fed up with a few of them, haven't had a go at any of them because that would be wrong, but I feel like I'm losing any desire to talk to them or play games. Literally before writing this I was playing on my xbox with two of my friends and I left after 1 short game because I was too tired (also happening a lot as of recently). I'm concerned and afraid as it's as if I'm becoming repressed and too independent in a way. Before this I've had minor insecurities such as height and other generic crap you've all heard of before, but it's never been an issue, now it is. I just need some advice, is something wrong with me? Could this just be a long mood swing? Any advice would greatly help

779,"I have been with him for a couple months now. About two months ago he was saying that he wanted a kitten and I agreed, as I have always had pets and am financially stable enough to support a kitten. So we adopted from our local shelter. When she was younger he would use a spray bottle to get her off the table and when she would beg or try to take our food. She wasn't really reactive to the spray bottle and would stay on the table and keep stealing food. He gave up on the spray bottle out of frustration and has now resorted to grabbing her by the scruff and hitting her until she screams. she used to be super friendly and cuddly but now she just hides under the bed. As we live together there really isn't a way to keep her away from him. I have never been okay with animal abuse and thats all I see it as. Most of the time i end up crying watching it. I talked to him about how it hurts both me and the cat and that he needs to stop but hell be nice to her for two days and then go back. Honestly I am genuinely considering surrendering her. I know there are better homes for her.

785,"Sorry if this is in the wrong sub, couldn't find another that made more sense. I'm not sure what to think right now, I tried googling similar situations but can't find anything, so I'll start from the beginning.

I'm 22yo and female. I live with my dad (70M) and my brother (16M) for now while I finish school. Yesterday I made my bed, took all the covers and pillows off and redid the whole thing before leaving for work. After work it was left the same way, so I hop in bed and go to sleep. There wasn't anything in my bed other than my phone. I had kind of a hard time sleeping but it's been that way lately anyways, like when you feel like you just shut your eyes for 8 hours instead of actually sleeping.

When I woke up I was trying to feel around my bed for my phone, and instead touched a condom. I turned on my lamp and saw it wasn't used as in limp and stretched out...but it was very dirty with brown/red on it and it was dark-colored. There was no packet for it, either. I for sure would have noticed this earlier if it was there, but it wasn't. 

I disclosed it with my friends and they feel like I might have been assaulted in my sleep. They encouraged me to get tested, although I don't think I have ""enough"" to go forward with it if that makes sense?

I thought if it was a joke, but that wouldn't make sense because everyone in the house is a huge prude and wouldn't do that...

In the past when I was in middle school my dad left out used condoms straight up just in the hallway, and has walked into my room while (he thought) I was sleeping to go through my stuff. If that helps. Lately I've been really uncomfortable around him because he's accused me of sleeping around for having a toy hidden in my drawer and pretty much berated me for having a sexual drive. I've been spending most of my nights at my mom's lately but since my dad apologized and has been less of a maniac I've stayed here only a few nights, also to spend time with my brother (since he never goes to our mom's...).

788,"before we start i am 15 and from the netherlands so there are going to be millions and millions of spelling mistakes

so heres the thing. i live in the netherlands and the school grading system is different but i will try to summarize it

so basicly after you are done with your first school also called the ""basic school"" at around 12 yo, you have to do a big test called the CITO test. 

Basically this test contains math problems and just a whole bunch of questions you would get on a IQ test.
after the results come in you are sent to a second school also called the ""middle school"". the better you do on the CITO test the higher difficulty your middle school will be 

there are 6 difficulties and i will just be calling them 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 with 6 being the easiest and 1 the hardest

1 and 2 take 6 years to complete and is for the best of the best

3 takes 5 years

4 5 and 6 take 4 years

Technically there is a 7 but that is for *special kids*

so when i did the CITO test i went to the 3 difficulty

so after year 1 i didnt make it. i didnt really do anything for school becuz i didnt care 

so in year 2 i went to difficulty 4. then i Easily beat that so much in fact that in year 3 i could go back the the 3rd difficulty

year 3......i tried....the hardest i could, i really REALLY wanted to pass. i learned at what for me personally was my limit. i was about to fail but there was 1 test coming up, if i passed the test i passed the entire 3rd year, if i failed i failed everything. this was it. i needed to pass. and then i didnt, i failed miserably in fact 

only getting 13 out of the 44 possible questions right. yet i still went to the 4th year of the 3rd difficulty becuz of covid 19. my mentor, my Parents, and every other teacher that i have ever had agreed that i could still pass because of corona.

year 4. this is a different year because every 3 months there is a so called ""test week"" where there is 1 week that is filled with about 7 tests. you have 2 weeks on the dot to learn for every one of the tests.....i learned more then i had ever learned before.....the entirety of year 3 was nothing compared to what ever in the fuck i was doing in these 2 weeks... 

i studied more than my limit, i started responding diffelently to people, i started eating less and more quickly, i basically went insane.........and i didnt even come close to passing ANY of the tests not any... 

i just could not possibly do more. maybe other people could, but learning 4 hours a day with normal school still going on. it was my limit and i stopped caring after that i didnt do anything for anything. 

i just want to stop and fail the year and go to the 4th difficulty. i just want to go forward in time to where i failed this year and to where i can start over better and easier.

 but my parents dont want me to. they said that after i fail the 4th year of difficulty 3 that i would try it agian. i have a test tomorow. and my dad i sure that i am going to pass and that i will finish all 5 years of difficulty 3. but i dont want to.

 i lied to everyone i know that i am still going to try to pass this year. and they believe in me. but i dont. i just DONT WANT TO. the job that i wanna do later needs me to have passed difficulty 5 of above anyway. 3 just looks cooler on a piece of paper.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Fitness Advice: This one is heavily influenced by the first, but I would like some more info concerning getting started after I find out about the first.

3) Music Lessons - I am wanting to learn Electric Guitar, but am struggling learning from a book or from YouTube videos - so anything to help me get started here would be great. - I can also post pics of my setup too if you'd like to rate it.

4) Language Practice: I am attempting to learn German through the Rosetta Stone application, like V4 I think?  The version right before they went purely online / subscription based, so once I start getting into it I'd like to know where i can find some people to practice with.

5) Resume Writing: I am currently working, but based off of how supervisors have been acting lately I'm worried about the future.

796,"tw: suicide, mushrooms, laced drugs, sexual assault, eating disorders

hey. i dont really know where to go from here but i need to vent this out somewhere and figure out what to do from here. or maybe be told that i really sincerely fucked up and im just really fucking bad. 

yesterday i (20, f) bought shrooms from a dealer i trusted because ive purchased weed from them in the past. i got the number from a friend i had in one of my university classes prior to the pandemic starting. the dealer just recently started selling mushrooms so i decided to try them out. my roommate (25, non-binary) is one of my closest friends, and their partner came over for the holidays.

i took shrooms last night at around seven pm. 2g, if that. ive taken it in the past, so i knew thats all i would have needed. i had my fun with it and then fell asleep. it’s important to note that i havent eaten in the past week, and that i recently switched from sertraline to effexor.

i began having a reoccuring dream that ive had numerous times over the past few years. mainly that my life is a simulation, and it was very truman show-esque. i then began feeling as though i was absolutely burning up. i don’t know what happened, but i opened a garbage bag, threw the garbage all around, and threw up into it. i then remember looking for clothes to wear in the shower, and just throwing them about. i then went into the bathroom, stripped down, stepped into the tub, and then everything went dark. 

all i remember is that i had opened the fridge, went to my roommate’s room (naked), and was so hot that i thought i was having a suicide attempt and told them as much. they began rushing to get me water, and everything was really loud, and i just felt as though everything was a simulation. i tried to “suck the soul” out of my roommate’s partner, believing that i was a dementor or something, and seeing them as someone who had assaulted me in the past. needless to say, this definitely looked like i was trying to... kiss them? all i know is that my body but not my mind was being absolutely aggressive and horrifying.

things get hazy from here (as if they weren’t hazy enough). i was brought into the living room and given a blanket. i fall asleep. cops show up, and i wake up again absolutely petrified. i remember shrieking. everyone was trying to grab me, and i just wanted to go to bed. i kept repeating this. the police dragged me up and tried putting me in a coat, but i kept repeating that i just wanted to sleep and i was trying to walk into my bedroom. the police officers were bending my arms and twisting it, kicking my shins to try to get me down, and all i remember is being absolutely terrified, and tripping so hard that i thought it was my abusive father. 

i woke up in the hospital, absolutely confused, and then i realized that the past night was not a dream, but instead was very much a reality. my roommate had gone into my room, seen it a mess, and told my girlfriend that they didn’t think i was stable enough to come home (even though it was honestly just a mortifying, terrible trip). my girlfriend said that they needed space, because they had their own assault in the past in their own bed. they were trying to call my parents to pick me up, which was a terrible idea and thankfully my girlfriend talked them out of it.

the thing is, ive told my roommate in the past that if there was an emergency, to never contact them. my roommate threw clothes in a plastic bag, and didn’t bring my phone, but gave me money for a bus (which... i don’t know how i would have made that work without any idea on where i was?).

my doctor told me that the mushrooms were most likely laced with something (they made me throw up last night, which i absolutely do not remember). they told me just to not take those mushrooms again, especially not while i am on effexor. they gave me the hospital phone and i just began sobbing to my girlfriend. 

i feel so very fucking guilty about the whole situation, and honestly just mortified. but i’m also so fucking mad that my roommate who is so proud to talk about community care and abolishing the police would immediately call the police on me, and when i was asleep, didn’t turn them away. i just wanted to sleep.

i’m so horrified because there is nothing about this situation that is like me at all. i honestly am still reeling at what i did and i still don’t understand how that wasn’t a dream, or what happened. all i know is that my roommate has basically kicked me out for the time being and i’m with my girlfriend, who is so very understanding and loving and keeps telling me that that wasn’t me, that it was a psychosis, but i just feel absolutely disgusted with myself. i don’t know what to do from here, but i feel like a monster. i stressed out so many people and used up so many resources during a pandemic due to my own selflishness. i traumatized my roommate and i don’t know if i’ll ever forgive myself.

i just don’t like myself right now and don’t know what to do. i fucking hate myself. i know that that wasn’t Me, but it also very much was. i had no control and i had no idea what i was doing, but i felt as though my body was controlling me and i had no say. i felt absolutely trapped in my own brain and couldn’t control myself whatsoever. and now that i’m sober and alert, i can’t help but feel absolutely vile. and just need some advice on how to move on from here.",14Dec2020,1

800,"I've been feeling this way for a very long time, sometimes it got better, so I believed that it will go away as I grow up. I'm and eighteen years old guy now. It may have gotten worse.

I've done and do a lot of things, I play guitar, bass, piano, I do programming (It's also my job at the moment and I love it), I make music with my PC, I'm nerding tea, enjoy cooking, I'm also an amateur photograph, I love writing poems. I love maths and can explain things pretty well. And a couple more things.

Why am I telling you this? Seems like I'm a useful, well-versed guy. Unfortunately, that's not the case. I do not excel at anything.
 And I'm not able to even fucking draw and cut a fucking straight line with a razor knife! And I want to be able to work with my hands!

Everybody is better in what I do, which I don't mind, when it's not people I wouldn't expect it from. And of course, I should do less things and do them properly. Quality over quantity.  The problem is me, my mind. I love every single one of those things. I also get easily distracted, I mean - really, really easily. Even as I'm writing this post, It's probably very chaotic, I just can't write prose text, If it's not a reflection on a specific topic. I once said that I am a being of chaos, because I'm just all over the place.

I'm not a handy man and I'm not the smartest one either.  I'm kinda... useless, in a way. I'm not depressed or anything, but one problem makes me kinda sad... I'm also almost always in the wrong, mainly when there is an argument. And I can't argue for shit. It's not that I want to argue though. Also,  my memory isn't the best when I'm talking to somebody and they tell me stuff. When it's ""important"", I tend to not pay close attention, I don't know why. I try to write down everything I can think of, but still, I somehow find a way to forget it or fuck it up.

I don't look at the whole thing, if you know what I mean. I forget the important things. Again - I get distracted easily. What kind of advice do I want? I'm not sure, honestly. I just want to get repaired.Please, if you can make sense of what I just wrote and want to help me, please do. I will provide additional details, because I know that I didn't write down everyhing  I wanted to, but this post is long enough as it is. Also I can't think of it all right now.

**Please help. And please provide me with anything I should change in the post, I want to get better at every possible thing I can, even if it's a teeny tiny thing. The details complete the whole thing.** 

Thanks and I wish peace and a great cup of Japanese green tea for everybody here.

Love you all!

P.S.: If it helps I've had (Means that I've struggled with it in the past and almost went to a special school) ADHD, and dysphasia, both for which I've been to a psychiatrist a couple of times when I was a kid, but I can't grasp the concept of the latter that good.

So, during May of this year I was diagnosed with anorexia, I spent a few days in hospital and when I was released I started going to a clinic specifically for teenagers with eating disorders. I am recovered now and have recently stopped going to that clinic. 

Though during the past few days I’ve noticed my  little sister (she’s one year younger) has reduced her food intake, by a lot. I don’t know what brought this along and it’s starting to worry me. She has also recently gotten into a relationship and I don’t know if he has maybe made a side remark about her weight or body?  That’s one of the possibilities I’ve explored, but I’m honestly starting to think it’s my fault and she’s following in my footsteps.

More recently, despite not releasing any code himself for months, he threw me and a teammate under the bus in front of our entire team and our manager by saying the work was a terrible mess he couldn’t work with (even though he has worked with it before and hasn’t had to work on it since). But he never says what exactly could be improved or seems to try to make the improvements himself. 

I don’t know if there’s much to do in this situation but it’s stressing me out and making me really frustrated at this person. One thing to note is that we have the same job levels (he is not my senior) but seems to look down on us for some reason.

815,"My (17F) best friend (16F) and I recently cut contact.

I initiated a conversation with my best friend, “C” about two months ago that has snowballed and caused our friendship to end. I had heard from a few mutual friends that C had been talking behind my back, basically telling people that I was “jealous” of her and her relationship (one she wouldn’t be in without me), along with some other pretty rude things that your “best friend” shouldn’t be saying about you. When I confronted her about it, she cried and told me  that she would never say anything like that. Regardless, I told her I thought we should take a break from each other (after years of spending almost every weekend and school break together, multiple week-long family vacations, and going to school together for three years). I didn’t put a time limit on the break at the time because I was very upset, but wound up calling her a couple weeks later after learning that she had contracted COVID-19. I felt, at that point, that I was ready to move on from our argument and made that clear to her. I told C that I thought we needed to rebuild trust on both sides of our relationship if we wanted to make it work. She basically ignored this and only sent me an update on her condition a few days later. I sent her a text wishing her a happy thanksgiving, but I didn’t hear anything from her until my birthday, where she basically copied and pasted my thanksgiving message and changed a few words. I replied and said thank you &amp; that I hoped she was doing well, she didn’t answer. 

I didn’t feel as though I had done anything necessarily wrong, but felt as though there may have been things that I could’ve worded better in that original argument, or some things that I just crossed the line on, but during that call on halloween, I took accountability and apologized for those things. She did not apologize, take accountability, etc., but I let it go because I figured people could have been making things up or there could have been some miscommunication, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt that time.

It’s now been a few weeks, and I have continued to hear from multiple people (even more than before) that C is talking behind my back. She has called me jealous, self-absorbed, petty and weird (there are screenshots, I’m not going off of trust anymore). She blocked me on her social media but some of our mutuals have sent me screenshots of things she posts (I haven’t asked, but you know how teenage girls are) and it seems like everything she used to make fun of me for, like the music I listen to (I listen to country / folk, she listens to mainstream pop and rap) and my spirituality, she is now interested in. C also found out that I had lost my virginity and told at least two people that I know of. I don’t know how many people she actually told, and I don’t think I want to. I found out she knew when one of our mutual friends “congratulated” me. This gives me reason to believe that she was talking behind my back in the first place and I have no current plans to forgive her. The reason she found out is because her boyfriend, “K” (18M) is my boyfriend’s (18M) best friend. My boyfriend thought he could trust K with that information, but since finding out that K told C, has had a conversation with K about keeping that info private and is no longer sharing info about our relationship with K.

K met C through me. K was never my first choice for C and I didn’t necessarily love how close C was to my relationship (even while we were friends), but regardless, I was happy that she had found someone that made her happy and I expressed this to her when they first started seeing each other, despite not originally encouraging the relationship. C has told every one of our mutuals that will listen that her and I are no longer friends because I couldn’t be happy for her. This just isn’t true and completely neglects the real reason we don’t talk anymore. She also feels “backstabbed” and thinks I need to apologize.

This Friday, my boyfriend, me, K and C are going to see Christmas lights together. This was not my idea, but my boyfriend is very excited about it and I have expressed my concerns to him, but agreed to go. I’m mature enough to be nice to someone that I don’t particularly enjoy for a few hours, but I don’t want to come off as if I’m forcing it, or like I’m too comfortable. I also don’t want to seem too open or as though I want to rekindle our friendship, but I don’t want to come off as rude. How should I be acting around C? 

TL;DR: I’m hanging out with my ex-best friend after she talked badly about me behind my back and spread private information about me. How do I act nice without seeming like I’m forcing / faking it and making the night awkward for everyone else? Also, do I need to apologize to her?",14Dec2020,1
816,"To get to the point, I (17m) recently broke up with my girlfriend(17) and I feel really bad about it. She says that she has pretty bad anxiety and even though I haven’t seen much signs of her having that in the past 2 years, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. She also has an eating disorder. When I did it she was sick quite a lot and was off school a couple of days not eating anything. She snapped me a couple of times to tell me as well and was pretty upset, however when I asked her if she wanted to be friends she declined. She said she wished she appreciated me better and has apparently told someone I know that she plans on asking for another chance. 

During our relationship she’d constantly point out anything I did wrong, would accuse of cheating any time I talked to another girl despite her receiving and still speaking to people who have sent her Dick pics  and sometimes call me names like gayboy for talking to my friends, or Alki when I have a cider on weekends. I was pretty miserable throughout the relationship but I feel bad for her as well, as it seems like she has been pretty devastated. I don’t really like making people upset. 

On the other hand I’ve got my mother (38) who has been royally pissing me off. To give context, I live with her mother (my gran 58) and her sister (my aunt 30). I also have an amazing relationship with my dad (43) but he can’t afford for me to permanently live with him. I moved to my grans house 3 years ago when she cheated on my dad and they broke up. She would be out for nights and in the morning come home hungover. 

She’s a pretty extreme alcoholic and has been since I’ve remembered. She lived with her junkie boyfriend for a while in my old house and would frequently break up with him and come up to see us so we could “help” her. This is always around my exam time as well and throughout the year so I always struggle with studying. This year she was put in hospital for 4 nights and was hallucinating constantly. My gran always had to go down to help her which really stressed her out as she rarely sleeps. 

Throughout the summer she’s been in and out of hospital more times than I care to admit, brought home from the police more times than I can count, and was put in an asylum overnight after threatening suicide. She sent her now ex boyfriend into a psychotic breakdown and was evicted from her house.

She has moved in with a new guy down in Essex who I have met once and seems like a pretty nice guy. I don’t think he deserves to be with her, especially now that she has been abusive to his kids, calling them things like “cunts” and ranting about how she’s not a baby sitter 

We invited my dad for Christmas dinner who now can’t come because my mum has decided she is coming with her boyfriend who despite being nice enough, I don’t want to spend Christmas with either of them, but my gran is under enough stress and even though she dislikes my mum, it’s still her daughter. 

And finally, my dog has been pretty unwell lately from the arthritis in his legs, and he doesn’t have long left. I’m pretty much in denial until it happens but deep down I know it will. It’ll destroy my gran completely as it’s just her boy. 

I really don’t know how to handle things. I’m just really pissed off constantly and whenever I need to I just punch my bedroom wall a bit. I think my gran has noticed that I’m getting stressed but I don’t want to speak to her because she has enough on her plate, and my dad is happy right now, he doesn’t need to hear my shit more than he already does. I realise ranting to people over Reddit might not be the best idea but I legitimately don’t know what I’m supposed to do to cope",14Dec2020,1
817,"Okay forgive me y’all this is gonna be long, but it’s all important so please bear with me. TLDR at the bottom. 

So, my boyfriend of 4 years, asked me if he could go out to a bar with this woman he met at work. I said it would make me uncomfortable and I’d rather him not going drinking with another woman without me. He did give a half ass “well you could come too” but he knew I wouldn’t want to, because I’m being precautious of COVID. I will admit in retrospect, maybe I should have been cooler about the idea of it. But part of the reason it made me upset is he has a drinking problem as it is, and doesn’t need to be going out drinking with people as it is. And he would have NEVER been okay with me going out drinking with a male coworker, or male friend which does make me less likely to be okay with him doing something he wouldn’t let me do. 

Well, the weekend after I said no, he went out with her anyways, telling me he was going off to his male friends house, and even going into some detail the next day about what him and his friend did. When in reality, he’d went bar hopping with that girl. 

I had a gut feeling, after seeing him add her on FaceBook, and after me acting suspicious he confessed he really did go out with her. But that I just needed to trust him  that “nothing happened.” He said they drank rather heavily and went to atleast 3 different bars. He said he just needed a “female perspective” on his and I’s relationship problems, even admitting he atleast briefly discussed our sex life and issues we have. (Granted, this girl is not a friend of his. She was new at work, and he had only justtt met her, he told me he thinks she’s attractive when I asked.) 

I’ll also say, my boyfriend is 21 and she’s 30. And I kinda do believe it ended up being platonic. But the fact that he lied about it really really upset me. And I sorta feel like, I believe him that nothing happened, but I feel like his intentions are what matters. I told him when he asked that the way she asked him out almost sounded like she was hitting on him, and he kinda agreed and was acting all flattered. I feel like nothing probably did happen, but he still wanted to go check out the opportunity, at the potential expense of our relationship. And he just ended up unlucky that nothing happened, but maybe his intentions were for more?

He’s also shown a pattern of ditching me too often to go out to bars alone, which I hadn’t made a huge deal of but he knew I didn’t like it. And like I said, he does have a problem with alcohol, so it’s hard for me to encourage him going out to the bars any kind of regular with or without me. I don’t know, I’m just having a really hard time trusting him now and I don’t know what to think, or if I’m being too jealous like he says? Should I end things with him? Am I overreacting? 

TLDR; My boyfriend went out drinking against my wishes with a female coworker, and lied to me about it telling me he with male friends. He also discussed intimate details of our relationship problems with her. I need someone else’s perspective on this. I can’t tell if I’m overreacting, or being too jealous and I really am curious how others would react to this.",14Dec2020,1

I guess having classes with him has just made me appreciate him even more than ever. It’s still odd though because it’s hard for me to imagine kissing him and stuff like that. I think it’s because I’m not letting myself because I refuse to believe that he likes me.

832,"So the way my school handles a lot of the online tests are through a questionnaire like system with a set amount of questions and a set amount of time let's say like 50 minutes, my problem is that since we are never told the amount of multiple choice questions and the amount of problems that will show up at the test and since you're not allowed to go back on questions just forward I handle my time terribly bad no matter what I do, today I finished my test of 50 minutes over 10 minutes early, I got the calculus done fine but I didn't revise my multiple choice since I didn't have time and didn't do too well, how can I solve this issue I have about myself",14Dec2020,1
834,"I've always wanted to join the military, but for the longest time I thought that it would be too difficult, too intense, and, just in general, too much. I put that dream aside, as I decided to go to college for civil engineering, and I am currently a freshman majoring in civil engineering.

Just a week ago, however, a member of the National Guard emailed me and asked if I'm interested in serving in the National Guard. To be perfectly honest, that was the first time I had even thought about it again in such a long time, but I really do feel like I should do it, maybe not with the National Guard but perhaps in the army or even another branch of the military.

When I was in elementary school, I wanted to be a Navy Seal. When I was in middle school and high school, I wanted to be in the Coast Guard. My grandfather, who served with civil engineers in the US Army Corps of Engineers, in Vietnam. He always told me stories about how they would build bridges and he worked with some other guys to blow up the bridges so the enemy couldn't use it. I always found it fascinating, although I don't know if I necessarily want to do that. Regardless, I've pretty much always wanted to serve in the military.

However, I've always been a bit worried about the physical requirements and the intensity. Recently, though, my buddy who's soon going to basic training for the army told me that he was, too, and still is, but that he decided that the worst that can happen is that they let you fail. And if you fail, you're in the same place you were before, not a part of the military, so as long as you don't take it personally, then there's no point in not giving it a shot, so long as you give it your all and give it your best. I realized that he was right. Without a doubt, it won't be easy, but what's the point of not giving it a shot. I'll either be upset about not making it or I'll be upset about not even giving it a shot, and I'd much rather not make it but at least try than not even try.

There is another aspect, though, that is relevant to me and not to my friend, which makes my situation a little bit different. I am currently on medication for anxiety, because when I was in high school I had pretty bad anxiety, as well as OCD. In the past few months, though, I've gotten much better with it, and even when I forgot my medicine for a week, when I went on a road trip, I was still much better than I had ever been. I used to be absolutely terrible with anxiety but now I'm far better off. I know that taking medication would prevent me from being eligible for the military, but given how I am currently doing and how I've been doing these past few months, I feel like I could possibly get off of my medicine by the end of college, if things go as well as they've been going recently. That would also give me time to graduate from college with a degree in civil engineering, which I feel like would be helpful whether I choose to pursue civil engineering-related work in the military or not.

I'm looking for any and all advice you could provide me on my situation, especially how to not get discouraged again from pursuing this dream of mine. Thank you!

tl;dr: I (18M) am currently going to school for civil engineering but at the same time I want to serve in the military. What should I do?",14Dec2020,1

836,"My younger brother (15) told me that he is almost certain he is gay. In theory I have no issue with that. However I am afraid of these two things.

The first reason is how hard things are going to be for him. He is a very shy and non-social kid and we live in a very homophobic country. Chances are that no one will beat him up or physically hurt him if he comes out (thankfully). However he will be shunned. Also the chances of dating or finding love here are very slim for gay people. I don't see the situation changing anytime soon, and I don't think my brother will be able to leave for another country in the next 3-6 years. So that leaves him with an romantic-less adolescence, and his best option is to leave his family behind so that he can be himself somewhere else. He is an emotional and fragile person and I am afraid of how that will affect him. Honestly I wished he liked girls at least a little so that he had the opportunity to openly feel and express romantic interest at this age. It doesn't really matter if later on he would realize he was only into boys.

The second reason is honestly quite selfish. Out of four of my siblings, two of them already have made a life for themselves in countries very far from here (and each other). They are not coming back, and visiting very rarely. If my younger brother leaves too, I am going to miss him so so much. I know he should go and do what's best for him, and I do want him to be happy. I just don't know how to bear the fact that three of the people I love the most will be so far away. This brother is 15 years younger and I've been more like mother than a sister to him ever since he started saying mama and dada.

I know if it comes to it I have to make peace with it and I am aware how this is not my life and I should be happy if he is happy. I just don't know how to, because I don't want to miss him too as much as I miss my two other siblings.",14Dec2020,1

Is this normal? How is it not possible to just accept some things and move on instead of making everyone frustrated by asking 'why?' all the time, and having a breakdown. 

I'm really annoyed and frustrated by this behavior from a 13 year old boy, this is maybe acceptable from 3 year old but having breakdowns when you don't get a logical explanation is just over the top. 

How can I prevent the breakdowns when I don't have an answer satisfying to him?  This cant be normal, can it?

838,"I'm going to try to include as much detail as possible so people can understand where im coming from with this question,

I am happily married to my husband of 9 years. When i met him he was 18 years old and he was in an unusual situation. He had an ex girlfriend who claimed she was on birth control and wound up pregnant from him. She KNEW he was heading to college and was going to break up with her and stopped taking birth control because she wanted him to stay. She confessed this to other people who then told him. Afterwards he broke up with her anyway but continued seeing his daughter who was then a baby. This is roughly around the time i met him. He was going through depression because cancelled all his plans to stay nearby, was working a dead end retail job with his unsupportive mom (who was calling him a deadbeat for not marrying this woman and was becoming buddy buddy with her) and on top of it all this girl was seeing other men. She began telling the baby girl that one man in particular was ""her daddy"" even though he wasn't.  He was a family friend and the family liked him better.  This woman's cousins began messaging my husband via facebook letting him know that they wanted the other man to be the father and if he didn't leave they were going to accuse him of being a child molestor and make his life hell.  My husband was on the verge of killing himself. He got into an argument with his mom who didn't believe him and thought he was just trying to dodge his responsibility and she kicked him out leaving him homeless.

 He knew i lived far and was only there for the summer. He asked me if he could move in with me since he was homeless. I said of course and we got ready and left.  This woman who didn't know about me until then went livid because she honestly thought he was going to stay in town and deal with her bs for the rest of his life. Would bad mouth me to whoever would listen saying that my husband left and abandoned his child for another woman. He would send money for the kid, there was never anything legally set in place for him to do so. But after about a year this ex calls him and tells him not to send money and sends him termination of rights papers instead. She apparently wanted to marry the man she was seeing and having the baby refer to as daddy. My husband signed his rights away because he felt done with it all and that was that. We went from good friends to slowly falling in love, got married. He did get to go to college and we have 3 kids

Now it's been 12 years since then and this woman is coming out of the woodworks and messaged him through facebook saying that the daughter found out the truth by rummaging through documents?? I dont know...Anywho long story short she says she wants my husband and the daughter to get to know each other via emails and texts etc. Then sends us an address to a trailer park where shes at. My husband is understandably feeling extremely uncomfortable with this as it feels like his past is coming to haunt him. But he also wants to make right by this little girl and give her whatever it is she needs from him, even if just closure. A lot of the emails the girl is sending sound off to us too. Almost as if its the mom writing them. And now the girl is asking for exchange of addresses to send cards and my husband thinks its a ploy by the mom to find out where we live. The ex then sent him a message which quite frankly is bothering both myself and my husband. She is asking for my husband to give her his moms (my mother in laws) address and phone number. This is because back in the day her and that woman were close and used to gang up on my husband and bad mouth him for not ""stepping up and being a man"" She misses the ""good times"" and wants to catch up. He hates that he hasn't even seen his daughter face to face, doesnt even think half of who he is talking to is really his daughter. And now this woman wants to get together with his mother? And so far in the exchanges, she has brought up how cute our children are, our pets etc but is purposely is dodging my existence. She is clearly angry with me still. And im not even going to mince words here. I dont like her. I dont trust her. What is the best way to handle this entire clusterfuck of a situation? Should my husband have answered this womans messages? And now that he did, how do we move forward?",14Dec2020,1

during my first two years I was sexually assaulted and i did poorly for those years. I had a 2.1 ugpa for the first two years.

then i transferred to another school and made straight A's for four years straight as a biology major. If I subtract my first two years from my gpa, I have a ugpa of 3.8 and a sgpa of 3.9 for the last four years. (I essentially started all over.)

I have done biology research and I have two papers in the works of being published. I also have a lot of volunteer work, and years of shadowing doctors. And I worked throughout college.

I also went to therapy, and healed the wound that some with sexual assault.

843,"Basically I was talking very seriously with a girl for like 2 months. 

We talked 24/7 and hung out a few times 

She seemed EXTREMELY interested 

I was sure we were headed towards a relationship 

But suddenly she got super distant after visiting home one weekend. 

It was weird because two days earlier she was blowing my phone up after our last date. 

And now she was being dry and distant. 

Long story short another guy had entered the picture. She later explained that she “had more of a background” with the other guy and said “it had literally nothing to do with me” 

I don’t really buy that but whatever 

Basically I find it odd how her interest went from  10/10 to 2/10 practically overnight. Especially after she wouldn’t shut up about how much fun she had in our last date and how she “saw this going somewhere”. 

Now I text her and it’s “haha yeah” and “lol”

But apparently this new guy and her are serious now so I’ve went no contact and I am in the gym and working on my passions and hobbies and trying to meet other girls and stuff. Life has actually gotten better. And I’m really becoming a better version of myself. 

But god damn I miss her. And I really wanted to be with her. We barely even got to know each other. I really regret that we didn’t sleep together at least once. 

In the back of my mind, I’m wondering if she will come back around to give things another shot when this dude fumbles. I’m not counting on it but I need to get this thought out of my mind.

845,"In first instance I want to apologize if my english is not the best, I'm not a native english speaker so I'll try my best to explain myself. (btw, this is my first post in this subreddit so don't be too hard on me please)

before you read: I'm 22 years old and I just finished all of my assignments on the college so I'm waiting to the graduation day, I studied an engineering major.

So I'm that kind of guys who is not afraid of trying new things, I've approached girls by talking to them and now that we are locked up in our houses there's no way I can do that (even if I wanted or not, safety first) so to the point, I saw this girl on instagram, she's studying in the same college than I do and I saw her profile, she's pretty beautiful and talented, I saw some of her work and I wanted to send her a message supporting her talent and I told her to keep doing her best, that she had a bright future. Since then, we have been chatting all day long, every single day of the past 2 months and I was so happy I found a girl like her, she has 3 jobs, 2 as freelancer and 1 as intern on the college we study and she's pretty organized and that's some of the things I'm most interested right now since I finished my major and I wanted to meet someone as her, a serious, hardworker, funny girl. So days passed by and we chatted a lot as i said before, I'm the kind of person who wants everybody to smile, even if days are grey and you feel like giving up, I'm there to help you out and make you feel you have someone you can rely on. That's what I did, she felt like days were boring since they were all rutinary and I was there to joke around and make her laugh a little bit. So on december 1th she just dissapeared, stopped readding my messages, ignores me everywhere and now I feel like I never existed for her. A friend of mine messaged me on discord and sent me a screenshot of her on Tinder and I was so heartbroken because I feel she just lost interest from one day to other (this were going great until december 1th, this happened suddenly) and now I don't feel rejected, I feel despised as I think I wasn't worth the reject... She maybe just found another guy she was more interested in but damn, I just wanted the best for her, the good morning messages she sent to me every day were like a treassure, the conversations and everything I did to make her feel the days were the best joy we had are now gone, I don't know what to feel and what to think... I feel really bad and despite I met her online (which I know might sound stupid and for some I shouldn't feel bad for someone I met online and for some months) I thought we could have something serious in the future.

Sorry for this ammount of text, It's what I feel and I didn't know who to talk with (Therapy is not a thing in my country and I can't afford it so please skip that part hahaha)

We ended up just hooking up with each other every time he came home, and while I wanted it to be more, I was just happy to be seeing him. Then he decided to study abroad, and I thought he would just stop talking to me. Instead, he would talk to me every day while he was there, and I thought maybe this would lead to me and him dating when he got back home. I ended up going to the same college as him (not because of him, it just kind of worked out that way). When I got there, I thought maybe then he would have time for me, but he always would tell me he’s super busy with school work and that we had to continue with a casual relationship. I continued doing this with him, thinking maybe, just maybe, he was just too busy for a relationship right now and someday he would be ready. After my first year of college, he got a girlfriend who wasn’t me. It was then that I realized it wasn’t because he didn’t want a relationship in general, it was that he didn’t want one with me. I was so heart broken.

He recently broke up with that girlfriend about 2-3 months ago, and now him and I have been talking again. Now he’s telling me he’s too busy with work and he’s not ready for a relationship because he just got out of one. He’s someone who I care about a lot, but I know he’s going to do the same thing to me again. I don’t understand why he has to keep coming back into my life after 3 years.

851,"As the title says, I’m a 23 year old woman who is infertile due to my ovaries shutting down very, very early. Some people have little bumps of hormonal releases that make pregnancy possible, but I haven’t had a period since the age of 17 or a documented hormone spike since the age of 21. I used to be absolutely thrilled with this since I wouldn’t need to get my tubes tied, but now I’m feeling very differently. 

My boyfriend (slightly older than myself) is absolutely incredible and has never even brought up the idea of having children. I brought it up a while back and we both agreed that adopting a pre-teen/teen when we’re in our 30s or 40s sounded batter than a baby. Neither of us are exactly “baby people,” so we were both very happy to be on the same page with that. I still want to adopt in the semi-distant future like he and I discussed, but I also want a child that came from the two of us. Before anyone asks, I would absolutely love both children equally. I’m not related in any manner to the man I call my father, and I’ve always preached that family consists of the people you choose rather than the people you’re biologically related to. It’s not the blood relation I’m craving, but for some unknown reason I really, really want to have my boyfriend’s child. 

Getting back on track, my “baby fever” has been getting out of control. I started feeling moody and was bloated recently, so I took a pregnancy test... I’m sure you can guess the results of that. I was both relieved and incredibly sad that day. The sadness didn’t go away, and I started judging myself in a way that I would NEVER judge anyone else. I’ve already gone through cancer, surgeries for implants, ridiculous amounts of imaging... It feels like my body keeps failing me over and over. 

I live in a very rural and conservative area where the average age of marriage is 21/22, so the fact that I’m not married and actively talking about my plans for children is extremely unusual already. I know that people mean well when they ask, but the regular reminders that I’m expected to have a child soon but I don’t even have a choice in the matter is absolutely killing me inside. This lack of choice is hitting me so hard... how can I stop hating myself for something completely out of my control?",14Dec2020,1

My family makes me see a counselor but I can’t talk to them because they don’t get it and they’re more concerned that I don’t hurt myself. It feels like the counselor and my parents advice really boils down to: “just don’t feel bad”. I feel so horrible.

My therapist brought up the idea that I may have ADHD/ADD, which I realized wasn't unlikely. My brother and cousin both have ADHD, but I never considered the idea that I myself might have it. I researched and read about the symptoms, and I realized I fit almost every symptom of the predominantly inattentive type. I do believe I have it, and since school started, I've been trying to get evaluated, diagnosed, and treated somewhere.

Recently, I've been unable to focus or turn in my work on time. One of my projects has been overdue for over a month. Now that my average is suffering, I've been getting more desperate for a solution. My parents talked to my guidance counselor, who told us she would contact the school psychologist to try and get me evaluated. After that, they said, I would be able to receive special help from my teachers so I could focus easier. (This would include giving me a second sheet of notes, repeating instructions, being more patient, etc. Nothing too big, but something that would probably help me a lot.)

It's been 2-3 weeks since. We got a response today from the psychologist. She informed us that I'm not qualified to get evaluated... only because I'm doing well academically.

It's only a matter of time before my averages in two core subjects will get even worse, so I'm really worried. Is the psychologist allowed to deny me an evaluation like that? What should I do?",14Dec2020,1

864,"What would you do if you had a 10-year acquaintance/friendship with someone of the opposite sex, (ex-coworker) - we're both single. You're both attracted to each other (a little bit of chemistry going on.). Each time we see each other, we both feel a slight attraction for each other but have never acted on it. She keeps suggesting plans for us to go out to a theme park, or just hang out at the beach. She acts like she wants to spend time with me, and then nothing ever happens. After discussing future plans, it gets completely dropped, nothing becomes of it, it's just dropped and not discussed ever again. Instead, new plans begin. Basically, It's just one disappointment after the next. I feel like I'm being strung along like a pull toy. Then, out of the blue,  I get a text message ""Happy Holidays"" from her. I feel that if I reply it'll be the same old routine... It's been 3 days now and I still have not replied. How do I respond tactfully to end the cycle of broken promises?  I'm trying in vain to find the right balance of words to express my feelings of disappointment and frustration, but with some sarcastic humor tossed in. Any suggestions?

867,"So I’m 22. I’ve been dealing with untreated ADHD and OCD my entire life — along with anxiety, depression, and all the related issues that comes with those two conditions. I’ve always been a hard working person. Granted, it seems no matter how hard I worked that I didn’t get anywhere I wanted to go but I worked hard regardless. I’ve spent my life treading water and doing my best to be productive even if focus is near impossible. In 2019, I stopped taking my antidepressants and got blindsided by OCD. I didn’t even know I had it until this year but looking back, that’s what it was. That year I started taking ADHD medication and it helped me. 2019 went somewhat smoothly. I saw that I had some smaller issues that could grow bigger but life goes on and I didn’t think it’d be a problem. Life’s momentum was keeping me going—as I assume it does many people. The first few months of 2020 were fine then lockdown happened. Since lockdown, I’ve basically spent this entire year in solitary and that has made my ocd uncontrollable. I’ve lost all my friends, my social abilities, my fragile mental state, and my motivation. Its like I’m dead. I want to move and do things but there’s nothing to do. I’ve spent this year in-and-out of a depressive slump. I haven’t been bedridden by depression since 15 and it’s back. There were times in the beginning where I would just lie in bed all day because my brain couldn’t will itself to move. I’ve always been strong willed—it’s the only thing that’s kept me going for 22 years— but it’s almost 2021 and my will is gone. I’m in a slump. I couldn’t handle college so I had to drop out. I can’t compose myself enough to find a job. I feel like a failure. I know my family thinks I’m a failure but this year has absolutely destroyed my will to keep moving. I’m seeing both a psychiatrist and a therapist but I don’t know what else to do. My family is seemingly unaffected by these shut downs (they’re pretty neurotypical and don’t have the already pre-existing mental illnesses I have) but it’s just zapped me of everything. I was barely functioning before but now it’s terrible. What can I do? I know the vaccine is almost here so things will return back.

I do not want this to end, but as of the last 3/4 months I've had a feeling we will break up someday and I've started wondering if I'm forcing it.  He has a recurring mental illness that he said would be gone 1.5 yrs ago when it first got bad, but guess what, it's still here 1.5yrs later and he can't/won't get help. It makes him a bad partner and I played therapist on and off for over year until I put my foot down. I know he's still struggling, he admits he is. I'm kinda waiting for it to get so bad again that he can't help but burden me daily for weeks, again. I'm not patient enough. I feel resentment, especially as he excused his bad behaviour on it a lot. 
 
To an extent, I almost feel like he's my best friend who I don't get along with a third of the time, yet was wildly attracted to for nearly 2 years? And thought for sure was gonna be the father of my kids?  I got a recurring female infection around June/July that I didn't see a doctor for until September. Sex can randomly get quite sore thanks to it. Out of guilt, I hid my discomfort at times and let him have sex with me as I felt too bad. We didn't at all from late September until this weekend, as I could only meet him for walks thanks to lockdown/restrictions. We tried for his birthday yesterday *twice* and I just couldn't do it? I was ""wet"" but it just hurt, I wasn't aroused enough? After 3 months of no sex? I didn't even really want to. I was happy to cuddle and hang out but sex has kinda felt like an obligation.  He feels like it's his fault cos he has gained like 40lbs in the last year but I still find him cute so that can't be it and also cos I've never orgasmed with him? I don't want him to feel insecure.

874,"So, when I was younger (18, 19ish) I was in this group chat with a bunch of other high schoolers (The youngest was like 15). I used to make a lot of very crass jokes (sending links to badly written or drawn porn or ""geeky sex toys. com"" because I though it was funny) and would brag about sex/masturbation/etc. After I got to college and my mother passed away I grew up and didn't speak to any of those people again apart from a few who contacted me. I apologized for my behavior when people reached out, but I generally just thought of it as one of those horribly embarrassing things that happened when I was a kid rather than something actively hurtful.  


Years later, I am a fairly private and quiet person with a career in concept art. I do have social media for art but don't talk much besides that. I rely on that social media as it's how people generally find and reach out to me for freelance work.   


The high school stuff was at the back of my mind until a few days ago, when someone from the group chat reached out anonymously, saying that I'm a sexual predator/pedophile who preyed on minors as an adult and that they would expose me. I don't actually know what they're going to say (if anything), but I know that the art community in places like twitter can be very volatile and if the callout is phrased harshly enough (evidence or no) they could get people to label me as a pedophile.   


What should I do here? Should I address it before they do (I'm struggling with this as it feels weird and inappropriate to bring it up out of nowhere on a professional profile)? I did reach out to a lot of people I knew in high school and extended an apology because I genuinely feel really awful that someone feels taken advantage of, but now I worry that might not have been the right thing to do (what if I contacted the person who sent the message and they felt stalked or threatened by me using an old contact?)",14Dec2020,1
875,"I’ll start by saying we’ve lived in this house for 3 years. Our neighbours aren’t great but we’ve never come to blows over anything... Yet.

Our neighbours daughter (late 30s) moved back in to her parents house a few months ago, along with her young son and dog after her partner died. The daughter used to rent our house before she got kicked out (it turned nasty) and we came in and bought it from the landlord.

There have been a few occasions where I’ve had to have a word with them about their behaviour towards our property. One time when I came home from work and they were parked on our drive, right outside the house. Another when the kids were kicking a ball around on the drive and hitting the cars. When they were allowing the dog to dig up our flowers we had planted the week prior... they generally just use our drive/garden as an extension of their front garden.

Since the daughter has moved in everything has gotten worse. She has a dog that she allows to run around in the street and roam our front garden and drive area. The problem is whenever I came home the dog would run at me barking like a lunatic and (while not biting) it would be smashing itself in to my legs. It would also do this to our visitors and workmen. 

I had a word with the daughter and asked if she could keep the dog inside because we’ve had complaints from workmen and have people in the family who do not like dogs (I love dogs, just not this one). I also do not like coming home and getting chased down my drive while getting barked at. 

Tonight I heard her talking to a friend, her voice filling the street telling her friend that “it’s my dog, I’ve lived here 18 years, now they’ve moved in and it’s all change” she said “if it was a nasty dog it would be different, but it’s not nasty”.

Am I being unreasonable here? I am so pissed off, it has been eating me up all night and I really feel like I need to say something, but I don’t know what? I didn’t want to take it any further as I thought asking nicely would help but obviously not?",14Dec2020,1

878,"I'm a trans guy and using testosterone replacement therapy to grow facial hair et al. My parents do not accept my identity and definitely do not support me. I'm very grateful that the Internet can provide so much information on how to shave correctly because I am embarrassed to go to my dad about it. He still sees me as his little girl and he's told me he ""just thinks it's gross"" so it's the best decision to not talk about it at all.

A couple days ago my parents wanted me to come over for some Sabbath prayer thing. While getting ready, I cut my lip on a new razor--normal thing that happens to everyone who shaves. I decided to wear a mask to hide it but my mom insisted I took it off and my parents saw and asked what happened. When I told them the truth (I cut myself while shaving) they ignored me the rest of the night and I haven't gotten any text or calls since then either.

I know for sure I didn't do anything wrong but I also know it's my responsibility to fix this and I don't know how. I've been trying to cut my parents out of my life since I moved out but my brothers still live there and I like having homemade food and doing my laundry for free.",14Dec2020,1
879,"For some background, I'm 30F, only child. In my early 20s (and with the blessing/urging of my therapists) I cut my parents out of my life - they were abusive and have addiction problems; they are in and out of jail. Because of my parents' unstable lifestyles we were never close to their families - it was a ""saw them a couple times a year"" type deal for the most part, so while cutting off my parents also meant cutting off the various extended relatives, it wasn't a huge loss. I know this all sounds sad, but it has a happy ending - I moved to a new state, forged a stable life for myself, developed good relationships with friends who are now like family, etc.

However, over the past year or so my dad's sister has taken a sudden interest in being close to me. She calls/texts, wants to video chat, keeps me deeply updated on the day to day lives of her kids (who I've never met), wants to travel to visit me, etc. Back close to a year ago when she first reached out I thought ""why not"" and chatted on the phone with her a couple times, but it was a very one-sided conversation - she ranted about how terrible of an older brother my dad was, she told me all about her twin babies, ranted about her job at the daycare she works for, etc. But it was always her talking at me - I didn't get to say much, and if I tried to talk she'd catch her breath for a second and then interrupt with ""and another thing!"" and start ranting again.

This started around the time that she had twin babies, so if I had to guess, maybe this is her trying to forge good family ties for her own kids. I can appreciate that - but at the same time, I haven't seen her in nearly a decade, I've never met her kids... I know I sound like a jerk, but I'm just not that interested. The only thing we seem to have in common is that my dad is a sucky person, but you can't build much of a relationship off that alone (and her constant talk about him just dredges up old memories for me).

I stopped talking to her on the phone - just told her I was busy and didn't have time to talk. Eventually she switched to Facebook and she sends me messages at least once a week - videos of her kids, anecodotes about her life, etc. I respond to be polite (""how cute!"", ""that's funny!"") but (I know I sound like a jerk) I'm just not that interested. 

She also regularly says she wants to come visit me at my home (bear in mind I am 3 hours away in another state). She'll say ""I want to see your new apartment! How about the weekend of October 16th?"" I know I'll again sound like a jerk, but I never invited her and am not that interested in having this happen. ""No"" sure doesn't sound very kind so I've said ""Sorry, things are really busy for me right now"" but obviously that is not a permanent solution.

I've found myself ghosting her without thinking about it - she'll send me a video call, and then 5 pictures of her kids, and then ask how I am, and then more pictures, etc., and eventually I feel terrible because she's reached out 5 times, so I say something nice so I don't look like a jerk... but that's not a genuine relationship/friendship obviously.

I don't want to hurt her feelings. She is a nice person with good intentions, and I suspect she is lonely and looking for some human contact - but I am not up for the type of long-phone-calls, weekly-video-chats, send-me-every-picture-you-take-of-your-kids type of relationship she wants to have.

I payed 2,2k for that car half a year ago and might be able to get 1,8k out of it if I'd sell it right now. I got a fairly good offer on a Audi A3 1.8 turbo 2004 which is respectibly more expensive than my current one to maintain. For the car itself I will have to pay 1k because the offer is coming from a close friend.

Now my father is trying to convince me that my car will not break down and I should keep it and he thinks I only want another car because it's slow and so on.   
Now sure it's quite slow and I'd like more power but I really don't want to pay about 4k in repairs and more for a car worth about half of that.   


I was thinking of doing an ultimatum to my dad that I either buy that Audi and sell my current car and pay my bills like described or I'll drive my current one until it dies and then he will either pay for the repairs or buy me a ""new"" car which probably will cost more than the Audi.

899,"I'm 14f and I've had problems with food since year 6, ive never been a fat kid but I've still struggled with food. From 10/12  I started to skip breakfast, lunch and although I couldn't skip dinner I tried to throw it up. This stemmed because of an abusive stepdad and bullying. Now skipping meals sounds unhealthy and I know it us but I also used to emotionally eat which was also but of an abusive stepdad and bullying. So from the ages of about 10 to 12 I would skip meals, eat emotionally in secret then try to burn off all the weight I had. 

Nowadays, I've gotten better. I've skipped breakfast on most days but I'm eating lunch much more often than I used to. I sometimes eat emotionally but only when I physically cant cope. Luckily the stepdad and bullying are out of my life so there isnt so much of a need to. My diet is pretty good and I eat pretty healthy,and  Im just starting feel good about myself now when before I'd starve, cut and harm myself because I felt I wasn't good enough. I'm still depressed and suffering with anxiety but I'm not suicidal. I've been clean from self harm for 2 years and I'm proud of that.

Now that it's much colder out the temp inside our townhouse is ridiculous. It's freezing cold downstairs even with the heat on. We are wasting a lot of money heating this place.

Ever since that moment whenever he is in his room he is terrified that the light will go red, to the point that he hid in the corner at bed time screaming and crying.

905,"okay so back in February i made a mistake by having sex with a guy that was just using me, and it ruined everything for me, and i told my parents and they wasnt mad or anything. and i've got a boyfriend now, and he gave me a hickey which my parents ended up finding and they called a slag and called me a disappointment etc. i didn't tell them that i had a boyfriend then, so they dont believe me now when i say the boy that did it was my boyfriend. but they never let me leave the house and even if i do end up leaving they would call me a disappointment , bastard and slag etc behind my back to my sisters and sometimes to my face. they think everyone in school sees me as easy and a slag, and it hurts so much especially when i've been treated bad in the past for things that aren't my fault and i'm being stigmatized for it. 
and last saturday i went to town with my friend (well bf but i told them it was a friend) and i left the house at 1pm and they told me i had to be home for 3.30, and even my boyfriends dad said that is ridiculous. i'm 18 and do you think i should be allowed to stay out later ??? i ended up coming home at 5.30 ish, i texted them after 3.30 to let them know i'll be later but my whole family was spamming me with calls telling me to come home right away, and when i got home my mum scolded me and ignored me for the rest of the night. and it's just so hard being called a failure and a disappointment all the time , for something that isn't much of a deal. i'm quite depressed lol and if i'm in my room my parents say go out for once! but when i actually leave the house they do everything they can to make sure i don't go , they just think i'm fucking people all the time and i hate having that image to them, when i'm literally in the library revising. 
like today i went shopping, to buy some Christmas presents, and my mother kept on giving me excuses why i couldn't leave. and she said even though you're 18 now you can't do what you want if you're living under my roof. she lets people not from our household come into our house when i wanna go to a shop she says we're in a lockdown and i'm not allowed to go anywhere. do you think i'm being reasonable how i'm 18 and should he allowed to go to a shop ???
i don't know if what i'm writing makes any sense but i'm just so tired and sick of living here. they're just so toxic in tiny ways but in the end it has a huge toll on me, they just pick little parts of my life to control but i wanna grow up and leave but my parents are the people that make me feel the worse about myself

906,"I wanna start with just saying, yea, my main goal is to get back with my ex, if that doesn't happen, oh well, i'll deal with that another time.

we broke up about a month ago, and during the first few weeks of the breakup, because i was already super super stressed because of stuff with my family i really don't want to get into, i panicked, spam texted her and called her, and ruined her will to even want to be my friend, lately things have stabilized a little bit, for about a week after that i decided to completely cut her off, i took a week away from her to not smother her and let it be to where she would WANT to talk to me, i texted her two days ago  because i thought that would be enough and we've been kind of talking, things went.. moderately ok, better then how they were and we talked about a few subjects for a while but after the first initial few hours, it went back to her not being too interested in talking to me, so i know now that that wasn't enough time.

so how much more time should i give her space for? another week? because we're supposed to see eachother and exchange christmas gifts on the 23rd (which i think could be a good thing in showing her how much i've changed since the relationship and restore some of the attraction) so im thinking not to text her until the day before then.

Another thing is she has this new online ""boyfriend"" thing she met on discord, sounds kinda stupid ik, im not tooo worried about that because i've asked a lot of people for advice about this situation and they all say online things like that never ever last and she'll move on from that after a while, it'll just be nice to get some people who agree,

anyways, my goal is to get her to know how much i've changed and to let her know how much i care and want to work for a better relationship, it was my first serious, long term thing and i made plenty of mistakes, but i've fixed most of them and i want her to realize.

923,"**Warning**: VERY long-post, will post a (somewhat) short tl;dr at the bottom.

To give some context about myself, I characterize myself to be a relatively talkative person but also do my best to be a good listener so my friends don't feel like I'm dominating any conversation.  But, I also find myself getting tired when conversations go on too long.

I have a friend I've known for a couple years and we've gotten close during this time.  We are also in the same program, so we usually have a lot to talk about - personal life and school-related matters.  However, during this past-year, my friend experienced something traumatic (something that I won't get into the details about other than it being a traumatic experience) and has been going through a lot both mentally and physically because of it.

She disclosed her situation to me during the spring of this year and I've done my best to be there for her and listen to her when she needs it.  She told me that she hasn't told anyone else about it, other than her therapist.  At first I felt kind of touched and thought that this was a great way for me to show my care and friendship to her by being there for her whenever she needed, because that's what I thought friends do.

However, recently, whenever she calls me to just ""have a chat""/""catch up"", she ends up dominating the conversation talking about her traumatic experiences and feelings about it for most of the conversation.  Even when she says ""oh I just want to talk real quick about what you're doing for the weekend"" or ""let's have a quick chat!"", the call ends up being 2+ hours because she is talking non-stop.  Like I said earlier, I personally don't like long conversations on the phone because they tire me out mentally after a point. 

I want to leave the call (usually around the 30-45 minutes mark) because I'm mentally exhausted from the long conversation - NOT because I don't care about her wellbeing.  I don't want to seem like I don't care about her and I don't want to make it seem like I don't care about her feelings, because I do and genuinely want her to feel better and be on the road to recovery.  But, I almost feel like she's using me as a 2nd therapist because she said she ""has only told me about \[the traumatic event\]"" and that she ""feels comfortable talking to me about her experiences and feelings outside of her therapist"".  But...I don't know what to say to her when I want to leave/stop the call.

Usually when I get tired, my responses become lackluster and I end up saying things like: ""Oh yeah"", ""Right, I totally get that"", ""Mhm"", ""Yeah..."", or other short responses and *every* single phone call we've had, I've made up a (lame) excuse like ""Oh, can I call you back? I have to help my family with something"" something along those lines.  They sound awkward and forced because there is never a ""right"" time to end the conversation, because she almost always never allows me to really talk.  There were many times when I've straight up ignored her calls because I knew the call would end up being hours on end, and I sometimes I don't want that.  It makes me feel bad, but I don't want to sit there for hours listening to her, because I don't want to put myself in a position where I give up doing the things I need to do so that I can listen to her, because I suck at multi-tasking (and I find it rude to do something else while someone is talking).

I haven't gotten to the point where I've told her I don't want to talk to her anymore or that she's tiring me out by having these really long, drawn out conversations because she's gone through a traumatic experience - and wouldn't that be an asshole thing to do???  Because it would seem like I don't care about her feelings/experiences and she's told me too that she's been feeling depressed about it because she can't/doesn't feel comfortable talking to anyone else (other than her therapist) about it because anyone else she's told she felt like they didn't care and/or dismissed her feelings.

But, how can I save/maintain my sanity and mental health without seeming like a sh\*t friend because I don't want to talk to her for hours about her traumatic experience?  I'm not a licensed therapist at all and when the call gets long and all she's talked about is her traumatic experience and how it's negatively affected her life, it kind of weighs down on me and makes my anxiety/stress/depression worse after the call.  I don't want to keep ignoring her calls or making up lame excuses because it makes me feel bad, but then I feel so bogged down and exhausted when I have to talk to her for so long.

***tl;dr*** My friend went through a very traumatic experience and I feel like she's using me as a 2nd therapist.  She sees a therapist and told me I'm the only person (outside of her therapist) she feels comfortable talking to about the traumatic experience.  Whenever she calls me to ""talk"" or ""catch up"", they end up being hours long.  I get mentally exhausted and have honestly other things I need to do, but don't want to seem like a sh\*tty friend if I told her I'm mentally exhausted or have other things I need to attend to - because isn't that a sh\*tty thing to say/do to someone who went through a very traumatic experience and is looking for someone to have their back?  So I end up ignoring half her calls and give a weak excuse as to why I missed them or give a weak excuse to leave the call if I do pick up, which makes me feel like a crappy friend.  What can I do to save my mentality/mental health but still be there and support her as a friend?",14Dec2020,1

930,"Believe me when I say, I really did mess up. I won't go into the details, but my friend was justified to be angry with me.

We have been friends for about 10 years. I am the type of person who is people-pleasing, peacekeeping, and avoids conflict at all costs. My friend is not afraid to be confrontational when she feels the need, and can be quite ruthless and mean when she is. 

During our friendship, we've fallen-out several times. Each time it went something like this, in her perspective I messed up, she confronts me, I apologize, she ignores me for hours up to days, then tells me my apology wasn't good enough, and expects me to fix it. If I recognize that I really messed up, I will fix it. But we will stop talking for a few months, then we will start hanging again, and then I am left wondering, when will I mess up again? I feel as though I am always waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

Most recently, I really did mess up. The time before not so much. Either way she acted in a way I can only construe as vindictive. And I'm tired of it. As of now, I've made all proper apologies and amends for what I've done. But now I am not so sure I want to go on this Merry-Go-Round with her again. I'm always left feeling horrible about myself, for days on end I feel like the worst scum of the Earth there is, to the point of utter depression. The worst part is, part of the expectation of my apologies for her is that it is not about me, and if I express my feelings I am a selfish person in her eyes. Which makes the self loathing all the worse. 

I feel bad because I've gone through all of this effort to repair the damage I caused, and she seems to feel it is all resolved. But to me, its not. I still feel awful. I feel angry and I don't want to talk to her anymore. I could simply fall off the map, but I feel she would deserve an explanation. Please help.",14Dec2020,1
931,"At the beginning of the year a long-time friend of mine cut ties after saying she wouldn’t talk to me until I get therapy for being raised in my family. We had a row over it, as it was quite random and offensive to me (we had almost never talked about my family and it came out of nowhere in an unrelated conversation). That same week, a book I’d preordered as a surprise gift arrived at her place and she took it as stalker behavior (her words) and blocked me on all platforms. 

I can accept her choice, but it’s difficult to lose such a close friend when she’s made that choice missing some critical information. I’ve decided to send one last email that I’ve pasted below. 

Is this a good idea? Is there anything I can add or change to make my intention clearer?

Hi. I don’t take sending this lightly. I’ve sought out a lot of perspectives on what I should do and all I can say is that if roles were reversed, there are few things I’d want to know:
1. I’m not angry and understand you did what you had to. I just want to know after some some distance if you might be open to keeping in some kind of contact. I’ve taken the year for self improvement, particularly where it comes to nutrition, exercise, and playing music, and it makes me sad we won’t have more depthful conversations on those subjects.
2. That book was pre-ordered many months earlier, as I thought we’d enjoy reading it together. I’d forgotten all about it and the timing of its arrival came as a shocking, nauseating coincidence. I’m sorry.
3. I understand it’s mostly moot now, but re: your original ultimatum at the beginning of the year I had discussed my family and upbringing with my therapist prior to our conversation and have continued those conversations since.
4. I’m generally very sorry for not being a better communicator and listener in the past.
I know there’s a good chance this message is unwelcome, and if that’s the case please disregard it. There won’t be any more following it. If that’s not the case, I welcome a reply of any sort. 
Either way, I hope you’re well.

934,"Hi all,

Thanks for taking the time to read this just after some advice on the following:

In March this year, we had our stag and hen do's in preparation for our Wedding in April.

We have now moved our Wedding around 4 or 5 times, obviously jumping around the COVID barrier is proving difficult.

We have a provisionary date for the wedding now of the end of March and a backup date of a Wednesday in June 2021, the venue just asked us if we want to take a Saturday towards the end of June instead, of course, we said yes definitely as lots of suppliers couldn't do the Wednesday anyway.

The problem is my brothers (my best man and vice versa) wedding at the start of July, my Mrs to be messaged his Mrs to be all excited saying that we have a weekend date in June now only for my brother to reply and say can we move our date as it is too close to theirs now and taking away from their day.

I totally understand where they are coming from and in normal circumstances would totally accept it but am I being unreasonable to expect a bit of leeway here it's not a situation anyone's ever been in before and we just want to get it done after waiting 3 years from planning to now.

Hopefully, we can get married in March but the state of the UK government and how they have handled this COVID 19 is not giving us any hope to be honest.

Thanks a lot in advance.",14Dec2020,1

936,"I sit near the back with a few people that cuss all the time and wayyyyy worse than I do. But my parents are super strict and if they found out, I’d be grounded forever. I’m almost 16. I’ve been pretty careful about not talking about bad topics or cussing but if they go back a few weeks I’ve dropped a few (maybe 12 or so in 3 weeks plus some bad topics) and they’ll hear it. They’re checking to see some kids in front of us do stuff. 
The other kids cuss and talk about pretty bad stuff every day. They’re not worried at all but their parents aren’t strict.

937,"So I started a new position just two weeks ago and today I’ve been talked to about my “productiveness” at work and the fact that they want me to do more. Now, I’m part time, I only work 21 hours a week and I don’t get any benefits or sick days. I was late one day and every other day I’m usually there before anyone else. 
I was taken aback because I’ve been doing a lot and they seemed to just tell me that they wanted more from me and I asked if I could stay longer and they said “no, we don’t have the hours.” They suggested that I work at home before work and after work. They also told me to answer the calls and texts on the days I’m off. They don’t want to pay me for this work, they just want me to do the work. In this meeting it was also suggested to me that I “creatively find a way” to figure it all out by the end of the day on Friday. 
Again, this is only a part time position and they tried to make it seem like this was a month in, it’s only been two weeks. Two weeks, and I work three days a week. So realistically I’ve only been there six days, and they’re saying I’m not working hard enough or fast enough. They also took issue with the fact that I took a 45 minute -an hour lunch break today despite that being union standard. 
I was also told that if I work in my days off, take calls, forward them and answer texts, maybe they’ll see that I’m taking it seriously and they’ll make me full-time in the future. Again I’m part-time and only get paid part time hours. 
I’m not necessarily angry but I’m very confused. This seems to be a pretty big red flag and I’m not sure what I should do next. I want to see where it goes and keep working but I’m under the impression that they want me to do things but they also don’t want me to do things. It’s a very weird space. Does anyone have any advice for this? 

Part of me wants to say that this is highly problematic and somewhat irrational expectations for someone in the beginning of the third week with no training so far, but I don’t want to seem like i’m complaining or making excuses. Please advise if you can. 
Should I just resign now and call it a day? This seems to be the beginning of a very unrealistic and warped relationship.",14Dec2020,1

939,"TW: Neglect, abuse, illegal age difference

Hey guys! This is my first post on reddit. I didn't really know where else to turn to so I'm here to ask for people's advice while remaining anonymous. Please be nice, I'm still a minor and need some legitimate help. Honestly this is kinda fucked up so idk if it'll even be allowed on here.

In 2019, when I was 15 years old, I was really depressed. I have two anxiety disorders and depression, and a history of being emotionally neglected and physically abused as a young child. I was taking a year off from school to get treatment and feel better. My self-esteem was at an all time low, and I felt really bad about myself. I was in this weird state of being super irritable and avoiding my family and irl friends.

Since I wasn't in school and had a lot of time to myself, I was super lonely, and I turned to online communities to find friends and form relationships with people. I turned to romantic and even sexual relationships with older men between the ages of 19 and 31 to get the attention and compliments that I needed at the time. I lied to them, telling them I was 18 or so in order to make them interested in me. I was often talking to multiple guys at the same time. The relationships were obviously super toxic and unhealthy, not only because of the very illegal age difference, but they were filled with gaslighting and guilt-tripping and other manipulative behavior. Eventually I decided to cut off the main guy I was talking to, deleted my account on the platform and blocked all of these people on every single social media platform.

Now, at the age of 17, I've made a lot of progress with my mental health and self-esteem. I feel a lot better about myself, but I keep coming back to this experience that I had. I feel super guilty about what I put myself through. It's a similar feeling to what I imagine being sexually assaulted feels like - I feel like I've had something very private and personal forcibly taken from me, but I also can't stop blaming myself because I feel like it's my fault, and I wanted the relationships at the time. Obviously now I recognize how fucked up that whole thing was and I hate that it ever happened, but I don't have any idea how to move on from it or feel better about it. Hopefully there's someone on here who has gone through something similar and can give me some sort of advice.",14Dec2020,1

941,"
some background/examples.

like a lot of people here, I take empathy. ""get well soon,"" or ""sorry to hear X died, let me know if I can help"" and I will help if asked, but resent it the entire way because I don't want to help them.

meanwhile, I take pleasure or at least happiness on seeing others fail, this I think as it makes me feel less insecure, that someone failed at something I didn't. so I'm there fore better than them. yet even though I know this, I can't work out how to overcome it. I love seeing them fail and suffer, feeling like shit.

is it possible to overcome my sociopath tendancies and stop pretending, or should I keep the facade up? I know if tell anyone how I really feel, I'd become an outcast. but constantly lying to them and pretending isn't working as I never feel like myself.

the few times I let it slip, I saw people's reaction and disgust and it made me hide away inside myself even more.

My name is Nick (17Y) living in Belgium (Flanders). Next week is winter break and I’ll be going on holiday to Malta. I will be gone for 10 days, not seeing my gf.

Asymptotic Corona tests cost around 50 euros in Belgium ( I also need my parents approval). But here’s the thing. Belgians are corona paranoid and she told that she will only see me if I test negative when I come back. But I will not be getting tested when I come back. 

My problem is how can I try and convince her to meet up with me without the test? Some helpful information is that Malta is safer, corona wise, than Belgium.

943,"So I have these two friends. Let's call them Bob and Susan. 

Susan is an alcoholic who used to be quite the town bicycle if you know what I mean. Fortunately for her she got a DUI and went through treatment and has been clean for some time now. 

Bob is a strange duck. He met Susan when she was still a drinker and low and behold... HE became an alcoholic. They banged a few times and then she got her DUI and got better... and then HE got better. Looking back I am fairly certain he was just following her lead and trying to do what she did to sympathize with her and impress her or something. 

He imagined that they were dating when in reality she was sleeping around as usual and not interested at all in a relationship with him. He became obsessed and jealous of her. It got to the point where she started to actively avoid him and he started leaving her notes in her jacket st work (they worked together). One night he came to her house and refused to leave. The police came and now he has a restraining order on him. A fucking restraining order.

That seemed to do Bob some good and he finally realized it was over (not that it was ever a thing, but you know what I mean) but alas. Things changed. 

I moved in with Susan as her roommate. Not in a sexual way at all. We've been friends since forever and get along. So Bob offered to help me move. I said no thanks due to Susan but she actually said ""what the hell, why not, I'm fine with it if he's calmed down"". 

Well everything seemed to go fine. He apologized to her for what happened and it seemed like things were gonna be fine. But that was all bullshit. He starts texting her these novel length texts ranting and raving about how he's obsessed with her and how he thinks she's leading him on blah blah blah. Meanwhile she's showing me them and asking what to do. I told her to please tell him that this reconnection of their was a mistake and that she's sorry for any confusion and then to just block him. Which she did. 

He spirals into a depression and I tell him that he needs to snap the fuck out of it. Which he seems to do. But then they both ran into eachother at the mall a few weeks ago and AGAIN think they can just be friends. So she unblocked him and starts talking again. 

And guess what? More insane messages about how beautiful she is and how he's there for her and blah blah blah. 

Keep in mind this restraining order is still in effect. They are both breaking the shit out of it. 

What the fuck is wrong with these two? 

1. I think he is literally insane. If some chick even thought of getting a restraining order on me I would be out of there in a flash and never think of her again. Period. This asshole just won't stop texting and messaging her super wierd shit.

2. She clearly enjoys fucking with his head. She knows he can't control himself and refuses to keep him blocked. She keeps giving him just enough rope to hang himself. 

I've spoke with them both and they both agree with me to my face that they need to separate. But then the very next moment he's back at it and there shebos giggling over the messages and occasionally responding as ifnjust to drive him insane. 

What the fuck do I say or do?

I got two friends that shouldn't be around eachother or communicating due to their emotional immaturity and legal reasons. Yet they both refuse to be the bigger person and just leave it alone.",14Dec2020,1

949,"I question the morality of this a lot because about five months ago I broke up with my boyfriend of three years. I changed my mind later and wanted him back but it was too late and he declined. I finally was able to move on, and in doing so I learned a lot about myself and also that there were a lot of things about my ex that I didn’t like but tolerated to avoid drama. I started talking to a couple guys but nothing ever got serious. I went on one date. Never could find anyone that sparked my interest. Until one person started staying on my mind constantly.
 
 My ex boyfriend’s friend, Wes, was texting me during these few months. At first I hit him up to warn him that I was about to breakup with my then-boyfriend, and to tell him I wanted him to make sure my ex would be okay after the breakup. Wes agreed to take care of my ex for me when I ended things, because my ex was already battling depression before that and I knew it would get worse. We ended up chit chatting about a few things, and about life in general, and I realized that Wes and I have a lot in common. So a couple months after the breakup I hit him up for some advice on a situation in my life. He was really wise and helpful. I appreciated it. We kept talking and I started to really enjoy hearing from him. We loved reading the same books and had long discussions about deep things. I’ve never connected with someone like that in my life. Another month goes by, and I started hoping to see him when he’d come back to our hometown (he works in another state), and it never worked cause I couldn’t flat out ask to see him. I rely on other people for rides while I save for a car and he comes home to *see his friends,* including my ex. It would be weird, I think, to specifically ask to see him. 

 He recently got out of a long relationship too. He broke up with his girlfriend at the begging of this year because she cheated on him while he was deployed. So he’s been dating around but hasn’t found anyone yet either. 
 
 I can’t tell if he likes me. A lot of people say it’s not wrong for me to date him because me and my ex are broken up, but Idk if Wes would consider that wrong or not. I don’t want to embarrass myself by being honest. I feel like it would hurt my ex too and their other friend would hate me for it. I can’t help how I feel though.
 
 Wes acts like he likes me, that or he’s just a weird amount of nice to everyone. He replies fast, and if he doesn’t, he apologizes and let’s me know why. I’ve never asked for this, he just values the time I bring to our text conversations. Our conversations are long. I’ll send a full paragraph, he’ll reply a full paragraph. I have never met a guy who will text paragraphs in conversation, or invest themselves into the topic instead of just being like “yea lol.” He is always 110% ready for talk and often tells me that I’m very interesting to converse with and that I’m a cool person. I compliment him too though so I’m not sure if he’s just being nice. The thing about him is that he is always 150% honest, even if it’s brutal. So I know he means the compliments, he has yet to ever say something he doesn’t mean. 
 I asked him straight out if he has conversations like this with everyone or just me and he says there are very, very few people that he can talk to like he does me and that he only devotes that amount of time to people that he feels deserve it. 
 I called him out one day for something small that had hurt my feelings that he said, and he validated me, clarified what he meant, and apologized. I’ve never had a man do that before.

 Over the last couple weeks I can’t stop thinking about him and it makes me happy. But last night he mentioned waiting for this girl to call him. I asked if he had a new gf and he said no, but that it was a complicated situation. I wanted to ask more but refrained. My plan was to give it a couple months and see if he had feelings for me. Maybe he’d make a move, and if not, I’d tell him how I felt. Now I feel like I’m running out of time, but I can’t handle scaring him away.
 
 I don’t want to lose the friendship we’ve built. But I don’t want to lose my window of opportunity either.

This stemmed from a discussion about the Gavin &amp; Stacy Christmas special last year (if you don’t know what I’m talking about one of the characters who isn’t gay says the f slur while singing fairytale of new York) &amp; I was saying that this character saying it was wrong, neither the character nor the actor are gay so it’s not ok. My mum &amp; sisters were saying that it is ok because it was for the benefit of a joke &amp; he was singing it in a song so the context is different (meanwhile when we play the song they skip over the word when they sing along) at one point in the argument my mum actually said the f slur, and it was basically just a really heated argument.

954,"(Tl;dr I have a couple of friends that always want to hang out but I dont have the energy. I want to stay friends and keep in touch but dont want to hang out regularly. They're good people I just dont have the energy)

I have two different friends that are unemployed and want to hang out way more often than I have the energy to hang out. 

They both are the type to want to hang out spir of the moment, they come over, take over the TV, want to talk about stuff, and stay for an undetermined amount of time. Almost always on week nights. (I work 9-630 M-F)

I've tried just being honest like ""hey, tonight isnt a good night because I'm really tired."" My one friend has accepted this answer but its pretty clear her feelings are hurt by it. The other, however, will literally try to bargain with me. She'll offer to help clean my place, cook dinner, do other chores, then lay the guilt trip of how lonely she is and how much she misses me on thick. 

So I've lied about what going on. I'll say I have a family emergency, I'm out of town, working late, whatever. Usually it has to be something that will indefinitely take up my entire night because if it's as simple as a store trip they'll want to meet up after. 

Now I'm to the point where I just ignore most of their messages. The one friend because she ONLY hits me up to hang out, never to just catch up and chat over messages, and it feels useless to just respond to be like ""yeah I cant hang out"" and have her be like ""oh ok"" and then stop talking to me. Me and the other one (who tries to bargain) will just chat to catch up but because shes so pushy I dont want to respond to her to end up having to argue about how I cant hang out. 

I don't want to lose either of these friends all together, I just dont care to see anyone (short of family and my partner) more than like once a month maybe. I want to be able to chat with them and stay in touch without having to see them all the time. I know ignoring them and making up excuses isn't great for a friendship, but clearly ""hey I just dont feel up to hanging out."" Isn't working either.",14Dec2020,1

My friend's car was stolen from a Dollar General (her baby puked all over the back seat, she parked it running to go inside and get wipes with her baby, was inside 7 minutes). Also this car is kind of rigged, she's a single mother and needs to buy a battery, sometimes it doesn't like to start back so she left it running until she got home. BUT ANYWAY someone texted her they saw the car sitting in an industrial park, she and a friend went, found he'd ripped the battery cables out of it, they went to get cables and came back to the car being gone a second time. The car was recovered after Methy McGee ran out of gas and was pushing it up the street, it got impounded because he's a felon and they found a weapon (gun) in the car and they needed to take things as evidence. After she paid the $75 to get it out of impound, the cop told her that there were some things in the car, go through them, they're probably stolen too, not much they can do with them. Dude had some tools, a car title, pay check, couple sets of keys, A FUCKIN METH PIPE AND SPOON IN A BAG (how they didn't find that I have no idea), an old busted laptop, old tablet, couple baby bottles (yeah his kid was in the car at some point), and basically just a bunch of junk. It goes to court, he's hired a damn shark lawyer that has basically turned it around on her, saying she ""abandoned"" the car at the store, then saying she ""abandoned"" it again when she found it broken down (with no keys), also trying to tell her she committed a federal offense throwing his mail (in the car) away. So now it's going to trial, he's bailed out and now he's messaging her on Facebook telling her that he wants his things from the car, she hasn't replied but he has messaged her all day long. Is she responsible for his things? Any advice on how to proceed?",14Dec2020,1

I (18) and my bf (20) are now together for more than a year, it‘s really going so great. We have the best time together &amp; are building up a life. We are dedicated to this relationship to make it work. 

So here‘s the situation. I finished my apprenticeship in summer &amp; it was always clear for me that I want to study. 
In order to do that, I need to go to school for another year to be able to get into college (in german: Hochschule) plus another (tough) year if I would want to get into all universities.

There is a study programm in reach that I could do with only a year of additional school. Then were would be the possibility of going to a relatively close &amp; good university if I did the two additional school years (if I make it, because the second one is kinda tough). 
I discovered, that there is also the possibility of going to another college that I would only need the one additional year of school &amp; where to programm is realy exciting. But its a 8 hour ride with the train away. (plus the train is rather expensive)

The programm is also possible in two variations: 
- a 4 year couse full attendence every week day
- a 3 year course with only 2 days of attendence per week &amp; the rest is online. (ofc content is also more limited)

Honestly, I‘d love to do the 4 years course, but on the other hand the 3 year course also does the job. Especially since I won‘t have significantly less chances &amp; I anyway want to do a master afterwards, I think I would anyway do the 3 year course.
&amp; then it would be possible to see him for some days every two weeks (now we see each other every second day)

The thing is, we are just a couple that needs to be together &amp; have quality time. I am scared that the distance will do no good to us. Ofc there are things like facetime &amp; text, but this is just not what works for us over a long period of time.
I am just scared that we will grow distant. 
And also, he realizes even before me when I start to spiral down &amp; helps me stop this before my mental health suffers majorly. Usually this happens when I am under a lot of pressure, which I would be when I am in a totally new place &amp; am so busy &amp; want to out do myself when it comes to grades.

He is totally supportive &amp; he said he‘d even be fine if I‘d want to do the four year course. 

I am just thinking wether it‘s worth it or nescessary that I leave?

Just trying to get some other view points of this situation &amp; maybe read some experiences of you guys.",14Dec2020,1
965,"I (f20) started dating my bf (m25) a little over a year ago. before that the only relationship i’ve had was a short lived relationship where i was cheated on. my bf was friends with his ex when we met and they broke up 5 years ago after dating for 4 years on and off. she broke up with him and jumped into a relationship the next day, and is still dating that guy.they didn’t talk for 6 months after they broke up then my bf reached out to be friends. my bf has had 1 gf in between us 

My trust issues started when i saw my bfs ex name pop up on his phone a couple times. i know he said they were friends but i thought more friend-ly, not close. then one day he said she started getting really mean, and calling him names and stuff. i found this weird and i ended up reading their messages (not proud but we’ve both done it, we forgive and move on). 

It was her reaching out much more, and he was kinda giving her one word responses. she was talking a lot about her mental health and things like that. she even demanded he call her at one point and got mad when he wouldn’t. the only upsetting thing i saw from him was they had one short convo where he made a comment about my “rich family” but he apologized and said he’d talk with any friend like that and wasn’t aware it’d offend me. he told me all of this was weird and in their 4 years of friendship she never acted that way. because i was upset about this and because she was being really mean and weird, he blocked her on all platforms.

my insecurities come when i start to ask myself why he reached out to be friends after the break up. he says it’s because they were friends before and he wanted to stay friends but part of me is scared he just couldn’t move on and wanted to keep ties. they also tried to be friends in their relationship before and ended up getting back together ( in that 4 year timespan). along with being cheated on in the past, my stepdad just cheated on my mom with HIS ex, and the situation is similar. he blocked her, then she found another way to reach out and bam they had a whole affair. 

with my past and my stepdad im terrified that my boyfriend could/would betray me in this way. i’m scared that being friends with an ex is just a cover to keep options open. i’m probably naive and stupid to think this way but i can’t help but wonder why she started acting so mean after i came into the picture. he’s had a girlfriend before me and she never acted like that so what gives? it makes me think she still had feelings for him, even though she’s had a bf for 5 years, and that in turn he could have feelings for her.

this is all messy but could i please get some insight on to how to stop ruminating about the past and trust my bf? is blind trust even possible?

968,"in love with a friend.. but it’s not the right time

I (20 - female) have feelings (and always have) for my friend (20 - male). We are close friends who met through mutual friends several years ago. We don’t live in the same city and never have, but may in the near-ish future. We have a very deep and close friendship, that has at times felt romantic etc. I told him I had feelings for him about a year ago and he told me that maybe in the future it could work. He has had several relationships. I have never been in a relationship. 
We talked about it again recently and he kind of said the same thing — that he is content with our friendship and to dive in right now and potentially harm what we have (which is so special as it is) wouldn’t be worth it, but maybe in the future if we live in similar areas and are able to spend more time together. I also think I would want something more long-term than he is wanting right now and forcing that before it was a good time wouldn’t be worth it. 
I can’t see myself wanting to be with anyone else honestly right now. I think I will always feel this way towards him, and right now, I think I need to find happiness in myself. I keep trying to tell myself that if it’s meant to be it will work out. I feel embarrassed about never being in a relationship, having a first kiss, because I feel like i’m on a timeline before it’s socially unacceptable, when it’s less of a choice and more of just how my life has gone. I am just trying to go with where life leads me and not force anything and not pressure myself into things because “i feel like i should”. 
Will it come back if it’s meant to be?

anyway, it’s gotten so bad that i’ve essentially slept every second of every day i wasn’t working, and i have a daytime-tv-worthy mess here. i keep trying to sort through my stuff, but there’s so much here that i don’t have anywhere to put anything, nothing is organized, and it just turns into hours upon days of nervous pacing trying to figure out how i’m going to sort through all of this and picking things up and putting them somewhere only to have to move them again and again later.

meanwhile, i’m still feeling the physical effects of clinical depression, trying to power through with caffeine and minimal food since my kitchen is too messy to use.

do i put everything away in my current apartment and then take it back out to pack it?

do i just put boxes and bins on top of all the crap that’s already here and sort into them?

do i shove everything to one side and then have one big mountain of crap where i can’t access anything easily?

do i just bag up my dirty laundry, dishes, etc. and take care of them once i get to the new house?

i’ve got a decent portion of 3 days to pack a one-bedroom apartment, but everything has to be sorted through by then, because i have family insisting on showing up to “help” unpack after the holiday.

He told me that his wedding was going to be ~50 people and everyone would be wearing masks. I show up to the venue &amp; it’s indoors with easily up to 200 people. Not one person was wearing a mask. I kept my distance, but felt obligated at the beginning to stay and used my telephoto the entire time I was there. It wasn’t until after the ceremony that I decided to leave because he was doing shots in the massive crowd, trying to get me up close &amp; personal for photos for keg stands (wild wedding, I know), and just pushing my boundaries because my business is my livelihood and COVID shouldn’t be a joke. People were so drunk that they wound up spilling their drinks all over my camera equipment that I left in a corner of the venue. My camera bag was ruined, and I had to get a lens repaired.

I’d only just begun to pursue my business full time &amp; quit my crutch-providing job in order to push myself to grow it as much as possible. Because of this wedding, I quarantined myself and lost out of 2 weeks of potential bookings because of my concerns of contracting COVID. I lost a lot of money because of the quarantine and damages done to my equipment, and I lost a lot respect for the photographer.

My question is, should I write a review or is it a conflict of interest? Is that wrong to do? It’s really something that bothers me beyond my downfall in the situation.

981,"It really sucks.

Let me elaborate a bit. I'm 24 and in college.

People don't hate being around me. I don't think my social skills are that low. It's just that people don't seem to enjoy being around me that much. And I have no idea why.

I can make people laugh, and I've focused A LOT on this, because for some reason for a very long time I thought (and still do) that making people laugh was the key of them wanting to be around me. So I learned how to be funny, I read books on it, I would review (and still do) every interaction after it happened to see where I could have been funnier, I would pat myself on the back every time I made people laugh and get mad at myself every time they didn't and assume the whole relationship was ruined. Right now I can make people laugh a lot. Not always, sometimes I make a lame joke or say something stupid, but I still have that in me, especially if I don't pressure myself.

Then I focused on being the intelligent guy. Trying to learn a lot about everything, regardless of whether or not I was interested in the subject. Learning about soccer and watching sport news even though I don't care about it just so that I could have an opinion and join in conversations.

It doesn't work. None of this worked. Yes, I get the feeling that people don't mind being around me. As in, they don't really mind if I sit with them and be with them for a while. I consider myself pretty good at ""reading the room"" and telling when I'm unwanted (which I feel isn't a good sign that I'm able to this so freaking well) and I don't get that feeling most of the times.

But at the same time, people don't really care. If I text someone I consider to be close right now, the person will take ages to respond. Or maybe she will respond harshly and cut the conversation short. The same person that will then go on to text someone else. Same thing happens in class, for example. I'm thinking about a particular girl right now. I'm not interested in her, but I've known her for a while. Yet if I try to talk to her during a class, she will just give me a rushed response to have me shut up and then talk to someone else.

And I'm not jealous, but it's hard not to compare. And I don't know what else to compare myself about. I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to improve. I don't know what to focus on anymore. I look around and see everyone else having people wanting to talk to them, and I don't think they are smarter than me, and the jokes they make are boring, and they have no interests at all. And here I am, after having spent a good amount of time fixing myself and trying to improve myself. And I'm stuck being the chaser and being the guy constantly trying to get other's people attention without ever being on the other side of the coin.

And I know one common solution is ""Just stop chasing"". Yea. If I stop chasing I'll shoot my social life on the head. If I stop asking friends out for dinner I'll just eat alone. I've done that before, and that was what happened. Like I said, people don't mind being with me I think, if I invite them out to a bite they'll say yes 8 times out of 10, they just will never be the one inviting. I don't think I'm up on anybody's priority list right now.

And the infuriating part is not knowing why. At all. If I only knew what to improve then it wouldn't hurt so much. It's the feeling that there is something *fundamentally* wrong with me. Something I can't see or sense or improve, something that draws other people away. This is so painful. And the more I try to improve myself overall the more I'm trying to impress others and seeking a specific reaction, the worse the situation gets when I don't get it. I honestly don't know what else to do or try. Please help :c",14Dec2020,1

984,"A little backstory here. 

My parents got a divorce in 2016 after a rollercoaster of a marriage that lasted 18 years. Their marriage had been in shambles since 2011 (me(9), bro(6)) but my dad stayed for the sake of my brother and I.  I was 14 and my brother was 11 at the time of the divorce. My dad got custody of my brother and I and we would visit our mom every weekend.  I’m not gonna go into detail about the reason for the divorce but I’ll say that it was entirely my mom’s fault and it has resulted in me not having a great relationship with her. I still visited her cuz I lovvve my cousins(they’re little) and it was an excuse to still see them every weekend. I went through a lot of stress (was never taken to a therapist or any doctor after the divorce so was never diagnosed with anything and I don’t wanna throw terms around cuz that is disrespectful to ppl actually suffering from serious problems). So for the past 4 years I followed the same routine of packing my bags every weekend and staying with her(she stays with her parents, brother and his family). My mom’s family always contributed to my “stress” cuz they kept telling me “oh you don’t love your mom anymore. You don’t want to see her anymore” and stuff like that if I missed a weekend. 

Cut to 4 years of the same BS, my dad got married in November. I am very happy about it because all I want is to see my dad happy. I haven’t seen my new stepmom or stepsister yet (ok I’ve been talking to them everyday for the past 3 months cuz they’re in a different country and I love them already). I didn’t tell anyone on my mom’s family yet. But now my dad and stepmom are coming home and I’m very excited to meet them for the first time. But at the same time, now I have to figure out a way to tell my mom about it. It’s gonna break her (idk if I care yet tbh). I know when they get to know, I’m gonna get told “she’s never gonna love you like your mom”, “you don’t want to see ur mom anymore now that you have a “new” mom”.  My parents were never good at confrontation or serious talks and I’ve picked up on that and suck at it. Also, I am the kind of person who would do anything to not make the person in front of me feel bad. I was thinking of telling my granddad about it and let him decide if he wants to tell my mom or not. Is that the right decision? Or do I tell her myself?How do I even begin?

TL;DR
Divorced parents. Bad relationship w/ mom but visits her for the sake of czns. Dad got married. Don’t know if I should tell her myself or make my granddad decide if she should know or not. Sucks at confrontation/serious talks.

Good habits that I used to have such as regular exercise, reading, meditation, getting out of the house to visit parks, and eating healthily.

It’s like nowadays I keep starting and stopping I’ll workout out for a few day’s then I’ll stop I’ll read a couple nights in a row then I’ll stop. I’ll meditate every now and again then I’ll stop.

My thing is I’ve only be able to stay consistent with my desired career which is music what I’m trying to figure out is how do I bring the spark that I have for music into other areas of my life so that I can stay consistent with those habits mentioned above and stop starting and stopping.

Also in regards to finding a relationship I’ve been single for over 5 years now I tend to hold myself back as I say to myself I need to get everything in check first before finding someone I don’t know if that’s wise maybe finding someone would motivate but I’m just unsure at the moment.

I feel like if I haven’t even got myself in check I shouldn’t be trying to find a loving/relationship but then on the other side I feel like maybe having someone in my life would motivate me to do better I’m not sure though.

I just feel a little perplexed at the moment it’s making me feel low I just don’t know how I can bring the drive and consistency I have in regards to my desired career into other areas of my life.

Any advice that could help me or relatable experiences would be appreciated.",14Dec2020,1
991,"So pretty much all you need to know was that I was punched in the chin, it didn’t hurt too bad, manageable. Busted my lip though. Next day a giant bruise came up, again normal. Then it swelled up, AGAIN normal. Now both the swelling and bruise has gone but it I feel the part of my chin it almost feels like a tiny bit of bone is out of place. I’m not sure what to do since I have health anxiety (please still take me seriously I’ve had problems in the past where nobody would listen to me talk about my health worries because they know about my anxiety) I don’t think the punch was bad enough to break anything and it didn’t hurt too much, but now I’m curious on whether I should ignore it and move on or get it checked on just to be sure. Any thoughts? Thanks",14Dec2020,1
992,I told my roommate that I got my older brother a meteorite for Christmas.  He started laughing and said it was really random/strange to get a meteorite for someone. I asked if he thought it was a bad gift and he said no but he was still laughing. I thought it was nice. Is it weird?,14Dec2020,1
993,"I know the subject might seem a little vague, but there's a lot to unpack here. My mom is from South Asia and you already know what the culture is like there. Anyways, I grew up without my dad around and I have a sister with autism. My mom works a high-profile job and naturally she's stressed - totally understandable. However, ever since my junior year has started, my mom has been HELLA degrading and has just eliminated any motivation I have. Thankfully, I've maintained good grades, but she is always calling me a ""disappointment/ret\*rd"" and that I'm a ""brat"" for being upset that my dad was verbally/physically abusive because she went through ""so much worse"". She basically feels that because I have a lot of privileges (which I do, I'm not denying that), I don't have the right to be upset. Ever since online school started, I've been eating a sufficient amount but sporadically. So, of course, my mom found something to say about this, claiming that I'm a ""waste of space/sorry excuse of a human being/lazy"" -- you get the idea. Moreover, despite being clinically diagnosed, she is in denial about my depression, saying that I'm ""bored"" and need to ""get a hobby"". Girl, was 13 years of piano, an internship, leadership positions in clubs, and soccer not enough for you? She claims that nobody in South Asia has time to be depressed, so neither should I. Her friends (who have children that are students at ivy's) have given her horrid advice, like ""it's okay to be a bad parent as long as your kids meet your standards"". I feel like my mother's love for me is PURELY conditional, no matter what she says. She belittles me, my mental illness, and my opinions in every way possible. I love my mom, and I understand she's under a lot of stress, but I don't really know what to do.",14Dec2020,1
994,"So my ex (who is 29) who left me has been catfishing me for a over a year now. Whenever I find out and call him out on it he disappears and then ends up creating another account. Hes been buying Snapchat accounts and also Instagram accounts and has so many picks of random guys and pics of their dicks. I really don’t understand why he’s doing this since this guy ended things with me and has me blocked on his phone. And the thing is I enjoy talking to him, he’s the first guy I fell in love with and I do still love him. So having him catfish messes with me a lot since he’s always complimenting me and saying that he’s mine and everything. The dumbass part of me likes to believe that because that’s all I ever wanted. And I usually find out months after talking to him that he’s my ex which makes it harder for me to block him. 
This time instead of blocking him, I decided to hurt him. Because blocking him didn’t do anything; he kept coming back as other people. So I decided to use all his insecurities against him and now I feel like shit. I am not the type of person to ever do that, but I did.",14Dec2020,1
995,"I want to preface this by saying I will not be leaving my husband at this time, I am committed to our relationship and doing whatever we can to mend the broken trust. 

Back in august, a friend moved in with us (rent free) because she needed help getting back on her feet. She was here about 3 months, and one morning she woke me up saying she found a camera in her room. We freaked out, my husband said he had no idea where it came from, I had no clue so we called the cops and filed a report. She immediately moved to our other friends house because she didn’t feel safe, which I completely understood. I asked my husband straight up if he knew anything about it, and I needed his honesty, he said he knew nothing, and I believed him. Fast forward a month, and I get a text from my friend, the detective called back and she wants to talk to me tonight. I say sure, I’m available, but the way she worded it made me nervous. I asked again if he knows why she would act like that, and he admits he did have a camera like that but that he promises he didn’t do it. I’m hesitant to believe him because we have had our trust issues in the past, but he convinces me he’s telling the truth. Well he called me about an hour ago to tell me he did put the camera there. That he doesn’t know where his mind was at but with her living in the house, he was just tempted and wanted to see more. I told him that I was truly hurt and disgusted, and that we had some serious issues to work through, but also told him that we would talk it over when he got home and come up with a plan on forgiveness and building trust back. I told him the fact that he lied to my face on multiple occasions really hurt our relationship, and he said he was just so ashamed. I need help figuring out where to go from here. How do I get over what my husband did and how do I ever trust him? We cannot afford therapy currently. I would love to, but we literally cannot afford it. Where are some things we can do to not only heal our relationship, but also work on my husbands lying? I know he’s not a bad person, but communication is such an important thing to me and I’m scared for our relationship. Please, if anyone has advice that’s not ‘divorce him’ I’d really appreciate it. 
TLDR: husband put a camera in female roommates room and lied multiple times about it. Need help on how to move forward.",14Dec2020,1
996,"17F. I've had a few phases (?) in my life just a few years ago but i just remembered this one thing and I got curious. Not sure if I still have it now but I get paranoid around people especially men. (not sure if paranoid is the right word) nothing traumatic has happened to me in the past that could trigger this so I don't really know where it came from. Whenever someone looks at me in public, I automatically get nervous and come up with conclusions which obviously never ended up actually happening. And with men, I always think they're going to do something to me. I was going to ignore it but there was a time when I realized It might be serious. It was my friend's 18th birthday and we are sleeping over. Her brother has this group of friends (like a frat group or smth) but she said they are nice. Idk if it was just me but I was so out the whole night. I tend to look at people around me (I guess to see if they're looking at me IDK) and when I see someone do, my heart starts beating fast and I start being paranoid.

I started texting my mom and asked if there's someone that could drive all the way here because I want to go home. There was absolutely nothing to be scared of that night, I was with all my friends and I was with them the whole time. But I was panicking and not thinking straight. I went home.

Also when this creepy guy kept looking at my neck and legs on the mirror of that public transpo (I know I wasn't being crazy in this one cause he really was creepy) but on that ride home I kept thinking ""what if he knows me?"" cause we live in the same town ""what if he goes all the way to my house and do smth to me?""

I'm scared I might have it until now. Is this a problem? Like am I sick?",14Dec2020,1
997,"My mental health has been terrible the past few months. I’ve been living alone away on an internship and since it’s a tiny company I don’t talk to anyone at work and I can’t meet up with any friends because of COVID so I literally haven’t had a real conversation in person with someone in months.

This isolation I think has contributed to my spiralling mental health and it’s been affecting my sleep heavily. I’ve been falling asleep around 4 a.m. and waking up at 9 every day for the past month or so and I don’t know how to escape.

I always get in bed way before but I just can’t seem to close my eyes and sleep because my day just feels.. not done? I feel unfulfilled, discontent. Because I wake up, go to work, come home... to nothing... every single day. And so to fill this void I just mindlessly scroll through reddit or tik tok or YouTube hoping to feel something, and I obviously don’t. I just wait until I get exhausted and am forced to sleep.

I don’t know what to do. But I just can’t lay there with my anxious thoughts swirling around my brain and fall asleep.

What can I do?",14Dec2020,1
998,"So two years ago I moved about an hour away from my hometown and was essentially dropped by my entire friend group besides one person. They don’t speak to me unless I reach out first, and if they do decide to visit me it is due to my one friend coming to visit me and being able to drive them to my home. Despite this when they hear about me from others they always say they miss me and want to visit, but stipulate that they need gas money.

They refuse to drive to my home unless I supply gas money or drive out there myself to get them. In the past I have done this, but began feeling like I shouldn’t have to essentially pay them to maintain our friendship, when I am the only one even putting effort into the friendship to begin with. They have lied to me about not wanting to come out to see me (saying they have work/family wants them to stay home), but when I go out to get another friend I find out that they were out with the entire group and then they ask to come with because I’m “going to get (friend) anyways” and get offended/don’t understand why I get upset with that. It is the fact I am lied to that makes me upset, if they said they didn’t want to drive out or had plans it would be fine, but instead I’m just lied to.

I have always been pretty lenient when it comes to drugs and alcohol in my house, and felt for a long time that they would only come if offered weed or drinks, on top of them just being druggies as a whole. Due to me not having drug issues, I don’t do them often and it has lead to me being excluded from just hanging out with them, or not being able to enjoy their company because they are inebriated.

I have spoken to them about these feelings with no change, and it has gotten to the point seeing them makes me severely depressed and have emotional problems the week following seeing them. Seeing them online just makes me sad, as it is always photos of me being excluded in some way, forgotten. 

Is it wrong of me to ghost them if I’ve tried to fix things only for nothing to change? Is it toxic for me to just leave?",14Dec2020,1
999,"[23F] using a throwaway. not really sure where to post this. before i start i just want it made clear that my boyfriend does not know the full story and i do not blame him in any form or fashion for what happened. 

i went to a boxing party last week with my boyfriend and it was at the apartment of one of his best guy friends (known each other for 13 years, i’ve known him myself for 4). i will sum this up as much as i can. we were all drinking pretty excessively throughout the night and after the party festivities ended it was me, my boyfriend, his friend, and his friend’s girlfriend left in the living room. we smoked a joint between the 4 of us and i had a few more shots as well. i started feeling horribly after coming down off all the alcohol and decided to go lay down, i didn’t tell my boyfriend or anyone what was wrong because i didn’t want to look like i couldn’t handle my liquor. i guess i fell asleep fairly quickly because i woke up to someone, who i obviously assumed was my boyfriend, on top of me and breathing on my neck. i tried to adjust myself a little bit because the person was pressing all their weight on my lower body, then i heard my boyfriend’s friend and then my boyfriend both erupt with laughter. apparently they thought it would be funny to pretend my bf’s friend was actually him trying to have sex with me (very stupid immature and not funny at all, i know). 

anyways, after i let them know i didn’t think it was funny and i needed to rest, they left me alone. i fell fast asleep and only woke a few times throughout the span of maybe an hour of me sleeping, only because of the music/yelling/etc. i fell into a much deeper sleep and was awoken again, this time seemingly hours later, after all the noise had died down and the light were all turned off. someone, assuming my bf again, was kneeling over me with both their arms at my sides. they started to kiss my neck and all i could smell was alcohol. thinking it was my boyfriend drunk and initiating sex, i reach down to the pants area and start rubbing. i could feel instantly that it wasn’t my boyfriend so i jerk my hand back quickly and freeze. it didn’t register to me what was happening until it was already happening. i told him to stop, to get off from the beginning and he didn’t, just kept pushing his weight on me more and more, grabbing under my shirt at my breasts, forcing his hand up my shorts. all i could think about is how my boyfriend would react if he caught him, and i didn’t want to bring any problems so i laid there feeling sick and scared. the whole thing lasted a couple minutes i think and when he was done he laid on me for a second mumbling things like “sorry” “that wasn’t good”... then jumped up like there was a fire, and bolted out the door. 

i am still processing all of this until today. i’m not really sure how i should go about this. i want to tell my boyfriend his friend raped me after they tried to play a “prank” but i don’t want him feeling guilty and i’m also nervous his friend will lie and i will end up getting the short end of the stick (like i said they’ve been friends for 13 years, i’ve only been with my boyfriend for 4) also considering telling my boyfriend’s friend’s girlfriend but i’m not sure what good that will do. i want to express my anger to my boyfriend as well for leaving me in that predicament/not checking on me after what they did but again, i don’t want to guilt him. i apologize for this being longer than i anticipated but i could really use the advice. please don’t be mean",14Dec2020,1
1000,"Recently I was busy texting a friend of mine(girl). We both have feelings for each other but we decided to stay friends at the moment. She asked me for advice because her ex was ignoring her due to their breakup and she hated to leave things the way they are between them, she wanted to stay friends. Anyway, during the conversation I asked whether she still had feelings for him and she said she doesn't know, that reply kinda stunned me and I've been distant with her ever since... I've been in a relationship before where my ex cheated on me, and I just dont want history to repeat itself. I really love this girl but I feel that if she can't make up her mind it will cause disruptions if we had to go out. (she does have a lot of exes too, so I guess that makes me a little worried) maybe I'm just insecure and have trust issues? Am I wrong to feel the way I do? I'm Open to any criticism.",14Dec2020,1
1001,"For the longest time I was working toward becoming a medical provider and it took me quite some time before I got accepted into a program. It required patient contact hours which I accrued by working at hospital and other medical offices. I never felt that ""passion"" for the field as so many people talked about. Yet I still told the program I did because I thought ""what the hell, I've been working so long toward this and don't really know what else i'd do so I might as well try it out."" While I was doing the classroom/books training part, I only thought about the end goal of making a stable income. Pls dont judge, im just being honest. Now I'm about to go on clinicals portion of the training and I want to quit. I don't feel like i'm quite cut out for the profession because I care more about making money which I feel will be detrimental to others. Further more I don't really feel up to studying the subject anymore, im quite depressed about it really. The people I spoke with brush it off as normal burnout during training which is quite common and tell me to just push through. Some even talked about how they resented the training every day right until the very end and then somehow found enjoyment for it years later after finishing. (like wth? that sounds wrong).  So i took a break from school. During that break I realized just how depressed I was because I had suicidal thoughts that occured on the daily. It was sort of a cynical/joking suicidal ideation of ""well if this is too hard i should just kill myself."" And then I fantasize about how I would do it and picture myself hanging from different fixtures around the house. I don't think that is normal because it randomly pops into my head at least twice a day. During that same break I decided to explore other things and started learning about coding and computer science. Ngl it's also hard but didn't give me the same type of anxiety I had from before because if I wouldn't kill another person with negligence or mistake if I wrote a line of code wrong or something like that.  I brought it up with my family and immediately was bombarded with everything you can imagine. ""Don't quit now, you're so close. It's supposed to be hard and you're gonna be fine when you're done. You're throwing this away a good opportunity just to start over on something stupid and you have no experience on. Medicine is the best job to have because its secure and you'll definitely regret this later if you quit. At the very least, just get the degree then do something else."" IDK how to feel about that last one tho. Yes if I tried really hard and continue to be depressed I probably can get the degree. But what's the point if I'd just end up doing something else. It'd be a waste of time and money just to delay my switching career path. I don't feel like I'm being heard. 

Personally, I don't think my personal beliefs and preferences aligns with being a medical provider. My goal is to make a lot of money because I grew up poor. I care about people as much as the next person but that's not enough to carry me through the grind of a depressing training process. I have other interests besides medicine i'd like to pursue and have put it all on hold for this and now I don't feel like I could return to them that because the program preach about how their training cover only the basic foundation of what we need to get started and the real education starts after graduation where we're expected to continue teaching ourselves. This last point is a bit juvenile but I'd like to do recreational drugs, nothing crazy but it's strictly prohibited for the profession and could jeopardize my license and I'd be lying if I said I'd give that up. 

Now the break is about to be over and I must choose between continuing which means more time, money and effort poured into this to see if I will change my mind about it or quit and start down a new path that feels even more uncertain. The best I can do is give the clinical phase a try for 1 semester before walking away so I can say that I tried every part of it and it's not for me but even that feels like a big waste of time to me. IDK what I should do.",14Dec2020,1

1003,"This has nothing to do with covid, I was practicing self-isolation before it was cool. I keep my circle small, and the few friends I have are long distance. This has been a long term problem. This is a long post, so I'm sorry in advance. 

Hiya, 17F. Got diagnosed with depression and anxiety in early childhood (Grade 3 I think), and the problem was clinical. As I progressed into middle school, medication was recommended. Like many Americans I got prescribed Prozac. 

The meds sucked and I tried a few different SSRI's. My early childhood pretty much had only one thing going for me, and it was my intelligence. I was always applauded for being more mature, etc, you've heard it all before. Anyway, a lot of my identity was staked on my intelligence, as growing with depression and anxiety made me a sort of person-shaped blob with no personality. 

 I started on 10mg of the Prozac which was fine, but the dose evened out. When I upped the dose to compensate (with permission from the prescriber) shit hit the fan. My face broke out, as did my back and upper chest, I was irritable, emotionally unstable, and suicidal, and had aggressive mood swings. The thing that scared me the most about the medication was a side effect I had experienced a little before but not nearly as much when the dose upped. I was starting to have cognitive functioning issues. Everything from my attention span and ability to concentrate, and even my memory was not the way it was. I couldn't even read without having to stop every couple of words. My focus was ruined.  Remember when I said I staked my entire identity on my intelligence? Yeah, this side effect hurt beyond belief. It made me feel like I lost my value. All of this scared me so much I did the stupidest, most impulsive thing imaginable. I immediately stopped taking the medication without telling anyone. This caused withdrawal symptoms, and even aggravated my previous symptoms. 

But I believe I'm better off without the meds. One of the things the meds fixed for me was motivation. I was more disciplined, and had an easier time doing tasks on time, etc. 

I'm typing this 15 minutes before an Art class that I would love nothing more than participate in and love. I want to draw, and turn in my assignments on time. I want to go back to my usual hobbies and sew stuff by hand or do some crazy makeup. I want to try my best doing homework and studying and participating at college as much as I always did. I want to be myself again, and suck helium out of balloons after making a cup of tea just because I can.

I feel like I'm watching pieces of myself fly away and I'm doing nothing to get them back. I miss myself, yet I feel indifferent. 

Has anyone else experienced this before? What did you do? I got to go to art and try to do stuff, but I constantly feel like I'm trying to peel a carrot with another carrot. It doesn't work, and it isn't fun.  How do you guys get discipline/motivation? Does this sound like a medication thing? Maybe the first time was a fluke? I don't know. I just know that I can't keep going through life like this, otherwise I'll never succeed.",14Dec2020,1
