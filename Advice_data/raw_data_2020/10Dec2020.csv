0,"Hey I really need help here... I want to upload videos to YouTube and I also have a small livestream channel but I just can’t get the courage to turn on the camera and start filming. I also feel like I start so many projects but never finish them. Or I just plan for so many projects but as soon as it comes to needing to do some work, I get so depressed and feel this weight on my chest that tells me just to go back to bed and lay there forever. I even got on stream and I usually have a great time but I just felt so off and horrid that I ended it after 20 minutes. I need to get out of this rut I hate how I feel. Also it makes reaching out to people mega hard also. I feel like I don’t know how to create bonds with anyone. I spend most of my time alone especially during the quarantine and never talk to anyone about how I’m feeling. I can’t I don’t have any friends or family that I have that connection with and so even when people try I ruin it or run away or ghost them. So yeah I’m just doing so many things by myself to distract myself but now it’s starting to become unbearable. How do you guys deal with mental health and productivity? I can’t even get out of bed most days.",10Dec2020,1
1,"I am not allowed to shave or shower with out her permission. In fact I have never shaved before. It's uncomfortable, especially down there. People already make comments on how hairy my legs and arms are now, and I'm going to high school. I can't wear shorts or swim suits, because I'm afraid people will make fun of me. I'm not allowed to go out by myself or talk on the phone with anyone. Any advice?",10Dec2020,1

3,"Okay so during lockdown in the UK, I was at uni staying in my flat with my 4 other flatmates. 

This one girl, we’ll call her Amy, has been continuously breaking lockdown to meet at least 4 different friends (all from different households) and seeing her boyfriend all the time and bringing him back to our flat without asking. 

Obviously, she was breaking the law at that point but I didn’t feel it was necessary to report her to the police since none of us were seeing high-risk people or even going to campus at that point. However, me and my boyfriend (who is also my flatmate) have been sticking to the rules and not seeing anyone regardless, and mostly avoiding her just in case. 

A couple days before lockdown ends we decide to finally sit down with our flatmates in the kitchen and have a drink, before we have to start isolating before we go home (explained later). Amy joins us a little later since she was busy earlier. The next day, she walks in while I’m in the kitchen and informs me that she found out yesterday morning that she had scabies (which she caught from her bf’s house which she shouldn’t have been going to in the first place) and that she treated it yesterday, but is only telling us today. That explained why she was doing laundry non stop all day (and she continued to do about 5 loads back to back over 3 days not letting us wash our stuff.) I admit I was pissed and asked her why she didn’t tell us earlier, especially since she saw us and decided to sit down in close contact with us. I told her to message the groupchat we have to let all of us know which treatment to get. We each ended up paying £20 (~25$) for the treatment and had to wash absolutely everything we owned. On the groupchat, she lied to the others and said she only found out a few hours ago rather than a whole day and a half ago, then she kept apologising unprovoked and said she’d never do it again she’d be careful etc. (In hindsight, I regret not calling out her lie)

Now, the first day post-lockdown, my bf briefly goes into the kitchen around 9pm and comes back to my room and to my surprise he says the other 3 flatmates are having a party along with Amy’s bf, and two other friends from a different house. At this point, it’s less than a week (3 days, to be exact) till we all go home. Both my dad, and my bf’s dad, are both high-risk (due COPD and immunosuppressants). We had no idea they were having a gathering and so had not been warned to avoid our own kitchen and wear masks when we do go. They know from previous experience that both me and my bf self-isolate for a week before seeing family by wearing masks around them and socially distancing, cooking at different times and eating in our rooms etc. I’m now completely furious that literally 2 days ago Amy promised us she’d be more careful etc. and now she’s organised a gathering behind our back, and I’m annoyed that the other two flatmates agreed considering one of them also has a high-risk parent and can empathise with our mindset. So my bf decided to report it and I was next to him trying to sleep, since they’re breaking the law, could get us into trouble, and worst of all could be the reason that our families get seriously ill or even die, God forbid. At first I angrily suggested we should report them but I said oh I’m not actually going to, but he did. A policewoman called us the next day saying she would keep it anon and just come to our house and talk to all of us as a warning. She never did. 

A week later when we’ve all moved back home after testing negative (except Amy who is still there), we get an email saying the police have sent our landlord a report and that we may have been issued fines (£100). If they find out we’re behind it (e.g. if they all get letters and see that we don’t)they’d be furious, as well as our whole friendship group of around 10 other people. Now I’m scared they’ll find out and worried that I overreacted. 

Since we got the email we’ve been talking on the groupchat and they seem to think it must have been a mistake, and one of them is suggesting to email them back and pretend that the people from the other households weren’t there, even though they were. We discouraged him because the only thing that could do is lead to an appeal and if the courts find out he’s lying he could get a bigger fine and a criminal record, and possibly drag us down along with him. 

I need advice on how to move forward and stop worrying and what the best way to deal with it is.",10Dec2020,1
4,"I've always tried to be a good person, but I have never had the upper hand when it came to a toxic ex. She shattered my entire world, and admitted she used me for her own ends, married me just to humor me, never loved me and had a new boyfriend the day we broke up. She fucked up and didn't put the separation papers through, so basically I have multiple grounds for contesting the divorce. In Virginia adultery is a misdemeanor for starters, I have her on abandonment, fraudulent marriage, and mental abuse visa vis shaming me for being a former addict and telling me she hopes I relapse, overdose and die.

So basically, I'm wondering whether I should stay the bigger person and try and continue to be a good guy, or completely fuck her life up by getting a PI and proof of adultery (which is extremely easy in VA) or just let it go.",10Dec2020,1
5,"He told me lies about everything. He has a girlfriend but he said to me he was done with her. He told me lies about his feelings but he wanted wanted just to play with me and have sex. He said all his friends about me that I was ""easy"" and a slut. I really feel terrible for this. It's very difficult for me to forgive him. What can I do?

6,"I'm in highschool and I really don't know what I want to do in my life. I used to want to do something in college for healthcare because I really enjoyed biology and chemistry; and I was happy. I knew I would get into a well paying job and do something I really enjoyed. But now, my love for chemistry has started to go down, and I have learned how hard med school and college is, and how I will probably never make it, along with job growth of healthcare careers going down. However, I have picked up an interest in math and have considered something in math or accounting. This may sound good, but I feel that if I don't go into something with a very high pay, I won't be able to do things I want to do in my life later, splurge on expensive things, buy brand new cars, travel, etc.

8,"Ok so to begin ive been dating this girl for almost 2 years now. In the beginning, when i went over to her house after work (mind you her house is literally an hour and 10 minutes from my work and my own house) she would drop everything and be all excited i was there, hugs, kisses, all that stuff as soon as i walked in. Secondly we used to have sex at least 2 times a week (more in the beginning naturally) but now its been like two months. She is now not doing any of that stuff (dosent even seem like shes happy to see me to be honest) she wont have sex anymore (but she will either sit in top of me with it inside and use a vibrator or shell just watch porn and use a vibrator) she barely cuddles me when we sleep (in some cases she has told me to literally not touch her because she dosent want to cuddle which i get occasionally but every night??). Now a bit about me. Firstly i hate tooting my own horn especially when it comes to asking for relationship advice buuuuut i treat her like a queen, i help her clean up her room, do all her dishes, wake up early sometimes to make her breakfast, was starting to think about a ring till about 5 months ago when all this started, i sit there in the bathroom while she uses it bc shes afraid of being alone, for petes sake i even facetime her on days where im not at her house all night long, i helped her paint her room, and then installed a carpet for her, everytime we hang out I drive out to see her she never ever comes to see me, idk i feel like this is a one sided relationship.... oh before someone says i should talk to her... i do try but she gets so defensive about EVERYTHING. Am i getting cheated on? Has my 40 lbs weight gain made me disgusting in her eyes? Am i over thinking it? (I tend to not believe this one bc its been happening for so long some of my friends ask questions.) Is it me? Could i be doing other things for her? Im at a loss and i really dont know if i can stay in a relationship like this (unless i can change something about me) please help. I really appreciate it.",10Dec2020,1
9,"We've been together 2 years now.  During the summer, I moved to her town; she used to live 90 minutes away.  She's the only person in my life I'm close to and the only person I know here.

In October, an argument and misunderstanding between us got so bad that we broke up for about a week.  When she came to get her stuff, I felt like I was in a manic state and made the mistake of asking her to wait in her vehicle while I packed her stuff.  She made the mistake of trying to force her way into the building after saying no.  She looked into my eyes and saw how broken I was.  She tried to touch my shoulders to calm me down but touching me made me jump and I backed up into a wall accidentally (no damage).  The police showed up.  She was hospitalized for almost having a stroke afterwards and considered committing herself to a clinic.

We spent a week apart, had a 9 hour conversation at a restaurant, and have been going to counseling.  Our communication is the strongest it's ever been and she said she realizes now that she can't ever imagine life without me in it.  The community manager claims someone took pictures of the 'verbal, physical, and police confrontation'.  She claims she called the police and filed a report the next morning, banning her from the property.  She said if she's seen, she will be arrested; after 3 strikes, eviction.  My counselor, girlfriend, and everyone I've talked to claims she's bluffing; which has made me feel like I've taken a crazy pill.

I asked through e-mail if anything could be done about it.  The manager said that it's not up for discussion, zero tolerance.  My girlfriend has been optimistic since October that we will fix it; I feel hopeless.  Today, I tried scheduling an appointment to talk to the manager about things more.  My girlfriend offered to join me to talk to the manager in person; and doesn't seem to believe that she might get arrested for it.

When I asked the manager for an appointment today, she asked ""what is the appointment regarding?"".  I said 'general questions' and she claims she isn't scheduling in-person appointments; only phone appointments.  My girlfriend disagrees that the manager is being difficult and claims it's because of the pandemic; I disagree.  I scheduled a phone appointment for 2pm friday but I feel like I got my answer today already.  My girlfriend wants to handle the phone call; I told her that only the lease owner can talk about the lease to an employee and that the manager will hang up on her.  My girlfriend is still optimistic.  In contrast, this situation is making my brain dizzy.

I feel like something can be done about this but I just don't know what.  All the other apartments around here have long wait lists; plus I'm medically disabled, so it's even going to be harder to move.  We can't go to her house for a while because of complicated family reasons I don't want to get into.  We've been dating from her car basically and she seems extremely happy and positive about things - I'm convinced she'll get tired of this and leave.  I literally have to walk 15 minutes in the snow to meet her.  When we buy groceries together, I have to unload them from the building next door.  We worked so hard to remove distance from our relationship and waited so long... for this.

I'm lost.  She's the only person I want in my apartment but she can't be here.  I know the manager is 'just doing their job', I know we made a mistake, and I know the building is independently owned, so they can set their own rules.  I just feel like we can reverse this somehow.  My counselor suggested going above her and requesting to see the apparent pictures taken (I honestly don't want to see them...).",10Dec2020,1
10,"Hi All,

I need your advice!  I love to have intellectual conversations and bounce ideas off of others.  In fact, I love to brainstorm solutions to other people's problems at work and in life in general, and people always comment on how much better they feel after talking with me.  Is there a market for others who share this same interest?  If so, what platforms should I target?  

Question:  If you were me, how would you advertise a low-cost online alternative to therapy?  I'm not a life coach -- rather I'm a supportive friend who can also discuss deep, theoretical topics from a wide range of interests.  

(At the risk of sounding immodest, I have a sparkling personality in person.  I'm bubbly and witty, while at the same time deep and perceptive.  I'm also an avid reader so family and friends call me ""encyclopedia.""  Therefore, I want to meet a market need by capitalizing on my strengths.  I'd appreciate any guidance you can provide!)",10Dec2020,1

13,"So recently his boyfriend left him for a girl, and I decided that if I didnt confess soon then my Christmas would be hell. So i wrote a whole paragraph that i was meant to keep to myself but.. I want to either make myself suffer or feel better and wanted to ask whether i should send this to him

Since i haven't really got anything to lose, And neither have you in terms of love i guess, Ill just come right out and say it. I like you. A lot. And its been this way for a couple of months now. I've never confessed directly to anyone, but hearing you singing earlier on, It pulled me over the edge. I feel like id die of loneliness if i don't either tell you or get rid of these feelings, and the second option is virtually impossible so, here i am. I know you probably don't like me back since you were with someone(Well i didn't know that either so eh), and actually I never thought you liked me in the first place, that's why i vowed to keep my feelings secret. But I don't want to live feeling like a coward. 
I've ruined things between us i know it. I don't want to lose you as a friend but you wont see me the same again. 
I swear, You’re the only friend i need.
I know we haven't known each other long, but you seem to be the only reason i enjoy being at school. And i think of you. Too much. And i wonder what your opinion is on every little thing i do. I'm fucking terrified of you. But then again i cant wait to see you. But i dont want you to see me. And then again i want to be the center of your attention. And then embarrass myself and come off as annoying

What am i doing writing this paragraph, we have less than two days before the holidays, and before i go back to that hell. And i dont think i can do it, with these shitty feelings. I cant bring myself to say this to you. I feel like i have to do tons and tons of research on whether you'd like me back one day or if you'd be interested in starting something, yet I don't expect anything to come out of this, but i just needed you to listen.

Thanks for always being there. You smell so nice. And i think you're really cute. But most importantly you have the kindest personality id ever witnessed. You’re completely unlike anybody else, I can never predict or tell what you really are thinking and that pulls me in.

Im sorry. I bet this either sounds really cringey or creepy. I cant bring myself to read it. A few months ago i started out trying to look out for you, or after you. And i had wanted us to be really good friends, but then i got to know you. And oh my god. You are so kind. So kind. No wonder **** group likes you so much. And the more i hung around you, the less i knew what to say. I dont know what to say around you. My mind struggles to think of anything witty or cool or interesting because im so scared, I know what to say to all my friends and stuff and what jokes to make, but never to you. You are so beautiful inside and out. That is cringe. Im so cringe. But you aren’t.
I want to see you live your life. by your side. Not even as a lover. Just as an onlooker or friend. I want to see your highest highs and lowest lows and be there to comfort you. I want to know you as if we were childhood friends. And I want to know what you were like before I got to know you. I've tried finding flaws on you, but doesn't work and my heart and feelings remain in the exact same place I had left them. I dont care if you dont like me back. Ive come to the conclusion that i want to stay around you. What i said here will strain our relationship. But as long as i can still see you each and every day at school,  Its worth the awkward humiliation
I like you. Maybe even love you. I dont know what love is.
You were worth so much more than some shitty girl.

Ok so that was the fat paragraph. I dont know how he feels about me or how he would react to this, and the fact that this would definitely change our friendship. I dont wanna drift away from him but i dont want to suffer or be cowardly. Should i shoot my shot while hes still single? Because he mentioned that he didnt know whether to stay single or find a new girlfriend or boyfriend. I really really dont wanna make things awkward in the bad way or have him reject me. I know he appreciates me as a person and friend. 
this is so sad. I am so sad",10Dec2020,1
14,"Hey guys. I'm 30 and still in school, and I keep failing year after year. Some of it's because I don't study enough, some of it is exam anxiety, some of it maybe is just too hard for me. And all these problems sort of compound on each other and cause more stress which makes them all worse. 

I think it's time to quit. 

Maybe there is a way to stick to a schedule, remove distractions, cure anxiety, etc that I haven't tried yet, but why risk it when it's still going to take me another 3 years to finish? I really wish I could finish, but I feel like it's going nowhere and I'm not willing to try hard enough to fix my problems.    

&amp;#x200B;

So, I was thinking of going into plumbing, to start an apprenticeship so I can get to working and build up to something, but now I'm having second doubts. They say it's a really hard job, you work late, it tears up your body, and you don't actually make that much money unless you're constantly selling or managing a company.   

I don't know what to do or what options I have. I have a bachelor's degree, but from years ago in a humanities degree I'm not interested in. 

And with COVID, I'm afraid it will be doubly hard to find a job, not even considering how it looks like to drop out of school at 30.  

Where do I start?",10Dec2020,1
15,"I have been laid off since May and have been adamantly looking for work that can meet my basic salary expectations so I can afford to live. Ideally that’s a $40k salary and health insurance (will allow me to get by with rent, utilities, credit card bills, and student loan bills returning).

I have worked in administrative roles in the music and entertainment industry, lots of data entry, invoice processing, vendor enrollment, etc. 

I’m really struggling finding work in any capacity. I don’t know how much less specific I can make my work history and it feels like employers see my previous experience and immediately pass on my application without acknowledging the transferable skills I have. 

How is anyone finding a job right now? I am panicking and have enough in my savings to cover my expenses until March. I don’t really know what I will do by then if I haven’t found work but am trying my best to remain optimistic.

16,"Anyone who’s worked retail or the like will probably know those customers who seem to forget that cashiers (etc) aren’t just emotionless robots. 

I (20F) wasn’t that bothered by them in the beginning, but it’s like they’ve just multiplied recently and I get so many angry customers it feels overwhelming. If I at least did something wrong I could fix it but they come up and yell at me for things that are out of my control. 

I got yelled at today by a customer for not wearing a mask when I was literally standing behind a giant plastic thing that allows us to work mask free. Aside from that I have pretty bad asthma and can’t move around too much wearing a mask or I’ll have a panic attack because I can’t breathe. Anyway, when I tapped the plastic she just huffed and left. Another guy came up screaming at me about getting his car washed but we don’t even offer that service? A third customer who’s usually horrible (a regularly) turned around to yell at the car wash man, it was that bad. Karens fighting karens. 

Another customer was super rude to me because she wanted to pick up a package and I honestly turned around and said “excuse me” purely to give her a chance to say it in a nicer way. It’s not my job to hand out packages and she knew this already. She just decided to ignore the giant sign that says “ring bell for help” down by the package area and took it out on me.

Today was just a six hour shift and I was emotionally exhausted towards the end which I usually aren’t. Recently it’s just been so bad. I don’t exactly back talk to customers but I DO put them in their place in a polite way which used to be enough.

18,"Hey guys, 

I'm in need of some advice. A bit of back story. I started a partnership business with my friend back in the summer. We did well for the season, but don't have any plans for the winter (plans to start up again in the spring). This business I've started with my friend is not something I can see myself doing for a few years (I do not love it).

Currently, I've managed to find a part-time job however, I've always wanted a job in my field. Due to covid and poor opportunities where I am located, there are still no jobs in my field. As a result of this, I've applied to a few random good paying jobs, and recently accepted a full time offer with permanent position. I have hopes in the future to get a job in my field; maybe in a year or so when the market picks back up. 

The advice I am looking for is how best to end my partnership with my friend. He/she knows that it is not something I enjoy doing (and won't be doing it for a few years). But they are also relying on me for next season. I feel absolutely terrible about accepting this new exciting well paying job; but I have to look after myself and pay my bills.

Any advice is appreciated",10Dec2020,1
19,"I need some legal advice and don't know where to turn. I have contacted an abuse hotline but they haven't been able to answer my questions well enough to keep my mind at ease.

I am asking for your help because I desperately need it. If you are a lawyer and can dm me, even better. I am afraid to give too many details, as he is an active Redditor, but I will do my best to describe the situation. I am just so tired of living in fear and need to find out my options and if I am being given empty threats.

I live with my ex, but we broke up before we started living together. We moved in together as friends and he swore there would be no tension between us. Over the past year, I have been experiencing a multitude of verbal abuse, harassment, and threats. He blames it all on me and says I cause him to get angry so he needs to punish me. I am not perfect, by any means, and know I make a lot of mistakes. But none of them should make me deserving of such wrath and cruelty.

I get belittled constantly and honestly, I have so much trauma from it that I fuck up more than I ever have in my life just because all I can think about is ""don't fuck up"", so I actually end up doing that exact thing. I have been called everything under the sun, but mostly he just thinks I am stupid. I know I am not the most intelligent person in the world, but again, I don't think it's justifiable to treat me this way! He is only making my PTSD much worse than it already is.

The yelling and belittling were enough to really break me mentally, but now I fear it's turned physical.

I am going to leave out a lot of details, again, for fear he will see this. Basically, we play a certain mobile game together and he entrusted me to trade between our accounts. I traded something important of his (no trade backs) and I didn't do it maliciously or on purpose. It was all out of ignorance, which isn't a good excuse, but it is what it is. I didn't know at the time what I had done, until later, when he called for me and questioned me. He started becoming hyper-aggressive and shouting over my mistake. I got nervous and backed down the stairs towards our basement, which was a mistake. He pushed my head down on the stairs with his foot and it cracked. And I fell down the stairs afterward. I ran to the restroom and grabbed my phone but he followed me, as well as took my phone from me. He wouldn’t let me leave the bathroom and threatened to break my phone as a punishment for ""destroying"" his property. He claims what he did on the stairs was self-defense and the authorities won't believe me. He thinks his perfect record will save him, as well as his smooth-talking and lies. 

I told him I just want to move out because this is such a toxic situation, but he threatens me every time I mention it. He says I can't because of the lease, but I feel with enough evidence of his verbal abuse that I can get out of the lease. He wants me to pay rent until the end of our lease after I move out, which I just can't afford to do. So, getting out of the lease is the only option and when I mention it to him, he says he will take me to court. If not over that, but anything. He claims you can sue for anything if you are willing to pay the court fees and he is willing to do so for the rest of his life just to make me miserable. Not only does he claim he will sue me for the rest of his life constantly, but he also says he has powerful friends that will doxx me and ruin my life, with no trace being left back to him.

Hello, i just turned 22 male from denmark and I seem to struggle with My mom. My mom and dad got a divorse when i was 15, since then i have stayed with My dad. I visit My mom one or twise a week and stay at her place and each summer. I just moved out this month due to My education. 

My mom has servere depression as long as I have known her. I feel it has taken some toll on My mental well being, i am somewhat glad that i lived with My dad.

She allways miss me, but I simple cant love her the same way. I think im Hurt on some level due to her behavoir when i was little, or because she left me and My dad at that time. (their relationship today is good, it was a preacefull divorse.)

I think she tries to fix a broken relationship. I wanna fix it to, but It Will be a false love if i act by her manner, i wanna be me, but I seem locked in My psyce, i tend to get fustrated or mute so im just quiet.

Me: ""Honestly I think I would be more comfortable at home but I could still talk to you every day?""

Friend: ""Okay we just want to make sure you have someone around you if you need anything anytime, even if it's just something small""

Me: ""Ya for sure, ik it's probably gonna be hard for everyone to trust me for a while but I really do wanna get better [sober]""

Friend: ""I totally understand that. Can we compromise and bring you home after your [therapy] appt on Monday? I just think after all these conversations you might need some time to readjust and plus we can help you with rides [i don't have a car anymore] while [my sister] is still in the middle of finals I think?

All of our other friends had walked home already, so it was just me and her. I brought my iPad to school that day, so while she was waiting for her mom to pick her up (we aren’t quite old enough to drive yet, we’re 14), we started watching a show while lying in the grass. We were getting a bit close at times, but nothing major. Her mom ended up having to stay at work longer so my mom picked us up to drive her home.

Dad was very mad and said I was this and that. I didn't have a plan but I was going to leave that night. Then I thought maybe if I keep things cool I can leave when Dad is out of the house, or another day. 

Dad calmed down a bit and he would lecture me. I wanted to move back to campus around January, he said it is too cold, if I get sick no one will help. He said I had to write out my plan for them and if they agreed it was reasonable than I can go. He said if I died outside no one would know, and some of that is true. I feel like I'm losing drive to leave, I don't know what is the way to do this. I need to find a place and just go with it.

I’ve lost a lot of friends due to personal choice.
I’m single after recently having a break up... I was with him last year and I had a really nice birthday. The day was quite serious because I broke some news to my family which all went tits up.

I can feel the tension from last year when I was yelled at by family for using my birthday as an excuse to break a certain piece of news.

So anyway... I don’t care for my birthday. I never really have. I enjoyed being with my ex at the time but I don’t tend to care for birthdays. My family make a big deal out of it and think I’m depressed. They don’t like going out to eat so that makes it harder. They love cooking and are offended I haven’t asked for my favourite dishes to be cooked. I know I sound ungrateful but I just feel a little off this year.

I’ve gained a lot of weight
Feel like I’m a bit lost right now with my future life plans so my birthday is the last thing I could care for. If anything it’s not great knowing I’m getting older and life feels so uncertain.",10Dec2020,1

It says that I realllllly need a therapist, which... Is impossible.


You see, I’m 14! I’m still by law a child! I’ve been recommended therapy before, and my parents freaked the hell out (look at a previous post of mine), and for a couple of months after that recommendation my parents mocked me and therapy.



You might say online therapy, but that’s out of the question. My phone is connected to my moms, so it has her credit information, so if I do something, she’ll know. I don’t have a credit/debit card either since it’s illegal in my state to get one at my age.



I have absolutely no one to talk to. I’m in a VERY Christian family, and it touches all parts of my life. Everyone I talk to just says “GOD IS USING THIS TO MAKE YOU STRONGER,” or, “PRAY AND JESUS WILL TAKE IT ALLLLLLLL AWAY!!!”

For instance this one time I wore my glasses for seeing better (i’m near sighted) and he told me to stop using them because they looked ugly. I’ve always tried to ignore these types of comments especially coming from him since he doesn’t know anything about this generation of what people like and dislike, but of course he always has something to say about how I look bad.

I am a very empathetic and sensitive person, so I don’t really know how to handle his behavior. He used to volunteer at a children’s hospital with kids who had cancer, and the other day he told me that he felt nothing when he saw the parents crying or when a kid died. I obviously thought this was a super messed up thing to say. He even went to go so far as to say that he didn’t even feel sorry for them.

“Mia carissima Annabelle, 

Se vi capita di trovarlo, voglio benedirvi per sempre. Non posso darvi questo quando sono vivo. Quella stronza di tua madre se lo prenderá. Sei stata la cosa più grande che sia mai uscita da lei. Prendi questo e conducete una vita prospera. Ti amo.

Okay so during lockdown in the UK, I was at uni staying in my flat with my 4 other flatmates. 

This one girl, we’ll call her Amy, has been continuously breaking lockdown to meet at least 4 different friends (all from different households) and seeing her boyfriend all the time and bringing him back to our flat without asking. 

Obviously, she was breaking the law at that point but I didn’t feel it was necessary to report her to the police since none of us were seeing high-risk people or even going to campus at that point. However, me and my boyfriend (who is also my flatmate) have been sticking to the rules and not seeing anyone regardless, and mostly avoiding her just in case. 

A couple days before lockdown ends we decide to finally sit down with our flatmates in the kitchen and have a drink, before we have to start isolating before we go home (explained later). Amy joins us a little later since she was busy earlier. The next day, she walks in while I’m in the kitchen and informs me that she found out yesterday morning that she had scabies (which she caught from her bf’s house which she shouldn’t have been going to in the first place) and that she treated it yesterday, but is only telling us today. That explained why she was doing laundry non stop all day (and she continued to do about 5 loads back to back over 3 days not letting us wash our stuff.) I admit I was pissed and asked her why she didn’t tell us earlier, especially since she saw us and decided to sit down in close contact with us. I told her to message the groupchat we have to let all of us know which treatment to get. We each ended up paying £20 (~25$) for the treatment and had to wash absolutely everything we owned. On the groupchat, she lied to the others and said she only found out a few hours ago rather than a whole day and a half ago, then she kept apologising unprovoked and said she’d never do it again she’d be careful etc. (In hindsight, I regret not calling out her lie)

Now, the first day post-lockdown, my bf briefly goes into the kitchen around 9pm and comes back to my room and to my surprise he says the other 3 flatmates are having a party along with Amy’s bf, and two other friends from a different house. At this point, it’s less than a week (3 days, to be exact) till we all go home. Both my dad, and my bf’s dad, are both high-risk (due COPD and immunosuppressants). We had no idea they were having a gathering and so had not been warned to avoid our own kitchen and wear masks when we do go. They know from previous experience that both me and my bf self-isolate for a week before seeing family by wearing masks around them and socially distancing, cooking at different times and eating in our rooms etc. I’m now completely furious that literally 2 days ago Amy promised us she’d be more careful etc. and now she’s organised a gathering behind our back, and I’m annoyed that the other two flatmates agreed considering one of them also has a high-risk parent and can empathise with our mindset. So my bf decided to report it and I was next to him trying to sleep, since they’re breaking the law, could get us into trouble, and worst of all could be the reason that our families get seriously ill or even die, God forbid. At first I angrily suggested we should report them but I said oh I’m not actually going to, but he did. A policewoman called us the next day saying she would keep it anon and just come to our house and talk to all of us as a warning. She never did. 

A week later when we’ve all moved back home after testing negative (except Amy who is still there), we get an email saying the police have sent our landlord a report and that we may have been issued fines (£100). If they find out we’re behind it (e.g. if they all get letters and see that we don’t)they’d be furious, as well as our whole friendship group of around 10 other people. Now I’m scared they’ll find out and worried that I overreacted. 

Since we got the email we’ve been talking on the groupchat and they seem to think it must have been a mistake, and one of them is suggesting to email them back and pretend that the people from the other households weren’t there, even though they were. We discouraged him because the only thing that could do is lead to an appeal and if the courts find out he’s lying he could get a bigger fine and a criminal record, and possibly drag us down along with him.

So I’ve come out of a long term relationship (3 years) and I’ve got no idea what to do with myself now that I’m out of the relationship.

I’ve been going to the gym as often as I can to act as a distraction and to feel something (cringe lol) but other than that i do nothing with the time that I’ve got. I’m unemployed due to covid and am not in the right state of mind to job hunt, I game with my buddies most evenings for a couple of hours but i no longer enjoy gaming by myself. I game with them as it’s nice to have the company. 

I’m personally not the type of person who likes the idea of casual dating and hook ups and all that stuff, that’s never appealed to me and I guess I’m quite traditional as I date for the long term stuff I guess. I was hoping that would’ve been the case with my ex however due to some things I did early on in our relationship due to my age and immaturity it made the rest of a relationship difficult as there was always an element of distrust there. That mixed with mental illness meant the relationship was kinda fucked from the get go.

I’ve been battling with my own mental shortcomings (not gonna self diagnose myself with anything, although I’ve got an appointment in the new year to hopefully help me find out and start working on my own mental well-being) and that’s really taken a toll on me. I spend most of my day in bed watch Star Wars The Clone Wars as star wars is like my comfort I guess. I then hit the gym for maybe 2 hours max, i then nap, then eat, then game with my friends for a couple of hours in the evening then go back to bed and stay up till stupid o’clock in the morning and start again the next day.

I’ve got no idea what to do with myself and it’s driving me crazy, I thought the gym would help (and it has to a degree) but it’s not enough to make me feel any better. Im one of those types of people who thrives being in a relationship I guess. Like I can be single but I don’t wanna be (like most people lol) and as i said I don’t like the idea of casual dating etc, it never made sense to me. And due to covid it’s made meeting people that much more difficult than it already is, plus I’m not even ready to move on from my ex yet, I wish I could but I’m not. 

So what should I do? Because I’m so aimless and lost right now and this lack of direction is destroying what’s left of my mental health.",10Dec2020,1

But then a week later she fell back into the same habits and frankly she told me about what she said in her therapy session with her therapist, and what she told her therapist was like just a weird conjunction of random shit about the way she acts and feels which are not really true considering what I’ve seen and heard from her over the last couple of months. I told her bluntly there’s no point of going to a therapist if you’re just gonna sit there and bullshit your therapist and not be honest with them or yourself. I know this because I went to therapy for years and it’s hard to really get out of the victim mindset and actually look at where you’re going wrong in order to accept change. 

She reminds me a lot of myself before I had to force myself into deep introspection about why I wasn’t happy with my life and all my relationships are failing. I really care about Lex a lot as a friend but sometimes it just gets exhausting being friends with her and I don’t see the point of half assed friendships at all. Would I be an asshole if I stopped being friends with her?",10Dec2020,1

61,"So I (21f) was recently referred to my Universities Student Judicial Affairs office for plagiarism by my professor. 
The assignment was open note, therefore understood that we can use information from his lectures to complete the assignment. The rules were to use your own words.

But somehow to use your own words to explain chemical pathways in the body... which I tried my best to do but a lot of the information is simply difficult to say any other way than one. 

He claims that I plagiarized by using my notes from his class to answer our assignment. Which is what he told us to do. And I did put it in my own words. So now I'm not quite sure what to do because I followed the directions and I used my own notes to answer the questions, and yet this is somehow plagiarism?

62,"Hi! I’m a senior right now set to graduate in May 2021 with a major in international political economy. I have one real internship which I’m doing not as a financial analyst intern at a small cpa firm while still working as a work study office assist which I did for most of my undergraduate career. I have a 3.52 gpa and I did a learning program on data analytics consulting in kpmg. Lately, I have been feeling very grim about the future. I’ve been constantly thinking back on what I should have done or what I should do now. I didn’t know what career I want to pursue and I don’t know if I will be able to even land one. I’ve been thinking of the what if’s like what if I was a cs major or in pre med then I wouldn’t need to worry. Delusional, yes, but also very all consuming. Anyways, I don’t know if the internship will shift to a longer term period since it’s so small.

At this point, I’m acting as though they won’t because that would allow me to prepare for the what if but I feel like I’m not qualified for anything and that I won’t be able to land anything after college. I live in NY and I attend a pretty good school in the city. I plan to stay with parents for a few more years but I don’t want to an unemployed leech to my parents.

68,"This is a long story and I don’t know where to start so I’ll start from the beginning. 

I have two dogs. A small chihuahua/Maltese (Gizmo)mix and a German shepherd (Luna). When COVID hit I lost my job as a chef and moved home to my parents with both of my dogs. Flash forward six months and I still haven’t been able to find a job and have never been so unproductive in my life. But living at home made it easier since all my siblings have moved out and my parents have a big back yard for Luna. 

One week one of my sisters comes home with her boyfriend. They are from another city 4 hours away and have two huskies of their own and the huskies love Luna but hate gizmo. The boyfriend asks me to come hang out for a week or two so I can get away and stop loving like a hermit and I agree.

Me thinking that it would be a short trip decide it would be fun to bring Luna along and leave gizmo at home with my mom since he is easier to take care of and the huskies keep picking on him. 

I should note that this sister is the most bipolar and angry sister of all the ones I have but her boyfriend and I are really close. 

One day while we were at the house playing games, she barges into my room and starts telling me to go do something with myself and to go find a job and belittling me. What she doesn’t understand is that it’s hard for me to find a job in my field since COVID the restaurant industry hasn’t been great. She doesn’t know how many applications I’ve filled out and still nobody is hiring. I’m at that point where I’m just over qualified or under qualified for any position I apply for. 

She doesn’t have a job. Her boyfriend takes care of all of her bills and credit cards so she has nothing to do but tell other people how to live their lives. This was supposed to be a get away for me to get some fresh air and now she’s throwing all this stuff at me. 

So we get into and argument and she somehow tells my brother who has a contracting business(handyman, builder, housework) to tell me to go work with him. At this point I’m over it and agree to work with him. I decide that I’d rather stay at his house with his wife since it would be less toxic but the thing is that he is allergic to dogs and has two little boys so my sister and her boyfriend would have to watch her until I could actually get my own place for Luna and myself. 

I was not planning on moving back here and now I’m trying to figure out what to do about getting a living space and how to deal with work that I’ve never dealt with before. From going to the main guy to the little guy and having a bitchy sister in my ear all the time and a bossy brother telling to go grab this and that. I feel that life hit me really hard this past year and my dogs were the only ones I had to carry me through. Gizmo is being taken well care of by my mom and it works out great because he keeps her company while my dad is out of town on his work trips. But Luna on the other hand is a lot to deal with since she is young and energetic and she loves to play when she’s around other dogs. Sometimes it becomes hard for my sister to deal with her and she takes it out on other people like me and her boyfriend. 

I currently started doing something in my original line of work and can see it becoming something bigger in the future but it will take some time. My brothers business also keeps me really busy and I have to go out of town on work trips a lot. This keeps me from being able to see Luna as much as I should since she lives 40 minutes away and it pisses my sister off that I don’t put in the effort to try and visit. But she doesn’t understand the position that she put me in by basically forcing me to leave to go work and live with my brother. I’m literally cancelling and turning down events that I could do as a chef to make it on work trips and to help my brother out. And it stresses me out because this isn’t what I want to do and I feel stuck. 

So she finally texted me today and asked me if I was willing to let someone adopt Luna. This person also has German shepherds. I don’t know what exactly I should do. I don’t have a home for her yet. I’m still trying to figure out my life at this point. I honestly didn’t see myself being in this position because I was only supposed to come hang out so I could getaway and be around people for a few weeks.  But here I am getting hit with life and now I need to figure out what would be best for myself and Luna. 

It hurts me to even think about it and even tears are coming down as a write this but maybe at this point in my life I think it would be best for me to give Luna to someone that could take care of her since I can’t do it right now. I have no argument as to what I could do with her if I said no. Maybe move back to my parents? But I have so much committed here now that I don’t think I could move home as it would be a step back for me. Can someone please just tell me what I should do? I really don’t want to lose my dog but I feel like I have no choice.",10Dec2020,1
69,"Hey y’all,

TLDR at bottom. 

— The answer above would ordinarily be a “yes, duh,” but there’s a bit more to it.

My family is the host family for Christmas this year on my dad’s side. We do a Secret Santa every year (for the adults, for the older cousins, and for the younger cousins), and I’ve joined every year with the older ones. My older brother is organizing the secret Santa assignments. 

This year, I opted not to join. They, my cousins, have gone out to clubs and to hang without inviting me. They have a group chat without me in it and have even talked about things in it and mentioned its existence in front of me. I’ve felt and been left out for years now, not being much for the club or soccer or drinking and other interests of theirs, but this year was especially tough, as it was for many of us.

I submitted my RSVP as “no”, still excited to spend Christmas with them but not participate in the exchange. My brother organized the exchange as I was out of town, and since he had an odd number that left someone without a Santa, he included me in it without telling me and sent everyone their assignments. He figured as part of the host family and someone who has joined yearly, it would be easy.

I got back home, and he took the time to tell me in person that he had included me anyway, asking, “What do you think? Do you want to be in it?” He was unusually respectful and thoughtful in telling me. He’s never one to say “I need a favor” or say please, and he didn’t this time either, but he got about as close to it as possible. Ordinarily, he’d just tell me what he did and get mad if I resisted, saying, “It’s just $35 man,” but he didn’t. 

I still told him no, and he then asked if I’d reconsider after telling me whom I was going to give a gift to. He then said one of my closest cousins was my assignment. I told him I’d think about it, saying it’d be an inconvenience. He asked if $35, the minimum, was a lot, and I replied that it was simply an inconvenience. 

Now, I don’t know what to do.

On one hand, I stick to my decision. I did not want to join the exchange, did not want to spend a minimum of $35 since I have other expenses coming up, did not want to participate to show some sort of discontentment and sadness with my family, and should not have been included without my consent. While he’s clearly asking for a favor, he didn’t phrase it that way and did not offer to help buy the gift. I feel as though I’m paying for his mistake cause of social pressure. 

On the other, he has to redo the exchange and perhaps make new assignments. Any time I ask him to “be respectful” and “ask nicely” in the future, I anticipate he’ll say, “Well I did this one time and you said no, so what’s the point?”. And I sour the relationship some, shooting him down when he either mustered the courage or will to actually engage in something respectfully and thoughtfully. 

What do I do?

TLDR: Didn’t join a family gift exchange because they left me out of things the entire year. Brother organized it and included me in it anyway because someone didn’t have an assignment. He told me he put me in it when I got home from out of town and asked if I was okay staying in it, being unusually friendly and thoughtful. Now I’m not sure what to tell him.",10Dec2020,1

But here's the deal, I'm currently upset with my GF bc I have reach a point where it's become difficult for me to feel loved by her. We have been together for 4 months. And up until a few weeks ago things were fine. she would call me a few times a day to check in, she would text me here and there just to talk. She would flirt. She would get upset if I couldn't come see her. Basically all the things that would make a bf feel special and wanted...

However, over the past few weeks, things have been different. She doesn't really text me unless I text her first. She doesn't call me unless I call first. She doesn't flirt at all anymore. She hasn't wanted to be Sexual (she said it was bc I was sick, but I'm not sick anymore and she's still made no effort to even talk sexual to me). She even told me to stop talking dirty to her. But in the past she's said ""I love you being dirty"". But now ""it's a turn off"". Which brings me to today. I called her to communicate how I feel with her and she said that nothing was wrong, that me and her were fine and that I'm over thinking it. And I got off the phone thinking ""maybe I am over thinking it"" bc it's only been like 2 weeks of her acting different. Maybe it's a phase or maybe it not a big deal... idk 🤷‍♂️. But then, a few hours later I told her I wanted to come see her (I've only seen her like 2 days in the last 2ish weeks and we usually hang out like 4-5 times a week).And she said she had a rough day and just wanted to smoke a little by her self and then go to sleep. Ok cool. I can understand that. But then, she ends up going down the road to hangout with her friend and smoke with her. So when I asked how come she said she didn't want company and then went to hangout with someone else.

""Am I supposed to deny my friend the invite bc I just told my boyfriend I wasn't in the mood to hangout?""

Which makes me wonder, why is denying her bf's invite fine, but denying her friends invite an issue?... I guess it's the inconsistency of her statements that bother me.

Her reasoning was that her friend has a warm car and smokes with her. I don't smoke with her bc I don't smoke. But I do allow her to smoke in my car and I keep the car warm for her too with the windows cracked. So basically the same set up, minus me smoking with her. So I don't understand the difference.

85,"Hello kind people of Reddit,

My partner and I have a serious problem on our hands and need to find a resource or a way forward from her mother's hoarding behavior, as it is now negatively affecting our quality of life and our mental health.

Contextual info: My girlfriend and I are college-age and have been dating for more than a year now. I was fortunate enough to get out of our college town and quarantine with her and her family (mom + younger brother) in their home when the pandemic started. However, I noticed small things like a lot of excess piles of stuff and a dismal fridge situation even early on in our relationship when we'd go visit (this is important later on).

My girlfriend's father passed away about 4 years ago, and as you can imagine, this devastated their family and they've all had to find different ways to cope. My girlfriend recently started antidepressants and in the process of getting a therapist for depression and anxiety exacerbated by the situation we are in. At this point, I think it'd be helpful to mention that she is Asian and her mom doesn't really believe in the idea of ""mental health"" and has ridiculed her in the past for seeking help.

It feels like ever since the pandemic started her mom has gradually turned one pile into two, and a fridge full of moldy, expired food into multiple fridges with the same problem – no, seriously, she just bought a THIRD freezer that they now have to keep in their dining room because they have ""no space.""

I only realized this was a serious problem when my girlfriend and I tried to clean out an old pantry over summer. A lot of her dad's and grandma's (also passed away) old luggage was there – stuff they haven't seen in close to 10 years. Throwing out anything even REMOTELY related to her father or grandma feels like an unspoken taboo. After we dug through old snacks and dried goods to get the luggage out, her mom came down to yell at her and made us put all of the luggage back. When my girlfriend tried to talk some sense into her, she was met with silence, the ""sentimental value"" argument, and a few probably not-so-friendly comments in Chinese that I didn't understand.

Her mom refuses to acknowledge what is clearly a huge quality of life issue, and we are at a loss for what to do. She even told her housekeeper (who also sees this as a problem) that my girlfriend ""just throws out everything,"" which from an outside perspective, I promise is not the case. We both are still in school with few job prospects in an extremely HCOL area, so moving out at the moment isn't really an option. We want her mom to be able to move on from losses in the past in a healthy way, but live a dignified life at present, not buried under old crap.",10Dec2020,1

I work in an office building. Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, I've been really consistent with wearing a mask and staying away from others. M6 coworkers have given me a hard time; most are anti vaxxers and COVID deniers.

On Monday, one of my managers said he hadn't been feeling well. He was easily winded, had a bad headache, and in general wasn't feeling too good. He said he had a negative covid-19 test over the weekend. 

Tuesday, he seemed better, but today, he was coughing A LOT. Like A LOT a lot. Uncontrollably. He also was too winded to get up and walk a few steps down the hall to clock in. 

I was wearing a face shield and a mask the whole time, but he did not have any face covering on while he was coughing, despite it being a mandate here. He said he hasn't been feeling well for nearly a week, but still came to work anyway. 

Here's my issue: IDK who to go to about this, because his boss is the BIG boss, who also doesn't care about the virus. He's the type that thinks the left invented the virus to make the president look bad. He also has ties to the local health department... ties that could prove to be an issue if I reported my concerns. There is no HR. They'd know it was me regardless, as I am the only person who works there who is vocal about following virus protocol. I also don't have the option to work from home.

90,"As the title says, she’s never taken me on a trip yet always asks her other friends if they want to join her on her trip to Disney land/Florida/other places around the country. She had always taken trips all throughout middle school and highschool, and those were the times where her and I were extremely close. 

Our relationship has been “strained” since we went to college because we haven’t been able to see each other as often. But I’ve always wondered why she’s never asked me - one of her closest friends?

97,"Here's my story: After high school my band signed to Warner Brothers records and toured for 4-5 years. Never made any decent money, had a fun early 20's and grew a lot as a person. Traveled after that and worked in Colorado on ski lifts, moved to California and worked in the marijuana industry, moved back to my home state.

I took a job at a medical clinic through a family friend and quickly grew my skills to learn all about the business and got promoted to assistant manager - 3 years later manager - and now I am 30 and I really love business. Through this job I have learned sales, accounting, management, hiring, firing, budgeting/cashflow, marketing (many successful digital marketing campaigns), working on the server to fix all tech issues, medical billing, collections...so much random stuff. I feel I've capped out in learning and pay...and I have no degree.

I have a couple side hustles: I have a FAA UAV license that I utilize for a small side hustle flying drones for real estate and construction companies. Also building websites for some clients and I taught myself to build native Android apps coding in Java/Kotlin. After looking for a programming job in that field for over a year I decided to take a break. Tech is flooded with ""entry level"" developers and I am not getting younger.

Ultimately I have no idea what I really want to do. I want to run a successful business or take a position doing SOMETHING that has potential to make excellent money. I thought about software sales, but I really need a degree to get in without B2B experience, so I've thought about getting my bachelor's to check the ""degree box"".

I really don’t know what to do. I can’t sleep and it seems like she’s ok with it but she has to more or less swallow her emotions to avoid facing them head on in order to do her work and deal with everything else or she’ll spiral mentally.

102,"So my boyfriend and I have known eachother since november 2018, starting dating august 2019. Due to his alcohol issues, we were on and off. It got bad around March 2020 and I left him very seriously. Moved out and took one of our cats. After that breakup, one of my managers at work and I started flirting. Hard. (same age as me, we'd been working the same shift since I started basically but never really talk to eachother. I was really awkward around him until I'd broken up with my partner). We exchanged numbers and started talking outside of work. Now at my job, managers are not allowed to be in relationships with crew. We agreed we were gonna be casual, that's that. I had a few issues with this entire relationship. Not personally, but people started spreading rumors. A few of my friends weren't too happy that this was the guy I chose to sleep around with. But he did nothing bad to me. He would bring me to his drug guy, buy me weed and was my rock  the first time I did snow and shrooms. We'd drink together and release tension after a long night of work. Sometimes I'd just go to his place to chill and play video games. We'd make food together every now and then. He always let me take his taxi home with him. And jeez. When I was with him it was about me. It felt so good being treated. All he wanted to do was make sure I felt good. The 3 months we had together were awesome. 
Then I moved to an hour and a half away to try to get my life sorted.... and I got back together with my ex since hed been sober and doing well. I got my car running, and I hadn't spoken to my manager in over 2 months.
Hed found out I got back together with my bf, ended up blocking me on snap. 

This is where my issue comes in... I've moved back with my bf. I'm working at my old job... with my manager. And I cant stop thinking about him. I love my boyfriend. I keep going back to him for a reason. I love him dearly and want to go the distance with him.... but his mental health, the things we've done to eachother is the past, how I'm constantly taking care of him... it wears on me. The fights he starts are silly and non stop. I just... I keep getting into this relationship hoping for something to change but... it never does. I go in believing it's not going to last how I want. Hes a narcissist and I'm stuck. 

And I cant goddamn stop thinking about my manager. How he made me feel even just in a casual relationship. Obviously I don't want to leave my partner just for a casual relationship. But feck I miss my nights with my manager. And now we work nights alone together. Our shifts could be so much fun. And I cant help but think he wants it back to. He started parking his car right my mine (he used to park about a 2 minute walk away from where I'm parked). Hes civil and sweet to me at work, making sure I'm not being fucked over. I'm probably thinking way too far into it but. Jeez. 

I'm a horrible person. I know. I'm not going to cheat. That's not what I'm about. But I hate that I have these feelings. And i dont know what to do about them. I need advice bad. I cant just leave my bf. I have nowhere to go If I do. I pay so much in car insurance that I couldnt even think about affording rent on my own somewhere. And my bf would have nothing if I left. I take care of him so much. I dont know what to do....",10Dec2020,1
103,"My boyfriend, best friend, and I all live in an apartment together. We’re all students, and my friends parents pay her rent, my boyfriends parents pay his rent, and my parents pay half of mine. My boyfriends parents are the wealthiest (by far). There are 4 rooms in the apartment, one of which we’ve turned into a living room. I sleep in my boyfriends room, and having a bed that fits the two of us in there has meant that he can’t fit a desk in there, so he has his desk in the living room. I have the worst room out of all of us, but it made the most sense since I don’t have a bed in my room and it’s not drastically different. My friend has a bed and desk in her room. In our lease, we all agreed to split rent equally. 

Today my friend told me that she was thinking of asking my boyfriend to pay more rent because having his desk in the living room and doing his classes from there meant he had two rooms, but I feel bad because I know that I honestly benefit the most from this living situation (I spend most of my time on the couch in the living room rather than in my room anyway). But I’m also the only one of us who works part-time to pay for my half of my rent and other living expenses like groceries etc, and I really don’t have the money to start paying more. I feel like logically I should be the one paying more, but I can’t afford it and now don’t know what the best thing to do is. They also don’t communicate much between the two of them so I feel like I need to act like some sort of mediator in any case. Thanks!!",10Dec2020,1

105,"A few months ago, I got a root canal. My regular (chain retail shit corporation) dentist (office #1) referred me to another one of their offices (#2) for the root canal.
  
I paid everything in full the day of the procedure.
  
A couple months later, I checked my Explanation of Benefits and it appeared that office #1 owed me $600, and I owed office #2 $70. I called and spoke with office #1, who said that in fact, I owed them about $300. I paid it immediately. I was told we were squared up.
  
Two weeks ago, I got a call from office #1 asking if I received a check. I said no, I thought we were squared up. They told me that's correct, and the check was issued in error and that it had been cancelled. Shred it if I get it. Fine.

Today, I just got a fucking bill from office #2 saying I owe them $600. And a check from office #1 for $70.
  
First, what the fuck? I paid, I was told we were squared up. Now, months later, I received a huge bill. I've always paid my bills, my credit score is exceptional. But this is bullshit. What are my options? Ignore it? Pay it? Dispute it?

108,"I have never taken an illegal drug in my life. I was abusing caffeine for about 5 years (16-21) but I quit as soon as I realized it was an issue. I've been offered drugs several times and I have lived with a drug dealer. I don't take drugs.

I have a history of depression since I was 8. I went to therapy, but out of 21 therapists, what helped me the most was meditation. Being aware of my thoughts helped me more than any person ever did, and I still have a therapist of 2 years.

I found out you could buy psychadelic mushroom spores online, pretty cheaply, and grow them yourself fairly easily. I'm pretty low on cash and a fan of H3H3 (if you don't know, theyre a youtube channel, when they were broke they got out of the hole by selling weed).

My plan was to buy mushrooms, grow them, and when they stopped growing, take some of the last batch. I've always thought about psychadelics, and I figure I'm fairly good with drugs, so I could handle one dose of this.

The spores haven't even arrived at my house yet, and my supportive girlfriend of 7 years has jsut revealed to me today (after I bought everything) that she has two friends who's boyfriends of 2 months broke up with them after tripping. I found this completely irrelevant, but she's adamant that I'll do the same, or at least I'm risking a similar situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally believe that I can handle them because she will be with me when I trip and I plan on taking them 3 total times, once at a very low dose, once again at a half, and finally a dose high enough to trip on. I'd do this over the course of 6 months. I see absolutely nothing risky in this, but she swears I'm underestimating it. I know myself well enough to say that I'll never abuse drugs, no matter how good they are, but she just can't bring herself to believe me. What do I do? I really want to take them one time, and if I'm giving them to people I want to know that they work. Also I'm just extremely curious about how they will affect me.",10Dec2020,1
110,"I have a relative who I'll just call Sasha. I know this year has been hard on everyone but Sasha has made it even worse. There's too many things to list. A big thing though is Sasha ruining the holidays and most recently my birthday. I usually look forward to the holidays as a sense of relief and like a break. Another thing is Sasha is constantly ruining my day. Imagine having a really good day or at least a decent day then someone reminds you that your dog died this year. They also shove it on your face on top of it . Sasha also lies like she breathes and I've had more than enough of that. I've actually been depressed for awhile because of her and asked for relatives and friends not to wish me a happy birthday, it didn't feel right. Everyone did as I asked except for Sasha and her sister, I'm surprised her sister actually did because she's usually the person who would listen.

Everyone knows the holidays are coming up and I've been dreading it. I've been trying to go low contact, hopefully no contact, with Sasha and it's been hard because she enjoys inserting herself into a lot of things. I know it's going to get worse because everyone is probably going to be in a Zoom, or something like that, call together and I'd rather just not have anything to do with Sasha period.

112,"Hi All,

So basically I've ended up on Reddit because I want to get a non-biased opinion on my situation rather than just getting biased opinions from my friends who haven't really liked my now ex girlfriend for a while and were extremely in favor of me breaking up with her, and are now also now overwhelmingly in favor of me standing by my decision. I will also add that my older cousin (24M), who although is my cousin is basically an older brother to me and is now married, is also in favor of me standing by my decision to break up with her. Anyways, I'll start from the beginning.

My now ex girlfriend and I met back in June and talked for exactly a month before we started officially dating in July. Although being my first legitimate relationship and her third legitimate relationship, our connection was amazing and we were truly in love, which I've heard is hard to find nowadays. She was the first girl that I could truly be myself around and was the first girl to actually love me for who I was without judging me. She understood me, knew me better than anyone and understood how I think, and was always there to comfort me without judgment. When I say this girl loved me, I mean she called me her soulmate and was truly in love with me in a ride or die type of way. And I'm pretty sure I felt the same way about her as she did for me for about the first 3-4 months of our relationship, and if not as much in love with her as she was with me, pretty darn close. When I first met her, she was independent, caring, and seemed to be secure with herself. She kept a close circle of friends which was a huge plus for me because I only have a few friends that I don't hang out with very much, mostly just because I'm very independent as well. She had a very steady high paying job and was very focused on getting good grades in order to go to medical school, which I found very attractive because I also am very focused on working hard to achieve my goals as I'm in the music industry ( I believe my job being in the music industry plays a big part in the rest of our relationship, which I will get into later).

She seemed like the perfect match; driven, valued her ambitions and hard work over a social life, loving and caring towards me, supportive of my career, and always available for me and prioritized me over everything else. The first 3 months of our relationship was amazing and I had never felt happier in my entire life. She lost her job around two months into us dating and due to COVID forbidding in person school, was left sitting at home with basically nothing to do. This directed all of her attention and entertainment towards me, which I actually loved at first. We hung out essentially every single day for 4 months, and hated going a day without seeing each other. Being in the music industry I regularly have to take business trips to Los Angeles, and since she didn't have a job that she was committed to, I began taking her with me. I believe she began to fall in love with the lifestyle of the music industry and started trying to live that lifestyle for herself through me. The fancy cars, studio sessions with famous rappers that were basically parties, traveling, and living the fast life were all things that I think she began to value. Being in the music industry, I do tend to have a little extra money to spend and took her on little weekend getaways to nice hotels and restaurants regularly, which provided great memories and fun for both of us. When I say it felt like I was living the dream being able to do all of these things with a girl I was in love with at 17, I really mean it. I will say that even though I introduced her to this lifestyle, she was NEVER a ""goldigger"" as I never spoiled her with fancy expensive gifts.

After these first 3-4 months went by, it seemed like she began to change and wasn't the same independent, ambitious girl that I had fallen in love with. She became extremely dependent on me for basically everything; attention, entertainment, validation, along with me having to pay for literally everything since she didn't have a job. It seemed as though she began to start living her life through me and for me instead of living her own life. Since we're both seniors in high school, we began to start applying to colleges and she talked about wanting to follow me to college in LA since that's where I need to be for my job in the music industry, while also saying she didn't want to go to medical school anymore because she wanted to focus on me to eventually get married. Although unsure, I went along with it. Then, for about a month (starting at 3 and a half months and ending at about 4 and a half months), the fighting began. Not legitimate fights about serious things, just stupid, pointless, fights where she was ALWAYS the one starting them. These would happen if not every other day, every few days and began to take an emotional tole on me because I never knew what to do as I was actually never in the wrong. The roots of the fights I believe derived from her needing validation, being bored, dramatic, selfish, and insecure, and were actually usually left with her taking ownership of the fact that she was in the wrong for starting them. The fights seemed to start outweighing the good due to their frequency and stupidity, and I could say that they would've been a reason to break up with her on their own. She began becoming manipulative and started fights when something didn't go her way, while also guilting me to make me feel bad. She was cheated on by her last boyfriend, which led to her having severe trust issues when she had absolutely no reason not to trust me (even though I'm constantly surrounded by other girls due to rappers bringing groupies to studio sessions, I was the most loyal boyfriend ever and didn't even speak to other girls, which she knew). She became super clingy as well, to the point where I literally couldn't even hang out with my friends or play Xbox with them once a month without her throwing a fit or thinking I didn't love her.

I tried so hard to work through these bumps in our relationship, I really did. Throughout that month's phase of fighting, she said she would stop starting the fights multiple times but never did until I eventually put my foot down when I went on my most recent trip to Los Angeles. The reason for this trip was because I had gotten the biggest opportunity to achieve my dreams in the music industry that I've ever gotten, and because the artist I would be working with was so high profile, it was the first time I had to go by myself since we had started dating. Since the nature of studio sessions in the music industry are extremely long hours at night (typically 12 hours at a time, starting at 5pm and ending at 5am) I wasn't able to give her the attention that she was used to. She made it about her, and said something along the lines of ""It would just be nice if you put in the same amount of effort into our relationship as me"". I had enough, and a huge fight broke out which again almost led to us breaking up, but we pulled through and decided to take a break from talking for the rest of my trip. Surprisingly, for the two weeks that followed this fight before we broke up, the fighting actually stopped. While I was in LA by myself, it opened my eyes. I began thinking to myself, ""Do I really want to be tied down and commit to a girl like her at 17? I'm going to be chasing my dreams more than ever, meeting so many new people, experiencing so many new things, do I really want to have to worry about a serious relationship right now with a girl that has all of these negative traits, that I'm not even sure if truly love anymore, when I could meet someone better in LA?"". I spent a week thinking about these things after I got back home from Los Angeles, and eventually decided to break up with her.

A few days after we broke up, I got a DM from a girl on Instagram calling me cute and asking for my snapchat, so I figured why not, I'm single now. The girl saw my now ex girlfriends comments on my posts, and direct messaged her to ask her if we were still dating. My ex exploded and accused me of cheating, posting a screenshot of the DM on her snapchat story accusing me of cheating, even though the DM happened multiple days after we broke. She started interrogating my friends for information relating to me cheating, and even went so far as to manipulating my music manager into giving her his number in order to call him and question him about what I was doing in Los Angeles without her (my manager manages very high profile artists and has much better things to do, so this was particularly embarrassing). If you've made it this far, thank you for reading lol. Basically I now miss her more than ever. I feel extremely lonely and the thought of her even talking to other guys sickens me. She loved me more than anything in the entire world, did I just take that for granted and throw it away? Maybe, through all of the flaws, I really did love her, and we could work things out. Should I try and get back with her, or stick to my decision and move on?

117,"Okay so this is a fairly long series of events

Anyway, my parents helped me pay for a house in Boston. I lost my job, times were tough, and I had to move to Seattle for work. I rented out my place for 6 months, being very uncertain about where the future was leading. 

Anyway, covid hits and work opens to remote. Seattle gets REALLY miserable. I want to leave my job and get a new one but I don’t want to take the risk of going anywhere, and I’m waiting for my bonus. My mom calls and says “were building a house in Boston, how about you stay at our place and we stay at yours?”  It sounded like a good deal to me and my gf. I assumed this would be mutually beneficial if we split my mortgage because their place is paid off and I would be maintaining it. They said they weren’t paying any mortgage. 

We move down there for a bit and things are fine. They arrive in Massachusetts and proceed to say my place is “disgusting” from the renters. I hire people to clean it. They say it’s unlivable, like a garbage place. They say they want to do renovations. They tell me I can pay them out when I sell the place, and it should be no more than 10k for only the most major things, like cabinets, appliances, etc. 

A month in they say “we really don’t have the money to keep doing this can you start paying us now?”  I say... sure... but now I’m getting uncomfortably tight on money during a pandemic. I’m also still paying for the mortgage on top of 2k a month in renovations. What’s more, the job announced they’re gonna return to the office effectively ASAP so I either gotta find a remote job now or move back

My parents start sending me pictures of the renovations and it’s severely pissing me off. They bought these stupidly lavish appliances, I said “why did you buy an expensive fridge? We didn’t need that!” And she says “oh you know, we just HAD to have French doors, just SO much better than your stupid fridge before”. They add a bunch of absolutely superfluous garbage I don’t need, like tiled back splashes, completely renovated bathrooms, new fireplaces, it’s just endless and they don’t even tell me, they just say “you’re gonna love it and want to move back here!”  They don’t seem to understand, despite me saying it time, time, and time again: I am never coming back. 

They later tell me... it was actually 25k and they want it out of my bonus that I’d be receiving. This would leave me almost no liquid assets to survive, basically less than 2 months rent. Not even enough to really reasonably get an apartment. For perspective, I was basically paying 3/4 of my monthly salary directly to them for this stuff. I was planning to buy a new car cause mine is barely functioning at 200k miles and is duct taped together. 

Then this is when it really hit: they said their own house is getting expensive so they would have to sell the house I’m living in, and they would be starting the process TWO DAYS FROM NOW. I felt absolutely taken aback. “What does this mean for me exactly...?”  They said I could just move. Now here’s the thing: I still don’t have a remote job. I have absolutely nowhere to go except back to Seattle which I now can’t afford anymore with the amount I seem to consistently have to pay them

They basically just shrugged and said “why not just live with us in Massachusetts?”  I have a girlfriend and my house in Massachusetts is tiny. I don’t want to live like that for 6 months of my life with absolutely no choice. My car also not even make it that drive, and I can’t live without a car, and I WOULDNT HAVE A JOB. It’s not what my gf wants either. I just don’t know what they expect from me but it literally seems like they’re saying I should be homeless. Whatever little value I have left is in my home and they’re living there for the next 6 months until their house is built.

My girlfriend got absolutely pissed and left to live with her mom, and honestly I don’t blame her, but damn... I feel absolutely lost. The stress of it all is making me sick to my stomach and absolutely miserable

121,"Hey guys

basically to keep it brief i have very severe social anxiety since i was little. Then around 2011/2012 i got depressed and withdrew from literally every one cut of all my friends and stopped being open with my family. This did a lot of damage but i was never able to be a happy care free person after. Now im in college and i dont have friends. I’ve made a couple of acquatances but i cant get past that stage with anyone because i feel so uncomfortable and such resistance. 

But when i think about it i dont even really want friends because its effort and i would have to be real with them and they prob wouldnt like me after that. Id rather have a bf for some reason but that also gives me anxiety because guys either move to fast for me or the vibe isnt there or i sabotage it with good guys.

123,"I am not looking for or expecting medical advice.

I'm a 23 year old college student.  


I have gone to my GP and they have referred me to a psychiatrist, I am awaiting an appointment.

They also took bloods, too to check thyroid levels.

I don't know where to go from here because I'm basically in limbo until I see the psychiatrist..

I don't know how my mood will be then and I don't know how it'll change in the mean time, nor do I know how to deal with my issues till then.  
I'm also in the process of making an appointment to see my college counsellor.  


I'd be quite surprised if I wasn't bipolar.. I'm not trying to self diagnose, I'd much rather be fine.. or for the issue to be a curable one at least.

There was a chain of events that basically lead up to the realisation of 'oh.. I really need professional help'.

I stayed up until 2 am trying to explain to my parents why I was going to drop out of college (again) and go start a construction business, or maybe I'd get work in construction first, maybe an apprenticeship, maybe a barbering apprenticeship and I could open a barber shop, create a brand selling hair products and build an empire.

I stayed up all night all week typing away on forums and Reddit about my new found plans, how life was shit but I could make something great of it, a truly noble pursuit.

I also caved in the top of my fathers guitar, the guitar I learned how to play on because I got annoyed..  
It's salvageable but still, it's not the same.

 Before that I was crying in my car on the way to work, thumping my hand off the steering wheel, I was sitting in my car for close to an hour before I built up the mental strength to go inside.

I have thrown away so much money.  
In the space of an hour I went from finding out what Palantir was to putting €400 into their stocks, it's gone up since then but it was a complete fluke.

I've bought a road bike for €600, €200 shoes and a solid €400 on other equipment, I used it a handful of times.

I have bought not 1 but two 'sports cars' (Mx-5s) at different times, which I sold not long after, but somehow for a profit.

I came within an inch of signing myself up for an Ironman (€400 sign up), I even started running.

I had this notion of taking on two college courses at once, 1 a regular business degree and the other one a part time course that I'd do on weekends.. That lasted 2 weeks and I lost €500 on it.

If I get back into playing golf, I'm aiming at the Irish open.  
Running? Marathon.  


Then I have periods of absolute wallow, I only get out of bed because my mother drags me out.  
When I was living away from home I managed to sleep in which made me late for work.. at 1pm.  


This has been consistent throughout my adolescence and early 20s..

Guess who no longer wants to talk to their parents, who feels embarrassed about standing in the kitchen roaring and shouting how if two plasterers from Galway could build one of the largest property development companies in Europe then so could I.. it's me.

This is also the first time I haven't lied in some part regarding my mental health.  
Thankfully she didn't ask about suicide ideation or anything of the sort.

I'm somewhat worried I might end up in a psych ward, maybe it's not even bipolar disorder, it's something else and they want to keep me under observation to figure it out.

Why am I worried?   
Because it's a real possibility.  
Also because I know a couple psych nurses who work in nearby psych wards and I don't entirely trust them to not tell others.

My doctor was great.. Looking back and reading online I can see all the questions she asked are all aimed at bipolar disorder, at the time I didn't see that and I felt a little frustrated because it felt like she was saying 'oh okay, well go to counselling and see if that helps the way you're feeling'.  
I mentioned how my parents thought it might be ADHD, she said no that 'you can have all those symptoms but it can be best explained by a different diagnosis', I then said 'I guess I'm just worried it might be something worse than that'.

She stopped me and asked if I was referring to Bipolar, i said yes but that I really didn't know so that's why I came here.

She said that that was playing in the back of her mind while listening to what I had to say and looking at my history (basically all my previous visits had been about irritation or possible depression). 

She then put me forward for a psychiatric eval..

I'm a little worried that if that is it, how will people react?  
I won't tell people but even my parents..  
I had a conversation about it with my mother (just talking about the disorder) she said 'oh no, you don't want that, that's really serious', the thing is if I have it there's no cure, it'd be as much a part of me as my left foot.  
I think she sees it that if you don't get diagnosed you don't have it.. the labels what makes it real in her head, even though it's labelling pre-existing symptoms.

I just told my parents that I was being referred, and that the doc suggested I speak to the college counsellor, I left out the querying Bipolar part.

I don't know what to do..

I don't know what's worse, it being bipolar disorder or it not being bp and then having no idea what's so evidently wrong with me..",10Dec2020,1

I did want to note that I post stuff on Instagram, and Instagram archives all of your posts and stories automatically. So everything I've posted on there, which is likely to be the more important stuff, is saved on Instagram. I will also be reaching out to friends, family, etc. to ask for photos they have with me.

134,"Hey guys! I just graduated this year with a Bachelors in Psychology and have been looking for jobs for the past 2 months. Most of my friends are going for full-time jobs, but I decided to look for internships in the field that I am interested in (clinical psych) as I am planning to migrate within the next year and may need to quit the job at any given point in time. Recently I was offered an internship at a clinic, however, the pay is hardly enough for me to survive on.

I guess most of the uncertainty came after talking to my friends. Most of them are going for better-paying paying jobs (e.g. associate psychologist roles) with the same type of clinical experience but these are full-time jobs.

I do feel upset as well - I am a graduate (top of my class, one that I worked hard for), but I would earn barely enough to survive a month (it hit me hard when a friend told me I was working for $2/h for the internship) while my other friends are looking for jobs that pay well and give them the same experience too.

I do still think this is probably the best I can do considering my situation, but I would like to know your thoughts on it. Are there any other better career options in my situation and if not - advice to just not feel like crap about the current job prospects would be great!

TW: Coming out story, gender dysphasia, self harm

Okay so some background: A few weeks ago, my sibling (15 y/o) and I (23 y/o) were having a venting session about our parents. I was complaining about how they were pressuring me to find a local job and stay at home, and my sibling was complaining about how our parents were being hypocritical with their parenting style and things like that. Just classic kid complaining about parent stuff. 

I was in a really vulnerable, bad headspace and ended up having a complete mental breakdown mid conversation, which ended in me telling them the terrible story about how I came out to my parents as bisexual (which was a bad experience overall that my parents have since ignored and repressed) and my coming out to my younger sibling as bisexual.  

My sibling then, knowing my sexuality and my experience with our parents, felt comfortable coming out to me as non-binary, and let me know that they use they/them pronouns. We both cried, we hugged and felt better knowing that the other knew a little more about the real us. They still wanted me to use their old she/her pronouns around our other family members who, minus our brother, would not have taken well their chosen pronouns.

It’s worth mentioning that 1) my parents are conservative, and offhandedly mock LGBT+ culture, 2) that I, in an attempt to cohabitate with my parents, do not vocalize my very liberal opinions at all, and 3) because I do not vocalize my opinions at all my younger sibling was convinced that I was conservative, homophobic and transphobic up until when I came out to them

Fast forward to now, Ive helped them cut their hair super short (fighting my parents on their behalf in the process), I’ve been listening to them about gender dysphasia, I’ve been educating myself, and I’ve been doing my best to use the right pronouns at the right time (depending on whether or not we are around other family members). However last week I took them to the store with me to get baking supplies for Christmas cookies and accidentally used the wrong pronouns. They didn’t say anything about it, but I caught myself and payed more attention to what I was saying. I felt bad, but figured that I’d use the correct pronouns at the next opportunity to show them that I’d caught my mistake. 

Since then, they’ve been ignoring me. When I talk to them they lash out, both verbally and physically on some occasions. They keep saying they’re done with my annoying bullshit, that I’m ignorant and that when they’re older and they leave the family they’re going to cut me out of their life. Our mother has noticed the uptick in our fighting and asked me about it. She’s really concerned about my sibling because the last time they lashed out like this they were self harming. My siblings gender identity is so off base of what she thinks the problem is it’s not even crossing her mind. I just kept saying that I didn’t know why they are lashing out (which is only partially true, considering that I am convinced it is because of my slow acclimation to their non binary identity, but I don’t know what else I’ve done besides that one incident at the store).

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to out my sibling to our family, but I know that getting things like a binder, using they/them pronouns regularly and their going to gender therapy would probably alleviate a lot of the angst/pain they’re experiencing—and I want to help them however I can, even if they slam their door in my face every time I try and talk to them. I also don’t know if they are self harming or not, they could be—but I don’t know and wouldn’t even know how to approach that situation. I want to show them that even though I’ve made mistakes and said things I that probably effected them deeper than I thought, that I still care and am still in their corner.

Now, I recognize that they are 15 and that there is a very real possibility that they just want to lash out because of teenage angst and things like that. I was an emotional wreck as a teenager and they’re no different. But I also recommend nice that there are a lot of valid, complex feeling they’re dealing with that may cause them to lash out. 

What do I do? Do I just hold out for one day when there’s been enough space between us that we can move past it? Do I address it head on in some big blowout? Do I buy them a binder and a they/them pronouns enamel pin for Christmas to show my quiet support?? I don’t know. And I can’t talk to any of my family about it because I don’t want to take away their own coming out moment, but no one else that I know would be open to having a conversation about LGBT+ youth.

How should I address their hostility? 

TLDR
My non-binary sibling (15) is only out to me (23) and their friends (no one else in my family knows). I accidentally misgendered them a few weeks ago and since then they’ve been lashing out at me. They’ve made it very clear they don’t want me to speak to them ever again, but I really care about them and want to show them that I’m an ally to them, even though I’m still learning. What do I do?",10Dec2020,1

It took everything I had to get clean the first time. This time I'm already exhausted and I've got nothing left in the tank. Beyond that, I've already used it as a crutch so much that can't even imagine the idea of getting clean again. I want to get clean, but I don't think I can.

151,"I will try to keep this as short as possible because I'm worried explaining all of it in full detail would draw people away from reading it all.  
I (19 F) have been friends with this guy (20 M) online for about 6 years now and as of recently, I've been having this sneaking suspicion that he has been spying on me through my devices. We had a period in time where we had feelings for each other, it was a point in time where I was very vulnerable and I trusted him deeply. That said, we exchanged pictures of ourselves that I fully regret. I recognized that at some point he stopped acting as a friend and only ever used me for pictures to get off to. I felt hurt and used, so I had cut him out. Many months go by of trying to get over it and move on with my life when he messages me one day out of the blue looking to rekindle our friendship as he has supposedly just lost his childhood ""best friend"" to a car crash. It was odd to me because this was the same girl he would complain to me about daily, calling her a whore and wishing how she would leave him alone. A slight red flag for me, but I mainly ignored it as I have gone through a similar experience years prior. We slowly started getting back to talking at the beginning of last year.   
We became very good friends again, putting the incident behind us. I'll never forget it, but I've chosen to move past it. Most days we would talk through snapchat. For context for the following, he is now in college studying computer stuff I don't really understand. He writes a lot of code and is very good getting around programs and stuff. Don't really know how to explain it.  He invited me  to play modded minecraft with him one time, but suggested that I host a server through my own network. I know it involved port forwarding and whatnot, but what was weird is that when he was showing me how to do everything, he read my own IP to me and pretty much knew how to access MY network. It creeped me out quite a bit, but I just figured it was something basic? I dont know, but I ignored it. But after that is when all the odd stuff started happening. Sometimes I would send him a snapchat that I would have no response to for hours on end, but when I would open snapchat to check for any new snaps, including his, he would get on coincidentally 20 seconds after I would check, he would respond. It was a very common occurrence, I began to think that maybe its not a coincidence. Strange things like that would become common place, where I would do something and then he would message me. Too many things to count.  
Last night is what sparked me to turn here for help. He had been getting frustrated with me in a game that I was new to, I hadn't realized that it was glitching out and had skipped part of the quest progression, leaving that session unplayable. I we didn't realize it wasn't my fault and he began acting as if I was stupid, and made me feel that way too. I got off immediately and returned the game through steam and just sat at my computer for a bit listening to music. I had been really upset these past few days due to a family loss, so I was sensitive and got super upset. 25 minutes later I had broke down crying in my bed feeling like I ruined his night and like I ruin every game we play together. Irrational, I know. However as soon as I started crying, he messaged me through discord apologizing to me  for getting angry with me and saying it was the game's fault. I rarely cry, and he rarely apologizes. I was not in a call crying, I was not texting anybody when I was crying, I was just sitting there. I am beginning to worry that  I'm being spied on through my devices via my network or something. This has always been a huge fear of mine. I may be overthinking, but I am concerned for my privacy.

154,"I am generally numb to grief, I don't know why but I am. Whenever someone I know dies I'm kind of in shock then move on quickly. I guess I just think of it as an inevitable thing but I've also never had anyone really close to me die. 

My boyfriend's cousin is in a coma and will likely die and I mean they're kind of close but not really. Like they only see each other probably a dozen times a year and talk occasionally. He is so upset about this that he got drunk today when he's supposed to be sober. I already don't know how to comfort people or react to grief so the fact that I am hurt and angry makes it so much worse.

I didn't want to have a conversation tonight since he's drunk and won't remember anything and it would just make him more upset. I just want to scream ""get over it and think about the people around you"" but I won't, I know that would be a terrible thing to say.

I just think it was so selfish of him to get drunk just because he's upset. We're having a baby in 6 months and I feel like he doesn't think of me enough. We kind of just have communication issues anyway but I really don't know how to react to this situation. I mean did he really think drinking would make it better? I hate when he gets drunk, he just gets more emotional and usually angry. I'm just furious. 

Honestly I hope his cousin makes it not just for the obvious fact of his family being heartbroken but so that my boyfriend would feel like shit about what he did versus his cousin dying and the grief continuing. I know that's selfish and please don't judge me I'm not heartless I just don't empathize well and I'm really hurt.

TL;DR I'm angry at my boyfriend but his cousin is dying and I'm terrible at dealing with grief and I don't know how to handle this situation.",10Dec2020,1

156,"College decision (advice)

Basically after I graduated high school I went off to a 4 year college and after spending freshman, and 1 semester of sophomore year at this college, I realized that I was unhappy at this university. I decided to take a semester off to help with my mental health and to try to figure my life out. (While at this university, I was applying to be in the schools nursing program. I figured, I’m not happy at this institution and I don’t feel as though the school really cares about my well-being anyway, so I’m not going to continue to pay a crap ton of money to a school that doesn’t care about me.) While I was taking my semester off, I visited loving family that live in Texas. 

However while visiting my family, the pandemic occurred, and I decided to come back home before I got stuck in another state. I had planned on attending a different nursing program but I ended up missing the test score acceptance by like 2% so I wasn’t accepted, and despite the pandemic, other programs would not accept me because I missed their deadlines by like two or three days. ( I was applying to accelerated RN programs so meeting the deadlines were important) 

Before the upcoming school year started, I still managed to get accepted into my community colleges RN program! The program is more affordable and although it’s not accelerated like the other programs I was looking into, it’s still a more affordable option for me. 

With that being said, I still live at home and I pay for more own college like most of my peers and I also work at least 30-35 hours a week. However my home environment is not the best emotionally or mentally for me (which is why I thought going to the four year college would have been best for me, but my mental health and financial health could not handle it anymore). I’m supposed to start my nursing classes this upcoming spring at the community college. However, I have an aunt that lives a few hours away and she said that I could live with her while I’m in school, and I wouldn’t have to worry about paying her rent. My aunt is very loving, and more supportive mentally, and emotionally than my current environment. The school where my aunt lives, is not a community college, it’s a private institution. And instead of receiving my 2 year RN degree in two years, I would receive it in 3years because I would be enrolling in the schools part time program for this upcoming spring (the school does not offer a full time program for spring semester, I would have to wait until fall semester, but I don’t want to take another semester off). 

I also think the parent that I live with plans on moving soon in the spring and I would not be able to move with this parent because nursing credits absolutely do NOT transfer from program to program. And I’ve told this parent that multiple times, that if they move I wouldn’t be able to move with them because I don’t want to start a nursing program completely over. 

If this parent moved I don’t think I would be able to afford the cost of living where we currently live (I have been looking recently) while also going to school full time and trying to work in order not to get evicted from a place that I find. 

So basically my question is, should I stay in the town that I’m in now? And have to worry about my mental health and then possibly all of a sudden just finding a place, while in a cheaper nursing program? Or should I go live with my aunt whose more supportive of me, and have to pay more and take a semester longer for the degree that I desire to have? I feel like I’m basically choosing between my emotional and mental health over my financial well being in the future. But I crave financial stability, but I also feel like I’m extremely depressed. And advice would be welcomed 

Kind Regards",10Dec2020,1

158,"This girl has been my friend for a few years now. Started out as casual acquaintances and grew quite close, she’s now one of my closest friends in a city it is really hard to make friends in. 

However the past year or so she has become almost unbearable to be around. ALL she talks about is herself and her problems. I had three deaths in my family this year and she did not act concerned about any one of them. Never asked me how I was doing, and when I would try to talk about it she would basically act like I didn’t say anything and just go off on some tangent of her own. 

Whenever we hang out now I have to mentally prepare myself for hours of negativity, complaining and self-centred whining and basically just sit there and listen the whole time. It’s exhausting. There is literally no point in saying anything because she will just bulldoze over it. 

I would like to talk to her about it but I don’t know how to broach the subject without coming across as an asshole. What’s funny too is within our common acquaintances no one seems to like her. Maybe this is just how she is and I’m just now noticing. I seem to have had this problem with a lot of my friends throughout the years to be honest.

159,"I hate my parents, and want absolutely nothing to do with them. I don’t want to mend our relationship at all, so please don’t start with that.

My parents are constantly picking on me, making fun of my appearance, calling me skinny, calling me short, making fun of my eyebags and it’s led to me growing up extremely self-conscious. 
They compare me to other children, such as my cousins, cousins get perfect grades and are often very well behaved, aka the model children of the family. My parents go on about how “Why can’t you get perfect grades like _ ?” “Why can’t you be as good as _ ?” It led to me feeling stupid, and again even more self-conscious about myself. They call me lazy, snake, pig, toothpick, and q-tip in reference to my behaviors and appearance, which has also led to damaging behaviors and thoughts on my part. 

Whenever I get into an argument with them and I have a valid point they tell me to either be quiet or stop talking back. They constantly interrupt me when they ask me questions, or when I normally talk. My dad also screams at me for every little thing. I feel as if they demand a shitload of respect but won’t give any back. 

And they have distanced me from my biological mother. I love my mother with all my heart, and I feel like they ruined her life. They shoved her in a room with my dad when she was only 16 (They where talking about having more children at the time and coincidentally were also encouraging my mom to get pregnant knowing she had mental issues and would not be fit to take care of me) when she gave birth they became so attached to me and when inevitably my mom was forced to give me up because of her illnesses they where the first ones to volunteer adopting me. They had already set up a bedroom for me and picked my name. I feel like it was all planned. 

I’m only 13 and have no idea how to distance myself from them, since I’m constantly around and can’t go out to see friends, In short I think they liked the idea of having another baby, but didn’t think much into it. (I’m also their first girl) now that I have feelings and get upset when they shame me/ mistreat me and expect me to be perfect I’m framed as the failure of the house.

I am a 19 year old male and I go to college where I met this friend. He was a cool person and never really thought or did weird things. We smoke weed occasionally(illegal where I live) and we’re good friends. 

Recently, he called me and told me he’d get weed from his hometown. I was excited about it because it had been a long time. He sent a text after I showed my excitement. The text said: Are you bringing a girl with you?
I asked why he was asking that and he told me that the stuff was good and he could take advantage of a girl I’d bring. I never planned on taking a girl with me in the first place. 

That text sent chills down my spine and it has affected the way I look at this world now. How many of the people I know are like this? He never behaved like this before. I don’t know what to do.

In high school, I also sucked at school and my teachers would mistreat me and make me feel stupid. My chemistry teacher even screamed at me because I couldn't get the information. My other teachers would also poke fun at me (and no, not in a joking way). There's this tension with my teachers where they know I'm dumb and I just stay silent (maybe it's my imagination).

Few days after they left, my brother found few of the stamps from his rare collection missing. My brother was very heartbroken and pressed my parents to ask about it to my cousins.

But we all knew it was her. After that, she never visited us or we never visited her.

195,"I have always had monumental difficulty with self-discipline. It’s been something I have secretly loathed about myself for my entire life. I took a personality test based in the big five traits and it came back saying that I was exceptionally low in contentiousness. Like really really low.

Then it went on to say how low-contentiousness people are lazy and coming up with excuses and never amount to anything and I just wanted to cry. I have been trying and trying and trying to get better discipline. I have tortured myself for years and been depressed and sad about it perpetually my entire dang life.

I know that the test was probably skewed for this reason. I understand logically that the low view I have of my consciousness (combined with the anxiety I was feeling despite the fact that this 10$ test specifically said not to take it while anxious) likely caused it to skew negatively, but it doesn’t take away from this huge dang problem that I have been trying to fix on my own for years.

Last year, I was doing better with it. I was in college, I was finally slowly learning to work on projects before they were immediately due and I was still really hating on myself the whole time. Then I got in a car wreck.
I nearly died, had several surgeries and months of therapy and lost literally all of my minuscule progress.

I don’t know how to do this anymore. My room is a wreck. I still haven’t enrolled in classes despite the due date being very soon, mostly because online classes terrify me. I hate myself, always have, and I just want to stop doing it.

I believe really really deeply in my responsibility to myself and others. I believe in self-discipline and order and all that stuff, I just can’t seem be self-disciplined.

It’s a good idea for me to add that I think I have ADHD, but I don’t have insurance. I really think I would benefit from some therapy, but I can’t afford it. I work part-time on minimum wage and I am not under any insurance.

I just need some advice on how to stop hating myself and to finally get some self-discipline. It’s crushing me and I’m so done.",10Dec2020,1

199,"So there is this very strange situation at work, and I""m not sure how to go about it at this point...

Five weeks ago, I began working at a local restaurant as a delivery driver. Now, this restaurant has two company cars we can use to deliver the food. They are custom painted cars with the companies logo and phone number all over it, it's pretty cool and catches everyone's attention. 

About two weeks later, I walk into work and my Manager tells me that he's going to take the cars in to get repaired because they've been having issues, and that I can drive his car if he wants.   
I was extremely appreciative of this, and decided to continue with the company car.  It has had quite a few issues like low tires, the 'check engine' light is on, and the brakes are terrible.

I figured it's no big deal, I'll be driving newly repaired cars in no time... the week had passed and they still didn't get repaired. And then like one day later the ""brake fluid low"" light came on and the brakes began working even worse than ever, like I have to really push down for the car to come to a full stop.

I sent my manager a picture about this, and we spoke later that night, and he assured me he would get them fixed on Monday... Monday had passed, I show up later that week and the lo, the cars are still not fixed. 

I don't like confrontation, I'm a pretty sensitive person so I try to be understanding and not be confrontational.

I let it go for a bit, a couple days later at the end of the night, I politely say: ""So, not to keep bringing this up but do you plan on getting the cars fixed soon?""

And his words were, ""So I'm taking in the white truck in on Thursday, and the red one on Friday""

... and would you believe it, I show up the following week and neither car is fixed. This time I decided to ask him, and he said, ""we did five thousand dollars on Friday"", so his excuse is that it was too busy to bring them in...

I let it go and wished him a good night, then left... the following day I was working again, and had told suggested to him that I take the cars in myself to get repaired since he seems to never want to carve out some time to repair them... He assured me he would bring them in on Monday even though it's his only day off... I politely told him that if he changes his mind, I can bring them in and that I truly would be happy to do so. 

Today I went in to work and AGAIN, the cars were not fixed. It's ridiculous at this point and very strange what he's doing...

Like HE is the one who FIRST approached me about getting the car fixed, and now I'm just trying to follow up with him because the car is unsafe to drive.

I didn't say anything today and don't want this constant conflict with him because he's actually an easy-going, nice guy compared to other arrogant male managers I have had.

My only other option is to call the owner and let him know about the car situation. Is this a bad idea? I don't want to jeopardize my job.",10Dec2020,1

202,"A few weeks ago, I (F19) was sick with COVID-19. I had flu-like symptoms that lasted a full week. A few days after experiencing no symptoms, I began to work out again and do my daily 1-mile run.  While working out, I quickly discovered that I had a very hard time breathing and that I felt pressure on my chest. I have heart issues and deal with chest pain but this was something else entirely, and besides, I'm on a medication that helps with my heart problems. In addition to running to stay in shape, I run to condition my heart because I have an issue where my heart rate is higher than normal.

I had an annual doctor checkup scheduled today and I planned to bring up my concerns. My aunt had a severe case of COVID and for a whole month, she had breathing issues, which worried me. After talking to the doctor, they said COVID could have resulted in phenomena or some other lung disease, even though I had no respiratory issues while sick. I went to another place to get a chest X-ray done and they are sending the results to my doctor who will be calling me tomorrow. It is quite possible that I will have to use an inhaler for a while until I recover. The only problem is the inhaler will raise my heart rate, and I already have a high heart rate and take a beta-blocker medication to slow it down.

I'm worried about something happening, and I need advice. On one hand, if I want to stay active and continue to condition my heart I might need an inhaler to breathe but on the other hand, it could impact my heart issues and reverse the effect of my medication. I see a cardiologist, but my doctor knows about my heart issues and didn't raise any concerns but I am personally worried. What should I do? Should I use the inhaler, or should I steer clear of it?",10Dec2020,1

     Recently it was revealed to me by said friends that they had group chat without me, which alright sure go ahead I don’t care but when they added me to it they were sharing some screenshots of one of them talking shit about me when I got stood up on a date. At first I was confused and I thought maybe it was just once they something like that but turns out after scrolling up to see what else they sent it was just more of it. Hell of them even took the time to acknowledge that the group was made to talk shot about me. That was in the midsection of chat which was going on for a couple months. 

     Fast forward to today I woke up to a text in another group chat that we’re all in just for one of dudes to send a screenshot of it being more group chats. A lot of them ending with “Gc....without *insert name here* ” or one of my favorites ending with  “....fuck that n-word *insert name here*”, all these are dated 32wks to 20 recently used and at this point I wasn’t even shocked. I was just tossing around with my thoughts thinking maybe it was just a joke that I’m taking too seriously or something along the lines. This isn’t the first time either of them talking shit about me but just to my face about it which I would’ve respected much more.
 
   There’s a lot more stuff that’s lead up to the point of me just wanting to drop them but this was just straw that broke the camels back.

I only eat fresh food from now on, burritos are my favorite fast food so I only have a large one once every month and a half or so. Aside from that, I put in effort to nurture my health not because I want to lose weight and not because I want to get into a sport; but because of my fear of diseases. I did some research which gave me some very helpful insight, it stated that ""fears which have no basis, in reality, should not exist and that the next step that should be taken is counseling"" this quote helped me ALOT as it put things into perspective for me.

212,"My (18F) Mom died over a year ago. Now I live with my Dad (52M), my Brother (20M) and our three Cats. My Dad works full time, my Brother studies Music (every two weeks in school and the other on Zoom).
I'm in this weird time between Highschool and University. I want to go to Art school and I'm putting all my Time into my Portfolio. 

After our Mom died we made a Plan for who does which Chores:
My Dad cooks on the Weekends, takes care of the Cats and the Bathroom. 
I cook every second week (when my brother has his class in person), clean the Kitchenfloor and Entrance and deal with the dishwasher. 
My Brother cooks the other weeks, brings out the trash and does the laundry.

What's important to know is that my Dad is from Russia with very traditional Values. My Mom stayed at home and took care of us and the Household.
Ever since she died I have felt pressured into her Role as a ""Housewife"" and I feel very overwhelmed with that. I have tried to talk to them about it but they don't really understand the issue.

So I love them both to death but they are really bad at keeping the House clean. Especially my Brother. It has always been like this and my Mom always had to be on his ass to clean up after himself and stuff. 
Recently he has basically stopped doing his Chores properly. My Dad started doing the Laundry and bringing out the trash because nobody else did it. And last Month I have cooked 3 weeks in a row and when it was his turn he only cooked on 2 days and afterwards the kitchen was an absolute mess which I cleaned up because I didn't want my Dad to end up doing it after work. 
I told my Brother several times but he brushed it off and as the younger sister I don't have the Authority to make him do it nor do I want to because I'm not his Mom. I don't want to complain to my dad because he already has so much on his plate and I can't really complain about doing more Chores than I should when he is working full time and doing so much for all of us.

It’s worth mentioning that towards the end, we were with both admittedly unhappy, but I was the one to make the decision to break up. A couple weeks after the breakup covid hit, and that was the start of the dreamlike state i’m experiencing now.

What I mean is, multiple times a week since the breakup I have found myself looking at pictures of the time period around the start of the relationship and middle. I think about the happiness and bliss of these simple times that seem so much better. Then I think towards the end where things got rockier between us- i almost force myself to relive that pain. I’ll think back on all the happy times, holding onto that feeling of comfort that she, and that relationship brought me. Then I will fall into deep sadness knowing I hurt her, and she will never get to be a part of my life again. There IS a lot of uncertainty in my life now compared to last year where I knew what to expect- only back then I wanted out, to have what i have now even. It just doesn’t live up to my expectations. I feel that may be why I’m holding onto the past and not moving forward.

Yet, despite my unhappiness back then, I find myself wanting to be back in that place, knowing that I’ll never get there. Still, the thought is comforting.

It was a weighted blanket. I was curious so I clicked on the notification and saw that it's a bright yellow blanket sized for a queen size bed. 

I'm not a fan of yellow, and I have a twin sized bed. It's going to look awful in my room, I won't have space for it, but I feel really bad because I know she spent at least $60 on it.

I’ll keep this as short and sweet as I can.  I expressed interest in a single friend.  Didn’t go crazy by professing my love or anything.  Mentioned that I was potentially interested in something beyond platonic but would understand if it wasn’t mutual and would be cool keeping the friendship.

They rejected me, said the comfort level wouldn’t change, but when I would try to maintain the friendship, they’d be a bit distant.  I asked eventually if we were cool, and they admitted they have no interest in hanging out for the foreseeable future, but want to communicate electronically.  I asked if it was about me asking them out and they said that was part of it and (suddenly) didn’t think we clicked even as friends.  They admitted they didn’t want to hurt me at the beginning, and tried to soften the blow, but instead ended up dragging on the lie and continue to make excuses.

Understandably I was upset and told them it’s not nice to treat a friend like they’re dead to you for asking you out.  Then she got upset with me saying I was disrespecting how they feel and that they have a lot of anxiety and trust issues because of how they were treated in the past.  I said I wasn’t sure how to respond to that other than sorry, but that communication and honesty are the best policy and any type of relationship with the intention of lasting deserves to be a two way street.

I don’t know how she sees it on her side but she doesn’t want to lead me on/hurt me but I’m wondering if I became too available or subconsciously made her push away.

Since the talk she does reach out to check up on me because she still wants us to be friends and later maybe with benefits. She does care about me.

I want it to happen naturally but it does hurt because I want to move on but I feel like part of me is that she does like me it just hasn’t been long enough.

The only details I can give you are I think the first day of my last period was either September 15-16, my OBGYN thinks I ovulated around September 29th, and my predicted due date is June 22, 2021. while I very much want this baby, I am terrified of going through this pregnancy without knowing who the father is and who to tell that I’m pregnant. I don’t want to ask anyone to raise a child they didn’t create.  
Now, with all of this being said, so many things point to the second guy(September 30th) being the dad. I even took a $1700 non-invasive prenatal paternity test with DNA Diagnostics center and he came back as 99.9% probably as the biological father. But these tests have some bad reviews about false positives. I know the other guy used a condom, but it was still within my *predicted* fertile days and I know condoms can fail. I’m suspicious because the day I had sex with the second man was a day after when my doctor said I probably ovulated. 
Please don’t judge me, I just need some opinions. Has anyone used DDC before? Is it possible the condom broke and we didn’t know it? Am I being paranoid over nothing after everything kind of points to the second guy as being the dad?",10Dec2020,1

227,"I have a long time friend who isn’t responding to any communication. I know he is struggling but I don’t know how to help him. 

He has had depressive periods before, where he will stop communication with our friend group (tight group from high school) and return when he is starting to feel a bit better.

He started to avoid us again beginning of 2020 and only saw us once in February. We all knew there was an elephant in the room but no one mentioned it and we kept it fun. He was a part of a few zoom calls at the beginning of covid in March and seemed to be doing just fine. Since then none of us have seen or communicated with him since. 

At first we try to give him his space because that’s what we think may be best. But it’s been months now. I know he is in a dark place. His relationship with his parents haven’t been the greatest, especially not his dad who he lives with. I doubt his job staying through Covid and I’m sure he isn’t able to do much about his education right now. 

I’ve been visiting his house but no one answers. I’d like to get in contact with his sibling but she doesn’t have social media. None of us know what to do to help.

I've been playing vr chat to supplement the socializing quota per say but it isn't really the same, and lockdown hasn't really helped much because my main wat of meeting new cool people was in university and my classes are all online which sucks.

really believe I can be a clinical psychologist some day. I want to be one very badly and I want more than anything to be that bitch that just HELPS people because it brings me happiness. 

My problem is I have zero idea where to get started and I’m the type of person who needs an A-Z guide/complete syllabus for goals these huge. ( honestly this will be the first huge goal I’ve ever set for myself)

Im so lost, I don’t understand college like it just confused the shit out of me, not so much the classes but what do I take next, how long will it take/how broke will I be when it’s all over? It’s really disheartening knowing how expensive education is in general.

240,"My best friend and I have known each other for 17 years now growing up together. We were both 16 when we started dating our girlfriends around the same time and we are all 22 now. His girlfriend was the meanest girl in high school like cheer leader, toxic mean girl. Literally like the movie mean girls with Lindsey Lohan. My girlfriend was the nicest and most down to earth. (Not even a biased description, anyone could attest to it). Anyway, he became obsessed with his girlfriend like stopped talking to all of his friends and hardly even talked to me, the only times we hung out were when we saw each other at work. After about a year of both of our relationships, as couples we went to a prom house together, went on about 3 double dates (all within 2 months).  I could always tell his girlfriend never liked me probably because I’m the coolest cat around (just joking it’s probably because I am laid back and didn’t go to college which is polar opposite of her). But she absolutely hates my girlfriend (probably for the same reasons). but one day after the last time we hung out, she texted my girlfriend and blew up on her because “we didn’t feel like hanging out on a night that they wanted to and that we aren’t going to be separated the following year like they are since we aren’t going away to college” and my girlfriend didn’t give her the reaction that she wanted and just said I’m sorry you feel that way instead of feeding the fire and then my friend’s girlfriend just cut ties with us and like unfriended us on social media hahaha. Psycho. We literally never did anything to them and are very conscious of how we act, and we don’t even act like a couple when we are out so I just don’t know what triggered it. Anyway, fast forward a few years later and my friend and his fiancé are now planning their destination wedding and sent me an invitation that just says my name. No guest option or no separate invitation to my girlfriend. He is my best friend and I’ll love him no matter what, but I just feel like it’s F’d up that they intentionally didn’t invite my girlfriend to the wedding as well. I’m honestly debating whether I should go, because it’s just a stab in the back I feel like.

Hi, so this in an old incident but I'm  just asking for advice now to help me navigate future relationships better. 

 I had met this guy online on Tinder 5-6 months back and we had been chatting for 2-3 months until this incident. Even though we never met,  we had gotten pretty close during the period. He even said he loved me once. I didn't respond with a I love you too because I wasn't there yet but I still liked him a lot. Anyway he used to be very busy because of work and didn't initiate texts much or reply well. He would go without replying to my messages for a day or even more sometimes. A couple of times I called him and he didn't even pick it up. I told him it's okay to not receive the call if he's busy, but that he should atleast drop me a text in a couple of hours or something to acknowledge it? Like just rejecting someone's call and not even acknowledging it seems rude to me. Okay so the last time this happened, I called him once. He didn't even pick up the phone or reply to my other texts.The next day, I wrote to him saying something like dudee I called you yesterday to which he said let's end this? 
Was I being clingy? Is it clingy to expect someone to respond to your messages in a 24 h time frame? 

We talked after that and he thinks I was clingy. I told him I thought he was very mean and he did acknowledge that. He said work makes him mean and stuff. The thing is, his schedule is clearing up in a while and he said I can concentrate on you better then and I'd love if we could get back together. But honestly, I'm not that down for that. 
Anyway do you'll think I was being clingy?",10Dec2020,1

Well minus them assuming it was my other manager and calling the cops on him knowing he had a warrant cause they saw him steal 42$.

My current location is trash. They have failed 2 core inspections due to how bad it is the have minors stealing but are keeping them cause taxes . And they used a manager who deserved to get fired as a scape goat and sent him to jail to save their asses.

A month ago someone got covid instead of closing down they made us clean it and then had a few people get tested and then everyone came back after the got responses. Tried to get and convince a guy who drank after his brother the same day he tested positive to come in.

The boss stated hes not paying for any tests after the first one that happened and if people think they have it it they either come to work or dont get paid and quarantine and take a test. 

So most people have either chosen not to take it cause they need money. I reported that and nothing happened but the one guy getting fired and they keep trying to fire others.

Managers have stated that they can not afford to take off they will come in. And our manager higher up one stated if you have symptoms still come in because it likely is something else. And even if you take a test you can come in. Several stated they had symptoms and took tests it came back they had allergies

So after thanksgiving we had someones family end up positive this was the second they got tested and stated they can not afford to not come to work. No one bothered to ask her her results they just kept putting her in cause they had the other opener arrested. A  guy posted in group chat that he was worried about the persons bad cough they and every manager stated she had smokers cough its smokers cough. They belittled the guy who was worried about his health and his families health and got him to shut up and think he was wrong.

We get to tuesday im feeling sick and I am 90% sure its allergies. She looks like shit heads home and doesnt tell anyone until shes been gone. Ends up shes been puking all day.

The higher manager stated to everyone she came to work drunk she is not sick shes just drunk and is like come in find someone to cover you or a write up.

Today she doesnt come in 7 days after her test shes positive. It takes all day for her to get the proof.

Id like to state i work up close and personal with this woman in drive through and she drives me to work. So im getting tested now tommrow.

They decide once again they are doing a deep clean and everything normal again. I let it know i wanted to get testes if the paperwork arrived. The higher manager redos a schedule  and puts me on it. The higher manager stated this is all what the boss wants its his ideas and he cant afford to lose money. We cant afford to close. My opening manager knows i dont want to come in if i have to get tested calls me tells me that if i want off tell her she cant make me work. Then told me the higher manager told her when she asked her if she wanted her to call me and ask she would call to ask me if i wanted off.
She didnt she wanted to just not give me the option and have me come in and work.

I tell her that i want to get tested and quaritine because i have worked 4 days with her 6 hours a day next to the woman and she drove me to work.

She then told me if you choose to not come to work and to go that route we can not pay for your test and you wont get paid for being off work.
She tried to guild me into coming into work.

I recently got a project but for that I have to relocate to another city, Mumbai which is around a 1000 kilometres ( 620 miles ) from where I stay, Bangalore. This will be difficult for me as I cannot leave my parents alone. They need someone that takes care of them. Incase of any emergency here, there is no one that can be of any help.  I have two sisters but they’re not old enough to run the home. Besides, cost of living in Mumbai is high and I will not be of a great help to them financially and we’re not financially ‘great’ either. 2l is a pretty dear amount for me to lose.

259,"f 14  i have had anxiety since i was 7 but it has progressively gotten worse, especially this year. 

it’s become hard to function with it, even if there is no reason i get anxious. school is what makes me the most anxious. 

i have multiple panic attack in a school day, but through out school hours i feel anxious but when i feel anxious it’s different than what my
anxiety use to be like.

now my hearing goes static i won’t hear anyone. i will stoop being able to recognize faces, then i get tunnel vision and it just all gets blurry.

it feels like going through a bunch of strobe lights, that disoriented feeling. 

sometimes i will see things that aren’t actually there.
things that can’t even happen. like my hand and objects fading/ dissolving away.  people “disappearing”. i will be in class and then i will be in my bedroom and then i blink a little and i’m
back in the classroom.

everything thing feels like a dream, i can’t begin to describe it. nothing feels real at all. and i feel crazy anxious, lightheaded, terrified and dissociated. i become very dizzy to the point where i can’t walk sometimes. 

this happens a lot, especially at school, mostly at school.

my mom knows i have anxiety but she doesn’t know that it’s like this bad. i told her today that it’s gotten bad but i haven’t told her the things i put in this text. i feel like she would definitely not understand. 

i have a presentation tomorrow, which brings me A LOT of anxiety, not even for a particular reason,
it just does. 

last presentation i had everything went static and everything look like it was “dissolving” and i just said that i was finished and walked back to my seat mid presentation. 

ive multiple panic attack tonight just because of it tomorrow. my mom knows this presentation is making me anxious, but it is much more than she thinks. i think this is more serious than she thinks.

what should i do, my presentation is tomorrow. i feel if i had to explain to my mom, she would think i’m crazy.",10Dec2020,1

I just wanted to come on here and ask what would be the best option in obtaining a new phone with reasonable/flexible financial options. As we know, we're in a bit of financial crisis so this was an awful time for my phone to break and my AppleCare expired not too long ago. I have Verizon but they told me an insurance claim would be a waste of money considering how outdated the phone is and it would be just as expensive to get fixed.  


Any advice would be great, thanks!",10Dec2020,1
263,"I guess that is what I am currently looking for. 

(\*warning I do touch on some sensitive topics here including abuse and negative/dark places.)

This will kind of get long-winded, there is honestly a lot to unpack and I have a hard time opening up and addressing these issues with myself. 

So, I'm a grown adult - I live with my grandpa, my mom and my aunt at the moment. The only thing that is really keeping myself or my mom from being homeless at the moment is my grandpa. 

This year, like for many other people, has been exceptionally rough for us. My mom has now lost two jobs, one earlier in the year around June - and the second was just today. We had been working at the same place - it is a fast food place and I don't really have any bad feelings on the grounds she was fired on. My mom isn't the best person, and she toes the line a lot - she crossed it last night and I understand why they would want to let her go after that. 

So, she doesn't have a job currently - and honestly at this point in time it just kind of feels like...getting her another job is kind of hopeless. Realistically, it's not impossible, but due to covid and the holidays it's...very daunting. We were barely scraping by. 

My mom has a gambling problem, she likes to spend the majority of her checks on scratch-offs. If I'm ever not with her she will blame me for the amount of money she dips into the machines with. We have several loans out due to this problem, loans to pay other loans, loans for christmas/holidays past that never got paid off.   
I'm a push over and - I will admit I have taken loans out in my name to appease her. I realize that I am at fault for these loans and responsible for them. But I have a hard time keeping up with them. 

My mom likes to rope me along with - if you do this I'm not going to be around anymore, I'm going to go and jump off a bridge, or I'm going to end up on the street. I know this is abusive, that she is an abusive person, and that for my sake I should really get away from her - but. I don't think I could live with myself if she ended up on the street, or if she took her life. 

The majority of my life, my mom and dad fault, they didn't get divorced until I was 20 something. I witnessed my dad beat my mom senseless several times, and I can remember twice when he almost actually killed her.   
I guess for the most part, that is why I've always felt guilty about leaving and living my own life...I've had opportunities in the past - I have a way out now - I have friends who want me to go with them. But I don't know what to do for my mom.   


And while I am grateful for my friends who want to get me out of the situation I am in, they also very much make me anxious whenever I vent to them about something and the only thing I get out of them is 'come live with us'.   
I know this comes from a place of caring. And I know that they genuinely want me to be safe and ok. But financially, I do not want to burden them, and despite how many times they tell me that I won't be - I know I will be. I am currently in a pretty deep hole debt wise.   
I know that I can't keep putting them off, that I can't not take their help forever - and I realize that a lot of my issues would go away if I could get away from the situation I am currently in. But putting that into practice just...it makes me feel like I'm slamming into a brick wall. 

My grandpa has tried to get my mom to go to graceworks (I'm not sure if that's an entire US thing, or if its only in the south) and she will meet with someone and talk to them for one session - and then it will be on someone else to make her commit to that.   
I guess, at the end of the day - we are enabling these sorts of behaviors by allowing her to get away with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now she has convinced herself that she is worth more dead than she is alive. I don't know what to do. I can't tell you how many times I have heard my mom threaten to off herself because someone wont give her money, or give her what she wants. It always brings me down and fills me with dread because I both know that it is an abusive tactic and that it is likely something that she is not going to act on. 

I struggle with depression. I feel like I am at rock bottom. I don't know what to do about bills going forward. I don't know what to do, I just know that giving up is not the answer.   


I have a lot more to share but I don't...know if it is appropriate to share...

Basically I am sick of having no privacy (22 w/o my own room!) and it is constantly noisy in my house, making it difficult to study/sleep/relax. 

I want to move out but it is pretty impossible for me right now; my city just got named the top housing market in the U.S. and rent for a studio apartment, even in the bad areas, is at least $1300/month.

My parents are generous enough to pay for my school and not charge me rent, but they will not pay for my rent somewhere else (which is completely reasonable).

Ok so a little background info first. Every Friday night a few friends and I go out to eat at a local ice cream shop. There’s this one person in our group that I don’t know very well so I wouldn’t say we’re best friends or anything. My friend and I leave and as we’re driving down the street the person I don’t know very well is following us very closely about 10 feet away from my rear bumper. He then pulls up next to us at a red light and starts to rev his engine to get us to race him and I decline by waving at him. He speeds off and pulls into a parking lot and shuts off his lights. As we pass he pulls up behind up and starts driving with his high beams on so I tilt my rear view mirror away to I’m not completely blind. We turn on a street going into my neighborhood and he speeds around us crossing over a double yellow line and gets in front me and my friend. The speed limit on this road it 35 mph and he slows down to about 20. I’m starting to get annoyed because he’s done this multiple Friday nights even after I tell him to stop. As I pull into my driveway he speeds away. 

My question is what can I do to stop this? 
I’ve considered purchasing a dash cam and recording his reckless driving (20-30mph over speed limit, illegal lane changes, crossing into oncoming traffic, ETC) and then turning it into the local police to help deal with the situation but I’m not sure if they can do anything.

We are about to move and I’ve been very stressed about everything lately. 

My mom and sister just got into a huge fight and my sister said some pretty bad stuff to my mom, and now my mom feels like shit and thinks she failed as a mother.

How this started was my mom called my sister boyfriend (who is a dad) a shit parent because of what he did to my nephew ( he put him the corner and told him to repeat I’m a baby until he said stop, he’s five, and took a bunch of his toys because he didn’t clean his room) my mom over heard this, and yelled at him saying that is mentally abusing him and he shouldn’t say that stuff to a five year old.

My sister blew up and told my mom to stay in hear lane and she failed at being a mother, in front of my nephew. The argument/fight blew up from there, and I wasn’t really listening at that point because I was trying to keep my nephew away from it all.

At this point my sister told my mom that she hates her and when she moves out she’ll never see her grandson again because “she couldn’t stay in her lane” and she should get off of her ass and do something to help clean up the house.

she is very very quiet, but if you tak to her she talks back, she has a very elegant way of taking like prestigious. but doesn’t say much. 

she is always straight faced until you talk to her and she will smile or laugh at a joke or something then like a snap, just switch her emotions back to straight faced. 

she shows to have no empathy at all, on many occasions. here’s a few of many examples; in class we watched a very sad movie based on a true story, many people cried. and she showed no emotion except for randomly scoffing. 

when others share sad things about them selves most people show pity, but she doesn’t at all. when i asked her about her passions she said she had none and wished to die young. 

she is very cold but not rude. in class the teacher was lecturing her on listening to music in class and she immediately stated crying and sobbing. then when the teacher walked back to their desk, boom she just switched back to straight  faced. not sad or crying. 

she reminds me of a movie character, ive never met anyone like her. i know i described it really bad in this, like really bad. but if you knew her it would make much more sense, just a compete “vibe”.

286,"A quick summary of my mother, she’s not herself and hasn’t been for years. A disease has slowly taken who she was, she’s still a ray of light, but she’s not the person that most people would remember. 

I’ve stayed by my mother’s side since the beginning. I was quite young when she was diagnosed, so for me, this is my life.

For a couple of years now, I have had no job, have not gone to college, no significant other, no friends, no children, no money, essentially I don’t go anywhere ever. I stay home with my mother, and quite honestly, she checks just about almost everything on the list above.

It’s not easy taking care of her, it has never been and I’ve never been afraid to admit that. But I always had that voice in the back of my head though, telling me that she might not be happy with everything I haven’t done, but she’d always be proud of the things I have done. 

It’s just, When they tell me she would be disappointed, it does hurt, because I can’t ask her if she would be or not, even though she’s sitting 5 feet from me.

Until recently, I realized how important it is for me to think she is proud. I don’t like to admit it but it does sway my confidence, because for me I have worked my whole life since the diagnoses to do whatever I could to make her proud, in an odd way though, it is for myself as well. 

I didn’t notice it till a few months ago, but my mother is my hero . I don’t have the ability to remember completely who she was before, I can only remember what she taught me, to be her definition of a good person, and I know parents aren’t perfect, but to me the memories I have left of her, is that she is a saint. 

The problem I’m having is, I’ve realized people use her to push their own agendas, but I just can’t seem to argue for her, or myself. I come from a really aggressive family, and I’m more passive.

As of recently I’ve done a 180, and have decided my mom wouldn’t be disappointed in me, would she think I need to get my shit together? Most definitely. But disappointed? I don’t think so, because to me, that would mean she would have to lack pride, and I think I have one thing she would at least be proud about. 

I ask how to build a better defense against them telling me she would be disappointed, because I don’t know how to do such without wavering. Me even defending myself could end in an argument between me and however is saying it, but I’ve reached a point that I’m determined to defend myself against that idea.

But we never asked because she wouldn’t listen anyways she would just hide it. We just didn’t talk about it. Later on a chain of events lead me to find out that my wife was also doing it with her. My wife ended up in rehab for 6 weeks leaving me to pay all of our bills. I had to turn our car in because we were already behind due to covid. Now my wife is 3 months sober and wants to be friends with said friend because they are both clean. I don’t think I have completely forgiven my wife and I have no desire to be friends with someone who would do that kind of stuff with my wife behind my back. To give a time frame I’d say we have been friends for 5 years and the lying has been going on for ~2 years of that.",10Dec2020,1

I pedal my bicycle starting from morning to night so I 
I had to skip work today because of my right foot. 
It started as a blister then it turned to a big callus, it keeps on spreading and now its turning kinda red and darker. Its really painful I think its inflamed or a foot ulcer based on what I looked up to the internet.

I only make a small amount of money everyday and I don't have money for consultation or surgery if needed, I'm the only one working in our family right now. My grandma is also sick she's taking a lot of medication so I couldn't afford to lose my job even just for a few days.

if you know a doctor whou could look at my foot and can give a solution even just temporarily so I could go back to my job that would really help a lot. I'll send pictures of my foot.

296,"Basically my (19F) boyfriend (26) and I fought all day today. I tried talking reasonably with him and it wasn't getting through so I gave up and just started flat out ignoring everything he said. This made him extremely mad. Then I got out of the shower and he was in my bed (we live together, but we have two bedrooms). We started fighting again and I told him to get out and sleep in the guest room in his bed. Part of our argument was about the garbage that's been sitting out for days that he refuses to help me take out (one of the bags is too heavy for me). So I said he could sleep with the trash bags in his room too and he got up and started pushing me out of the room so I pushed back and he grabbed me by the neck while we were both screaming at each other. He kept trying to talk to me after that. I locked him out of my room but our locks are cheap and he got right back in. He said sorry but I told him I never wanted to see him again etc. He kept blaming it on me after all that which upset me even more since I was already scared and I just curled up and refused to look at him. He kept trying to get me to turn around.

Nothing he did really hurt, and I don't think it left any marks. I'm just scared. I know this is a stupid question but is that technically assault or something? I'm not calling the cops because I don't like to escalate things like that, they probably wouldn't do anything anyways because there are no marks. I don't know what to do now though. I can't afford all this on my own and our lease isn't up until may. I'm sorry this is rambly and all over the place I'm just scared and shocked. I never thought he'd do this to me.

The first time he came in like 30 seconds and kept pulling out to stop himself from climaxing and some MAY have gotten in me cause it was so quick and in the moment but I’m not fully sure. He wiped off but didn’t use the restroom and neither did I. Then we got something to eat and an hour later we had sex again. Same thing but he didn’t climax as quickly and he pulled out. Another factor is that it was completely unprotected and I am in my ovulation week. We both didn’t use the restroom and I just totally forgot so if anything got in me at all, it was in there for a while. Including the fact that we did it twice so maybe pre-cum from the second time pushed out some left over semen from the first time &amp; could have possibly fertilized me?

So a conversation arose in my family about a lot of men showing up next door all hours of the day. And looking up the address came up with a single listing of a massage business name. Looking up the name we found a facebook page with the address matching. 

So on the page had the professional spiel in one post below. Explaining legitimacy saying they have a store downtown but to save money we do messages at home, which would be fine except for the post stating: want a message with extra and a good time.

312,"I really just need to vent right now, but I have anybody to talk to. Dont really expect much response but its been driving me insane being so alone for so long. 

For some background...

I (21M) am soul-crushingly lonely. As a senior in college (studying Mechanical Engineering and Economics), I am a kissless virgin who has never attended a party, has basically no friends, and has been chronically depressed since 13-14 years old (lol classic loser). Unfortunately, my mental state over the last few years has tended to oscillate between absolute apathy (psychotic, according to some) and borderline suicidal mania, which has been incredibly draining to manage. I haven't been happy since I was a child. 

On the surface, Im a 6-2 175lb , bi-racial, middle class, generally athletic guy with many interests and hobbies, 3 summers of construction internship experience, and a ""bright future""; every single fucking morning I hear my alarm clock, and my first thought is that ""I wish I had died in my sleep"". Not in a ""God i wish i was dead millennial humor"" vein either, I often legitimately wish that I was not alive. 

In high school, I never attended any dances (including prom), games, or social events, largely due to rejection from my peers. People I had initially considered acquaintances and friends had consistently turned down requests to hang out, and often actively excluded me from any social gathering. While high school is a rough time for many people and irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, I can't help but think that this really hurt my college experience too, as I never really got to develop adequate social skills.

While in college, probably partially due to my majors, I found myself oscillating between coffee to stay awake and alcohol to fall asleep most days. On an average day, I would talk to 0 people and stare at a glowing box of formulas and homework for 12+ hours. Weekends were usually spent largely the same as weekdays, with the futile goal of catching up on sleep. The majority of my professors shoulda been replaced by soul-sucking robots smh. I had tried to join clubs in my first few years, but that ended up being a dead-end largely due to the 2 clubs I joined falling apart because of infighting (most of them never talk anymore). At this point, I just want the goddamn diploma. 

The net result of college was basically all my worst attributes slowly being magnified in a downward spiral. Unless I am doing something productive (schoolwork, cooking, working out, playing guitar), a tidal wave of self-loathing seems to dominate every aspect of my mind. While I understand that I am incredibly fortunate, and am grateful to have the opportunity to receive such an education, I can't help but wonder if it will ever be worth the wasting of my youth. Many of my peers had the best years of their lives, found love, friendship, employment, and made great memories; I can't help but be a tad jealous. 

In order to try and help remedy my social deprivation, I tried tinder, bumble, hinge, etc, but none of that really materialized into anything beyond pleasantries. To be 100% fair, if I was a girl, I would not try to seek quality relationships on an app populated with legions of dudes whose only goal is to smash. Whatever ""Chad"" has got that I don't, good for him, but fuckin cmon there's gotta be SOMEONE left out there for me. FFS id date me. 

I have a decent enough relationship with my parents/family, but they are relatively closed-minded (mostly) conservatives with whom it is becoming increasingly hard to converse for extended periods of time. They are simply of a different era. While I myself am a pretty moderate-libertarian individual and at least understand the broad appeal of people like Trump or Bernie, I don't think their veins of thought are nearly as adept as, for example, Reagan or Kennedy. My family has unfortunately gotten wrapped up in the mass-media CNN vs FOX political bullshit that has seemingly infatuated the country. Every time I try to have a serious conversation with them about my own life, they usually brush me off by changing the topic or trying to belittle me by saying to ""just get used to it cause I'm a man"". 

I'm getting pretty sick and tired of all these threads and stuff of people saying ""trust me it gets better"" when it really doesn't. Why or how would it? Unless something in my life changes, I will continue to be fundamentally unhappy with myself and will likely not live to see my 30th birthday. I cant expect stuff to magically fall into place like this is a Disney movie. Bullshit blind optimism is great, until it isnt. When cynic reality sets in, I acknowledge that I can be a pessimistic and toxic person to be around. 

TBF, my social life actually improved a bit due to COVID lockdowns. Everyone being miserable locked inside has allowed me to commiserate with many peers in a way I never could have before. My sister says my biggest issue has been a lack of self-confidence, but abject failure at every venture (socially, academically, and a faltering tech start-up) has left me with little to brag about. Coming out of this pandemic, I need to hit the ground running if I am going to enter the post-graduation world with any semblance of mental stability. 

I need a quick win, what should I do?

How normal is all of this/what should I be doing differently? 

When COIVD is over, how do I become a happier person?

316,"Background info: I am 17 years old, my sister is 15. Live in a small town in Ontario just outside of Toronto. 

Where do I even start. Just today, my sister called the police at 1 am, just because my mom wouldn't let her run away, so she called the police lying to them saying she ""needs to go to the hospital."" And I know for a fact she was lying. She has been doing bullshit like this for the past 3 years, and tonight, I have fucking had it. This year she has done so much evil, I would be entirely satisfied if she was locked behind bars. Most people would call this regular ""sibling rivalry."" It is far beyond that, especially when it gets to the point where she daily makes comments about me like ""I'm going to kill you"". It's honestly disturbing, and scary. Just a few months ago, she stole over $2000 from my father (who has no job and basically survives off of my grandparents wealth for food and a home). The reason she took the $2000? Because she ordered tons of Uber eats, and paid for her friends Uber to my house so they could do drugs and do stupid shit. I cannot believe my father wouldn't report her to the police for stealing this much money, for this reason. It makes my blood fucking boil, it makes me feel like I want to literally explode. Not only has she stolen from my father, but from my mother, my step father, myself, and we suspect others too. Not nearly as much though. All in all, she has probably stolen about $5000 in total, which she has made no effort whatsoever to pay back to us, and she feels ""proud of it."" One of her main problems is her friends, her friends are terrible terrible people, who are basically the ones teaching her to do all this horrible shit to my family and I. Yet my parents continue to let her see them and get busted by cops. Speaking of cops, she has probably called them 10 times to our house in the middle of the night for shitty fucking reasons (like my mom taking her phone, or saying she must do her homework). I feel so bad for these cops, someday I would like to join the police force, and she keeps making my family have a terrible image. My sister has been to the hospital psychiatric ward about 5 times now, each time proving useless. There is no longer any hospital in Ontario that can help her. All in all, she is an evil, evil person, and there is almost nothing I can do about it (as far as I know), because of my immediate family who refuses to take any actions to punish her for her actions and hold her accountable. I can't take it anymore, either they need to fucking scold her hard to straighten her up, or I need to leave, for a good period of time to get away from this situation. This is taking a massive toll on me, and I won't take it anymore. Someone please, I beg you, what can I do??? Please, please, please.

TLDR; my sister is an evil evil evil fucking person, who lies, steals, and manipulates others to her own advantage. She is a borderline criminal, and I can't stand being with her when my family won't do anything about it. I need someone to help me soon, or I need a long time away from her before all hell breaks loose.",10Dec2020,1
317,"I work in a retail environment. We have recently been having a pest problem with roaches in our break room. I rarely bring in food because of this. Recently a coworker of mine came to me and told me there were dead roaches in the freezer. I, being disgusted, decided we should toss out a lot of the items in the freezer and clean it out. We throw out a bunch of popsicles, a bag of vegetables, a water bottle filled with some other liquid. I leave in the freezer my one coworkers frozen lunches as they are on the wire rack above where the dead roaches are and they are covered in cardboard, so I doubt they are contaminated. 

The next day my other coworker, who I generally don’t get along with in the first place, goes into the freezer and flips out. Apparently the vegetables were his and were expensive items and he was holding them for friends. He is yelling and I tell him that if he wants to blame anyone to blame me, as it was my decision to throw them out. I ask him what the cost was to replace him and he tells me it was about $100 worth of items. I go and grab $100 that I had on me and offer it to him. $100 is definitely not the type of money I have to throw around and it was just really odd timing that I had it in cash. He refuses the money and admonishes me and tells me that I had no right to throw it out. I try giving him the money again and he once again refuses. This was about a week ago.

Today I am closing with my manager and she tells me that my coworker wants me to go and buy gift cards to replace the items that we tossed. I am informed that he has been saying that I stole his property and that I deliberately only threw out his stuff and that I’m mean to him. I honestly had no idea whose food belonged to who other than the frozen dinners. I think it’s ridiculous. I offered to pay him in cash what he told me the worth was and he refused. I have since used that cash on presents for friends for the holidays.

319,"Hi, I'm a high school student in my senior year(16 years old) from India living in the midle east, and for my college degree i have two options. I can either go for my passion which is spaceflight basically try to be an astronaut(long shot i know) or get a job at a space agency if I get rejected(most likely will). Or I can get a finance degree, a cpa and work in investment banking which isn't my passion but I am pretty good at accountancy and the maths involved, and the job pays a shit ton of money.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, if i want to work in spaceflight/human spaceflight nasa is the place to be, and I'm, not an american citizen, i wish i was born there to pursue my dream job but I'm born in a corrupt country where if your dad is a politician you get a headstart in everything and we have no plans of human spaceflight. I could go through naturalization, get a green card become an air force officer and work in my dream industry, which is all very risky and is gonna be a tough process(immigration) and cost quite a bit. The advantage is that the military pays off your student debt. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, my college choice is in the uk where job prospects are good in finance and the visa process isn't as hassling, all i know is  i do not want to live in india or return there again.

Should I even bother trying to be an astronaut? It's an extremely long shot and thin chance, If i dont become one i can still work in a great industry and i wont have the regret of not trying, but its an extremely long process and american citizenship is not easy to get. 

I am so depressed now because my life's dream is basically impossible because my dad lost almost my entire college fund in the stock market and buying alcohol, and I'm born in the wrong country for this industry, my family lives very comfortably but they dont have that kind of money for my college, i will end up taking out loans and what if my citizenship gets rejected?

7th grade I was bullied hard. before this (elementary school) I was a stud.

I have no motivation to do things I know I want to and need to do. Has anyone been in a similar situation? i’m just tired all the time and so lonely it’s unbearable.",10Dec2020,1

324,"So this is primarily aimed at those with experience in both public and private schooling (guess public grammat schools fit in here too) but everyone else is very welcome to chime in. Especially in the UK

Just to be clear, this is not a boast nor a what if post. I'm happy and proud of where I am. I just like to weigh up possibilities and scenarios from an analytical and logical perspective. Plus I've been asked about public vs private schooling for the children of cousins because I'm just that guy. So I don't expect a dont look to the past, look to the future...dw I am :)

I've always been a pretty intelligent guy. Went to school a year early but had to repeat a year because of capacity issues so I'm in the correct year. Always popular because of being clever and having a mother working in the same school. I was pushed up a year but pulled back down when it was realised that the only teacher capable of teaching us was leaving. Then I moved onto Secondary where my first geography lesson consisted of me answering every question thrown my way, barring one where I got embarrassed. Finished secondary with the best results of the year.

I was offered a scholarship but turned it down after seeing the stark difference between those who could and could not afford the lifestyle. Everything was perfect but I couldn't get the fact that there were two separate dining halls(I say halls, one was a little room with concrete floors and steel chairs serving pot noodles) for those who could afford school dinners. I would firmly be in the poor section, I'm not from the best areas...gunshots, drugs, fights, robbery and friends stabbed (he is alive and doing well). Not that I wouldn't fit in, it would just take effort and I'm a lazy mf.

I opted to go to a public college (uk so 16-18 years old) on those grounds. Cant lie, hated it. Got sh*t grades and suffered from depression but that's in the past. Now at my dream uni and dream course (and surrounded by private school kids...)

But yeah. I'm wondering what life would have been like if I went private. What were the differences, both good and bad? Did you benifit from the connections made? What did you enjoy and what didnt you enjoy? What did you enjoy and dislike about public schooling? Anything else you think is relevant is welcome too, all input is valued :)

Thanks guys!",10Dec2020,1

also i'm the first in my family to go to college, so i'm kind of figuring all of this out on my own so any other college related advice + scholarships are appreciated!

328,"I was playing a game of among us one day and met this really nice lobby. Super chill and fun. We made a discord channel together and it was really nice. 
A guy said ""howdy"" in the general chat and I responded by saying hey.

 From there we just started talking in the private DMs. We spoke everyday for 5 days and became pretty close. We spoke about our problems, school stuff and all that. We sent each other photos of our faces and told each other our real names. He sent a photo of his face in the general chat but I just sent a pic of my face to him and only him. He's average in the looks department..but anyways.

He's fun to talk to and relate. Sometimes we even made sexual jokes and teased each other. 

For some context: I'm indian (yea sorry for the bad grammar) and he's American, I'm 14 and he's 15. I got strict parents and they're very serious about who I talk to. Especially guys. That is also the reason they have not given me my own phone.

So I found out that he thought that being called daddy was wierd. So I started calling him daddy. I kept doing it for fun because he didn't like it..until he started to like it. Soo somehow we ended up sexting. It felt great while we were doing it. But after a few minutes..i felt wierd and gross. Like..i did something very wrong. I'll get to what happened after that.

So I asked him:

""We're friends right?""

""Idk maybe""

""What you think we could actually be together?""

""We could make it work""

Now as I mentioned I said that I have strict parents. Especially my mom. She would totally freak out if she found out. She also might make me delete among us and discord. I just felt wierd...because...well there's the location difference..and the next is my mom. I love her with all my heart and don't wanna break her trust.

So we discussed things about how we could make it work. Well..he did. I kept saying that I didn't want my parents to find out anything about this and that this couldn't work. What my parents think and do is very important to me. So I dont wanna have like..an online relationship, keep it a secret and then suddenly tell my parents one day. That would be horrible. 

I feel horrible. I should've stopped. I never shouldve let it get this bad. Now that he likes me..I..um..I dont know what to do. I dont know whether I feel the same way about him. Its not that I dont like him. I...just..dont know. I dont wanna reject him either. I can't do that now..we've already shared so much private info and have spoken about a lot of private things. And its not just that.

He's a very supportive and understanding guy. He's never been too pushy or creepy or anything like that. Honestly I dont know why i feel this way..i think its because I'm terrified of what my parents are gonna think..
Plus I just think its wrong. Talking to guys online is the ONE thing I was told not to do by my parents. Also I was strictly told to not share any private info. And I...did all of that.

Ok soo back to the time after the sexting was done. I feel very wierd and gross. Like I've done something..so..so wrong and unforgivable. He didn't feel anything like I did and kept doing his best to calm me down (I was kinda freaking out a lot).

 I just wish all this had never happened.  It was all my fault. I should've stopped it..i let it become sexual between us...and theres absolutely no one i can tell. I don't know whether to cut ties with him and say goodbye..or somehow just go back to normal.

What have I done? Have I done something wrong? What do I do now?",10Dec2020,1
330,"Mobile - I’m sorry in advance

I’m not sure how to start this so I guess I’ll go from the beginning. When I was a kid my dad and I were sort of inseparable.. all because of sports, he was like this Encyclopedia of knowledge about useless records and shit no one gave a shit about. but I’ll admit it was pretty cool as a kid knowing my dad knew more than all the other fathers bout sports. He made a career with it actually, writing articles bout everyone and everything and used to even write about me and my teams sometimes. Now he is some bus driver till he retires cause the paper shut down... not important but I felt like it should be there. 

Growing up I sort of noticed things about my father. How he was missing half my sports games.. I’d be the first one out of the dressing room but last to leave the arena. Which didn’t make sense cause he just watched the last half of the game.. so what’s taking so long to pick me up? same with school.. He’d be almost 30-1hr late picking me up Or I noticed he drank a lot... and so did my friends(didn’t clue in till I knew what beers did in my teens) always had cases around... empties that needed to be put away etc. Not only that, he would drink them alone in the garage while on the phone. Which at the time seemed fine cause he volunteered running a female west coast hockey league. So I assumed it was work calls. Of course none of this really stood out to me until well I was older. Specially the “business trips” which were true but also a cover at the time.

Fast forward to when I was 14. My parents sat me and my sister down at the table... and told us my dad packed all of his things and planned to just Dip and leave and never come back, until he had a change of heart last second confessed to my mom (pretty sure she caught him) that (yup you guessed it) he was cheating with his old high school girlfriend who moved across the country to be with him. My mom promised to work it out (it never did ) etc which is funny because a short time before they told us.. I had a hunch! No concrete evidence but just thought worst case scenario to myself “what if my dads cheating?” With it being true. Knowing he was ready to just fucking leave . I subconsciously killed him in my heart... my sister left to run away with her boyfriend leaving me alone for 8 months of cops coming to the door daily... fights me sleeping outside. Breaking into my school to sleep in the nurses room or just to get away from the toxic shit  I dealt with day in and day out when I was 15/16 years old. I ended up moving out the second I could once I graduated

Few years later we still talk and I was at his wedding with his new wife who can’t stand how close my dad and I were and refused to let me stay with them when my ex and I broke up and needed a place to crash. Not like it mattered.. cause we never became really talkative like we used to. He went Hero to zero and he IMO Isnt my father anymore... but I’ll sit beside him at the dinner table. No matter how hard I try.. no matter how hard he tries I just can’t really forgive him. 

Present day... nothings change we talk once every few months. Hell he sold our family’s house and I had no idea where he was until a few weeks ago.. but something clicked in my brain. I am very much like my father when I really don’t want to be. I don’t mean in terms of what he did. Just his mannerisms, the way he talks I talk. The posture he used to drive is what I use to drive. I notice I have a few drinks right after work like he did. When he is speaking to someone I stand and converse the same way he used to... I would literally catch myself doing these things and would have to literally stop myself.

I do not want to be anything like my father... but these things I can’t stop. Any advice on how to stop these habits ?",10Dec2020,1

332,Some of you might know about the SAT exam you have to take in order to give to college. Honestly I got an 1180 on my first SAT I took and I expected it. Then I studied and did all these books and all that and took my second score and got an 1190. This honestly broke me. It made me so depressed and I cried for hours and hours since this was my last chance. My dad is disappointed in me and frankly enough I can’t disagree with him. My brothers both got above a 1300 and I couldn’t do a single thing about it. I just can’t take the stress anymore. This completely broke me and I can’t focus straight or do anything. I just don’t have the brain capacity to even think straight anymore and honestly I don’t know if I’ll even perform well in college. All my friends got above a 1300 and I was so jealous of them. I would just lay in bed crying because I couldn’t do any good. What’s up with my life. I can’t do anything right. I did at least 35+ hours of studying over the course of a month and only got a 10 point increase. I just can’t deal with life anymore. It’s so depressing for me and I’m not smart at all. It’s so gruesome to even talk to my friends because I start getting mad and jealous of them. I just can’t anymore with life since it’s just so unfair. I’m left with complete regret and all I wanted was just a 1300. On top of that I wanted to cancel my score send and I called college board to do it and they couldn’t even do that. After I hung up the call I cried even more. My dream college was getting a score of an 1190 and their average SAT score is a 1320. My life is in complete shambles. I don’t want to even talk to any of my friends anymore. I’m left with regret and I can’t do anything besides just cry. I wasted so much time studying and got a 10 point boost. I usually bang my head against stuff while even thinking about it and honestly I started crying mid way writing this. I can’t do it anymore. Life is so unfair and treats those who take it for granted better than those who don’t. I just can’t...,10Dec2020,1
333,"My mom is in high-risk pregnancy right now due to her age being in the mid-30s, low, blood, diabetes, and baby's location is low. Her husband (my stepfather) use to care about her all the time and so would his family, but yesterday was my mom's birthday and he didn't even wish her even though he totally knew it was her birthday since my mom's past realtor sent her some money (which goes straight to stepfather anyways). This made my mom extremely sad because in the past all of my stepfather's family would wish her happy birthday and my stepfather would get a bunch of balloons decorations and gifts, but not a single one even said happy birthday including my stepfather. Not only that, A day before my mom's birthday, he told her that he was going to sleep in the other room so that she isn't ""disturbed"" when he wakes up. My mom thought maybe he was setting up a surprise, but to her surprise, she woke up to absolutely nothing... I'm in college and my sister is with my biological dad, so she was all alone in the house during her birthday without her husband even wishing her or even buying a simple gift/flower. He started being a jerk after getting his green card and argued with my mom about why a picture of me was on the wall but not his father's, even though his whole family is on the wall while there was only one picture of me and he wanted to take it off. And it's not like I've been bad to him, I legit buy him a gift every time for his birthday while he doesn't do the same, so it should be the other way around. He calls my mom ugly all the time and just isolates her from his part of the family kind of like showing them that she doesn't exist anymore. There are way too many other bad things about this guy that I have yet to even discuss, but right now I need some advice to give to my mother, she really needs it. The situation right now:  my mother is 4 months pregnant and the baby is coming in April. My stepfather gets his citizenship meeting in June. Right now all money is handled by my stepfather, so she doesn't have any money, but I will send her some money I saved up if need be. What should she do? She says she wouldn't really be able to raise the child alone and really want to stay with my stepfather, but she is dying on the inside because he doesn't love her and I think he would ditch her soon after he gets U.S. citizenship. Should he leave, will he have to pay child support until the kid turn 18? He is working as a security guard and showed like 40k income in 2019. I really don't know what she should do because he has everything and I feel like as soon as he gets citizenship he will leave, and I don't even know if we can say that it is illegal.

When I’ve brought up the pandemic, my dad just mentions how the seats are distanced on the plane. They don’t think the pandemic is a legitimate excuse to not go on vacation. My dad asked my aunt if she was going down with us and scoffed when she said no because of the pandemic. I don’t want to go!

I don’t mean soulmate as in “only one person I am perfect with”. I mean it as in, an intense and loving relationship through your entire life journey. Kind of like Ned and Ariel’s relationship (from the Try Guys) - it’s really cute to see how close they are, even after taking a grain of salt (since the internet doesn’t show everything). 

I want that for me, to just click and be super close from the beginning, and maybe move in with each other a little too soon, and be spontaneous and totally in love. I’m just having a hard time in my personal life and relationship these days, and even after being in couple’s therapy, I’m just kind of sad about how things are now. I’m just not crazy about my partner at the moment, and I wish I was.

Can that intense love be created rather than found? If so, how? I know the quarantine situation isn’t helping either - we don’t get to see each other much, and living at home with family makes intimacy difficult. 

These days I feel like he doesn’t *get* me like I want him to, and we have communication issues. Do I need to work harder at the relationship? Is it just a temporary slump?

341,"TW: attempted s*icide (I'm censoring since idk if that gets blocked)

So for some context: 
When I was 7 my brother attempted to commit s*icide (he was stopped) and that left me with some pretty big issues since I was the one who found him. 

Since then it's been generally accepted that my role in my family &amp; friends group is that of the support, I'm there for everyone and put them first (not the healthiest I know) 

I've dealt with depression for several years, I didn't want to be medicated because I was scared of missing doses and of the side affects (I'm incredibly forgetful and regularly forget my ADD meds). It may not be the best reason but it made sense at the time. 

I've had my lows and while I wanted to never tried to do anything because the memory from when I was 7 and how horrible it would be for those around me made me keep going. 

Flash foreword to a few days ago when my boyfriend tried to kill himself and is now hospitalized. I'm not very close to his friends (those who know) so I can't get support from them (I'm better at giving support as mentioned earlier). 

And it's kind of feeling like the straw that broke the camel's back, I spiraled and I haven't really been able to function properly (get out of bed, eat, drink etc) only the things I have to or can't get out of. 

I'm doing my best to be there for him and support his recovery, as well as I know that once he gets out he can't know how badly I spiraled. 

But I'm worried I'm making this about me, that rather then focusing on him and those around him I'm too focused on myself and my issues?

342," 

Some or Most parents “like” to show off their authority to their child. They use their “parenthood” to justify their absolute control over us. My parents never fully understood me. They think that I don’t care or love them at all when I fail to do a simple task that they ask me to do. They emphasize the little things and belittle the major things that we do. I understand that they are the ones who raised us and educate us. But, I think that should never be the excuse of why they want to put us in a cage. 

So, my solution is to give them what they want and never converse with them about anything anymore. Because, it seems that every time I say something, it will always lead to a problem that will cause me to pain not only physically but also mentally.

Before I wrote this, I pledged to myself that I will never talk to them about simple things anymore. If they wish to talk, I’d respond but I will never lead it any further. I can’t get any simple conversations with them. It will always lead to something problematic and serious. It's hopeless. 

Once I get a job, I will not hesitate to help them not only financially but also with other things as well. I just feel like that at this period of my life, I should not express my feelings and my thoughts to them anymore. I believe that it will save me a lot of time and prevent me from getting hurt.

I can’t explain myself very well since I speak too fast and I have mild stuttering which I might have developed because of them.

They treat my attitude as like I am doing incredibly evil things like drugs, alcohol, and fornication. They don’t even realize that I have no interest in any of them. They treat me like I am some incredibly evil piece of shit.

One simple mistake that they don’t like, it will progress into something unnecessarily bigger. It will lead to physical and verbal abuse. They will bring up things like “I am your father/mother, I am the reason why you are alive today. If it weren’t for us you won’t be able to eat and go to school. Don’t you think about that? Don't you appreciate what we do for you?” They say these stuff aggressively. They hit my head whilst doing this and make me feel like a fucking lowly creature. They ask me “Are you brave? Are you not afraid of us? You wan’t to fight?”

TELL ME! is that the right thing to say? Do you think it will help anyone that way?

343,"So I have no one I can talk to, no friends nothing like that and I feel like if I dont tell whats going on, it will make me explode. 

I am experiencing very strong anxiety and probably depression. Feeling like a failure. 

Long story short. 

Have two kids, partner and I was forced or invited to move in to my mothers house. She was never strong but always weak. 

When the whole COVID shit started here I was looking for another house because it was too small and I had a second baby on the way. Than the COVID happened and my mother said ""why dont you move in with me ? what if I cannot see my grand kids because of quarantine ? We will help each other and when it its all over you can move out to a place you want to"" It seemed a good idea because with a second baby on the way any help is great so thats what happened. 

All was great for a while and than I lost my job, (never failed to pay rent or bills) I realized my mother has a problem with alcohol, drinking late at night screaming, arguing all that stuff and than not remembering shit. 

Than even when she was sober I heard ""get the fuck out, dont want too see you"" 

I had no means of moving out I still dont. 

I was very angry at her and one day after she sobered up I was just malignant to her word wise. Saying the same shit she did for the last couple of nights and days like ""oh no you again"" or some other stupid shit. The anger got the best of me.

Next day my brother came and she moved out because ""she felt in danger"" she manipulated him into thinking I was the evil one all the time. She said I got 4 weeks until I find a place or live on the streets as she is ""getting rid of the house""

My father is still here but he is not on my side as if he does not care. (he will end up on the street too but not bothered.)

I feel betrayed I feel hopeless I am doing everything I can; got some legal advice but its taking forever to sort things out. I love my children to death and I am very worried about them. I want them to have a happy and healthy place to live.

I dont sleep, I am shaking, my heart cannot stop pounding.

My piano teacher is awesome, but I also have to take Solfeggio (ear training) and choir. The choir is the worst, I literally take it with people who are in highschool and I just feel like I don't belong there. I just can't sing, and think I'm constantly making a fool of myself when we have to sing alone. I have no will to practice anymore, most of the time I don't sit down at the piano once.

2. Possibly how to actually sing, for an absolute beginner please (If it helps I'm a bass)",10Dec2020,1

If my partner has an issue and tries to bring it up I get super irritated/emotional and I hate myself for it so much.

The third day he asked me “So how long will it take till I get to know you” and I said back “The more we talk you will” so we talked everyday and when we were about to go offline he would shyly say it was nice playing with me or he had fun. I can hear him smiling when speaking to me at times. 
We were playing a game and he cussed. I jokingly said “Language” I can tell he got flustered, he started stuttering. Like “I- erg- o“ and he kept making like moaning sounds. He did it when he almost hit the ball as trying to reach for it. But he did that like 3 times. More than once. He sent me random emojis saying “they do be emojis tho 💯💫🤍🗯🗯👋🤙😀☺🤩🤨” idk but I feel like there some message in it. He sometimes sends smirks and winks to me...idk. 
I can tell he loves playing with me cuz he asking when ima get on, always tells me he had fun playing with me. He knows I like Star Wars and he actually watched a whole movie of it. The dedication.

Neither of us is the jelous type and both have had interest in the idea of being poly but it’s also a very scary prospect...

More people come into the shop and then I didn't want to be a bum so I brought my tiny crystal up to the front. We chat a little and he goes... ""alright you're all good to go.. did you need help with anything else?"" and I go "" but wait you didn't take my payment"". He then smiles, nods his head, and gives me a thumbs up "" Yup you're all good to go.. did you need help with anything else"". Then it hits me that he was giving it to me for free. I like laugh nervously and go right "" RIGHT YES AHA thank you... so much... it was nice meeting you"". There were other people around and I felt so awkward and dumb that I didn't catch his drift.

I’m a 23 year old guy who’s been in a relationship with my beautiful amazing fiancée (we’ve been together for 5 years). I just want to say that she’s the most amazing caring woman I’ve ever known, well she is most the time. Recently she’s been lashing out and taking everything out on me. I understand how much she’s going through, as she’s currently grieving the death of her grandmother,I try to emphasise but I find it difficult due to my traumatic childhood. My issue is that recently she’s been swearing at me a lot. When I say swearing I mean calling me a bitch, a pussy, say to go fuck my self and most recently to “ go cry you whore”. Another thing she’s been doing is trying to force me to have sex with her. I know this seems like a positive but I’ve got so much on my mind at the moment that I just don’t feel like I can. Last time we did it was less than a week ago so I don’t think that’s the issue.

I’ve tried so many times to voice my issues with her but she doesn’t seem to care instead she screams break up with me then and when I say no she resorts to calling me a bitch. I know I love her and I really want to be with her but the way she speaks to gets so bad it makes me want to rip out my hair.

I don’t believe in the old fashion my wife needs to listen to me because I’m the man because that’s absurd however I wish she’d listen when I say no or when I ask her to stop speaking to me that way.

I’ve tried every thing even to have a specific time that we can sit together and communicate but when I suggested this she said “no go fuck yourself I hate you”

She says it in a way of saying that I'm stupid. She also made it out like I was tulid when I first told her that I wanted to do the degree. 

From a young age (9) I was told I was stupid. I genuinely believed I was. I dont know why my parents started saying that, there was no indication that I was at that age. Throughout secondary school, i never tried, because I genuinely thought I would fail. I thought you had to do your best - without revising, and then leave it at that. This is how my parents bought me up. (I literally can't get it into her head you have to work hard to achieve things) They wouldnt bother my younger sister or older brother to do chores but would bother me and my older sister at the same time they would call us stupid. My parents and my older brother would try to make me feel crap about myself. I dont speak to my older brother anymore. 

I wish I said something back then, but when my sister told he teachers (same school as me) that she was getting bullied they did nothing. My parents made it out like she was weak for speaking up. 

Now that I'm trying to get my life sorted, my brain is in a better place, I'm not 18 (which is a good thing, because I was in such a bad place). I used to be good at maths and alot the other things I'm learning they're not taught at school anyway, so it'll be new for every student enrolled on the course.

anyways, i’m a 17 year old male that should be somewhat proud of myself as i literally just reached 100 pounds lost and am finally no longer considered obese. i’m glad i did this but i’m not really proud of myself. i have trouble thinking i did anything really amazing besides do something necessary for my health. i would obviously get teased when i was younger for being really obese and it got to where i hated being in public so much that i homeschooled. now years later i’m still homeschooled with absolutely 0 real life friends. i have no idea where i’m going in life and have no real talent. i enjoy video editing but don’t think i’m really skilled enough to take that anywhere yet. i have very little faith in myself in getting good at anything even if i really want to. 

now back to the no friends thing, i used to have a couple friends that i’d play video games with and whatever. however, they were crazy. there was never a serious moment and it was always really offensive humor they’d do which got to me. i have guilt over this because i ended up being a massive troll online because at the age of 12/13 i thought as long as it’s a joke anything’s okay. i fucking hate myself for that. i recently stopped talking to them and am in a discord community with some other people. i made a couple friends there and it went amazing. i had similar interests with a couple of them so i could talk about them without feeling bad, and they even invited me to play games once. we played and it was literally the most fun i’ve had gaming ever. i think i got over excited and probably ended up talking too much to them bc i’m not used to having normal friends. it seems like they’ve been avoiding me the last 2 weeks. now i’m staying up all night thinking about this because i was so fucking happy and genuinely think they’re awesome but i somehow fucked it up. i don’t wanna mention this to them because i feel like it’ll make it worse and i also feel extremely pathetic. i know it’s so dumb that i’m obsessing over this. i also feel bad ranting because i know other people have worse problems and feel worse, because i’m not suicidal. i don’t wanna die. but fuck i wish i wasn’t born sometimes if that makes sense. i’m sorry this is so messy. is there any advice on how to be more confident in myself and hopefully be a better human being? or any advice on my situation at all? thanks.",10Dec2020,1

373,"This girl I grew up with is having a very public mental breakdown over social media. I want to help her but I don’t know her well enough to step in really. But her posts are very worrisome and people are taking advantage of her financially. 

What she’s posting online: 
-open about taking mushrooms daily 
-She is giving all of her stuff away for free (BMW, huge tv, laptop.. etc)
-painting her entire apartment (ceiling and all) with nonsensical quotes.
-posting her Yelp reviews on every local 7/11 asking them for “recycling space” and for the owners to donate their homes. 
-buying stuff with fake money and boasting about it. 
-posted her only fans balance. 
-she’s getting a neck tattoo tomorrow 

I really don’t know her super well, just through mutual friends and from middle/high school.. but she asked for help with an “art idea” a couple weeks ago, and I messaged her because I’m an artist. She was looking for help with a nonprofit and wanted to make shirts, so I referred her to someone. Her behavior has increased dramatically since then. I noticed that when she started giving stuff away, the friend I referred to her was taking some of it. 

I feel slightly responsible and want to say something to him, or her. It’s obvious she is going through something and taking things away from her (even though they are free) seems fucked up. Also, there have been several other people asking her for money. 

She has a history of chaotic behavior and I just want to do something. I am really worried about her. She posts “I’m not crazy, fuck off Karen’s” often, so idk how to approach her without upsetting her.

As her girlfriend, there's only so much I can do to help her when she isn't feeling well. These days we are both working at least 5 days a week, so we haven't been able to see much of each other even though we live together.

Today she was fine during the day, fine at work, until she got home and suddenly she's putting all this depressing stuff on her Instagram story, messaging me telling me that she thinks she's ugly and fat (she isn't), that her life isn't worth anything, that it wouldn't matter if she died, all that. It's not the first time she's had an episode like this, but some times it ends in her harming herself or drinking, and I have to deal with the repercussions. I'm at work as she's messaging me all this, and as I'm typing this up.

She said that if she had the energy she'd be in the bathtub with her wrists slit.

What do I do? I've had doubts about our relationship in the past, but I really feel like this time if she doesn't get professional help soon, I'm going to have to end it.

375,"Okay, so I admit it my therapist and I had a complicated relationship and so many people wouldn’t approve but I don’t need any negativity. So before being my therapist he was my support worker at a group home. He was there while he was working on his degree for counselling and the group home was pretty abusive so in secret he offered me counselling. I wasn’t allowed to be touched by anyone in the group home because I was a danger and violent. Furthermore, I wasn’t offered much therapy besides behavioural support because I had BPD. But he showed me love (not romantic) and hope in a time there wasn’t any. He hugged me when I cried  and comforted me, something only one or two other people have done. He showed me that I was loveable. He broke a hundred rules and fought me for me. While at Juvie and Forsencic Hospital we talked in secret because he wasn’t allowed to talk to me. He supported me for I don’t know maybe 2 years. After I got of all that mess I was back with my biological parents with little to no support and he offered a hand. After a while the voices in my head became hard to bear and I stopped talking to him because the voice said that it would hurt him. But after a lot of strength I started talking to him again. Because he moved out of my town we video chatted and he said he would visit me whenever he was in my town. And he did visit me once. He held my hand and hugged me while I talked about my feelings. Well the other day I was talking about something tough and I took the screen and hugged it like I would hug him. Don’t get me wrong we did this before. But he didn’t comfort me or hug me or anything. Before I could say bye the wifi dropped and we made plans to talk next Wednesday. But before that, I texted him (yes I’m allowed to text him) and asked him why he didn’t comfort me. And than started impulsive texting him how I felt used and how I had been staying away from touch recently because it reminded me too much of trauma and that it was really hard for me eat cetera I told him I was hurt. I deleted the messages because it was embracing, I wish I hadn’t. But after shouting at him through text I had a breakthrough I felt the weight on my soul and told him we should talk about all this next session. Don’t all therapist or at least most therapists think anger is a break through. I also told him that I loved him, yes we say I love you to each other but not romantically. I think I said something like I’ll love you forever, so much because in the next 2 days Monday and Tuesday I texted him how I was feeling and how sorry I was for shouting at him and the messages were seen but never replied. I though nothing of it and waitied for wednesday. Which is today and I called him at our scheduled time and he didn’t answer. I called him repeatedly in intervals until 9 when our session would end.  So I searched online about what to do and the web told me to see if he was okay so i messaged his son and he told me my therapist was okay. I don’t get why he would do this after everything we have been through. And I don’t know if I can move on because every therapist I have been with have been really toxic. Additionally I don’t think I’ll find a therapist who will hug me comfort me say I love you and all that.

I struggle mainly because I was bullied in middle school so that really fucked up my confidence.
until one day I had enough and since I was a bigger kid than most, I finally had the guts and stood up for myself, I fought two kids separately and I won.

They stopped from there on. But that didn’t even raise my confidence tbh. I was kind of chubby in middle school and freshmen year. Sophomore year I came back to school and I grew like 4 inches and lost 15-20 lbs. so I had a small “glow up”.

I had a friend group of girls in Spanish class, I asked them how attractive I was, I’m comfortable talking to them because I’ve known them since elementary. They all said 7/10 8/10 . So I guess I’m average/decent?  well the point is lately a few times through the summer.

A few cute girl’s would try to talk to me, Idk I guess you could call me a coward. But I never knew what to say. I would have a casual conversation then say bye. Because this happened at a store. And then I had Drivers Education segment 2. And two cute girls were talking to me.

I just don’t have a clue on how to flirt sadly. I’m pretty dense I didn’t even realize they were flirting with me until weeks later. same thing happened at work. And throughout the school year last year. A cute girl was also trying to flirt with me but she was being really pushy. So I didn’t know what to do I felt cornered, I caught her a few times staring at me, I don’t know if that really means anything.

But I just don’t know flirting feels kind of awkward to me tbh. Is flirting necessary or can we just get to the point you know what I’m saying. Like instead of flirting,can I  say I think you’re cute can I have your snap?

Idk I’m not a fan of flirting, is it necessary or can I just be straight up. I don’t like the “talking” phase were people hang out for like a month. Before one of them asks each other out. 

Oh yeah I forgot to ask how can I raise my confidence. I play sports football/soccer I also play basketball. But I still struggle man I just keep remembering of how I was viciously bullied in middle school. And it makes me feel like a loser on the daily.",10Dec2020,1
377,"The title says it all. I find drawing a pointless way of expressing emotions and people get famous just by moving their hand over a paper to create something with colors. When i try to draw though( which the only time i draw is in art class in online school) , i am not happy and i cant find a point in drawing as i mentioned before. Also the teacher just gives us a topic and little time in my opinion (thirty minutes) to draw it, and the next time we have art she either continues with another topic or she gives us time to complete it. And therefore from the 30 minutes time limit i get anxious and cant even get myself to draw. Do you think its normal? Also how can i avoid this?

So when you were done talking to the teacher you would have to tell another person to come in.

So I  walked in the wrong room and I embarrassed myself in front of everyone (they were looking at me.)

383,"Before I get into this, I'm not searching for medical advice for my mother. I know she's in good hands. She in the care of one of the best neurologists in the world who specializes in this exact situation thankfully. I just need to find someone who has been through a similar situation to help guide me through the reality of the situation. I'm not looking for sugarcoating or attention, I just need something to help me cope. My entire family is pulling together through this, but I don't have the relationship with them that I have with my mom and nothing can replace that. I'm trying to be positive, but preparing for the worst right now is a reality and I just have to accept that....

Now,

A few days ago, my mother had a sudden rupture of an aneurysm in the middle of her brain near her brain stem. Luckily my brother was around and noticed her seizing after he got out of the shower and called 911 immediately and they said she had a pulse and her blood pressure was ""okay"" however she was unresponsive. She's currently in critical condition and suffered a massive stroke her first night in the hospital. She had a lot of blood on her brain causing her brain stem to herniate out of the bottom of her skull and also had swelling at the front of her brain. She's been medically induced into a coma to prevent her from getting worse. The doctor said that there is currently too much blood on the brain still that needs to drain before he can operate because it's just way to dangerous to go in there. 

I can't imagine losing my mother at only 24. She raised me as a single mother and we are incredibly close to each other. It's a relationship that I don't think I can ever recreate with anyone else. She's always been so supportive in my times of need when I just need someone to talk to. I'm fucking terrified and it doesn't feel real and it's just a waiting game at this point which I can't stand at all because I want to know right now whether or not she's going to survive. If she does survive, I'm afraid that she will never be the same person. This is the worst time possible that this could happen as well as the worst thing someone and live through. The emotional destress I've been through is unbearable and trying to stay strong and supportive for my younger brother is becoming too much for me. The way he seems to cope with it by constantly talking about what the doctor has been saying and discussing scenarios where she could survive, and I'm happy that it eases his mind doing so, but I can't stand hearing about it or thinking about it every minute of every day. I just want to forget that this has ever happened, I want to wake up from this dream if it is one. I would never want someone to experience a situation like this because it is so painful. I can't begin to fathom what my mother may be thinking if she is even able to think right now. 

I really need some advice on how to cope with this if anyone has been through a similar situation. If anyone has known somebody with a similar experience happen to someone they've loved, please tell me how it turned out for you, how you coped with it, how you distracted yourself from the situation enough to be sane for even a few minutes of peace. 

I'm so upset that this has happened around the holidays as well. All I want for Christmas is for my mother to live. I would literally do anything just to be able to talk to her and tell her I love her and have her say it back to me. I want to be able to call my mom again in the middle of the day just to talk about random bullshit that we understand about each other. I want her to send me recipes through out the week that she thinks I would like. I want her to notice my mistakes I've made and guide me through becoming a better person and learning about how I can improve on those mistakes. I just want my fucking mom to be okay, I want her to see me graduate college, have a baby, get married, see my kids graduate, spoil my kids to the point where it gets on my nerves because grandmas are always the best thing to a kid. I wanted to see her graduate college after 20 years of pushing through it and chasing her dream while raising my brother and I. She's the strongest person I know. She is my world and the only thing in this world I care about. I would do anything for her.

2020 fucking sucks.

387,"So I'm going to be turning 21 in February and have been out of a job since the first week of August. I used to work at a local Chinese restaurant (since March), the local supermarket (August '19 to March 13th), and before that I was getting my GED. My dad gave me the idea when I was laid off at the Chinese place to keep track of where I put in my applications &amp; what they would tell me over the phone or in person. So, I did. But first, I want to tell you what I think is keeping me from finding any type of employment:  


* I have a hand tattoo from the 1st knuckle of my thumb to the side of my wrist. (It's the Hunter's Mark from Bloodborne)  

* I've only been at my past 2 jobs for about 6 months. The 1st one I left because they played favorites &amp; only gave me (and many others around my age) the minimum amount of work time to be on the payroll. The 2nd one I was laid off from.  

* I have Misdemeanor Possession of an Illegal Substance on my record from when I was 16. I was young, hanging with the wrong crowd and really, REALLY stupid. That is the only thing on my record, I've never received a ticket.  

* I have severe anxiety mixed with a lovely dose of dysthymia (persistent depression). I have been taking strong medication for both of them, which has made me fail drug tests in the past.  


So, now that that's out of the way, here's the bread and butter: I have applied to exactly 153 jobs that I am qualified for (Highschool/GED Diploma), which mostly includes places like hotels, fast food, Walmart, Autozone, O'Riley's, YMCA, gas stations, library, factories like Pfizer &amp; Viega, and **many** locally run businesses. I can't begin to name them all. I have managed to at least talk to somebody on the phone once with about 80% of those, then my further calls as the weeks pass are either not answered, told they've hired someone already, or I get the ""We'll look into your application"" loop. **Zero interviews.** 

As you can imagine, the lack of getting anywhere in the job market has had a very big effect on my motivation, which hugely ties into my dysthymia.  


After I put in these last applications to the only places I have left to go, I am completely out of options. Driving out of town for work is not an option. I can drive my dad's old pickup truck - when it runs - and make 9 MPG on a good day, or ride my bike.  


I am completely out of options, and am BEGGING for help here...",10Dec2020,1

390,"As the title says, I'm currently suffering from a very common heart condition, I believe it's called SVT.  I have constant missed heartbeats creating a really uncomfortable feeling, and every once in a while my heartrate will speed up to 170 for a while.  I've been to several cardiologists, they've all told me how incredibly common this is and that ""most people experience this in their lifetime"".

There's two solutions to this that I've been informed about:

1. Taking medication to keep it from happening.
2. Get a cardiac ablation to stop the problematic nerves, a more permanent solution.

The problem is that neither of these work for me.  The first thing I tried was the medicine - I've been on too many of them to count.  Not only do they not prevent the heart issue from happening, but they all make me feel terrible in other ways.  One of them made my chest feel extremely heavy, one made me lose all my energy, preventing me from doing basic everyday tasks, one made me extremely dizzy, one altered my taste, but none of them helped my issue even slightly.

About three days ago, I gathered my courage to try the riskier solution - a cardiac ablation.  According to my cardiologist, there's a 90% chance that they'll find the problematic nerves and go through with it, and a 10% chance that they won't be able to find it and can't go through with it.  I'm the most unlucky person I know, and unfortunately my notorious bad luck reared its ugly head once again and I fell into the 10% - they couldn't find the source of the problem and couldn't go through with the ablation.

They told me to stop taking the medicine and not to worry, but didn't give me another solution because they said there isn't one.  This was supposed to be an easy fix, but since nothing's working I'll ""have to live with it for the rest of my life"".

To make matters worse, all the side effects of the medicines I've tried have stuck with me, well after stopping taking them.  I now have SVT, an energy level so low I can't leave my chair or bed most of the time, and extremely heavy-feeling chest, and I'm constantly out of breath (don't worry, multiple COVID tests show I don't have it).

So, there's nothing left.  I now feel worse than death and I'm being instructed by trained medical professionals to live with it and accept that there's nothing that can be done.  I constantly dread the next heartrate increase, and when it happens I start dreading the next one.  It also doesn't help that I have a history of extreme anxiety, one so bad that even though I've been alive for 23 years, no doctor has been able to find medicine strong enough to handle it.

Am I SOL?  Do I really have to live with this?  Is there something that cardiologists don't recommend by defailt?  I'd honestly try essential oils/hopes and prayers at this point despite their meme-like status.  I've been suffering through this for over a year and death honestly sounds like a better experience than this.",10Dec2020,1
391,"With this online school crap going on I've been growing more stressed each day. I use my phone for about 8 hours a day, and I think I'm starting to crack. The teachers aren't helping in any way, so this semester I've gotten more homework than any other year. Some don't even log in and they expect us to do homework. Yeah, I'm going off on a tangent here so let me say what bothers me even more. 

Whenever I take tests I am a little anxious. Simple enough, right? Well take that anxiety and multiply it by 10 because that's what I feel when we take online tests (Google Docs, Kahoot, Quizz or just sending a pic of the paper). It's not necessarily because of the test itself but because of my colleagues. 

They keep pestering me to ""help"" them, usually sending them pics of my answers. I don't blame them. They must be stressed as well. But can they just shut up? I haven't even started answering the questions and they've already sent me 10 messages asking for the solutions. One time I didn't even send my test in time and it got cancelled because I helped them the entire time.

 I mean, how LAZY can you be?! You have a TON of information at your hands. You are probably at home. You probably have your notebook or your books. You most probably have access to the internet. So why the fuck should I tell you what I'm writing? Why should I be the one at risk because of you being either too lazy or stupid to even check out what that teacher's been explaining for hours? Not to mention that almost  every teacher sends us materials at the end of class in case you didn't note it down. If you want notes, I will send you them. If you want a second explanation, I will explain anything to you and do my best. But you have the audacity to ask me for the answers when I talk to you like what, 3 times an year? We are not friends. My best friend doesn't even ask that of me and I would be more than willing to help them because we have done each other favours and supported each other through the years. So why should I help YOU??? To be viewed as a ""good"" person? To be accepted in this community? Or be viewed as a ""nerd""?

 I don't even get everything right most of the time and just look over my notes 10 mins before the test. Why is it so hard? This is how I've gone through these years of school. The last time a teacher saw me trying to ""help"" another person, she asked me if I wanted to fail the class. Why the fuck didn't I stop then?

 I am incredibly stupid. Today this happened again and I want to tell everybody to fuck off. I want to delete WhatsApp but that would be even more stupid because I won't get in contact with anyone. I just want them to see that I can't see their messages and therefore cannot reply to them. Blocking them goes out of question because I am spending 3 more years with these people and I don't want whatever crap they give me when we will meet in real life. Ignoring them won't work, i'm telling you. I realise I come off as an arrogant piece of shit. I don't care anymore. At least here. 

I just wanted to vent but maybe people who have been through similar situations (or anyone really) would help me.

395,"I've never really had a friend in my life. I want to say I have but they always end up leaving after a while, usually they don't stay in touch so I take it as we weren't really friends to begin with. I mean sure, I've talked to some people but the more I think about it, the more I realize that we weren't really friends.

\*Background\*\*\*

Thinking of it now, a lot of it was heavily one-sided. I was the only one making any effort. There were a lot of hints I should've gotten sooner, some painfully obvious, however I just thought they were like that. Hell, one of them even kept straight up lying to me and I even knew it was total bs but I really thought it was me. Like my head making something up to force me to push them away (it's a little funny tbh). Turns out, they did want that. I'm just terrible at getting hints but the thing is, everyone uses hints at my school. It's hard to really tell if anyone is genuine now (it wasn't just that one person. A lot of them did the same thing) because I just don't understand and I, end up confusing a ""hint"" for them being genuine. As you can probably tell, I'm most likely very socially inept. I just don't get why it's so hard for some people to be honest.

I can understand that I'm not the most likeable person. I mean I'm quiet, a little too honest, standoffish, look a little apathetic, etc. I've made mistakes too, nothing really harmful (more heat-of-the-moment stupid things I said or did to try to make them like me a little more. Or I should've really thought first before I said or did something. I don't think I did something really bad yet). I was confident that they'd tell me if I did something to hurt them but, they never tell me anything. Even when I asked so I can be better and avoid making the same mistake, they either leave me on ""seen"" or make a way too obvious bs excuse. Hell, even if they just said, ""Your a jerk!"" it would give me **something** to work with. I can at least know where to start with myself. I just end up in this weird cycle where I rip myself apart, find out there's too much wrong with me, get overwhelmed because I don't know what to do, then I kind of auto-pilot from all the stress for a few months.

It would all be easier if they were just honest from the get go. If they really didn't want to be friends or know someone new, they could've just said so. Yea it would of hurt but, at least they were honest about it, you know? So now, I just think most people are like that. They only talk to me for their own enjoyment, that they can laugh about to their friends, all the while they hated me the whole time. That's what it feels like to me.

\*\*\*

Even with knowing that I still can't tell if things are one-sided. A lot of it is probably due to me being so lonely. I'm only focused on having someone to talk to Vs do they actually want to talk to me. I don't mean to throw a pity party but, it really has almost been a full decade of me being alone. I feel that has something to do with it. The next part is me knowing everyone is a different. It's pretty dumb to chalk everyone up being the same, when everyone is so drastically different from each other. I try my best to give everyone a fair chance when talking to them. Besides, there could be a reason they can't help which is why they don't talk much and/or take a while to reply and/or aren't fizzing with energy in texts/tone etc, etc. I don't think it's bad that I do this, I just want to know if the person i'm talking to actually wants to talk to me.

Before anyone says it, yes, I do ask them if they do like talking to me. But I run into the same issue I described before, they just lie. I can't tell they lied because I either realize too late or think it's in my head. I always try to think of the best of everyone until proven otherwise so, that's kind of another issue with myself too. I'm at a total loss.

I know I said I don't want to chalk everyone up to being the same but, is there a way to tell when someone is being genuine/actually liked talking to me? Like key things to look for in messages? or in gesture?

When developing and discovering my style as a kid I never got past this jeans+tee outfit as they reacted harshly to anything else. For example, scrubbing my eyes and making sexual comments when I tried eyeliner in 8th grade, or sexualizing me / slut shaming me when I tried a shirt that showed a small area of mid-riff when I was about 15. I do own clothes that I love (and hide), and wearing them for social media posts fills me with absolute euphoria - but I am so, so terrified of their reactions that I don't know how to transition from these ""safe"" outfits into what I truly want to wear. I feel like it's almost too late to make this change, they are already so used to how I act/dress, they may think I'm rebelling or confused - even though I have been longing to dress this way for almost a decade. I always promised myself that I would move out at 18 and become my own person, but things aren't looking too promising. I will be remain in school for the forseeable future, and likely wont move out until closer to 2023. I just don't understand how I can make this change so suddenly - but it really needs to happen for my own mental health. I'm sick of wearing the same ugly thing every day, and I want to even try some piercings? I am an adult, and have full control over my own body/style - but this fear is really restricting me. I have already made small steps (leaving makeup prodicts lying around, hoping to spark a conversation) Any suggestions on how I can prepare to make this transition? do I even need to talk to them about it? I don't have a good understanding of normal relationships, but I do know that most teenagers don't need to ask their parents permission to wear nice clothes 😅. I know it's a very silly fear, but it's just not as easy as putting on a skirt and walking outside for me. The thought of them seeing me in anything but modest, safe clothes makes me physically sick - but I really, really want to dress in a way that makes me happy. Advice is welcome and NEEDED ❤❤",10Dec2020,1

405,"Hi Everyone,

I feel like my life has been spiraling downward over the past year.

About 3 years ago, I left my comfortable IT Consulting job with the goal of starting an online business and ""getting rich"". I bought into the idea of building an eCommerce store and greatly underestimated the amount of work that would go into it.

I ended up doing decent and making a little bit of money from it, but I ended up dissolving my company and moved on to the next business idea.

I've since been through 4 or 5 different serious online business ideas, each one lasting a shorter than the last. I also got a marketing internship with the hopes of gaining valuable business skills, but I also eventually grew to dislike that job and eventually left shortly after becoming a full-time employee.

I feel like I'm a bright guy, I pick up skills very quickly and I think I'm moderately creative, I'm also great socially and feel like I can talk to anyone. But every time I start a business idea or a new job and think ""Do I really want to do this long-term?"", my brain starts to freak out and make excuses like ""I'm just not passionate about the work."" or ""When I find the right thing, I'll work hard then."" and I ultimately end up quitting.

I'm incredibly grateful that my girlfriend's family helps support me by allowing me to stay in their home. But I also feel like not having to worry about having to be fully financially independent is giving me a reason to not work hard and not take my work seriously.

Am I shooting myself in the foot? I want to build a business that pays me later on so I don't have to work, but I feel like having that intention is sets me up for failure. Because if I want to achieve success, I need to have a good enough relationship with work to the point where I want to do it long-term or feel that it's positively adding to my life more than just financially.

I guess my question is, how do you build a good enough relationship with work to the point where you don't feel like quitting at the first sign of trouble? How do I stick with an idea after it loses its ""honeymoon phase""? Is it foolish to ""follow your passion"" and just work on accepting that work is work?",10Dec2020,1

408,"How do I stop comparing my new guy to my ex?

I got out of a very toxic dysfunctional 5 year long relationship about a year ago. I was very attracted to my ex, and as a result frankly very jealous and insecure too. It wasn’t a fun time, but we were addicted to each other.

1 year post break up, I started seeing a new person. He’s great and I enjoy spending time with him, but since I don’t have the same addictive attraction/feelings for my new man, I often find myself comparing.

I can talk to the new guy about anything. He’s much more open, he’s funny, and he’s intelligent. He’s caring and fits my style of affection a lot better than my ex did. He and I seem very compatible. It’s been a breath of fresh air.

The problem is: I can’t stop comparing. As soon as my attraction fluctuates with my new love interest, I find myself thinking about my ex again. I even subconsciously compare everything down to the size of their “male parts.” My ex was very well endowed, whereas the new guy is only about half the size which really sucks. I wasn’t mentally trying to compare, but I can’t help it as soon as I find a “downside” to the new guy. 

I know it sounds like I’m not over my ex, but I don’t think about him until I find a reason to compare. Is this normal? What do I do!?",10Dec2020,1
409,"So I've made promises to some of my friends in which I'll give them something when I get the position as a student leader, and yes I did get the job. To be honest I was a bit hesitant since I've literally given atleast 70% to them. My first friend was really good to talk with before, and lately she doesn't even bother saying hello. My second friend is kind and polite, he knows how to keep his distance in a way that it isn't offensive. While the last one is, idk how to describe him, but I think the word for it is 'undependable'. The thing is I need to setup a tournament and I need atleast 8 teams for us to save our organization and my position as a student leader, so I've approached my third friend to join, since the tournament is about a mobile game, and he's playing that game, so I thought that he could do me a favor since its just him playing and enjoying the game while saving me from the job, and lately both my 1st and 3rd friend isn't responding to my messages and I felt bad to myself. I mean, I am willing to invest a part of myself to them and it definitely hurt my feelings knowing that they couldn't do the same. So this made me realize if I should still give something to my third friend? I've already given my 1st and 2nd friend something, and I don't think it made me happy giving something to my first friend. I am also serious about keeping promises, but at the same time, I hate investing a part of me to those people who couldn't reciprocate.

410,"This is a long one. And thank you in advance to all who read the whole thing. 

I am a 20 y.o female living with my parents. Where I am from it is typical for the children to stay with their parents until married off. And in my family according to our religion and societal expectations I am supposed get married in 4 years or so. 

My situation is simple, really. I don’t want to get married. And no amount of convincing or begging is going to change their mind about that. My parents will not allow me to stay unmarried. Or live a independent life. It is also a matter of status for them. 

And the reason I don’t want to get married is that all I have seen is failed marriages. Plus I am supposed to follow along my parents wishes and marry a guy they find for me. I can’t do that. If I was a happy go lucky person with no worries in this world (and no dreams and aspirations might I add) then I might have been okay with the situation. But no. I want to be independent, not be trapped in some guy’s kitchen cooking and cleaning after him. 

Other part of the reason is I have severe depression and what else not diagnosed in my 3 visit to the psychiatrist. I can’t have a family, nor do I want to, to be honest. 

Honestly my parents are the reason for my depression. But fortunately they have changed. But for the longest time I couldn’t accept them. And recently I realized why. I can’t accept them because they won’t be able to accept me. The real me. The one who don’t want to get married. The one who just wants to be free and independent. I subconsciously knew it and that was what was hindering me from reconnecting with my parents.

And honestly, if this was how they were when I was growing up, I wouldn’t have had depression. 

All these things aside. I wanted a general opinion, or different perspective on if I should run away. (I should add, it is just a rhetorical question) Is it selfish of me to run off for my happiness and leave back the parents who raised me ? Or should I just shove all my feeling aside and just accept my fate as it comes and just get married ?

Any feedback on the matter is really appreciated.",10Dec2020,1

412,"I'm currently a student at a well-recognised uni. My academic success is due to having feared what would happen if I weren't successful. I won't get particular, but I'm doing my current degree due to (in the past) having feared what would happen if I hadn't have done this degree (external fear). This fear took hold of what I was doing for the past few years.

414,"I posted this on relationship advice, I hope it's okay to post it here too. Please tell me if I should take it down instead.

(sorry for any grammar mistakes, my native language is italian. Also sorry if this post is all over the place I'm so desperate and this is my first one.)

I met this boy when we were 14-15 in high school and we just clicked instantly. Talking to him felt so effortless even though I'm a very shy and reserved person (now 20yo F)

The time we were friends was very rough patch for me. My parents were in the process of a divorce which included lots of physical and verbal fights and I often had to be the mediator in those situations so they don't kill each other. On top of that my relationship with my mom was completely ruined too because she would start fights with me for no reason other than to relieve stress. It left me with serious mental health issues. 

Back then I didn't notice but now thinking back it's clear that I was very possessive over him/the boy because I felt like he was the only one who cared about me and understood me. I was terrified that he would realise how fucked up I was and he would abandon me so I clang onto him. I also had a lot of anger in me and sometimes I started stupid fights over little things and I took it out on him. I wasn't conscious of all this back than and I though I was reasonable. I was so dumb and he didn't deserve that. These things weren't everyday things though. Our relationship was mostly fun and amazing, he would say he loved me and being with me more than anything.

At some point he asked me out. I said no even though I was in love with him. Seeing my parents' relationship fall apart made me terrified of being in a relationship and I also thought he deserved better. He used to tell me he was afraid of ending up alone and I could tell he really wanted a girlfriend. He said he would wait for me to be ready for a relationship even after I said he doesn't have to. Our friendship continued the same.

Like a year and a half after this he cut me off one day. I was so confused because it just happened out of nowhere. He didn't talk to me for days even though we were in the same class. I was scared to ask him why because he looked at me as if he didn't want to talk at all. After some days I decided to message him after school and asked him why he ignored me and he told me that he thought I had blocked him on messenger so he thought our friendship was over and moved on. I didn't block him. I had to do a complete reset on my phone when all of my apps got deleted and I think that's when he tried to message me and his phone didn't know what's up? Idk honestly I still don't understand it to this day. 

He told me I was also acting distant towards him lately. I told him that my family problems were worse than ever and I wasn't really in the mood to talk about them or anything but I still loved him and I was sorry. I asked him to be patient with me. It seemed like from out texts that we talked through everything and I thought our friendship would be the same the next day but it wasn't. 

I tried to talk to him but he didn't seem to want to answer me. I stopped after a while. We never talked again. After some days all of my friends in our class started to turn away from me and all of the sudden I realised I was completely alone and no one would even look at me. I figured they only became friends with me in the first place because i was friends with this boy and they were kinda his friend group. Now that he didn't want to be my friend anymore everyone followed him.

Maybe a week later I found out he started dating a girl he just met a month before that I never knew about but they broke up after 2 months I believe. I don't know if it's and important detail or not. Maybe he didn't need me anymore because he got a girlfriend?

That school year was hell for me. I hated being in school because everyone acted like I didn't exist and I hated being at home because my parents. I almost failed most of classes that year, fell into deep depression, started self harming and had panic attacks every day. 

The year after that I decided to switch schools and have a fresh new start. 3 years passed since then. In these  years I never stopped thinking about him. I never stopped missing him. I would replay our whole friendship and our conversations in my head over and over again. I realised how stupid I acted towards him. It was clear to me that he didn't want to be my friend because of how possessive and paranoid I acted towards him. 

Around 2 months ago I finally got myself to write him an apology text after all these years of no communication. I apologized for everything I remembered and poured my heart out to him. I was terrified of how he was going to react but everything was fine. He told me he wasn't angry at me at all and that he thinks he was the one who overreacted things. We didn't talk much after that, I just told him I was so relieved and happy that he wasn't mad at me. 

He ended the convo with a message that said: ""I hope maybe we can talk sometimes if it happens that way""
(Sorry I don't know how to translate this better!)

We didn't talk for 2 months after the apology because I was hoping that maybe he would initiate a conversation if he wanted to. He didn't and I wasn't trying to make him feel uncomfortable or force anything. 

His birthday was a few days ago so I decided to message him ""happy birthday"". After that we chatted a little and he was so sweet. It felt so normal. As if we were still good friends. I asked him about his life and stuff and we talked a little about how fun it was when we went to *insert our old favourite place's name* together. After some time I had to go so I asked him if we can talk sometimes again and he said yes.

Maybe he just said this to be polite. I know if I texted him he would be ok with that but I don't think he would initiate a conversation. He didn't reach out to me for the past few months either. I'm happy that he's not mad and that we could talk for a little but I know I won't be able to forget him. I thought the apology would help me let go of the past but talking to him just made me miss him even more. I would like to be his friend again but I don't know if he truly feels this way too or if he's only texting me these things to be polite. I don't want to make him uncomfortable by messaging him if he doesnt want to talk to me for real.

I never stopped missing him through these years. I just never clicked with anyone like this before. I'm so angry at myself that I messed it all up. I wish things turned out differently.

What should I do? Should I stop bothering him? I would really appreciate any advice or anything I just really need to hear a different perspective. Please tell me anything.

418,"I am not sure how to react to this, or how to frame it in a way I don't just accuse him of being clingy while claiming I'm a perfect soul. I guess the only thing I can even do right now is to tell some backstory.

So, we've known each other since 1st grade basically, let's call my friend James, and we've been really good friends ever since. I am the introverted/bookish/shy one and he is the extroverted/sporty/loud one. We've hung out daily either in person or in voice chat playing video games for most of school up until high school, when we started to study at different schools. This was the time when we've started to hang out more online than in person. Then University came, we're both 19 now and... I think our schedules/workloads are much different now? A thing to note here is that I'm majoring in electrical and telecommunications engineering while James is majoring in kinesiotherapy.

About 90% of my time is spent either on schoolwork or hanging out on Discord, mostly with James and sometimes other friends. Let's call the other friend I hang out with regularly Lewis. He is also very busy with schoolwork and also spends a lot of his free time learning to program (which I'm also interested), so the amount of time he spends gaming with us is like half the time I spend gaming with James, so I would assume that he spends that other half learning to program, so it is no surprise that he is much, much better than me, which while I don't envy him, I do feel bad for not spending more time learning something productive rather than playing League of Legends for hours upon hours, which I'd say is a good thing.

James is always messaging me everyday around 3-4 hours before I finish my courses (around 3-5PM, sometimes 7PM) to ask when I'm done so we can play something. Just a single message usually, to which I respond with the time I finish courses, but if I don't answer he usually sends a few other messages and then he starts calling me on my phone, so it's not like he is spamming me day/night with messages. As I'm both not in the mood to do schoolwork right after \~6h of courses and I'm a bit of a night owl as well, I do indeed hang out with him from the time I finish courses to the time I'm supposed to start schoolwork.... Yeah. I am a VERY bad procrastinator and combined with the fact that I'm a bit shy it's really uncomfortable for me to tell anybody I'm on voice with that I need to go do something, but since it's schoolwork and it's really important to me I can manage doing that, and even though James reacts... weirdly? I would say something like ""Yeah this is the last match for today I need to do a project for X"" at let's say for example around 8-9 PM, any later and I have to sacrifice bedtime, so I have about 2-3 hours to finish said project, which is basically the bare minimum amount of time I need to do it. He would respond something like ""So you're not going to play anything else not even later today?"". Uhm... how can I play with him if I don't have the time, do I have to be more blunt? Maybe he just doesn't understand that a project could take 2-3h, or that I really need to do it because it's a part of my final grade.

Lewis and I were hanging out in Discord doing ""Advent of Code 2020"", basically a daily programming challenge. At some point, when we're both fed up with both of our codes not really working out, James comes online and all 3 of us play something, usual stuff. A few hours later, Lewis logs off saying that he wants to finish his code. I say that I'll keep playing with James. A few hours later, I start feeling that creeping urge to say that I need to go finish up my code, but I wasn't quite ready to deliver it to James yet. Perhaps I was acting a bit bored because James asked why do I play so differently all the sudden, to which I say that I don't really want to play League of Legends right now. He starts thinking about suggestions but I cut him off saying that I'd much rather program. I'm not sure what he understood but he said that I can function perfectly fine and have fun without socializing and it's not normal????? I just left after he finished talking without saying anything. What does that have to do with what I've said? It's not the first time he personally attacked me for not spending 100% of my time with him. This scenario has been happening in one way or another since the start of the pandemic/university. Maybe he is just saying it jokingly but I just don't realize? He sure doesn't sounds like joking to me, but I've only talked to one other friend about this and he was agreeing with everything I was saying about James.

TLDR: Every time I don't spend my time with my friend James and tell him I'd rather do something on my own, he calls me antisocial or tells me that normal people spend their time socializing or something similar.",10Dec2020,1

421,"First off, I am not asking for a legal or administrative advice. I do not live in the US, so it most likely wouldn't apply anyway.

Today, I received a grim phone call from a woman who claimed to be my landlord's wife. She told me he unfortunately passed away a week ago, and asked me to pay for a small bill I had left hanging. Understandably, the woman was very distraught, and frankly, so was I – my landlord was a wonderful, wonderful human being; I won't get into details, but the man was just a good person, through and through. And I haven't been the best tenant.

Now, she did also ask me to pay my rent to a different account going forward, but only after I inquired her about it – it was obvious this was not on her mind. She told me she'd send a bank account information for me to pay my rent going forward when she's ready. 

I have no reason to disbelieve these tragic news, but I still want to do my due diligence. I've been in situations before where I've believed bad news that turned out to be false, and a scam. (Side note, I do hope this is a scam. I'd take a scam over his passing any time.)

How should I go about discovering this? My landlord and I didn't have much contact – I had his email and phone number, and he had mine. I don't know where he lives, where he works, we don't have any mutual acquaintances. I admit I tried stalking his Facebook page after the call today, but sadly we had not added each other on Facebook, and there was no information or activity that could either confirm or deny his passing.

To make matters worse, the bank account I've been paying my rent to wasn't in his name, and I cannot inquire the bank whether the holder of the account has passed.

Do I call his wife and demand to see a death certificate, before I start paying my rent to another account? Do I try and call his phone number, which most likely would again be picked up by his wife? Do I do whatever is possible within reason to find out through other means?

I definitely don't want to be insensitive about it – the woman was distraught. But even if I have no reason to disbelieve her, I do want to make sure I've done every precaution within reason.",10Dec2020,1

So, my sister just gave birth a month ago. Ever since then, my mom and I have been staying at her house to help to take care of the baby and the baby's brother which is my nephew. I just dont get why my sister and her husband dont take care of my nephew and the baby together. Instead they ask me to take care of him while they take care of the baby. I have observed and evaluated, and I can say that it is possible for them to take care of them together. They're acting as if the baby and my nephew are seperate and arent siblings. Even my mom said something similar. It has been more than a month and I have not gotten a break, especially since I have finished my big national exam. I'm tired. My mom is tired too. She has been having gastric every now and then. And the thing about my sister and her husband is that they dont discipline him, thats why he gets angry so easily if he doesnt get what he wants. 


I want to go home so that my father doesnt feel lonely without my mother. My sister at home is battling with her mental health and I want to be there physically for her. I miss my brother. I miss home. I promised to take care of myself after my exam as I will have a long holiday. But now? Hmm I lost hope.

435,"I feel like I have been blind sided by my fiance. A few months ago she decided to go on a dating app and matched with a bunch of dudes. She decided to really only talk to one. We had several arguments about it, mainly because I felt uncomfortable about her speaking to another male that wants more than a friendship. She spoke to him until I had a very serious talk with her. She then cut contact with him.

Lately we've been working on our relationship and since maybe last month shes been super defensive when I ask for her phone. She tells me I have my own and I can use it. I found it very odd because she has snooped through my phone and I've let her use mine for many things. 

Tonight I haven't really been able to sleep and decided maybe I should find out if she's hiding anything. I immediately looked at her snapchat, thats really the only text app she uses (she likes to send her friends and I pics and videos of our dogs), I see she's speaking to one dude. I don't mind because I don't know him. I do know on snapchat you can delete conversations to hide your friends. So I go to her friends list and guess who I find? The same dude she told me she cut contact with.

I'm a little mad by this point, so I go and see if she still has the dating app, and what do you knowledge? She does. I look at the people she's spoken with and see that the other dude that didn't bother me was one of the people she's matched with. 

I'm a little mad and shocked because she has lied and lied constantly about not talking to him behind my back when I was uncomfortable about it all those months ago. Now she's done it again. The reason she got the dating app was because she has no friends and wants some people to speak with, I completely understand. This dating app also has the options to find friends. But she has gone on the dating option to match with people.

What should I do? I have made it very very clearly I am uncomfortable with her speaking to people she has matched with on the dating app.",10Dec2020,1

Sometimes people called me childish and say I'm a nobody but I just shrug it off. 2020 has been one of those years of change for me. I've changed my personality, my style, the clothes I wear, and learn to focus on the things I want.

439,"This happened with a close friend of mine. I found myself physically attracted towards her lately. We are very open about things so I shared this with her and asked if she would be OK trying friends with benefits thing. She said she doesn't want that as she doesn't see me that way.

One evening at a party both of us were drinking and talking. We were quite drunk. At a moment I gave a friendly peck on her cheeks and I noticed she turned towards me kind of so that we kiss. I backed out and ignored that. Same thing was repeated after a while but this time when she moved towards me I went with it. We kissed and I literally had to apply force to pull myself and get out of that.

I did enjoy it then but it left me confused later. She had explicitly told me she doesn't want anything like that. But then it was her who kind of initiated the kiss. And the next day I don't think she remembered or maybe just didn't want to talk about it.

I am confused as in how does this happen? Can just alcohol make her do this even though she didn't want it? Or is there something underlying? Anyone who understands or has had similar experience please help. Would especially like a girl's take on this. And how should I go about it now? Should I talk bring this up with her or no? 

TL;DR: My friend kissed me while drunk, but when I had asked when sober she said she doesn't see me that way. Was it just the alcohol?",10Dec2020,1

We have not had sex in 4 years we been married 5 years. She told me if I want sex go to some else because we married.

My dad wants to help my flip houses, but I think he would hold his help over my head. So I’m probably not going to have him help me.

449,"Hi everyone. I can't say that I myself have been raised by narcissists but I can say that I'm dating someone who is. I'm a 19 year old female and I've been dating my 18 year old boyfriend for 8 months now. I didn't get to meet his parents until June which was 5 months ago but I could tell from the moment I met my boyfriend's parents that something was very wrong. The week before I was set to come over to their house for dinner, my boyfriend let me know that he informed his parents that I was his girlfriend and that he wanted them to meet me, so knowing this I thought that meant that they were okay with the idea of me dating their son. That next week rolls by and I come over for dinner. First thing that caught me off guard was when his mother answered the door, didn't even greet me and just shouted at my boyfriend that ""his friend was here"". His parents never greeted me, like at all, they didn't acknowledge me at the dinner table, it was like they pretended I wasn't even there. Naturally I felt super uncomfortable and my boyfriend was pretty pissed. I later found out that this was apparently because my boyfriend's mother couldn't accept the fact that he had a girlfriend but eventually they started to open up to me, which was good at first but things started getting weird. These last few months I've noticed that his mother has a very bad addiction to shopping, and is known to steal money from both her own son and husband to feed her addiction. 90% of what this woman is talking about is usually shopping, Vegas, gambling and waiting for the day her son becomes as rich as Drake. Yes, she literally believes her 18 year old son will become a billionaire by the time he's 21 (not that I don't want the best for him too but this expectation seems a little too far out there). His mother is also the most emotionally unavailable person I've ever met. Last month, my boyfriend's bestfriend committed suicide and obviously my boyfriend was devastated, and instead of being a loving and supporting mother, his mother told him he needed to ""get the fuck over it, I need you to set up my Christmas  decorations downstairs"". When I asked her why she felt like this she literally said, ""he needs to stop being a baby about it, his other friend died last year, who gives a shit"". I was in shock because who would in their right mind would say this to their grieving child? She also has a pattern of downgrading me as well, often telling me that she doesn't want me in her son's life if I don't become a successful real estate agent, last weekend she told me that if I don't become rich quick that her attitude towards me will change drastically. The reason I'm ranting right now is because I love my boyfriend, he's an amazing person and I want to have a future with him but his mother puts so much pressure on him and on me as his girlfriend that I feel like I'll never even be ""up to her standards"". I don't know what to do, I don't want to try and force my boyfriend to choose between his mother and I because that's his mother and I could never do that but I also don't want to lose him",10Dec2020,1

We have this modular type of learning so it’s all on us to learn several subjects in one week. I don’t know if I’m doing it wrong but somehow I just can’t get it right. I try to watch videos but it doesn’t register in my head. I’ve been making do by copying from other folks, I mean it is what almost everyone does. The thing is I don’t have a nick of insight gained through the years. I don’t know how they do it. I follow through whatever methods they teach and follow that but it is only really limited. I feel dumb in contrast to almost every other diligent students out there because I just can’t understand.

459,"hi! im a 15 year old girl (year 10) who lives in the uk and i have been struggling with school for a long time now. there are lots of factors which led up to me refusing to go like depression, friend issues, food issues, low self-esteem etc. when i say i used to go there and try and get rid of the tears in my eyes in every single lesson, it was awful. i would literally just think about dying the entire day at school and not even focus on any of the work. school definitely ruined my mental health more and i just couldnt deal with it anymore. i had been keeping it inside for years. i remember i would just get out of school and the first thing i would do when i got in my moms car is cry. i dont think my parents really noticed how down i was or probably thought it was just my period because i had lots and lots of friends at school and i was known by a lot of people. the friend issues were about my 'best friend' which theres lots of factors which led to me feeling more depressed. i felt so alone and that i didnt fit in anywhere.

on the monday, my mom phoned the school and told them everything about friend issues and my mental health and they arranged a meeting. the meeting was about all the things my 'best friend' had done and how i was feeling. we had several meetings but i just couldnt bring myself to go back to school. i have now been at home waiting for the school to transfer me to another school (near my house) where i actually had lots of my old friends there who i still sometimes message. my mom received a letter today from that school saying im on the waiting list because its oversubscribed (full). she is now saying i have to go to a different school but i literally cant bring myself to go to any other school or even my old one because i have no friends anywhere and its too stressful. im dreading the day i have to go. i know that if i dont go im going to be ruining my education and be even more of a failure but i just really cant go. the thought terrifies me and makes me feel sick. i used to get migraines once a week from the stress of going to my old school and i just feel like im going to get worse.

i have no idea what to do because this is my most important year at school because of exams but im just finding it so stressful and i hate it and i wish i could die or runaway. im not seeing a therapist or anyone because its so stressful and horrible talking to someone about how im feeling. my mom is worried that she could be fined for me not going to school and i feel awful about it but i literally cant go to school. its stressful as it is being a home and trying to get the school work done when i feel so unmotivated and not having a lot of energy let alone actually getting up and going to another school. please help me if you can :( (im sorry its so long i just really need help in this situation)",10Dec2020,1
460,"This is gonna be long one, I don't really have anyone to talk to about this so why not vent and get advice from strangers on Reddit.

I've been doing long distance for a year due to covid, my boyfriend, well ex now I guess? He lives in Australia and I live in New Zealand, I was supposed to be moving there to be with him in May, but alas, I couldn't due to lockdown. Recently he ended things with me, due to things out of our control, like the boarder and the travel bubble being one 1 way (NZ to AU) he lives in Queensland which is the only AU state not open to NZers which of course, would be the case, another being that he feels he can't put himself in a postition to be emotionally vulnerable, a problem that all started because Snapchat map had me at a hotel, I wasn't at the hotel but at the taxi stand that is outside the hotel, so he thinks I cheated and I gave him proof I hadn't, I was actually with my friend getting the taxi and she backed me up, so he says he doesn't want to be in that position where he has these thoughts, he says he has a lot going on atm and is the reason he wants to cut things off, he won't let me in or tell me what's going on, he says his mental health is being affected, I want to support him but I don't want to pressure him into telling me what's wrong but at the same time, this effects me too.

So anyway, we've been talking over the last few days, mainly me trying to work things out with him so we don't have to go down this ""ending things"" route, he's thinks this is the only way and in his words ""I can't do THIS, right now"" as in be committed or invested, he constantly says ""Right now"" and I try ask what that actually means, but he doesn't answer, how I take it is that right now isn't the right time, but later on will be? I don't know...  
He says he doesn't want to lose me from his life and doesn't want to stop talking to me and that I've impacted his life and that I'm a big part of it, he's those things to me as well, he says he just wants to be friends and talk like that and still wants to see me and hang out with me when I move over, but like, isn't that kinda mean? I said I can't, I emotionally can't do that, cause I really can't see him in any other way than the way I've always known him, we never started as friends, we were instantly attracted to each other when we met, we built a connection so fast. I can't just pretend and turn off my feelings for him, it isn't right.

So I don't know what to do, I don't want to lose him, I want to respect what he's feeling, but I can't help but feel he's being selfish, for a year we've been making plans together and I've been preparing to move my life to another country so that I could be with him properly, the thing both he and I have been wanting all year, now he's ending things right as the time I can finally move over is upon us, I don't know if I should move anymore but at the same time, I've put so much effort and time and emotion into this move, that I feel it would be all for nothing if I didn't do it...so yeah, it's the gist of it, even tho this year has been the worst, the year with him has been the best year of my life.

So what do I do? What do I say to him? I don't know what to do but all I know is that I don't want to lose him but I can't do what he wants and just be friends, I'm so confused :(

One of the managers put in place a 'bubble' system so that certain people could access the office on certain days to limit the amount of mixing and the amount of people in the office at one time. I have been going in on a Wednesday for the last few weeks, as agreed with my manager, for mental health reasons: I have been struggling with home-working and a change of scenary for 1 day per week really helps. Until this point there has only been 3 people in on a Wednesday, so we are able to social distance. We also take our temperatures on arrival, wear our masks to move around, wash and sanitise our hands regularly and disinfect our working and communal areas after use.

Yesterday I arrived at the office as planned to see that our CEO had invited the entire senior management team in for a meeting/crisis talks, as opposed to doing it virtually (like the rest of us have been doing since March). Also completely ignoring the 'bubble' thing. I worked out that there were 16 people in the office in total, and its not a large space. I'd say only 6 of those needed to be in for essential reasons. The management team were all in one room, not social distancing. What's more, the CEO sent another member of staff out to buy sandwiches and snacks for the managers, which she then plated up and they all ate from like a buffet. No masks were worn, in fact I got laughed at for showing up with a mask on. But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they were washing their hands.

The CEO always goes on about how much he cares about his staff. I've always been dubious about this and 2020 has shown otherwise for a number of reasons I won't go into, but this is just the icing on the cake. I did not feel safe or protected in the office yesterday as the CEO was quite clearly ignoring (and encouraging ignorance) of the COVID-19 guidelines. I have an elderly family member in my 'support bubble', who I want to protect.

So my question is: should I talk to HR about this? 

TL;DR: The CEO of the company I work for breached COVID restrictions yesterday by inviting the entire management team into the office and ignoring social distancing, mask wearing, social 'bubbling' and food hygiene rules. Subsequently I didn't feel safe. Should I speak to HR?",10Dec2020,1

I'm a girl who grew up in a conservative, purity culture and am just discovering my sexuality, my kinks, etc.

I have a planned consensual nonconsent scenario coming up with my boyfriend, because I have been exploring BDSM. This has been a fantasy of both of ours for a long time and we're very excited about it. It involved a lot of planning, prenegotiations, consent, safeword discussions, whatnot.

I happened to mention this in a chat of close female friends where we frequently talk about these types of things (sexual activity, etc).

However, when I mentioned, my friend messaged me separately saying she was a victim of sexual assault and it was very triggering for her. I had no idea and I felt awful and apologized and agreed to not speak about it in the group chat again (and I will definitely be more careful about my audience and things like trigger warnings in the future.)

However, she went on to say that my roleplay itself and talking about it was dismissive of sexual assault survivors, that is mimicked a very evil act, and other similar things.

Frankly, I don't want to make this about me, and I want to be compassionate to the true victim in the scenario and the fact that I triggered such an awful memory for her. At the same time, I'm still very fragile about my own sex life and desires, and I feel very judged and like it set back some of my own sexual empowerment/openness. Power/BDSM dynamics have been a very positive way for me to personally channel things like my anxiety, trust, etc with my partner.

Frankly, I feel like it was kink-shaming, sex-negative, and a bit close-minded, but I feel selfish for feeling annoyed.

I spoke to my kink community friends afterwards, many of whom are sexual assault survivors, who told me that consensual nonconsent was a way for them to empower themselves, regain control, and in general was very healing for them, so I don't think it was fair of her to speak for all survivors. Also, like many mentioned, I have a completely different relationship with this fantasy than she does. And unlike actual rape, I have all the control, safety, and consent in this scenario.

This is also a personal sex life issue between me and my boyfriend, something that isn't her business and not hers to make a moral judgment on. (I understand I brought it up)

Having a rape fantasy doesn't mean you condone rape or that you would want to actually be raped/rape someone.

Idk how to approach this issue or to deal with how upset I feel at her about it all, while remaining sensitive and understanding to my friend. I don't know if I should try starting a dialogue again, or just remain silent out of respect for her experience. I also do want to open a dialogue with the group chat, because I want to address any issues/see if it was triggering/shocking for anyone else.",10Dec2020,1

My husband and I have bought N95 masks and are prepared to attend the services at the very least. There's a few problems here though. All of the events, minus the burial, are indoors. The after services were supposed to be held in the backyard, but it's raining today. In addition, I live in a state where coronavirus cases are high right now. We reported 12,000 yesterday, the most in a single day so far. My husband's mom is pressuring us to attend all of the events. I understand because of the severity of the situation. But I'm legitimately concerned, especially for the sake of others who will be in attendance. 

I feel awful for not going and being there for the family and showing our condolences.

472,"Hello. I don’t know where to start, and I might be a bit disorganized, but first things first, I haven’t gone out of my house for 9 months now. I quit my job last March, and it just so happened that a week after my last day at work, community quarantine happened, giving me more reason not to go out. The past months has been a blur. I live with my mom and my sister, along with our cats. I know I had plans after I quit work, like study/review since I wanted to work on getting a master’s degree, maybe get a part-time job while I’m at it. I quit my previous work because I don’t think I was doing well mentally and I don’t think working night shift was helping me at all. I tried going to therapy because it got to the extent that I was suicidal and all but it didn’t work out for me as well. Generally, I lost sight of it all and I lost my sense of purpose. I thought maybe I needed a break. I don’t know where I’m going with this, just that my family has been encouraging me to go out recently. I know I needed to, but I just can’t bring myself to go out at all. I’ve always been a homebody is what I thought, but I used to go out and meet with friends before, and now I just feel like I don’t want to go out at all. Even to the point of my best friend getting mad at me because I won’t go out to meet with them. I don’t know, I guess I just wanted advice on what to do, because I really can’t steel myself to go out, not even in our backyard. I know I want to, but my body and mind just refuses to.

473,"So I'm gonna vent rn, I am very much ignored by people and my friends I've found. I'm sure most people are to some degree but I've just become very aware of it, so I know how often it is.

Most people I know don't relate me to my hobbies. I make art, cosplay, write, etc(I'll not name them all). I've been told to my face before by a friend, after they asked me what careers I want to go into, that they ""don't really see me in any of those jobs"", after saying my passions and what jobs they can lead to. So I didn't even know why to say to that cause.... That's all I do, how can you not make a correlation between me and any of my hobbies?

I make art and Cosplay for myself, I enjoy creating. When I share things online tho, I am showing it to people. Let it be known I do not care about likes or followers, never really have, and I don't have a problem with comparing myself to others. I do like comments, it's shows people acknowledging and appreciating what I do. Thing is I never get any comments; if I do it'll be 2 and they'll either be self-promo's, bots, or a relative. I have 6-7 close friends, they don't even comment on any of my stuff or say anything about it when they see me, even though they know I appreciate comments and they could easily do it to help out my account. 

It was my birthday recently, only one of my friends texted me happy birthday plus an online friend who is twice my age and lives on the other side of the world. They were all actively online that day, saw me post on my story about having breakfast out with my family for my birthday and some even talked to me online about unrelated things. I wasn't that fussed about it, but it really is just another thing on the list when I think about it

Back to the hobbies, my friend and I both cosplay. Everyone knows this, I'm not quiet about my hobbies. Idk what they actually think, but most people think my friend is a cosplayer and I cosplay with them, if you get what I mean. to be clear right now, I'm not upset at this friend for what other people think, I love them as my friend so much; they do acknowledge my skills, however they are unaware to when I'm being put down. When art and Cosplay has been brought up in the room, we will literally be sitting next to each other and everyone will immediately turn to them and start asking questions about it, they have never asked me questions. If my friend is out of the room and the topic comes up they will wait for them to come back, and not even bother asking me when I have just as much experience and skill. All these people have actually seen me in cosplay and all my stuff online btw. When I've chimed into the conversation or answered their questions myself I've also been blatantly ignored. So my point is, even tho I'm an basically open book people I know go out of their way almost to not relate me to my interests. 

Of course, while I'm not upset with my cosplay friend, there are things they could do to include me more. (I know they don't do these things intentionally) often when they talk about an experience we had together at eg. A convention. They say ""I"", ""sm that happened to me"", when I was also actively there, and I'll also be in the room, next to them, while they say this. So it kinda just writes me off out of the story. I often have found out when we're going to a convention, about a few days prior that we're going to meet up with some of my friend's online cosplay friends. However when we meet up, obviously they only want to talk to my friend, even if I'll try to make conversation too; they might say hi to me, but I've often been pushed (not physically)to the side of circles of conversation and been left out for 30mins+ while my friend talks to them. It would be nicer if my friend introduced me online to people that we are going to be meeting.

I'm not even gonna get into the amount of times I'm cut off in conversation, when someone else overtakes my point, when someone goes on their phone while talking to me, or starts talking to someone else while I'm mid talking.

It's very hurtful, and I feel very underappreciated. I try  to be as kind and approachable as I can, I comment on as many artists as I can when I see them cause I know how much compliments mean. I have been made to feel lonely even when surrounded by people so many times, at least multiple time a week. 

If you even saw this and read all of it, thank you. And is there anything you think I can do?",10Dec2020,1
474,"Only a couple of days ago, my close-friend confided with me a ""disgusting and disturbing truth"" that she has been living with. She mentioned to me that she has memories of her Father grabbing her ass since she was a smaller girl—with the most recent experience being less than a week ago. As she's matured, she's grown into being reluctant of his actions (smacking his hands away and yelling at him) and has gone as far as telling her Biological Mother—the Mother, has brought it up in conversation with the Father; however, the Father continues to do so and both parents think the Daughter is 'overreacting' when she brings up how uncomfortable she becomes when her Father gropes her. To make matters worse, my Friend has a younger, 12-year-old Sister and my Friend will be leaving her household and country entirely for University—leaving this predatory Father alone with her younger (more gullible) sister.  

I really care for my Friend. This is a long distance relationship, so there's not much I can do in person. I have suggested that she contacts a therapist for herself and her younger sister, because just as she's experienced this sexual abuse with her Father, it's very likely that her younger sister may have, as well. I have become adamant in my position that her Father, if given the opportunity, would fully engage in sexual activities with his underage Daughters. I have done my best to be more understanding of her situation. I offered her help; she refused, telling me explicitly to ""fuck off"". I suggested multiple times that she gets a therapist and that she advises her school of her Father's behaviour and how the Mother is doing very minimal—and that she contacts Law Enforcement the next time her Father acts upon his predatory-repulsive-impulses. I have suggested that though she may not be concerned about her own safety, that she takes my advice as it may protect her younger sister from any sexual abuse—just as her family was ignorant of her Father's predatory actions on her; they could very easily be ignorant of her Father's predatory actions against the youngest sibling. 

I need help. I genuinely want the best for my friend and her younger sister—I want what is best for their minds, bodies, and their future relationships. It's become very difficult to try to convince her of what I would do in her situation. However, if I cannot change her mind, she will certainly lose me. I have spent so much of my energy messaging her with my own background, my own perspective and opinions, and what I want from her; but she's too adamant and too affixed on maintaining the idea that her parents are special, loving, and great; that they're not regular people with bad ideas and bad impulses. I have exclaimed that her own Mother is at fault—for breeding with someone that would sexualy abuse children of his own; however, she exclaims that I ought not to speak about her Mother. I've shared so much with her already, but she doesn't seem to wake up to the objective facts. She's so deep in the waters, that she's gone as far as to have told me that I'm exaggerating and that I ought to calm down. I stand firmly on moral principles, I know I'm not wrong. I've told her ""You're not upset with me, you're upset with your reality—I'm just pointing things out objectively"" however, she continues being rude to me and asking that I change the topic, ""or else"". Had she been someone I don't care about, this relationship had been over. I just happen to be someone that's more open and more agreeable and I happen to think I might be able to help her and her younger sister—I hope to stop a conversation 20 years down the line, where they both share about how Dad touched them and the younger sister confesses that Dad did more than just grope her. Please, help. I don't want to lose my friend, she means a lot to me. But if she continues to refuses my help and refuses to touch with reality, I'm gonna have to leave her. 

TL;DR: Friend's (F17) Dad touches her ass and her Mother knows and does nothing. Friend has a younger sister (F~12) that I think has been sexualy abused, too. I tell her to get a therapist for her and her sibling and contact the police—especially if it happens again; she tells me to ""stfu"", ""fuck off"" and that I ought not to tell her what to do.",10Dec2020,1

483,"On mobile, so please excuse any mistakes.

So recently I've been having a lot of trouble motivating myself to do anything.

A little background to that:

I (20f) am a student and I'm doing an internship this semester where I'm working from home. I never really attended classes at my college, as I didn't feel the need to. In my country, attending classes is not obligatory and no one really cares unless you pass the exams at the end of the semester and even if you fail, you just take it again the next semester. That is why I don't have to spend time on my courses, as I will just look at the slides of the course a week before the exam and then I'll pass. 

When I was younger, I used to be one of those smart kids that never really had to study and it just came to me. Everybody just to tell me how I will do great in college and get a great job and how I am so smart. Even though my grades dropped a little in high school and it wasn't all As anymore, I still passed every time and I didn't feel the need to study as I didn't have to. So I also didn't start studying in college.

I think this is one of the reasons why I can't get myself to do anything now. Like I said, I'm doing an internship and working from home right now and although I know that this is something I would like and I would be good at, I don't do it. I'm just on my mobile all the time, browsing Reddit. I find it hard to just turn on my laptop and open the browser and after that, I already feel like I have done so much. 
I also can't find motivation to do anything else, like working out a little or even cook myself food. Sometimes I think that if I am just wasting time, I might as well read a book or something, but that is to hard too. I can't even get up and turn my box on so that I can listen to music.
Most days I just wait for my bf to come home from his work. When he comes home, I get motivated to do something together or even do some work while he's there, but when I'm alone I will just not do anything.

I seriously don't know what is wrong with me. I used to suffer from depression but this feels so different. Like, I'm not unhappy or anything, it just feels like I physically can't get myself to do anything, let alone something productive.

I don't know how to change this or what to do about it. I feel so useless but it is so hard to do anything apart from laying in bed.",10Dec2020,1

As of now, we live 2 hours away from each other but I told him I plan to live with him in the next couple of years.

486,"I bought this nice custom build pc from a relatively good reviews seller about 2-3 months back.

On the first day after I collected my PC and brought it back home the PC died that night so I brought it back to he workshop on the second day to have a check and was said to be PSU issue, he was nice to replace majority of the parts for me as it seem to be his issue. He got it changed and fixed on the spot which is very nice as I can reduce my travel and enjoy it back home. As a person he seem to be nice.

This happen 2 more time in a span of 2 weeks and he started to ignore my messages when the same PSU issue occur the 3rd time even after I bought a surge protector as recommended from the 2nd time that happen. So I have to bring the PC back to the workshop myself since he doesn't want to reply my messages. 

After the 3rd time changing to a better said PSU it was fine until recently 3weeks ago it died and its probably the issue again. So I contacted him again and yet again got ignored so brought it down again and did told me quite a lot of buyer of his having PSU problem but this time he said there will be new PSU stocks and would replace it for me and told me the PSU will be arriving in 1.5wks time which is supposed to be this Monday but when I ask him about the arrival of the PSU he just ignored me again over the past few days. I started thinking about whether will it stop happening to me once and for all already.

I really don't know what to do anymore as I am so stupid to the point that I do not have the receipt nor the invoice nor the warranty and done through bank transfer, as it was through an app that let anyone be online seller. I didn't have much experience in this field as I don't interact much with others too. So I thinking that he just planning to run away? I do not have much evidence other than the message about replacement of parts plus I already left my PC there.

I never thought of any of those until I researched more into what I can do but now I really don't know what to do and it have been making me felt tired, frustrated, annoyed, dumb and depressed because I use up quite a lot saving for this investment to make me happy as I am not a bright person + introverted. I do not have any friends anymore and gaming is to coverup for my sadness and emptiness that I am feeling. Now I am lost.

She has a slim figure, straight long hair, a nice face, and always dresses very clean. It just makes me think about how I appear to other people.


I've tried makeup but its too much work and usually just ends up making me feel more uncomfortable and unattractive. I can wear a little bit but I dont think that amount makes any different so what's the point. I gained a few pounds, I've never been over 105 in my life and usually averaged between 100-102 but now somehow I'm 108 consistently. Even though its barely anything, I feel terrible about it. I've been trying to workout more to get it off but I've gotten really discouraged. I feel really self conscious about my body and dont like looking at myself anymore.

494,"(Throwaway account as I might come off wrong)

I (26m) am thinking of getting a DNA test for my daughter as I don't think shes mine. 

For context: At the time (19yo) I didn't have ID for nightclubs, so my girlfriend went with her friends. One morning she came over after a night out and a bouncer came and parked on the corner of the street to return her phone she dropped on the dancefloor. I know, it sounds shady already, and at the time I was confused but didnt think much of it. Needless to say she was pregnant not too soon after. 

I never had a dad, so I decided we'll keep it and I'll try to be there as much as I could. We lasted about a year after she was born (21yo) because she cheated on me with her cousin in law. (She also had sex with my best mate and roommate in the room next to me after we broke up). 

As for my daughter, she looks nothing like me, she has blonde hair and I have red hair, her mum has brown hair. She has really olive skin and I'm pale, as is my ex.  All her features are her mums aswell, some people say she has my ears or nose but I cant really see it. 

I now have a son with my fiance and he looks like me 100%, he has red hair and is pale, looks just like me as a baby and nothing close to his sister. 

The icing on the cake? My fiance's sisters ex husband is the bouncer. I spoke to him one day and I just see so many similarities it just sets off bells in my head. He still works there too. 

So should I get a test? I'd feel really guilty if it comes back positive, but I think about this all the time and I've never felt more disconnected from my daughter. I read about guys finding out when their kids are teenagers or older and I don't want that to happen. The only other thing I can think of is why she wouldn't confess if it were true? We are 50/50 but we always fight and she has a partner now aswell so why not confess to cut ties with me if it were true?

I tried to convince myself that I’ll like it and for a short moment I thought that I actually really would. But now the more that I do of the course the more reality sets in and the more I realise that it’s not for me and I’m really not interested in it. 

I still have the majority of the course to go, plus the work placement. I’ve only completed 2 units (and completed half of the third and read most of the material for the 4th) out of 13 units. 

So I still have a lot to do but I don’t want to waste this! Like if I quit then it’s an absolute waste, but if I keep going at least I’ll have the qualification, experience and will have learned new skills (especially as this is my first course and will be my first experience in the workforce). But thinking about it just makes me kinda sad because I’m probably going to be doing a childcare course next and I’d rather be doing that than this, and this course is just prolonging that. And it’s just hard to do all that reading and assignments on something you’re not even interested in.

He liked me too but I had a feeling he only did this because I was comfort for him too as he had issues with his girlfriend. In the end I got confirmation that was true. I fucked up by continuing that relationship with him, going against morals, keeping it quiet and betraying a friend. Lots of people ghosted me after everything came out and I understand why. Only a year after I reflected fully understanding and realising how fucked up I was doing that because of my own hurt. It was extremely selfish of me. I never ended up apologising to her.

My grandma is on chemo and we don't know how serious it is. Another Aunt is also on chemo.

Both my dad, my mum and my aunt are on antidepressants and I can hear them cry when I come back from school. Additionally I have been having some identity problems as I have been playing the role of a person who I'm not in school to try to be liked, I am now trying to stop this, but the more they get to know the real me the more they distance themselves. I also have a crush on this girl, she is wonderful but I really can't tell whether she likes me or not, we've been talking for a while but sometimes I feel like she wants nothing to do with me, and I feel like that about a lot of girls in general.

My grades are going down even though I'm trying to study. And everyone seems to have picked a wonderful university course while I'm choosing a career path which basically guarantees poverty. I have basically no self esteem and I keep having mood shifts which go from slightly happy to dangerously depressed.

I'm at the point where a minor thing like, this girl I like seeming cold to me, can send me down a depressive spiral which has occasionally given me suicidal thoughts.

i’m very biased against women. i have been sexually harassed/borderline abused by a woman, lived with an abusive mother, and been bullied/dehumanised to the point of harassment. contrarily, the men in my life have only been kind to me. this is a flawed view. i shouldn’t judge an entire group of people based on my experiences but i can’t get myself out of this mindset.

i feel like women are inferior; nothing is ever enough for them. they’re hypocritical, and throw a fit when things don’t go their way. i go to an all-girls school, so i can’t say that has helped to improve my view. to me, feminism is just women preaching about how much better they are than men. when i look at the way some of the girls i know shamelessly flaunt themselves i really do think that we’re just meant to be bred. again, extremely flawed and harmful mindset. guys are easy; guys won’t spread rumours and go out of their way to harass you, guys will just punch you and call it a day.

First, I use zepeto, it's a application like imvu or avakin life where you could dress up and talk with friends. I use this application to be a virtual idol, like we use pose of the game to dance to music, just like Asian idol.

There's a instagram account that use tellonym to post tell that people sent to them. The problem started when I saw a post about someone being kicked out of a virtual idol agency for wearing in game dreadlocks when he was white. I didn't want to get in trouble too but I commented about defending him because I don't think kicking someone over a haircut is nice.

Some people came at me in the comment and said their opinion about the subject and I kept defending him then I ended up not answering because I was afraid to get exposed, or a thing like that. Fast forward to today where I saw a tell in the tellonym account of the page that is still not posted. It say at the end ""especially you OP you act like a sweet person but you don't understand cultural appropriation. Get off your high horse"".

The thing is that it's the first time there's a tell about me and I'm scared that this will affect my reputation, and that people think of me as a rude person. Maybe they will forget me but in the worst case they could cancel me, I don't know. What should I do?",10Dec2020,1

I am the oldest of three, our mother passed away almost 2 years ago, it was a shock for us all. We're pretty dysfunctional my mother was an alcoholic and as I've grown I realised she was also pretty abusive I was the only one of us still talking to her before she passed away, however it still hit us all and hard. 

One of my brother's got into cocaine. At first like most it was just every so often I suppose through my own grief I haven't paid too much attention to how and when it became a problem until now, he owes me money £325 which is part of what I've saved all year for Christmas and my son's birthday which is today and he hasn't paid me back. I need it back but I've also come to the realisation that he may be in huge amounts of debt to his dealer/s and that I'm probably never going to see it again.

I'm not sure how to bring it up or help him in any way. I don't know where to even start looking for help for him. How do you start a conversation with someone who isn't ready to admit he has a problem. I'm also terribly worried about his mental health maybe he has grieved but I haven't seen it, to me it's like he bottled it up but I could be wrong. 

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this and if anybody knows the right place please let me know I'm desperate to help him. I'm hoping he will show up tonight for his nephews birthday and I can maybe approach this with him.

The check came a week early, and I paid her back in full 6 days early because she wasn't there the day it hit my account. 
Because I quit with little notice, she has gone and told people that I never paid her back and is pretending to take the high road by saying she won't pursue it.

Event: Since last Thanksgiving, in-laws came to visit, I decided I don't want to spend my time off with them. I am focused on personal growth, diet, exercise, education, and mental health. Christmas is coming up, and I am expected to travel with my family to meet my inlaws for about a week, which translates to the opposite regarding my personal goals. 

Situation: I am foreign, living in the USA with my wife (she was born here). I have been living for almost five years now in us. Spent five years every holiday possible with her family. I don’t get along with them that well; they are pretty toxic and insidious; I manage to avoid trouble for my wife and my kids (2), so they can enjoy their time, always thought family is essential. 

Additional: I have been in the military for two years now, and it has always been about traveling these miles during time off or them coming to visit. 

The military schedule is pretty shitty work, sometimes even weekends, stress, etc. Time off is subject to your leadership. So on Christmas, I get precious time off that I NEED to use for myself and declutter as much as possible. Clearly can't do it with the inlaws. 

Her reaction: fights nonstop since I mentioned after Thanksgiving. Saying I am the person with the issue, mentally, socially, etc. Is not her family; it's me. It may be me; that's why I feel I need this time for myself to improve. But I think pretty humiliated and attack by my so. 

This is the first time I oppose a holiday or a meetup with her family. 

Additional info: I don't have anybody else in this country, like I can't go to my family to hang out instead this year, FYI. 

I don't oppose her going by herself. The issue is kids are little and hard traveling alone with them, very stressful, which will make me feel selfish and asshole to my so. 

I honestly don't know what to prioritize in this situation, what decision, the case between me and my so added drama (we fight frequently), etc. A lot. 

Thanks. I would appreciate some advice",10Dec2020,1

518,"So me and my brother were sat in the living room (near the front door) and the door bell rings. It's a delivery and it's my brothers top Christmas gift this year (it was not in a plain box which didn't help), I had to tell him to stay in the living room whilst I safely hide his gift. He doesn't like his Christmas gifts being spoilt before Xmas.

Thing is, I think he knows why I asked him to stay put and now Im trying to think of some convincing reason that would make him think that it wasn't because one of his top Christmas gifts had just been delivered and that I asked him to stay in the living room for a different reason.",10Dec2020,1
519,"Before starting I will just like to provide a little background about myself.

I am a male 19 years of age. I have never been in a relationship till date and hence I am a virgin for that matter (though I had tried to be in a relationship once but to fail, never had courage after that to approach a girl). I study in an engineering college (where it's easier to find animals than girls). I am not that social as well, I like to spend alone time (corona has made things worse tho) and I am rather a very studious boy. However, given all these factors, I have a very high sexual drive.

So one day I was going through some websites and there I stumbled upon one of those gigolo ads. I was instantly interested in it. I instantly verified it's authenticity (through my sources). However the issue is I am not interested in monetary benefits coming with it or being a serious member and rather I want to use it to get to know how sex feels like. However I just can't weigh in the cons related with it.

So my question is should I give it a try and have sex with a woman or rather I should wait and act more maturely and ignore this??

Any advice will be appreciated.

521,"My mother has been unstable for most of my life.  My immediate family has known, and we all simply ""dealt with it"" as she had her bi-annual episodes over the last several decades, as it usually fizzled out after a few days or weeks.  She always seemed to time these episodes around birthdays and holidays.  She would become withdrawn at first, resort to alcohol, and then lash out at everyone.  My father, who has worked hard his entire life and deserved none of this, was usually the biggest victim.  She'd blame him for everything that has ever gone wrong, right down to the tiniest, most insignificant details anyone could remember.  My mother would strike at him while he tried to calm her down, leading up to her throwing him out for 1-3 days at a time.  There were times where she was mild-to-moderately abusive towards me, always when alcohol was involved.  My mother would never acknowledge or accept what she did to others, and in her mind she was always 100% right.  When she wasn't having those episodes, *she was actually a very good-hearted person who went far out of her way to help others.*  

This continued 2-3 times a year as my sister and I grew up.  Things got massively worse when she had a very traumatic episode while trying to defend her parents against elder abuse and extortion.  In the end, the court sided against her, put a restraining order against her, and she was unable to see either of her parents leading up to their deaths.  After that, she started drinking 2-3x as much and the ""blowout"" episodes were far more frequent.  It became hard to talk with her, as anything said in confidence would inevitably get twisted and thrown back in your face at a later time.  She became destructive, so much so that I had to store my belongings elsewhere until I moved out. 

Right before I bought my first house, I met my future wife.  My mother did not like her, and routinely made comments against her, even threatening to make a scene at our wedding.  My mother called her lazy, entitled, useless, all sorts of things that didn't fit.  My wife just let it go in one ear and out the other for the most part.  It got worse throughout the years, up to the point where my father stepped in and told my mother to lay off and treat my wife with respect.  That didn't go over very well.  My sister stilled lived at home with my parents at that point, and she was struggling with my mother's alcoholism and random outbursts.  It affected my sister to the point where she needed a counselor until she bought her own place too.  My mother also started lashing out at random people- neighbors, her own friends, random people in public.  She cannot hold a job anymore because of it.

All of this lead up to a breaking point that occurred not too long in the past.  While visiting with my parents, I brought up the topic of the holidays and wanted to determine plans.  The previous few years, we had the big holidays at our house with both sides of the family, and my wife put on a 4-course meal for everyone.  Unfortunately, my mother would drink too much, say inappropriate things, drive off guests, and then storm out claiming she is ill.  I didn't want a repeat.  The discussion escalated and ended with a swearing match between my wife and mother.  My mother then spent the next 3 hours sending me text messages about how much she hated my wife.  

My father reached out after a few days and didn't know what to do.  He said he disagreed with my mother's behavior, but there was no way to get through to her.  She had even hit him a few times.  And, being retired, he couldn't escape from her either.  We talked 5 minutes here and there when he could avoid her (my mother would go ballistic if she knew he was talking with me), and after a month he eventually asked if I would be willing to visit and try to resolve matters.  I agreed.  Long story short, within 2 minutes it turned into a hit-job where my mother sat back all high and mighty in her rocking chair, spewing insult after insult, swearing, screaming.  All she wanted was for everyone else to apologize to her, and she denied having ever done anything wrong.  I had enough and decided to call her out on everything.  The alcoholism, the undiagnosed mental illness, the projection, the abuse...  I got up, went for the door.  She went to block me, screamed in my face, and lifted her arm like she was going to attempt to strike me.  I smiled, said ""I'll make it easy for you, take me out of the will, block me on your phone, whatever makes you sleep easy at night.  You have 4 living family members left on this planet and you're cutting out 2.  That's on you and nobody else.  Have a nice life.""  And I left.

My father called a day later, and asked what we should do.  I suggested an intervention, leading to her being committed to a mental hospital.  My father said that is a bit extreme but didn't want to rule it out entirely.  My mother refuses to see a doctor, since the last checkup she had resulted in concerns about her liver due to alcohol.

525,"On mobile so sorry for any errors.. 

I live with 2 guys (we'll call them sleepy and munchy) who have been good friends of mine for some time (Munchy since we were in school 20 years ago). I love these guys like they're my brothers but omfg they are wearing me down.. 

Some context, Sleepy is a (as he says) recovering addict (been clean about a year since his last slip-up and I'm SO proud of him!~) Munchy has Aspergers and clinical depression.  I'm a transwoman who has been out for about two years (that's a story for another day) but has not been able to afford treatment. Anyway, we all clearly have issues and honestly at first were helping each other with them (just being there for each other and trying to lift each other up) and it felt amazing to be loved like that.. 

Since the pandemic started though... Well... Sleepy cooking eggs once a month is equivalent to me cooking a big meal every other day on a bad week.. I do ALL of the dishes, and about 70% of the cleaning. (That's actually being generous the more I think about it.. IDK when the last time they even wiped their piss off the toilet seat! It took 2 months of constantly complaining to get them to flush their own feces!) At least Munchy does load the washing machine when he needs laundry done.. 
I understand that I'm the only one here without a consistent income (Finding work is hard, especially good work. My last job was at Wendy's for 6 months but my coworkers found out and made my life there hell as management laughed and encouraged their behavior. No, I could not pursue legal action, because it wasn't considered discrimination, I just need to ""learn to take a joke"" apparently) and thusly I should do more around the house (Even if their income is SSI). This has never been an issue... What IS an issue, is that they both have other support systems (family, therapist, what have you) and I really don't (can you guess what my family said when I told them I'm trapped in the wrong body for the millionth time in my life? I "" need to consider their feelings and my transition would cause them grief, so I'd better not actually go through with it!""). Why is that important? My parents call them and ask how they are / if they need anything, and that makes me happy and sad. Moreso sad, because if I mention how upsetting it is to me that these people ignore me for trying to be happy with my life, Sleepy and Munchy tell me I need to ""toughen up"". Sleepy and Munchy both use me as a support tool, and I'm honestly glad they do, I just wish I could voice anything without an instant ""no one wants to hear it"". Sorry not sorry, if I spend 2 hours cooking and doing dishes it would not kill you two to at least put leftovers away or wash your own dishes so I don't have a pile of them! Or maybe leave me more than half a serving of food?? You do not need 3 pounds of meat for dinner, Munchy and please stop trying to kill yourself by inhaling that two pound block of cheese as a snack. (He already has high blood pressure, and is borderline diabetic but me trying to help him monitor his intake is me being controlling)

But I'm being ungrateful and I can totally see how... I live with them ""rent free"" (I chip in everything I can as I have it, part of why I haven't even been able to afford Therapy in 18 months) and complain a lot... (this post has made it obvious to me how much bitching I do instead of just doing what needs to be done).

I guess what I'm asking is this: how can I express my concerns with them in the hope to make this a place filled with laughter and love again instead of feeling like a prison? Am I over analyzing everything? How can I show my appreciation for everything they do for me? Am I being a petty selfish person?

529,"Hey everyone! 

This is kinda complicated so I’ll try to explain everything as best I can. One of my best friends and I go to the same university and we hang out pretty regularly, like almost every weekend when school’s going on since she lived on campus. Now that the semester’s coming to an end we’re both at home (about an hour and a half away from each other whereas before we were only 30 minutes away). We usually hangout in the afternoon until later in the day. The last time we did we hung out at my house until 11 at night. I’d really like to see her this weekend since it’s been a few weeks but I don’t know how to do it without having to drive in the dark at some point. I’ve only driven to her house once during the day and I don’t feel safe trying to do it at night. So if we were to hang out in her area I’ll probably be driving home in the dark or if we hang out elsewhere then I’ll be driving to her place and back in the dark. So I’m thinking about asking her if she’d like to hang out at my house with my family and I again and then I take her home the next day. Especially with covid going on I don’t want to do anything that’s around a ton of other people either. Do you all think it would be okay to ask her if she’d like to stay overnight if we hang out? Or would that sound weird? I personally don’t see it as any different than when I hang out with my guy friend’s but I just want to make sure it wouldn’t weird her out.

530,"So, my partner and I are renting a house and I'm looking for jobs (in the full-time, $15/hr range). My partner has a lot of anxiety and has a hard time finding a job, and when I work full time, they end up doing most of the housework, cleaning, laundry, dishes, cooking, etc. 

As we are queer socialists (feel free to laugh at the walking stereotype hahahahaha) we believe labor is valuable and I don't want them to feel as though they are being taken advantage of by being a homemaker.

531,"So, this is my first post and I´m not very good at phrasing things in english so sorry for any mistakes. It's kind of a long story (TLDR at the bottom) but here's what you need to know:

Sam: my ex-boyfriend

Cara: one of my best friends

Vinnie: also one of my best friends

Laney: Me :)

The backstory: Sam and I used to date three years ago and it was the first relationship that ever felt like it could lead to something, at least for me. For him I was apparently just a rebound and I was heartbroken when he broke up with me because he still loved his ex. He never gave me an explanation either and I only found out that that´s why he left when I went through his phone (I know that that´s wrong but I was 18, dumb and very heartbroken).

We all went to school together and Sam, Cara and I belonged to the same, very close friend group, which was great while we were dating and everyone jokingly said that the three of us were in a love triangle because we did everything together. But it sucked when we broke up because he sat behind me in every class and we saw each other outside of school too. I was constantly crying and it took a year for me to not be sad anymore and after about two years I was finally completely over him. Cara was extremely supportive and defended me against everyone who made fun of me for crying and quietly explained to teachers why I wasn´t participating in their classes.

Now three years later we are all friends again and it´s not weird to see Sam because I do still love him but in the same way I love Cara and my other friends. I was happy again. That´s the backstory of that part but I still need to explain what started to happen a few months ago.

Cara told me in August that Sam liked her and she didn´t know what to do because again, we are all best friends and something like that can mess up the dynamics especially because Cara didn´t feel the same way... I thought it was kind of weird but I wasn´t surprised because it just made sense and I told her I absolutely did not care and even said I thought it´d be cute. She insisted that there would never be anything between them and that was that.

Yesterday however she asked me if I wanted to come over and I said yes because I hadn´t seen her in a while (thanks Corona) and I didn´t think anything of it. But there was a reason she wanted to talk to me. Cara and Sam are officially dating now. I knew it as soon as she said she had something to tell me and my immediate reaction was complete happiness. Again, no one was surprised when they heard that Sam liked Cara, it just makes sense and I think they can make each other very happy. She told me that it had been going on for MONTHS and she never thought to say a single thing about it because it wasn´t official and she didn´t know how to feel about it. Also ""You´re his ex and it´s weird."" But she did tell her family and a couple of our friends.

When she went home the happiness was still there but I also had this feeling of idk... sadness? I guess I felt a little betrayed and like she didn´t trust me because I tell her everything and she didn´t even mention anything even though our other friends knew. My friend Vinnie understands her side and said it might be weird for her because after all I am the ex and she might have wanted make up her mind without a third party chiming in and confusing her further but she told a lot of other ""third parties"" and I think after not sleeping alone for the last couple of weeks and telling each other ""I love you"" she could have said something. So, the issue isn´t that they´re dating, it just sucks that apparently to my best friend I´m now just her boyfriend´s ex and she didn´t think our friendship was worth more than my short relationship with Sam three years ago...

I feel really bad because I know they´d be bummed if I didn´t support them 110% and I just know they will get married someday so I don´t want to be something they have to worry about or feel like they have to hide anything when I´m there. Idk what to do because one of my biggest fears is losing my friends.

TLDR: Two of my best friends are dating, one of them is my ex and even though I don´t have an issue with it, they apparently do and she seems to see me more as her new boyfriend´s ex than her best friend.",10Dec2020,1
532,"Hello everyone, sorry in advance for the lengthy text which might be TMI, but please hear me out. 

For a bit of background, I (M20+) have had a few relationship, but mainly have been in a relationship for over 4 years starting in high school and am now in what we could describe as my ""second serious relationship"" which has been going on for a few years.

In this relationship, I grew along my significant other, both surviving through university. I am my gf's first serious relationship  and a lot of firsts happened. We discovered that no matter what we do, we cannot have intimate relations without her feeling uncomfortable or litterally hurting, no matter what accessories/consummables used. I am not asking for medical advice, as she has been to a doctor a few times and there are a few solutions currently being investigated. 

I end up being really troubled regarding the way forward with this, as the medical expertise that we have had for the last year did not seem to ""fix"" the problem, if it can even be fixed. I do not want to push her into something that is physically harming her, but at the same time I do not think I would be willing to live my life without having intimate relations with the person I live my life with and want to build a familly with. We are periodically trying again while going through treatments, but every time I feel like I am the one pushing for it and this is overall not a good situation to be in for anyone.

In conclusion, I would really appreciate advice regarding my own way to see things and possible ways forward, does this kind of situation possibly resolve in a positive way? Should I just change the way I think about this or should I more actively look for solutions? I try to talk about this sometimes but she only puts the blame on herself, which I completely disagree with, and tell her so. I really care about my significant other and want to build a familly with her and she feels the same way, but I cannot help but fear that this might not be possible for reasons outside our control.

533,"Okay this is actually quite a complicated situation and isnt really just the typical ""boy likes girl and doesnt know how to tell her"" situation.

To start, im from the UK, im originally from the south of england and lived there all my life until the start of this year when my dad kicked out so i had to move in with my sister in south wales (kinda convenient because i also started uni in south wales this september). 

When i was in secondary school down in england i met a girl who was a friend of a friend, we spoke occassionally, i thought she was really cool. We went to a few parties together and would sit on the sofa talking and that. I started to develop a bit of a crush on her, but I ended up moving school for my final year of a levels before moving to wales and the friendship kinda just fizzled out. Were still friends and occassionally swipe up to reply to each others snapchat stories and that. When i koved to wales so much was going on in my life that i didnt really think much of her, but recently ive been seeing her stories a lot and hearing about her through the grapevine (instagram lol) and it just makes me realise that the feelings i had for her never really stopped, just paused. But now im in this situation where we dont even really talk, so i cant just say ""hey i like you"" because we talk like, one convo every 2/3 months. 

The fact that im in a completely different country makes it quite difficult because we cant just meet up or anything and get to know each other that way, which if i still lived in england i would definitely do. I think shes a bit out of my league but shes really awesome and i would like to at least say i tried to pursue something, even if we become good friends and i decide actually i dont want to pursue things further than friends. The first port of call is obviously to become good friends with her before telling her, i just dont know how to develop that friendship i guess.

Any advice?

3. New girl crosses her eyes like a champ apparently (notable quality i guess lol), and my supervisor says ""the only thing worse than that are knuckle crackers."" (i do this all day, bad habit, took it personally)

4. new girl asks if i am doing anything for my birthday, i said im not sure, probably not! I said I was regretting getting closer to 30. I think she took that personally (she is 34 or so idek) and said, ""30s are better, less drama"" (took it personally LOL) 

5. i went from 160 to 108 because of my mental health and during this time i was using pto for doctors appointments, health days, etc. My supervisor would just ask, ""well is your illness forever?"" which makes me feel like shit because I know I'm inconveniencing her. That's all it is. 

When my dog was mauled and a tendon was out, I had to bring her to the ER. All she gave a shit about was ""WHEN WILL YOU BE HERE??"" before I finally said I am NOT coming in.

when the new girl and i are together alone not a word is uttered. 

it's just a shitty environment... amazing pay... the work is easy... i just can't stand my coworkers anymore. There is no moving departments.

So basically, I’ve been sneaking out to see my boyfriend since there is no other way I can. I mean, it’s part of being a reckless teenager LOL. My dad though, sometimes likes to sleep downstairs on the couch or sometimes upstairs. Recently he started sleeping downstairs and now he’s ACTUALLY wanting to sleep downstairs, like my mom brought him pillows and an actual blanket and stuff. 

Now the only way I can sneak out is through the back door or front door which are both downstairs. I’m trying to manifest him to sleep upstairs permanently but I’m hoping it would come faster or take permanent effect. 

I also feel he started sleeping downstairs because he might’ve caught someone sneaking out last year. But if he did, he would’ve started sleeping downstairs from then on (which he kind of did, but he would alternate). I don’t think he’s ever slept downstairs for this long. 

What would be the best technique to manifest that he sleeps upstairs permanently, in order for me to sneak out? 

Sidenote; im also very new to manifesting, please be light",10Dec2020,1

545,"We met around four years back. I've had feelings for them ever since. The two of us were in the same class and have never met each other until that point. We just clicked. They were a person who showed me kindness and always made me feel safe. We'd often text each other about anything to the point to where they said ""I feel like I can tell you anything.""  The two of us were secretly quite close unlike how we appeared in real life where we had trouble talking to each other. Having to look at them and how others around us would react really contribute to this. 

A year later, I confessed as we were graduating. They liked me too for a while. It was never only me though. There were others. Others who I didn't know if they also had an emotional bond with them as we had. Luckily, after talking, the two of us remained friends. Nowadays, the two of us are still close and speak on a weekly basis. It's what I look forward to to get through the week. Though they're a person who greatly values their privacy, they're always willing to open up about their life and experiences whenever I ask.

On one hand, it feels right. I've been in the same class with others for years and have known people for years as well but they've never stuck around. They did. If they've reciprocated the same feelings, what says they can't do it again? Though, the first time, I suspected they felt the same but ruled it off as me being desperate (it's happening again.) The two of us have such similar humor and can practically communicate without words. 

On the other hand, our relationship has been quite one-sided, with me almost always initiating conversations (they're like this with others though.) Also, whenever they've reciprocated my feelings, it was never only me they were interested in. (But hey, they go to an all gendered school, so perhaps they won't be interested in others?) There were others that caught their eye. We also don't like bringing up our ""history"" together in terms of how we've felt towards each other.

Should I even attempt to ""make some sort of move?"" If so, how can I do it without ruining our relationship? (I apologize this might not be as important as more serious questions on this subreddit. It's just been nagging at my mind.)",10Dec2020,1

\- He plays poker  
\- He is a referee

547,"For context I am a 23 year old female and my father is 66. My mom died when I was five from a crack overdose and it’s just been me and him since. For as long as I can remember my dad has been addicted to pain killers and alcohol and will do any drug he can get his hands on. He can also go weeks doing nothing. The last 5 years he stopped hardcore doing painkillers and went on Suboxone but still regularly does meth, drinks alcohol.. literally anything he can get his hands on. He also constantly talks about hookers and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. I’m about 85% sure he’s a sociopath but I’d like to believe he loves me.

The first time I ever took a painkiller I was 12 I stole one from his bottle and took them at school. Never really bothered with them again until high school. My dad would always randomly ask if I wanted one of his roxy 30s(when he was high) and I always declined.. Atleast for a while. One day he asked me again when my best friend Cassie was over and I decided fuck it I’ll do it cause she wanted one. He gave me 30mg my first time and I pretty much projectile vomited all day. But I loved the high. It made me awake and happy and full of energy. After that he would regularly offer them to me. 

My real problem began when I was 19. I moved out at 17 when I graduated highschool to live with my boyfriend and his parents because my dad was abusive and I didn’t feel safe. We were together 2 years but when we broke up I had nowhere to go. I went back home. Once again dad started offering pills. I wanted them more and more. He prescription got cut when his doctor died and he was fucked. This is when he has to get clean.

He got clean for the most part but I still wanted them. He started selling them to me from one of his friends as long as I’d do some with him. It started out maybe once a month I’d get them. Then it turned once a week. It got to the point where my dad was selling me 180mg of oxy a day. I blew threw 10,000 dollars that I had saved. (I was living alone in an apartment at this time and was and still am financially independent). I finally decided enough was enough and got prescribed Suboxone. 

Cut forward to today I realize I traded out one pill for another I still have to take something every morning to feel normal. My dad called and asks if I want some pills like he does usually once a month or so. This time I say yes. I’ve been high for a week.

I know I’m an adult and it’s not all my dads fault. I make my own decisions and I could easily say no. But i resent him so much. I hate that he offers them to me and I hate that he sees nothing wrong with this. I feel that normal parents who care about their kids would never do this. So does this mean he doesn’t care about me? He told me he needed me to buy them so he doesn’t “lose his connection”. Like what the fuck. What do I even do about this? I obviously don’t have the will power to say no and he’s the only family I have.",10Dec2020,1

554,"(just a heads up this was originally posted in aita but it got taken down due to the mention of covid in the post) 

For context im 17 (18 in January) 

My parents are pretty strict and I don't get away with alot. Its always been like this but it's not like the rules they laid out were unreasonable and had no meaning as annoying as it can get sometimes. When everyone first got into lockdown the rules were simple. Wear a mask if going outside, and if you meet with someone give them a disposable mask if they dont already have one and refrain from physical contact. These rules still apply today. 

Well recently I got sick. throwing up, runny nose, cant really move ect. However we weren't sure if it was covid or a flu, but my stepfather was also experiencing the same symptoms as I was. Obviously because of this I couldn't go out and my mom wanted me to stay in bed (not that I could get out of it anyway). She encouraged that I continue to join my classes with my camera off and try to pay attention the best I could however I found it difficult and often fell asleep so didn't bother after awhile. 

Few days later I ended up starting to feel better, I felt good enough I could actually get up again and eat at the supper table like I used to (as nice as it was to get my supper brought to me) my step dad however seemed to have only gotten worse and was now coughing quite a bit as I could hear him from my room most of the time.

When I told my mom I was feeling a bit better she told me that now I can walk around and get things for myself, I should wear a mask when leaving my room to avoid getting her sick. I didnt think too much of it at first and did so without issue but that's when I noticed my stepdad whos probably more sick than I am wasn't wearing a mask and was basically sitting right beside my mom. I was a bit confused  and asked  why that was the case and my mom said ""well he coughs into his elbow so we doubt hes spreading it"" 

This pissed me off a bit because they made it sound like I just cough in the open when in reality I cough in my shirt (I feel its more effective than the elbow since people could still grab the area or something) and that they dont trust that I could be responsible enough to do so.  I brought this up as politely as possible trying not to get them mad but I was told to go to my room because I talked back. I refused and brought up how its unfair and that if I have to wear a mask then they should too or at very least just stepdad, considering if hes sick like I am and if my moms so concerned about it then he should be fallowing the same rules I am instead of putting her at risk for something that could possibly be covid. 

They gave me the reason that ""hes too sick to wear a mask"" and that its ""hard to breathe"" meanwhile my stepdad was staying completely silent as my mom yelled at me for calling out the unfairness. I was trying really hard not to yell at her back since that never lead to anything good but I was starting to get defensive. Eventually I couldn't hold it in anymore and told her that she ""better be ready to go to the hospital if its covid"" and left the scene. Surprisingly she didnt come in here to say anything about me being disrespectful or something like she normally would in such a situation. 

I later ended up ranting to my friend about it over text and they told me to give them the bennifit of the doubt and that I was being unreasonable. I feel like I shouldn't have yelled at her in that last moment but its really hard not to yell back after being yelled at for at least 20 minutes.  

Not sure if I should apologize or if I was actually being unreasonable so I thought I'd get some extra opinions.",10Dec2020,1

556,"I went to college with this guy when I was 19 (I’m 24 now) and we were friends, but not close friends. Like the kind where you have mutual friends and don’t mind having a conversation, but would never ask them to hang out just you two. Those kinds. He was liking on a friend of mine at the time, so we never really knew each other. (I should note that this guy did kiss me; I must have made a face because he immediately apologized and we never spoke about it again.) 

Fast forward to about 3 years ago. Me and this guy reconnected and decided to catch up. (I know very out of the blue). We started hanging out a lot and became basic level friends. (Like see each other like twice a month.) we started sleeping together a few times at first, then we started sleeping together all the time, hanging out every week (watching movies, going to dinners, going to networking events together, museums,etc.) We had a mutual understanding (yes there was a conversation) that we were basically FWB. I was cool with that (in fact I preferred that; so did he.) . Fast forward to around 10 months ago. Over quarantine we became extremely close, we talked on the phone all the time, FaceTiming, texting, checking in on each other mentally and emotionally. But (because of quarantine) we weren’t seeing each other in person. Like long distance. Which personally I was confused why he was still talking to me because I thought he was only there for one thing. He stayed though. Through me having to go through trauma counseling, to getting my surgery, to being there when I lost everything. He’s helped me when I literally didn’t have anything and I was sleeping in my car. And I was there for him in those ways as well. But still we always made sure each of us knew we were just friends. 

To the point of this story. The other night we were smoking and he leans to me and says “you know I don’t hang out with you because we sleep together, I like hanging out with you.” I told him I knew and kind of laughed it off (I’m not a mushy person, I have a very hard shell) and there’s things he does where I have to say to question if he has actually feelings for me.",10Dec2020,1

574,"I (27F) matched with someone about three or so weeks ago on hinge. I initially liked his photo because I thought he was cute and I could tell we had similar interests by his photos and his answers to his prompts. Turns out we went to the same high school and graduated in the same class almost ten years ago but didn’t know each other. His response after we first matched was “wait, you went to ___?!” my high school is listed in my profile. After discussing that, we started talking but not a whole lot. Neither of us respond to each other until later at night. I usually don’t check the app until I’m in bed looking at my phone before I lay down. It would go back and forth maybe once or twice at the most and then whoever’s turn it was would respond the next night and so on and so forth. So it’s been slow rolling so far. 

We haven’t spoken in about a week because he’s been away. The last thing I messaged him last week was “have a nice time and that I’d say send me pictures but you can’t do that on this app” thinking maybe he’d give me his or ask for my number (dumb dumb dumb- I should have just been straightforward and given him my number I know) he responded back last night and just said “thanks!” and didn’t acknowledge the last part of what I said. I feel kinda weird and not sure what to say next. I don’t want to all of a sudden be like “here’s my number” after not talking at all for a week but I feel like I should if I want to show I’m interested in getting to know him more, which I am. Or should I just keep talking to him on the app and see how the conversation goes? I feel like since we don’t talk much since there are lapses between our messages, it’s dying out. Or should I just not reply and let him reach out if he’s interested in talking more once he’s home? 

The part of me that is always hard on myself feels like maybe he only messaged me because he realized we were the same age and went to the same school so he was wondering who tf I was. And that he isn’t interested in me but is just being nice. Idk. This probably sounds dumb. It isn’t anything at all and we’re just talking. I know I’m dwelling and overreacting and definitely shouldn’t be but I just feel kinda weird and stuck and any advice on what I should do next would be appreciated.",10Dec2020,1

However, this semester I'm at risk of failing. If I do I'll be able to retry again in march. I fully plan on retrying again in march should I fail.

577,"Hi everyone, sorry about the weird question.

Basically, I burnt pasta in my microwave 2 days ago (by not thinking and not adding water to the bowl, then trying to cook it). Long story short, the pasta turned black and there was lots of foul smelling smoke, but no flames.

It left this gross yellow residue everywhere inside that I can’t get out (and a faint smell). I’ve tried everything I can find online, lemon juice, baking soda, vinegar, even just regular Mr. Clean Magic Eraser’s. Nothing works.

I’m pretty frustrated that no matter what this stuff just refuses to come off. Any ideas to get rid of it? Advice? Thank you!!",10Dec2020,1

581,"So I currently work at a bakery for a very conservative polish man. I feel like I do a lot for him ( work weeks without a day off, work holidays, stay after etc.) and he doesn’t appreciate. I am his only employee and I am not able to call off if I’m sick even when I was worried I had covid and extremely sick. Yesterday he was really rude to me when I came in and had a migraine and said something along the lines of “so what your not going to talk to me all day” and was basically throwing a fit about me not talking to him. So after my break when I got back he said “do you realize you walk like this “ que him doing some kind of weird Quasimodo walk? Lol even though I think I walk perfectly fine. Maybe he was just trying to make me feel bad idk? 
He has asked me to use the restroom before clocking into work and just a whole bunch of other shit that I think is illegal. Not to mention he is racist, sexist and homophobic and sometimes he really starts to piss me off with the things he says.

After yesterday I was at home crying and just felt like I shouldn’t even come back today and quit on the spot. I’m honestly afraid to give my two weeks notice because I’m not sure how he will treat me during those two weeks....

587,"So, I'm 29 and about 2 years shy of my Bachelors. I'm planning on getting my Masters after as well. If I go to a on campus university, I would have to wait until Fall 2021 and will finish in Fall 2023. I won't have debt because I get financial aid. The other option is to take this cohort accelerated online bachelors degree program at a accredited university. Both schools are Cal State, so neither is really better then the other. If I do the online program, I'd start Spring 2021 and be done Spring 2022. The program is 16 months. Downside to this is I'll have to take on about $20,000 worth of student debt because tuition is a bit higher and financial aid doesn't cover it. I plan on working full-time, so I won't need to take out anything additional for living expenses. At first, it was a no way, but now I really want to consider it. I don't really want to spend an additional year and half on my Bachelors if I don't have to. I feel like that time could be used towards my Masters and working towards the career I actually want to be in. I'm getting older and really don't want to spend additional time in school if I don't have to. I want to move on with my life. It's really not a rush, I'm just ready to move on and create a life that is a lot more fulfilling. The older I get, the more precious time becomes.

589,"I was married this year and everything went off without a hitch- minus my photographer issues. In her package she offered:

1,000 edited images

custom care package with 15 high quality prints &amp; framed keepsake

***images delivered within 40 days of wedding date***.

This was GREAT, 40 days after our wedding date would be perfect timing to gift images to parents for xmas. I signed the contract in Dec., and put down the deposit. Late April, she emails to let me know she is pregnant &amp; is due about 2 weeks after my wedding, but her business partner will be there no matter what. I don't mind having Business Partner be the photographer, so I congratulate her and let her know this isn't a problem at all.

She calls a week before the wedding to let me know she will not be there &amp; gives me the info of her assistant. (Note she previously said business partner)

Wedding happens and Assistant is fantastic. Photographer emails the following Tuesday, she got the pictures and is ""looking forward to going through our images."" I submit the rest of my payment in full, per our contract.

2 weeks go by, and I hear nothing. On her Facebook page, she posted a sneak peek of a wedding that happened after mine. I'm slightly bothered, but I move past it.

5 weeks after the wedding, still nothing. Fine, but the clock is ticking to get our entire collection. Husband emails asking if he could get 1 or 2 pics to tide us over (I have the post-wedding blues pretty bad). She responds in 30 min ""Yes of course, sorry I haven't done a sneak peak yet (I have a newborn at home and she hates it when I work :)"" Husband replies a nice thank you and congratulates her on the baby.

Two days later, we receive a sneak peek, with another ""Sorry I am slow, my newborn hates it when I do anything that doesn't completely revolve around her!""

We are now **60 days** past the wedding and I have not heard a peep. I know she has a newborn, I also know she has an assistant that can edit. I'm more annoyed that I haven't heard anything about when we will be receiving our pics. If I were to get an ""I'm sorry, I didn't know how time consuming a newborn would be, your pictures will be late, is that okay?"", this wouldn't be an issue. If I had not paid because I didn't realize how expensive a wedding would be, I would be sued. On the other hand, how pushy can I be, she could just send me non-edited pics and say she threw a filter on them?

(I am not a mother, so I get how this can sound jaded and rude towards new moms, however I was a nanny for a newborn, and a full time caretaker of my nephew, so I do know a little about what caring for a baby takes.)

**How should I approach her about getting my pictures? When should I take her to court over this? Am I being a bridezilla?** 

TLDR: my wedding photographer is 20 days past her contract, and is using her newborn as an excuse for lack of communication.",10Dec2020,1

For an embarrassing amount of time, I’ve had an odor from down there. My doctors gave me pills, creams, and everything else available. I’m assuming they thought I washed it, but sadly they were wrong. They told me to start washing it then sent me on my way. 

So my dad bought me a “Feminine Hygiene” wash that says it’s PH balancing but I’m skeptical. I read on the web that you should never used scented wash on your nether region. And the soap have a VERY strong lavender smell, which makes no sense to me.

597,"When I was sixteen, I went through a terrible depressive phase, in addition to feeling unwell, dizzy, lifeless and experienced severe mood swings. I remember being shunned at school and not being taken seriously at home despite telling my parents I didn't feel so good, because I didn't have any 'symptoms' of an illness.
My immunity was so bad I contracted chicken pox, dengue and bronchitis in the timespan of a year, and during the tests done it was revealed that the cause of my low immunity was anemia. I recovered, but I don't think my immunity did. Since then, I've always been physically weak.

I joined med school when I was nineteen. I was sick for a month before I started, and spent the day before I had to take my flight in the ER because I couldn't breathe, got myself discharged against medical advice, flew to uni, spent the next month sick as well. This was when the anxiety kicked in.

First year was hell. Every disease or medical condition we studied, I was convinced I had, which sucked. A mouth ulcer equaled oral cancer. Getting breathless climbing stairs was because of pneumonia. Elevated heartrate after exercise was a heart attack. Headaches were because of aneurysms. Late periods were because of PCOS. I always always felt like I was going to die from one of many illnesses. I'd give myself panic attacks, claw at my hair and skin, bite myself, because I was so scared.

I visited my university hospital constantly, and while most of my visits resulted in the doctors sending my back with a Tylenol equivalent, they did tell me I had a torn retina (not large enough to warrant surgery, it healed on its own) solar urticaria (sunlight allergy), and bronchitis (again).

I came home in March and didn't feel like I was about to die as frequently, but I still have panic attacks.
When I'm not panicking, I just lie down thinking about nothing, with no energy to do anything. I miss my classes, miss my meals, go for days without showering or brushing my teeth, because I just don't care. Other times I get a sort of adrenaline rush and have to run for hours before I stop feeling jittery. Sometimes I get into verbal fights with my family and I get so angry the only way I can calm down is by watching, or thinking about, violence/murder. This has now become a cycle and I don't know how to break it. The only times I actually feel like I have to break the cycle are few and far between- today is one such moment. I don't know when the next one will come.

I booked an appointment with a therapist in July, but my father was so dismissive about it, and made fun of me so much, it that I never went back after that first appointment.

Recently I received a letter from my old employers stating I owe them over £900 from my time working there. 

However as far as I am aware I have never been overpaid, and I have done plenty of overtime and feel I have at times been under-paid😥

I’m wondering if there’s anyone who may have advice on where to proceed next? Or someone who has experienced the same?
If I do not pay over the £900 the company are asking for then they will apparently be taking legal action, this will be devastating for me as I am a student and I am already struggling financially.😔

602,"r/Advice,

I've been living with my roommate (let's call Pickles) for almost a year now. Pickles moved in suddenly after their previous two living situations had not worked out (previous roommate kicked them out and they were living at a family members house while they were out of town). I had wanted to live alone for a month or two prior to a roommate but bent to accommodate them as they are a friend and moved in with them.

A day or two after moving in Pickles lost their kitchen job due to the pandemic. They have since been unemployed. I have over the past 8 months encouraged them to look for work as there were lots of seasonal jobs within walking distance to get some income and experience. Pickles wanted something permanent, so applied to nothing. They are now applying for unemployment and asking friends and family for money to make rent. I have told Pickles this concerns me for their livelihood.

Pickles is still my friend but living with them has been difficult. Pickles does not allow me to wash dishes and stated early on they need control of the kitchen. Pickles tells me what items in the kitchen are used for. They decide what dishes and how many I get to use because they want to do the dishes. If I use an extra plate I am scolded because I make extra work for Pickles that they insist only they can do. I hate this and have asked Pickles if they could show me how they want these things done so I could do them but I am told this is a waste of time and there is no point. Still feeling the sting of that one.

Living with Pickles makes me feel pretty shitty. It feels like they walk around with a chip on their shoulder, telling me how they're fighting with someone on social media, their family, or just overall fighting social injustices in the world. Sometimes Pickles sends this energy at me too, twisting my words after I have clarified what they mean.

I'm feeling exhausted. Maybe it's the weight of the pandemic but I don't want to live in this negative environment anymore. I've been thinking of asking Pickles to leave for a few months but due to the pandemic I worry if this may be immoral. Due to increased utility costs i also planned to increase rent with a two month warning which may also (not intentionally) push them out.

Can I ask a roommate to leave during a pandemic? How can I ask them to leave when I know they may have nowhere they can or afford to go?

Thanks for listening.",10Dec2020,1

610,"So, let me give a little backstory. My sister (S) and her wife (W) have been together for about 4 years, give or take. Back when they first started dating, everything was great. W and I became fast friends. She helped me with school work and my resume for my first job. It was always so much fun being with them. 

But once they moved in together, they began to fight constantly. It was always so painful just to go out somewhere with them. They would have these small arguments that would leave everything awkward and silent. Even during game nights that were supposed to be focused on having fun, they would find something to knock heads over. 

This has been going on for a while now. And the worst part was that I wasn't getting the full story from S. I always noticed that W was a bit manipulative with S and whenever we were hanging out, I would point it out. 

An example; Our uncle was in town recently and S was over at our house having a great time. We were all talking, joking around, and eating some good food. That's when W called. Usually, when W gets off of work, she calls S and talks to her until she gets home. But this time S asked, ""Hey honey? Is it alright if I don't talk with you on your way over? I haven't seen uncle in a really long time and I really want to keep talking with him."" W said it was fine. 

Fast forward to when W arrives at our house. She's sulking and pouting as she walks in the door. S asked her what was wrong and W then proceeded to guilt trip S into apologizing for not staying on the phone with her. That's just one example of MANY. 

Sadly, that is not the worst thing that W does. 

A few weeks ago S decided to stay at my house for a while. I was very confused when my mom called to tell me that, only for her to follow up with, ""W beat the shit out of S."" I. Was. Furious. 

When I came home that night, I saw S laying on the couch and she showed me some of the bruises, and let me tell you, it broke my heart. S then finally told us the full story about how this wasn't the first time W had done this and how she would look up the definition of abuse every week. After a few days of S staying with us, I saw how she was so much happier. She hadn't been that happy in a very long time. 

But sadly, S decided to go back to W. And I told her outright, ""I will support you no matter what. But I can never forgive W for what she has done."" S just responded with, ""I know. It's okay if you don't."" 

So now I've found myself between a rock and a hard place. I really, REALLY don't want to get W anything for Christmas. But I know she'll bitch and moan about it and put on the waterworks.

I spent Thanksgiving with my immediate family. There are only four of us, and I have been very careful (isolating, seeing only my boyfriend in-person, working from home, wearing masks, ordering and disinfecting groceries, etc). Upon returning home from my family house, I immediately got sick. COVID results pending. 

My family has not been very careful. My dad had COVID already and recovered (thankfully), and everybody still has to work in person. My dad is still going to visit family and friends at larger gatherings, eating out, going to bars, and going about life as though there isn’t a pandemic going on. My brother works in retail and still goes about hanging out with his friends and girlfriend without proper COVID precautions, and I think I got whatever I have from him.

I would still go home for Christmas if it were just my immediate family. But my dad is planning on going to stay with my high-risk grandmother, and I don’t necessarily feel comfortable going along. I don’t want to offend my family/grandma or spend Christmas alone, but I also want to do my part to protect my grandma.

I talk to my husband, both brother and sister in law and mother in law. For them (not my husband) to tell me that I'm just picking on her. So people of reddit tell me if I'm wrong.  
It started with her first breaking the rules I say bedtime at 10 pm. She feels she can stay up as long as she want cuz she had to finally school work. I tell her well you have all day time to do it not night. But go on deaf ear. Then she want to tell me that when her mom away she in charge. So I can't tell her anything I need to bud out. I try talking to her but she just roll her eyes and tell me I'm not her mom and leave her alone. So I talk to both her parents they tell me that I need to just leave her alone cuz they will handle it. But nothing happen they just walk in the bathroom talk for like 5 minutes then go about there day. The last straw was when they ask if they can take all my daughter clothes out of her dresser and put her clothes in and put up led light. I said no. Her favorite line is "" what the big deal it only"" whatever she want. So I told her no and that final.

 I don’t have very much faith in myself for a lot. If i’m being honest, i genuinely hate myself. Because I was an extremely obese child, i was obviously teased every day. I couldn’t stand being in public because of the looks i would get so i homeschooled in 6th grade. Now years later i’m still homeschooled but i have absolutely 0 real life friends. I used to have a couple friends to play video games with, but they were really intense. there was never really a serious moment with them and all the humor was offensive jokes (including slurs and whatever). I was around 12/13 when i started talking to them so that rubbed off on me. I became a big troll on the internet for a couple years and i fucking hate myself for that. Me being young thought that as long as it’s a joke i could say anything. This has been haunting me for this entire year now.

628,"Hi, I'm here to vent/get some input and since im a guy who can't talk about his feelings in person I guess I'm gonna try reddit :)

So over a year ago a few bad things happened all at once. Family related stuff, the pressure that comes with moving out from my parents and managing all the real life adult stuff for the first time. Plus most importantly my first real crush dumped me after dating for some months. I felt pretty bad for quite a while, which is okay.

But I never really recovered from all that. Multiple times a week, for no real reason I get absurdly hung up on the fact that this girl rejected me. My heart starts racing and I feel extremly stressed out and helpless. I always need about an hour of beeing alone just to kind of ""reorder"" my thoughts and then I feel better but the rest of the day I'm kind of drowning in self-pity.

This has been going on for over a year and a half now and although i can manage feeling bad on repeat it is just really exhausting.

I feel like I'm obsessing over this person for no (apparent) reason, since even on bad days I can kind of accept that it just wasn't meant to be and that theres ""gonna be a next one"".

Said crush and I are still friends and see each other on occasion, which doesnt help. (Also hooking up with said crush doesn't help - who could've guessed)

Now the input I'm looking for is: Is it possible that I'm still hurting from the rejection more than 18 months after it happened? Because to me it seems like either I REALLY suck at getting rejected or I might just be in a bad mental state and the rejection is just what my head comes up with to ""feel bad"" if that makes any sense?! Has anyone experienced something similar? I just want to know how I could be approaching this whole situation and get better, since I have no real idea about what I'm feeling or should be doing.

Any input appreciated. Also it just felt good posting this :)",10Dec2020,1

630,"Hi everyone,

Disclaimer: Its a bit long and I’m on my phone so forgive me for the lack of a proper draft up and/or structure of the post.

I would sincerely appreciate it if you took the time to read through it and let me know your thoughts on the situation. I never post anything tbh but I’ve been overthinking about a recent incident lately and needed some insight/advice. I’m in my early 20’s. I recently rented out a basement room at a house where the property owner is a single mother living upstairs (we’ll call her Jane).

Prior to moving in, I spoke to Jane over the phone. Jane knew a family friend of mine (we’ll call them Nicole) and told me that she would be willing to rent out the basement room for as long as I’d want because of the good references I had. I told her, over the phone, that I very much appreciate my privacy, and if I do move in, I would like as much as segregation between us as possible. She said okay but it seemed that she forgot relatively quickly (more on this later).

A couple of her rules that she requested of me were: - No guests allowed to visit me in the house except my family members - No pets and smoking allowed

I found having the “no friends allowed as visiting guests” rule a bit odd but I respected it whole heartedly. And of course, as far as the no smoking rule goes, I have never once smoked inside the house anywhere. Its common sense and courtesy anyway to not smoke inside and go outside to have a 5 minute smoke. I occasionally smoke cigarettes and thats it, but that has always been outside and far away from the place of residence. I personally wouldn’t ever do it inside the house even if it was allowed, since I hate a room smelling like an ash tray just lingering around constantly.

Anyway she started falsely accusing me smoking cigarettes inside and that her kid was allergic to it. I respectfully told her that I had never smoked inside the house. She said that she may have mistaken it for something else. Then she started to invite me to have dinner upstairs with her and the kids, to which I respectfully declined. She offered food to me a few times to which I repeatedly said “thanks but no thanks”. I wanted my life to be completely segregated from hers, no matter what she offered.

Even though I was living in a basement, there wasn’t a separate entrance unfortunately so we had to share the same main entrance. One evening as I was going out to get some coffee + a nice walk around the block, she stopped me as I was about to exit the main entrance. She said that she would like to get some coffee too and that if I was going to the nearby coffee shop, she was hoping to tag along and walk together with me to and back from the coffee shop. This was extremely awkward for me and weirded me out since I barely knew her and I had already explicitly made clear to her to not overstep the lines of privacy prior to moving in. But it seemed that she had totally forgotten about that, which I really didn’t appreciate. Anyway, I told her that “no, I’m not going to the nearby coffee shop, i’m going out to one thats much further” and I ended up dipping from there all alone without her tagging along.",10Dec2020,1
631,"I am working in customer service for a supermarket chain and handle phone calls. Increasingly we get rules about what we are and are not allowed to do for customers. A frequent question I get lately is people struggling with planning their home delivery orders for their groceries, because things on our website tend to not work. Also many auto-plan orders haven't been planned in. I am able to reserve a moment for customers by placing a small order myself that they can then change, usually helping them out a lot. However, officially we are now forbidden to do that because the customers would 'become complacent' if we keep doing things they should be able to do themselves. 

With all the limitations I keep getting, I'm hardly able to do anything for people that are really dependent on their home deliveries, so helping them plan an order is about the only thing I can actually do for them. I feel a storm brewing with a coworker who is a bit of a stickler for rules and a tattletale, because she is making complaints about folks still planning those orders in general (so against the rules).

I can have a bit of a heart of stone regarding many things I have to say for work, but I'm not sure I can do that with this. If I would follow the rules exactly, I would effectively do nothing for customers practically begging me for help. I just feel really bad for them, especially because it's so easy to help them out a bit by doing a 1 min task for them. What should I do?

636,"So for light context, up until two days I ago I was working as a liquor store manager for a fairly large company in my city. I am 20, had no prior experience, but was promoted because the old manager left and they figured I was the best option? Needless to say, I was doing a poor job overall, partially because I wasn't cut out for it, but also because my boss was pretty terrible to me, and after I came back from Covid leave (was feeling unwell but didn't actually have it, still **legally** had to isolate) he served me my termination noticed and cited that I apparently wasn't showing up for scheduled shifts, and also he had to do my employees timecards as I had no assistant manager (thanks to him) and I was unable to come in because covid.

Now, just two weeks ago I was thinking about quitting/transferring within the company as I was not feeling very confident in the role, so I reached out to the manager of an entirely different (but much larger) store to see if they might need someone either before or after the holiday season going forward. He replied just before I was fired, and said that they would be interested, and that they would like to have a meeting but I would have to tell my boss about it first just for transparency and also to get the ball rolling on the transfer.

Fast forward to me being fired, I was pretty confused about the whole thing but my boss just told me to leave and if I had any questions to contact HR about it. So I did, writing an essay about my experiences with the role and also my boss, but at the end asked them if I could still do that transfer instead. HR replied to me saying they would let my former boss know about the potential meeting, and that I was cleared to go ahead with it, but it would have to be as a new hire rather than a transfer now obviously.

My main question is this: How do I go into this meeting and be like: ""Hi there, FYI I was just fired, but I am a great person please still hire me."" without totally scaring them off. I understand that it's inevitable they will question that whole situation thoroughly, but I want to know how to best put it so they give me a fair shot. Because in my opinion I am an excellent sales person, and I really do have a passion for the craft beer industry, so just working as a sales associate while I do university would be the perfect role for me.

Thank you so much in advance, it means so much! &lt;3

TL;DR: Got fired from my job as liquor store manager, was wanting to transfer to new store within company as sales associate because I was struggling as manager, HR said I can still do that but I will have to tell new store about me being fired as they have to treat me as new hire now.

Awe. Same video he says he only has two daughters and laughs that my mom who is divorcing him now was near a wildfire). So I sent another message to his work saying not to let him read it, I got the wrong person, and that I am just a crazy person.   


Why am I so angry? It wouldn’t have originally been libel or slander, because I didn’t lie in the first, really long message, but then I said I was lying, and I have seen Law &amp; Order. ”Was I lying the first time or the second time? Am I lying now? Why should anyone believe me?” I mean, I sent it to his new job that he just got three months ago. The only reason I found it awash because I was looking to see if he died.   


So, am I dumb or completely stupid?",10Dec2020,1

642,"My mother-in-law had an argument with my husband (her son) 2 weeks before Thanksgiving. We were having her and her husband over for Thanksgiving (just the 2 of them with myself, husband and toddler) due to covid. Part of the argument was her wanting to invite other family and we said no. It escalated to her spouting conspiracy theories and political crap. My husband was trying to reason with her about why those things weren't true. She said we have had the wool pulled over our eyes, said she can't believe that he is her son, and hung up on him. 

They surprisingly showed up for Thanksgiving, but she was obviously still extremely upset, avoided my husband, and at one point stormed out to ""go for a walk"". As she refused to be in the same room with my husband, he sat in the living room while I had an incredibly awkward dinner with them and my toddler. She said she only came to see our child, who is her only grandkid. She stated several times she ""shouldn't have even come over"". I told her she needed to talk to him. She did, telling him how he hurt her ""more than anyone ever has"", and he told her he was sorry for hurting her, but he wasn't taking back what he said. Nothing was resolved. They left shortly after. I was honestly pissed that she ruined Thanksgiving because she couldn't either act civil for an hour, or figure out how to resolve their issue like an adult. But I tried to brush it off and enjoy the rest of the day.

The next day she sent me a ridiculous video via a tiktok, which I ignored (she often sends bizarre Facebook or tiktok nonsense as though they are facts). She then asked to come see her grandkid, specifically when my husband would be at work. I  personally think that's crap, and she shouldn't be rewarded for her behavior, but my husband said he wasn't going to punish our child, who absolutely adores her. So I told her very gently that I was worried about her. She asked why, so I said she wasn't acting like herself and I was worried she could be depressed. (She has had a lot of stressors in the past year, not even counting covid, and I am honestly worried about her). No response. So I said she didn't need to talk to me but I hoped she had someone to talk to because even her husband seemed blindsided by the issues she's having with her son. I then said that she can visit any time. No response. 

She never visited, and hasn't contacted either of us. It will be 2 weeks tomorrow. I wouldn't care too much to give her space, but her grandkid's birthday is this weekend. I don't want her here if it's going to be a repeat of Thanksgiving, but also know she will probably hold a grudge forever if she decides we ""made"" her miss his birthday (there is no way she will think this is at all her fault). Not to mention Christmas later this month. They are the only family we have been near because of covid and because they are low risk (she doesn't have a job, his is low contact). 

This situation has already ruined one holiday, and I dread the next few weeks because of all this. My husband has tried to make amends, but at this point the ball is in her court. Yesterday I sent her a cute video of her grandkid. She viewed it, but still didn't respond. I don't know if I should say something or just leave it alone, regardless of the birthday and Christmas.

i was out the other day with some friends, and we were talking about my bestfriend (lets call them M), because they almost outed me and my other friend. i accidentally started using they/them pronouns for them, instead of the he/him pronouns that they were going by around these people. i was the only one they were out to. when someone said 'who' i said ""oh yeah, (name) they are nonbinary"", then i realised what i said and immediately said, ""shit, i wasnt meant to say, please dont say anything"" which made it 5x worse in retrospect because now it sounds like it was me telling a secret/slagging them off. now i dont know what to do.

they found out and they texted me about it. i have trouble reading emotions, and i have trouble with my memory due to trauma, so i could barely remember what actually happened, so i had to go off of what others were saying happened until i remembered this morning. i mentioned about this to my friend, who happened to be with someone who was there, and sent me a voice message saying 'you knew what you were doing, you did it on purpose'. and now i dont know what to do because they obviously told M that, so now they think im making excuses and saying i slipped up on purpose.

646,"Hello, I’ve been studying music for more than 10 years, but all my education (conservatory) is pretty much classical and some specific jazz and “modern” academic composers. I’ve also been studying and playing traditional music for five years and I’ve recently begun working with some DAWs and create some projects.

I’ve already uploaded them on youtube, spotify and related stores, but I’m totally lost at how should I start to get my music known.
I’ve worked on hardbass, lo-fi and I also have some songs from my funk band, all of them are original work.

We’ve tried instagram but without paying for ads its really hard to get exposure, and I would really like to get my music known.
My objective is to get known a bit, I don’t pretend to become the new Ed Sheeran. It’s unrealistic and I’m happy with my work, but it would really warm my heart to see people enjoying my music as much as I enjoy it and improve over time.

I’m currently working on recording a traditional music album with a friend and filming some videos to try to make it more interesting.

652,"Background: I M26 live with my father in my big 5 bedroom house (No rent, very little expenses). I also work as a partner at my father's firm along with my big brother, 30 and my father himself. Of the several small business my father runs on the side is a supermarket he opened years ago for my since-deceased mum. My father and I get our groceries and household supplies from there. We make a lost and forward it to the manager, I go there after work and pick up the package.

My father recently hired a new manager for the supermarket whom I've only met like 4 ~ 5 times. I'll call her Jane(24). Jane is insanely attractive and for some unknown reason, I can't seem to stop lusting after her. I've found myself being worried and disgusted by this. Before anyone jumps to conclusions I would like to say from all indications she's very competent; that is not in question, and I believe that is why my father hired her.

I would never be the guy who sexaully harrasses his father's female employees.

I have gone out of my way to make sure I never let her catch the slightest whiff of this. I make extra sure to be nothing but polite and slightly aloof. Whenever I'm there to pick up any groceries, I only smile, greet, wait to pick up my package, thank her and leave.

653,"Hey reddit. Before I begin, I just wanna say that I've never used r/AskReddit before, so I'm looking forward and am welcome to any advice I can get.

So, to start out, I'm a 19 year old guy living and working in Maryland. I work at a medium-to-high end privately owned retail company with nearly 400 locations across the United States. I've been working at this store since October 2019, so I'd say I've gained a good bit of knowledge and experience since I began. 

I applied for the job because I liked the idea of dressing up for work (suit and tie) without having to sit in an office cubicle all day, and because I love formalwear fashion and looking like a million bucks.

When I started the job, I loved what I was doing. Fitting dudes in great quality suits really seemed to work for me. That is, of course, until the virus swept through. I was forced to leave work at the end of March.

When I began, the store had over a dozen employees, which was plenty for us. We are a low volume location, with a square footage of about 4,000 feet. 

When I returned to my job in mid-July, the staff totaled 4 people, including me. The guys I worked with were my closest friends since graduating high school. After a couple monthe of being back, two of these other employees moved on to other jobs, and we were left with just me and my boss. We managed on our own for a few weeks and managed to hire on 2 more people.

Now back at 4 people, the two newhires are completely new to the company, but due to their ages (both older than me) and their total years in the workforce, they were immediately promoted to assistant managment positions. This is the current situation.

Now, to go over the things that make me want to quit:

1. The Pay: I earn $12.50 an hour. This is nice considering that Maryland's minimum wage is $11.00 per hour, but I know for a fact that there are places I can work that offer more, and are just as simple if not easier jobs. It should also be noted that salesmen no longer earn commission on sales, as this was redacted to save the company some money. We filed Chapter 11 back in June.

2. The Hours: Due to our situation of being understaffed, I find myself working more hours than before COVID. While I appreciate having more hours and getting paid more, the hours which I work allow for little to no time for my social life. The average day starts by waking up at 7:30, leaving home at 8:30, and clocking into work at 9 a.m. I then work a 12 hour shift and clock out at 9 p.m., but find myself so exhausted from being on my feet all day that I dont want to do much other than eat dinner, watch an episode of NCIS, and go to sleep at 11 p.m. The only day that is differemt is Sunday, where we close up at 5 p.m. instead of 9.

3. The Managment: While I appreciate the raise from $11.00 to $12.50, I feel like my expertise could be better used in a different aspect. In this company, it is not uncommon to rise through the food chain rapidly; my current boss was only here for 5 months before becoming an Assistant Manager. I have been here for 14 months (11, if you dont count quarantine) and have only recieved the $1.50 raise. Again, not complaining. However, I've noticed that the new Assistants we have like to clock out a few hours early at random, qhich is FAR from okay. I would report this to my Senior Manager, if he didnt also clock out early. I am the only person at the store who works their full scheduled shift, amd have only left early twice in extreme cases (illness amd family emergency)

4. Corporate doesn't care: While we have voiced our complaints for months on end, corporate seems to have fallen deaf. When we inquire about hiring programs and recruiting for our store, we are shrugged off. When we ask for new supplies, we are told to contact a store that has surplus, and are required to travel 70+ miles to the closest store to pick up said supplies. When our hours get extended or we pick up longer shifts, we explain that we are being worn thin, yet corporate ignores us. Our biggest complaint is that we open at 10 and close at 9, while the mall we occupy only opens at 12 and closes at 8. We get absolutely zero business in the mornings and evenings. This is only worsened by thw fact that anyone who worked in our corporste offices before lockdown are all still at home, and only rarely contact us from the comforts of their home through Zoom.

5. The customers: While we have signs everywhere asking cuatomers to mask up, keep in mind that this is Maryland, one of the american epicenters of what I like to call ""yee-yee country"" filled to the brim with anti-mask individuals who ridicule us for having to wear masks on our company property. Multiple times a day, we are required to still work with these customers, wether they wear masks or not. It creates an unsafe environment that I, personally am not comfortable working in.

In conclusion (starting to sound like a high school essay here) I feel like if I dont quit, I'm going to drive myself insane. This job is draining me of my social life and my family. I talk to very few people other than my co-workers, my relationship with my girlfriend is becoming less romantic and we are seeing less of each other, and the stress of working no stop hours is starting to pile up. My anxiety and lack of patience is starting to toll heavily on me and I feel like I'm going to lose my cool one of these days. The only thing keeping me around is the reasonable hourly rate, and the fact that if I leave, the store will assuredly fall on really hard times. The newhires still have no idea what they're doing, even though we've been training them for over 6 weeks now.

I don't love working here anymore. When I wake up each day, I dread the 12 hour shift ahead. Its started to become a place of stress instead of a place of fun, honest work. I'm starting to lose respect for my coworkers and what little corporate presence we have.

Am I overreacting here, or are my feelings justified? I want to do whats best for the store amd try to stick it out, but at the same time, i dont know how much longer I can go on like this. If anyone has any advice or comments, please feel free to leave your thoughts below. Thank you guys so much. Any response is appreciated.",10Dec2020,1

656,"I feel like my mother is trying to bully me to get the reaction she wants. Long story short, my mother has a mental illness that made my childhood really hard. She somehow came up with the idea that I was the main issue for all her problems and would love bomb me when I would realize I’m not, but still convince me I was. (Hard to explain) anyway, I went no contact with her over 3 years ago because she did an attempt on her life and told my father that I called her and argued with her and pretty much told her to hurt herself. I did call her and left her a voicemail checking up on her because I hadn’t heard from her. I later got a message saying what a shitty person I was all because I wouldn’t drive her to the store to buy a cake for my dad's 60th birthday. (Every time I was in a car with her, she would berate me and go over what a piece of shit I am. This was a boundary I established and she didn’t like it). 

Anyway, I moved overseas and went NC. I didn’t block her on fb because I figured if something serious happened in America, I would hear it through her and would know to go home. During that time, she noticed I added my (biological) father on my Facebook. She lost it and sent me messages about not ever calling her husband again, and that I’m money hungry, and a disappointment and that she’s done with me. 

I didn’t respond. 

I got more messages over a period of time about how horrible I am, how she didn’t deserve it. It was always the same pattern: 

1st message: you’re horrible and this is why, and we aren’t family so don’t you ever call your father again. (Stepfather who I refer to as father) 

2nd: why won’t you talk to me? 

3rd: I was a good mom and I don’t deserve this. 

I never responded. I read it but wouldn’t talk to her. I’d talk to my step father telling him to talk to her and get her to stop because this is driving me further away. 

I got pregnant and returned to America with my husband. I told my step father that if she wanted to be in this baby’s life, she’ll apologize. He said she had nothing to apologize and gas lighted me that I actually was bad, I deserved her calling me a c\*not at young ages, her hitting me, telling me that I was meant to be an abortion but it was too expensive at the time, and for throwing rotten meat in my face. I was also the subject for many of her manic episodes which she then never apologized to me. I’m talking: waving guns around, telling me she is going to hurt herself, etc. I didn’t feel safe in a home with my own parents. 

He then decided to ignore me during my pregnancy even though I reached out to him. I almost lost my son in the second trimester and I had three miscarriages before him. I wanted a family ear to comfort me. I didn’t get that when I needed it. My husband was disgusted that my father could ignore me during my high-risk pregnancy because I was too much drama because I wanted an apology and complained about these nasty messages I received. 

Anyway, I had my child in July. I was gaslighted into going into contact again. I showed her a few pictures and then she stopped asking for photos around September and I noticed that my mood approved. My husband told me that going NC would be healthier, and that they gaslighted me and that our goal was to keep our child safe and healthy. He also hated something that my mom would say when she was mad at me that he never wanted our son to hear: you aren’t family anymore. 

These are her last two messages to me sent last night: “ i want to see my grandbaby i just found out youve been sharing pics with (a grand/great aunt) who youve never met. this is not right. Im not asking to be in your life i think that cant be repaired. But i deserve to see him at least in pictures” 

I didn’t respond. The lady is a fb friend, not that it matters, so she sees what’s on my fb. Not me sending her direct messages. 

“ all i want is to see the baby. You are being a bad person. I will be having a talk to the family about this and it might not work out well for you. All i want is to see my grandbaby in pictures.. I dont want a relationship with you nor does (your step father) . We could give the baby all kinds of things. You are hurting him (the baby) in the long run by being spiteful to us”

I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit, but thank you for reading this . So basically I (24|F) have been in school all my life and college was no question . My mom always put pressure on me and my sister to finish up school . Well it took me almost 3 years to just finish my AA degree so I can go into the RN program without worrying about any other classes . After a couple failed attempts trying to get into the RN program I tried to go into different areas in the medical field like MA and LPN but really wasn’t all there because I wanted to be an RN so I would drop out . But this process took about 3 years of going back and forth because I was really hoping into getting into the RN .

Fast forward to January of this year I actually got into the RN program but couldn’t finish because of COVID and not being able to work and pay rent so I had to pick up extra shift which honestly messed up studying and my grades so I had to withdraw . I was so depressed and kinda gave up on wanting to live because I don’t know what else to do if I spent all these years in school . 

Today I actually came back from orientation for LPN to just get this over with in a year and now my fafsa is all mess up . I can’t pay for school out of pocket and I honestly don’t think I’m going to catch a break . I did all the schooling for nothing . I just feel so exhausted about everything in this world . 

I want to just stay in bed and just cry . I’m feeling like so much of a failure right now and don’t have any friends to talk to expect my boyfriend. Haven’t even told anyone I withdrew from nursing except him . I don’t even know how to keep going on in life without having a breakdown and wanting to be alone anymore ..",10Dec2020,1
663,"So basically I met hooked up with a guy and because I am a virgin he starts shitting it in fears of me getting pregnant.

664,"I'm not a parent so, that's a minus on authority, and I have issues myself so, that's a minus on credibility and consistency. But I want to help in my little brother's growth if I could and try my best to be consistent with it. Someone in our house has been pushing his own thought process, political views and opinions, and unhealthy habits to a child, and being the only same sex role model, that has impacted him greatly. And though not all habits and words he had told him are bad, mostly are, and my little brother has admitted it stresses him out. I've spoken with this person about it months ago but he still hasn't changed. And frankly, I would throw him out of the house if I could.

Anyhow, I heard it's usually more impactful if the role model is of the same sex (minus on that as well, and though the article I read pertains to parents and child) and much more if they held similarities (ex. they both really like games, and I prefer reading) so, I'm troubled on how to do this. Nevertheless, I still do want to try avert his attention away from that guy even just enough that he would know how to handle things less violently, less on the tantrums and blaming his surroundings, and more of a lifestyle with a growth mindset.

I want to start on his habits and how to help him think for himself carefully. Since he just follows whatever that guy says and does. I hate seeing lil bro get so agitated because he doesn't know why he even said that something whenever I ask why he thinks like that, or getting into trouble because of his unhealthy addiction with games or patience. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

For starters, I was thinking perhaps putting my phone in a basket at bed time with his own phone so, he wouldn't feel he's the only one following this thing. And maybe setting up an RPG themed time management app that we could both follow. Though admittedly, it betrays my own lifestyle so, I'm worried on whether how long I could pull it off. Therefore, I would like to ask tips about how I could manage that as well, if I may.

But most of all, I'm still stuck on how to make him more cautious about his decisions, managing his temper, being more considerate of others (not that he's not considerate but he does have his moments which is increasing as days go by), and not following opinions and views without proper context and knowledge of all sides.

He's still a kid, has issues, and he hates complicated things that aren't fun for him so, I want to make things as simple and entertaining as possible, and on his level or just one level up. I'd like to see my little brother enjoy being a kid more without always getting into trouble because of his habits and attitude.

However, there are friends whom I connect via those social media and I did enjoy seeing/knowing what they are doing and have conversations on their posts (no contact otherwise). On the other hand, there are just too many of fake influencers (or wannabe), haters, shallow people etc you know the deal (they are all my friends at some point in life). I want keep some friends and lose those but feel if I remove them one by one it’s like declaring ‘I hate you’.

The initial plan was to uninstall the app and until I have learned to not be affected. I am not addicted to those social media but every time I go on them I feel worse about the world and myself.

668,"So obviously I'm going to have to cut a lot of detail but basically I met this guy when I was 14 (he was almost 17 at the time) and my friend pressured me into feeling like I had a crush on him and so I started to be really into him because I was 14 and dumb and after a week at summer camp with him I find out he has a girl friend! I was crushed because I was 14 and stupid and I kept trying to be his friend because I was so invested in him at this point (I really did not have ANY friends even the one who got me to start liking him wasn't really invested in me at all)

So we found out we lived within walking distance of each other and we texted every day and hung out pretty much every day. Mostly without our parents knowing. I lied a lot about where I was going so I could hang out with him and he knew it. I didn't realize at the time how obvious it was but he was definitely ""feeling out"" what boundaries he could push with us and pressured me into a lot of uncomfortable things (sitting on his lap, strip poker, asking suggestive questions) 

Regardless of all this we became inseparable (to the point of concern) best friends. There was a point in my life where my daily routine was wake up, call him and help him with homework until he went to class, do everything I had to do for my day while he is in class, and call him once he's out of class with a brief break for his family dinner but then talk until he went to bed.

Anyways. Once I was 15 his attempts got more obvious starting with taking pictures of me in my bra when we would hang out for photography stuff and then he'd get me to sit on him and I always said I really didn't want to and was really uncomfortable and would say I wanted to stop or go home but he kept convincing me it would be ok

I should mention real quick I've always had really bad anxiety and I have panic attacks frequently

There was one day he was driving me home from somewhere and he stopped in an empty parking lot, told me to get out cuz he had a surprise for me, and raped me against his car

I never knew what to do because he was my best friend and I felt like I was disgusting and broken and didn't deserve better so I just cried and cried and it happened a few more times.

Keep in mind a few things

He had a girlfriend through all of this and he told her that he cheated on her with me and she's still with him (they're engaged right now)

His younger brother is a really good friend of mine who I now work with and am close with and he of course frequently brings up his brother I used to be friends with because he has no idea what went down

(I cut the brother off when I was about to turn 17 I am now 20 and still have intense anxiety from everything that happened)

This is sucky for many reasons, but this job was the first one he’s had where he knew he wanted to build his career in this industry, and that’s exactly what he did. He helped build the business and start new initiatives at it, and we got to a point where he was more associated with the place than the actual owner. He’s truly great at what he does, but due to COVID related statewide restrictions, it looks that he’ll be unemployed by the end of the year or beginning of January. 

I’m gutted; he’s gutted. I’d like to plan some nights to raise spirits for both of us. I’m a doctoral student and do have a steady income, but money is tight (and it’s not like we could go to the movies or bowling alley anyway like we would normally to have a fun time). 

I’ve been running out of steam lately on how to make fun evenings for us before this latest onslaught of bad news arrived, so now I’m feeling a bit deflated and unsure on how to make things FUN, if only for an afternoon. 

We already cook together and watch plenty of tv and movies, so I’d like to avoid that. It’s also plenty too cold to do much of anything outdoors. Board games are fine, but not really our idea of fun (whoops). 

I know I’m just sabotaging myself because certainly there are still fun, low cost things to do even though we can’t safely go into the world. But what on earth are they?

It kind of did but he commented your very prepared. Long story short, I get a morning after pill. Next day, I get a message saying he was in shock of the pregancy test and thought I used him. Also, that I act childish which makes me immature and not sensible according to him. 

I was told I am not organized because my room was a mess and that was a turn off. I'm not the type of person to use anyone or intentionally hurt someone.I slapped him on the back he found that disrespectful which for me I thought was normal. I do it all the time with everyone as a joke. Main question: should I apologise and make amends? Or leave him alone forever? Should I accept those criticisms? Let him go?

i am definitely not interested in having penpals now so as soon as i realized it had to do with the pen pal website, i went over to that website to request for my info to be taken off and then i realized i had actually put MY HOME ADDRESS there on a public website and frankly freaked out. i don't know what was going through my head when i did that, so i quickly sent in the request to remove my stuff. but the thing is, i have since received two more letters from inmates sent to my home address and still haven't heard back from the people who run that site.

684,"Not sure if this is the right thread, but I am very confused and need some advice. 

I moved into an apartment with my boyfriend about 2 months ago now. Everything is going well and we are very happy, but our ashtrays keep disappearing. This all started a few weeks after we first moved in. 

We live on the second floor and sit on our balcony to smoke, so our apartment is at the top, nobody is above us and nobody is below us when we are on the balcony. There is also no neighbouring balconies surrounding us, we are secluded and high up. 

A few weeks after we first moved in we had an ashtray on the table on the balcony, it was pretty full and needed emptying, we had both acknowledged this a couple of hours before going back out later to see it completely gone. We were both convinced the other had moved it and just passed it off because it was too weird to explain. I then put another ashtray out and we just decided to ignore it because we were freaking each other out. 

10 days after I had put the ashtray out, it disappeared. I was home alone so knew my boyfriend couldn’t of moved it and I had been out to smoke only about half an hour before (I was very stressed this day). I couldn’t understand how another one could of disappeared because we are too high up for someone to climb and I would hear if someone was clashing about with a ladder, and why go to all that effort for a gross ashtray? When my boyfriend got home i went outside to look up at our balcony and attempt to climb up but it’s impossible! I rummaged around the area but no ashtray. We ordered a hidden camera but it’s not arriving until January! 

We decided to put an empty coffee jar out instead and use that as an ashtray because both of our sentimental ones had vanished and we didn’t want to spend money on another one. Just now, we go out to smoke together and the coffee jar has vanished! I am baffled and also growing more concerned. This has to be a person, but how? I cant explain it! Does anybody have any rational explanations or advice on where to go from here? 

We also have had somebody very quietly knock on our apartment door at 2am a few times now. It lasts for 5 or so minutes and then we hear them walk down the stairs. My boyfriend has called out before but nobody replies and we are NOT going to open the door to a stranger at 2am.

685,"I've been working under the best manage I've ever had for the last 3 years. They have built me up from an awful place and I feel I owe a lot of my progression to them. 

COVID hit our business somewhat and things have not been managed the best from our directors, in my opinion. There has been a slowly diminishing volume of workforce in our current department, managers that previous would have been very involved in their team have been bombarded with so much work that they don't have time to interact with their team in the same way.

Long story short, in my current position I am comfortable(ish), definitely in a secure job and as I say, under a manager that I ave a good relationship with. I've applied to a different job role in a different department which is more in line with my desired professional path. I'd be quite surprised if I didn't come out with a job offer from the interview.

I was invited to an interview for next Monday and was hoping to keep it on the down-low. That way, if unsuccessful then no one need know and no one gets stressed or worries and if successful then I start a difficult conversation. However, today my manager rearranged a meeting to the same  time and I had to reject in lieu of ""an important meeting"". I was asked if there was anything they should be concerned about and I just told them that it would depend how the meeting went and I would chat after the meeting.

Basically I’m a little bit torn so need advice. I’m unsure whether or not I’m putting too much effort into a friendship, the girl in my class we’ve known each other for about two years. However, ever since the quarantine it’s not felt the same. 

At the start we got on well (was in better headspace since I had girlfriend, generally was more confident) and we clicked as friends but when we came back and I was broken up with I kind of had a little crush (or infatuation/whatever) on her, even though she had a boyfriend. 

Long story short I’m now past that, never mentioned it and kept it to myself; although now I don’t know if it’s me but I’m slowly sensing the friendship scale seems more tipped on me? 

Except for the odd outing with her (and other friends in the group for celebrations etc) we only “hang” in class. 

But the conversations are one of those “only talks about herself” “every new day is a new problem to moan about” “boyfriend this boyfriend that” and fair enough I try to listen but at the same time that just ends up draining me. 

What irks me more is if I try to mention one of my experiences/problems it gets brushed off and not shown much care or attention.

Recently though she was in a low point (issues with boyfriend and was about to break up with him) so I sent her a link to a video of me being a goof when I was a kid to cheer her up.

 Now this is a BIG deal to me, if I share that with you it means I trust you with it. I was bullied in school and ridiculed for it so when I show someone it’s in the assumption that it won’t be made fun of. 

But the next day when I missed my lesson I get sent about 3 stories on Snapchat where it shows the same video on a massive monitor, everyone’s seeing it including classmates and teachers, laughing etc. She’s shown it to them all.

Now I’m sure that my past school experiences are obviously skewing my perception here, but it really stung that something personal to me got shared without asking. What even stings more is that I didn’t make a fuss or anything, laughed it off but on the inside I feel betrayed ngl bro.

I want to tell her about it but with the past few months and the general experiences in convos etc I’ve had with her have had me more on edge around her, putting her on pedestal and  the general vibe I get is more me trying to get liked/impress her than a genuine friendship. 

So I don’t know, cause we also have good days/some memories but at the same time, it seems like I might need to taper off the conversations, questions, and the whole friendship cause I really don’t think it’s worth having a talk about.

Surgery to possibly slightly extend her life would be around $8500+ whatever other treatments are needed after that.

She's a senior pittie. My best buddy. I don't want to be selfish and get surgery and treatments when I have no guarantee what her quality of life will be. I will not have her suffering. The consultations alone have already cost us thousands and we still seem to be missing information.


We want to know: is she in pain? Is the surgery low risk? How will her life be post surgery? What time does she currently have with no treatments? 


We couldn't get a straight answer or even an estimate. We have no idea what to do. We had to put our other pittie down last year around this time--right after my fathers passing. All due to cancer. The holidays are officially a season of shit. Mine &amp; my brothers birthday are coming up and all we can think is how every year we lose another thing we love dearly and our birthdays/major holidays being near are just awful reminders.


How the hell do people cope with this? I've never loved anything as hard as this dog and I don't know what to do. Risk the surgery and possibly keep her around a tiny bit longer?

anyways, this isn’t the first time he cheated (i think this is the 5th time) but i’m still pretty fucking disappointed. the reason why i don’t know what to do even if it’s clear that i should tell my mom is because two times (or more?) my mom confronted him about cheating and asked to separate, he tried to kill himself. the most recent one was last year (mom caught him cheating and said she was gonna leave so he left a note and we had to look for him around the city. we managed to get him back home but my mom can’t leave him. still pretty traumatized from that).

so right now i feel stuck. if i tell my mom, she might confront him and we’ll have to go through the whole ordeal again, or worse. and i feel like it won’t matter because my dad will just end up cheating again. if i don’t tell my mom, i feel like i’ll be lying to her because she deserves to know the truth. i don’t know what to do. any advice is very much appreciated.",10Dec2020,1

My already broken family is crumbling further. My mother is a drug addict, my father overdosed (2018), and my grandfather passed (2019). My grandmother, 62 years old, is my main guardian and she is all I have left. I have a 3 year old brother who is a bit developmentally slow.

My mother was kicked out 3 or 4 days ago due to a physical fight she had with my grandmother and uncle. My mother never paid bills or gave money to my grandmother and treated my brother badly. She stayed in the basement with him and only fed him ramen and never gave him attention. Because my mother was kicked out, my grandmother has to take care of my brother. She's doing an amazing job, but her mental health is declining rapidly. It was already declining before. We had been planning to move with my aunt, but that's out of the question now. 

I can't stand to see my grandmother suffer anymore. It feels like every day for the past 2 months she has cried and said she wants to kill herself and that she can't take it anymore. I don't know what to do. I've been trying to help with my brother, but I have online school all day. I ask my grandmother everyday if there's anything I can do, like laundry or cook or clean, but she always says no. I cook dinner occasionally but that isn't much of a help. She needs help financially but I can't do anything for her in that way. I try not to ask for money or buy anything but that doesn't do much. My uncle lives with us but he doesn't help much either.   


Please help me. I'm so lost. Any advice is helpful, even if it's about taking care of the baby. Please help me.

704,"DISCLAIMER: IM NOT ASKING FOR CERTAIN ADVISE THAT NEEDS SPECIFIC EXPERTISE, I NEED ADVISE TO SEE IF IM OVERREACTING OR IF I SHOULD TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT THIS

This is a different subject than you normally see. This is about a rare sleep disorder that I have called EHS (exploding head syndrome). I need advise because I’m overthinking it, and I’m sort of worried. Most of you probably know what EHS is, but just in case, I’ll explain. 

It’s not as violent as it seems. All it is is loud auditory hallucinations right before you fall asleep, or right before you wake up. This sound is louder than normal, and right in your ear. People who have this normally wake up frightened with intense heart beats, but then realize it wasn’t real and they go back to bed.

I haven’t had an attack in a long time. Until last night. But I’m not really sure it was an attack tho. What happened was i was asleep, but I could think. My subconscious told me I was about to have an attack (weird bc that’s not supposed to happen). In a couple more minutes, I wake up to a loud ringing noise. (I don’t have Tinnitus so that’s not what it was). It was so loud I woke up covering my ears. I decided it was just another attack, but it was so weird that I saw it coming. (Hmmm. Strange...) 30 minutes later, it happens again! But this time I didn’t see it coming. This one was less violent, but nonetheless scared the shit out of me. It ended up happening about 5 times last night. I still got a great amount of sleep, it just baffles me. Should I be this confused? Should I see a doctor or something because as far as I’m concerned, that shouldn’t happen 5 times a night? If any of you have EHS, is this another attack or something else?",10Dec2020,1

708,"Hi, sorry if this isn't the place for this but I wasn't sure and need advice.

So a few months ago my apt door was kicked in by an ex and though I did call the police, I did not file charges/file for reimbursement (I'm not here for advice on this, it is merely background info). I did not want to tell my landlord this as it was embarrassing and a friend was able to come fix it to the point that I can securely lock it again. It looks completely normal except for when the door is open. A piece of the frame is gone where the lock went in (sorry I don't know official lingo I hope you can get the gist of what I'm saying) and my friend stuck a piece of wood in to attach the lock piece back to the rest of the frame. The point is, it's fixed enough to lock and look normal to passersby but not enough that you couldn't tell it was broken if you walked through the door.

Now, as it is nearing freezing temps/winter break and I live in a college town where many tenants go home for extended periods of time, the landlord is having maintenance come around to check for things, like that the heat was left on, change furnace filters, AND check the locks. They will obviously be able to tell mine is broken. 

The problem is not paying for any damages or fines, I was truly just embarrassed and trying to get past everything when it happened. My main question is can I get in trouble for this beyond losing money; as in can she take any kind of legal action against me or evict me? 

As the door is not totally fucked, I am wondering if I should lie and say something else happened but I cannot think of any great excuses as to how it could be broken other than that it was kicked in.. Another question would be could I get in more trouble if she found out I lied?

cool.

My brother’s now ex-boyfriend/fiancé was locked up last night after being pulled over. They found out after he didn’t come back from work and found his picture, but a whole different name. He also told my brother he was 26 but he was 24.

They also found that he had been arrested in the past for some really bad stuff including larceny and fraud. There’s a lot more stuff as well, such as he told my family that he was a veteran, and would always tell these stories about how he did so and so overseas. However, when my Army vet partner and I would come by the house, he never said more than just basic terms and small chat. 

I’ve already advised my brother to make sure no credit cards were opened up in his name, and to make sure everything was as it should be.

Medical school is a LONG road, after four years of undergrad, it’s an additional 5-13 years of full time schooling. 

I recently graduated undergrad and am on the road to med school.

All my friends who went to work straight out of high school, or who completed degrees that fed them directly into the workforce, are much further ahead domestically than me. 
They have spouses, houses, kids, money etc.

My bf broke up with me because he had doubts about the future. He loved me a lot, but I think he got to a point in his life because of his age that he was scared of the future (is she right for me etc.). This is all he explained to me ‘doubts’. We had a good relationship and I recently chatted with his sister, who said that he just said he had doubts. When he broke up he seemed confused and frustrated that he himself can’t figure out his problem. When I texted his mother two weeks after the break up, just to say thank you for the great times and memories.. she answered that “it was sad it didn’t work out between us, but who knows.. no one knows the destiny between to people and who knows maybe we’ll see each other”.
I know to have hope is stupid, but I wonder what she meant by that. If he would have been completely done with me, his mother wouldn’t have texted me something about destiny. We had a good relationship and I’m certain that I was not the problem, but rather his feelings and thoughts.

723,"I can’t talk to my girlfriend about my school accomplishments

Me (19M) and my girlfriend (18F) are both in university. I’m in my second year right now while she’s in her first year. 

School has always been something that I strived to do great in. I’m useless with hands on work so I’ve focused on staying book smart and keeping my grades high. I would say that studying may come easier to me, but I still have to put in a lot of work.

My girlfriend is smart but has a problem with comparing herself to others and bringing herself down. The jump from high school to uni along with online classes has been really stressful for her, and she hasn’t been getting the grades that she expected. As for me, I’ve been doing pretty good. Online has been a struggle, but I’ve managed to make things work. However, I feel like it’s also important to note that she’s in a science program while I’m in business, so to be honest I feel like she has a harder workload to begin with.

My girlfriend is my best friend and the person I want to please the most. Her opinion matters a lot to me and so I want her to feel proud of me. However, whenever I get a test back that I happened to do good on, she dismisses it instead of cheering me on. She’ll say things like “you always do good anyways” or “I knew it” and it never fails to bring me down. It makes me feel like she wants me to do bad to prove some sort of point, and it also undermines the work I put in to do well. To me, my grades are the only thing I can really be proud of. Like I said earlier, I don’t really excel in much else. I can’t work with my hands, I don’t play any sports, and there’s a pretty big difference between being book smart and being street smart too. I play a lot of video games, but that’s not going to get me anywhere.


Today I decided to confront her about this. I had done my last test in one of my courses and got a good grade, so I went to tell her about it. She responded in a similar fashion, so I asked her why she couldn’t just be happy or proud of me instead? I told her that the way she thinks of me matters a lot and that I just wanted some appreciation for my work.

She got upset at me and told me that it just isn’t something she wants to be hearing about right now. She told me that she gets that I get A+’s and that school isn’t as hard for me as I like to think. She’s sure that I’m putting in effort, but it’s not much of an accomplishment because I don’t struggle to keep my grade up. She finished by saying that it makes her feel like shit about her own schoolwork and that I should go to someone else for approval. I dropped it and said I wouldn’t talk about it again

Now I’m feeling torn. I think that what she said is completely valid. If she’s comparing her grades to mine and it’s upsetting her, i can understand why I shouldn’t be talking about it with her. But on the other hand, it makes me sad that she can’t be proud of me. I like to think that if the roles were reversed, I would be doing the same for her. But of course, there’s no way for me to prove that. Am I wrong for wanting her approval? Is she wrong for feeling the way that she is? I want to make it clear that I understand where she’s coming from which is why I dropped it right away, but I just can’t shake the feelings I’m having either. I wanted to make her proud of me in the only way I know how. Perhaps I’m being selfish, and rather than her undermining my work, I’ve been undermining her’s. I guess I’d just like hear some outside thoughts on the situation. Is there anything we should be talking about together?

For some clarity’s sake: we’re both in 4 courses this semester. I’m currently on track to get 2 A+’s and 2 A’s. She should be on track to get 2 A’s, 1 B+ or A, and 1 B or B+. I’m mentioning this because despite how much she’s struggled, she’s still been able to keep her grades up at a very good level for which I’m super proud of her.

730,"I'm planning to create a Facebook account soon, mostly to fulfill the requirement to use my Oculus Quest 2 VR headset (you need an active Facebook account to use it). But I've been wanting to create a Facebook account anyway for a while now. I'm not great at staying in touch with people and have lost contact with a lot of friends and family over the years. 

I've created 2 Facebook accounts in the past. The first I created was in 5th grade, around the time when Farmville was a thing, and I really didn't get into the social features at all. I played Farmville, and when I stopped playing Farmville, I stopped using Facebook. A few years later one of my family members noticed that I misspelled my own name on the account. 

When I moved between states, I came out as gay and didn't bother to tell anyone in my old home state. I have a very Catholic family and went to a catholic school. 

When I started highschool, in the new state I was living in, I decided to create another Facebook account. Intentionally separate from my first, where I could be open about my sexuality. To hide my account from the people who knew me in my home state, I used a different first name. Naming myself cringe-inducingly after a Disney character, but keeping my last name. 

I didn't play any games on this second Facebook account, and attempted to use it for its social features. Honestly it just felt like a chore. 

Since then, I've tried logging in a few times now, and can never really stay committed to it. It's just boring to me. It *is* a chore. 

I'm too self conscious to take photos of myself, I never like how they look. I don't travel, I don't go out, I took 1 semester of community college and was stuck in a job that I hated for 4 years. Currently I'm trying to improve on things. I got a new job, before Covid started I started going to the gym and I plan to go back to school in the fall. I don't want to advertise to everyone that I'm still trying to get my life together. All of my friends are happy, healthy and dating. Facebook feels like a giant mirror reminding me how far behind them I am. I know that's kind of an illusion, the social media effect, but I'd still feel compelled to put myself out there when I'm not really comfortable with doing that right now. 

The last time I logged on was about 5 years ago, and I remember getting bombarded with messages from people asking how I'm doing and what I've been up to since we last spoke. It felt so overwhelming. I want to get back into contact with those people, but I've never felt like I had the energy to do so. 

Now is the time to do that I guess. 

My only contact with family members from my home state was through my grandmother. I'd call her and she'd tell me how everyone was doing. She passed away recently, and with that, I don't have any other way of staying in touch. 

I have no contact with friends from grade to middle school, and what little contact I maintained with my friends in high school is deteriorating. One of my closest friends is moving to Washington soon. 

I want to stay in touch with all of these people and to get back in touch with people I haven't spoken to in years. 

Currently my plan is to create one brand new Facebook account as a nice clean fresh start. I may go back and review my old friends lists, and see who I should add to this new account, and delete my old accounts if possible. 

But I don't know who to friend on there or how to balance the different people that I know. There are some who still don't know I'm gay, and many others who do know. I have family members, friends from gradeschool, high school, and coworkers, and I don't necessarily want those different groups of people merging. I behave differently around all of them, and I'm scared some of them will be judgmental towards the others. Or more likely be judgemental of me based on who I hang out with. I'm very left leaning politically, but I still love my right leaning family members. I don't know how to balance this, I want to preserve my relationships with all of them, but I don't think I'm ready to tell my very Catholic aunts and uncles that I'm gay and have a very loving partner now. 

What should I do? How should I move forward? Any advise would be appreciated.",10Dec2020,1

734,"So, i live in a fairly rich family, we aren't millionares or anything, but we have a lot of extra money for fluff and shit, not trying to brag, it's just a point to keep in mind for added context 
So, i don't have a monthly salary as my dad fears that I'll use the money to binge food, as im already growing pretty fatty, so, when i wan't something that is really expensive i don't save up for it, i just kinda ask awkwardly, which makes me feel like a spoiled brat sometimes, but there is a limit, i limit myself from asking for more then 1 really expensive (200-500 dollar expensive) cuz it doesn't make me feel well and i doubt my dad would like if i asked for a vr headset or the new ps5 together in a 2 month gap ._.
Here's the problem, it's a minor problem, kinda frustrating, which is why i made this post, but it is the price u have to pay if u wan't free shit:
I turn on whatsapp instead of irl cuz im a fucking wimp
I text my dad
Hey dad
Can u please buy this? I will do anything u want for it
And u don't have to say yes by any means, its ur choice
Then he agrees
Then
I wait
A week
A few weeks
A month
._.
So, basicly the problem is that i have to approach him multiple times a month till he finally feels like it cuz...idk he never tells me when i can buy it i just wait and one day he goes ""okie son order off credit card now"" and im like :D
But before that im like ._.
The problem is he doesn't say no or anything, so, he kinda drags me on this loop of waiting for the all clear to but it ._.
So....um
Idk take this post as u will

739,"Sorry, Idk what subreddit to put this under. Plz tell me if there's a better place, thanks.

My best friend's baby mama is at in-patient treatment, again. She is addicted to many drugs and alcohol. But here's the thing: she's been to rehab a million times. My friend jokes that she ""could teach it at this point"". It's so clear that she goes in, knows exactly what to say/how to act to get released ... but once she's out, she immediately just goes and looks for drugs &amp; alcohol. She will drink / use drugs til she's nearly dead again. 

At what point will someone, anyone, say ""hey this isn't working"" or ""the state is no longer gonna pay for her ""vacations"" to rehab"" (I say vacations because she's homeless---&gt; because she refuses to hold a job of any kind, so she enjoys getting sent to rehab because she gets a free room &amp; meals, I'm assuming it's paid for by other people's tax dollars because she is penniless ---&gt; except when she buys drugs/booze, she can always find money for that somehow). 

Or will they never say that? They'll just keep admitting her to exspensive in-patient facilities, let her ""go thru the motions"", and then release her again? Knowing full well she will go do all kind of illegal things (steal, property damage, just random hood-rat shit) on top of nearly die from drug overdose again? How many more times can she be caught shoplifting, and cry to a judge ""I'm addicted to drugs/ I need help"" before someone finally says ""no, you dont get a free pass out of this by going to treatment, yet again?"" Or will that day never come?

We live in Minnesota if that makes a difference. She also still hasn't lost custody of her kid, depiste the fact that the kid lives 100% with the father, and she has literally ""ran away"" with her kid before... upon finding the kid, it was clealry malnourished &amp; covered in bruises &amp; cuts. The father is not on drugs and has a job &amp; an apartment. Multiple judges in court still award them 50/50 joint custody. Like holy crap, when will this woman finally get what she deserves?! Or will she get free passes for life? Can anyone explain why courts/judges allow this nonesense?",10Dec2020,1
740," So I (16F) have been friends with my best friend (16F) for just over a year. Lately, I've been getting increasingly jealous of her but I want to stop. Her family are all kind and caring to her and always have been, my family is always saying shit to me and are borderline abusive and have been like that since I was young. She has multiple other really good friends that she's been friends with for years, I have nobody other than her. She's almost always texting them when we're together. She just got the iPhone 12, I have an iPhone 6 that is barely working (I don't really care about this one but she's been showing the phone off and putting me down for it so it hurts more). When she shows me her childhood pictures I still somehow feel jealous because my parents barely took any pictures of me when I was young and the few that we had they lost. She gets lots of free time as she only has 2 older siblings and just sits in her room watching movies whereas I'm constantly having to look after my 4 younger siblings and help my family, she also constantly tries to get me to watch some movies and gets pissed when I don't watch them because I don't have time.

The past few months have been extremely busy at work for me, and I had to cancel 2 of our planned catch up chats.

Same with my brother, he was not contact traced from my class mate but they think he has it because he came in contact with me. ( I know you can contact trace contact trace. ) today I was talking to my mom from a safe distance and I told her that if I test negative that I can go back to school on Monday. She got mad at me and told me that she wants me and my brother to finish out this 9 weeks of school ( we only have a week left ) and then talk about going distance learning for the rest of the school year.

We have a guest house I can live in if that’s the problem but me going distance is not a good idea, my grades will drop and so will my mental health.

So, there's this old friend whom I haven't talked to in about six or seven years; we were in the same class (a fourth- and fifth-grade combo class), but she was a year older than me. We were very good friends, and it was clear at a point that we had feelings for each other, though nothing ever happened. We eventually ended things off not too well, and that's evidently the reason why she broke off contact with me.

However, I am moving away out of state in a few months from now (after living here twelve years), and I strongly feel as though I should seek closure with the person before I leave, if just to finally ease my mind. There's a chance that she's forgotten about what happened between us or has long since gotten over it, or perhaps has still remembered to this day and might still be bitter.

751,"To start, sorry if the formatting is bad. I'm on mobile. 
I have a complicated interpersonal conflict- sort of- in my life. It's been going on for 6 1/2 years, if I had to make an educated guess. For background, my partner and I started dating around 2011 and were on and off for a while. We were 12 when our relationship started, so you can't exactly expect either of us to have handled the relationship maturely. Both of us came from a rough situation and not to get into too much detail, I was in and out of treatment for my mental illness a lot, which was the major reason I would break it off every time. On one of these 'off' periods, when we were 16, my now fiancee started dating a girl (19 at the time I think) who now, 6 years later, still very obviously resents me because my partner broke up with her, and since then we've been together. I'm not someone who deals with confrontation well, and I never have been. She's called me horrible things over the years, spread rumors about me, has wrote some pretty nasty stuff about me online (in recent MONTHS) and now started working at a store down the street from my house recently. I didn't even know she existed when they started dating, and I've never felt hateful towards her. It feels like I couldn't escape her, she just kept popping up, trying to message my fiancee when they made it VERY clear they weren't interested, and honestly, I could feel the negative energy radiating off her whenever I saw her. Of course it's uncomfortable for me to see someone who actively tried to hurt me for years. I tried to talk with her recently (over text), to close this chapter behind me, and hopefully both move on our separate ways with less hard feelings. The problem is, well, she was really just... mean the whole time. She had insisted she changed and is a better person, but would also turn around and say things like 'you need to grow up and act like and adult, and let this go.' and 'I don't care about seeing either of you around, so if it makes you uncomfortable to see me, it's flattering that you think of me so much.' on and on, not really reading what I was saying to her, trying to make me feel lesser, or bad for having feelings about this. Off handed remarks like that over and over, claiming she won't waste time apologizing to me because she's a 'different person now'. And that she tried to ‘befriend' me and apologize back then, so it's my problem that I didn't accept it. It was pretty obvious to me at the time that she only tried to talk to me to get to my partner, as after I shut down that interaction (as politely as I could, might I add.) she messaged my partner about what a cunt I am, and how she hates me, and I'm scum. It's pretty clear she didn't mean it when she said sorry. Thinking that interaction counts as an apology sounds so backwards to me. She... later in our conversation admitted that she dislikes me because she still has feelings for my partner, and my partner 'chose' me over her. That idea is so ridiculous to me, like it was some sort of competition or something to her. She hasn't changed in my eyes. Really, I don't know how she doesn't see the blatant contradiction. I tried really hard to be pleasant, and I really was hoping to resolve this. I have an anxiety disorder, so it's not like I can just forget about stuff like this, especially when someone has been so outright cruel to me. Unfortunately for me, my memory is what people around me have called a 'steel trap' lmao. I remember most major interactions I've had with anyone in the past 10 years with fair clarity, and I can still feel what I felt in that moment when I think about it. On bad days it's really hard for me to leave the house even, so seeing her at a store I frequent obviously is unpleasant. It's given me some sense of closure- My suspicions were correct, and I don't have hard feelings for someone who is jealous or insecure. I just don't know how to make my intrusive thoughts on this matter pipe down. I thought maybe if I faced the problem head on, I could be relieved of some of it. I'm older now, and honestly, my partner and I are getting married soon. I don't think she knows we're engaged (we keep our social media accounts on private.) I really hoped she would've let it go, but it's clear she hasn't, no matter how many times she claimed to not care. Otherwise... why say she still has feelings for my partner? It's easy to confer that she still holds animosity towards me. Where do I go from here? My partner has no desire to speak to or see her, so it wouldn't be fair to ask them to get involved, though I thought that maybe if they spoke with her and told her their true feelings on the matter, she might finally let go and leave us alone.

The details are: I have a medium-ish back garden with tall gates backing onto an alleyway wide enough to drive up and down. The gates are multiply locked. For the last few weeks I have been noticing things. Cigarette butts all piled up together, far too close and precise to be thrown into the garden, but placed there purposefully. The bottom of a broken bottle of Budweiser, but no other glass. Just the bottom, again looking like it was deliberately placed there. And nobody in my house drinks Bud. A potato. Yes. A potato outside my back door. We have a caravan outside and we found a pair of socks in there (I wanna say they were a brand like Gucci or something) hidden under a blanket. Sometimes at night we have been sat in there and heard tapping on the windows and walls, moving around every side. Twice now I have left the house with the door locked and come back to find it unlocked. And once, knowing I had left it unlocked, I came to find it locked, and nobody in the house had done it (unless they were lying for some reason). Things go missing, never to be found again. Plug socket switches are often off when we don’t turn them off. I’m sure there are more little things but I can’t think.

 Will my step-daughter be able to receive my benefits once I pass? Or do I need to go a step farther and legally adopt her as my child for that to happen?

760," Nothing makes you look inwardly like a pandemic--I have goals that I want to achieve such as working out before work, being better with cleaning my living space, meal prepping, and getting at least 7.5 hours of sleep a night.

I am 26, live with my significant other, and I work at a law firm full time as a paralegal. The goals I have for myself are:

To start waking up at 6 am to be able to workout and be at work by 8:30.

To cook everything I eat and decrease the amount of processed foods in my diet.

To commit to my hobbies such as reading, practicing piano, knitting, etc.

To save money and pay off my outstanding debt.

However, everytime I think of incorporating all of these goals into my daily life and changing my lifestyle, I feel overwhelmed and mainly feel that once I begin to do these things, life is going to become insanely BORING.

My hobbies don't require any social interaction, I'll be working out at home, I'll be eating at home, and I'll be saving money which means I'll have to stay home to keep from spending it.

The idea of being the person who gets ready for bed at 9:30 pm and rises at 6 am just to workout, work, cook from 6-7, eat, clean, have some me time for an hour/an hour and a half 5 days a week just completely puts me off from wanting to try to attain these things. I love staying up on weeknights until 11:30/12 to wake up at 7:45 and quickly get dressed and go to work because it gives me that semblance of my pre-full-time job life where i had no routine, was in school, worked part time jobs and subsequently was able to do whatever I wanted.

But I need to be healthier both physically and mentally. I just have this idea I can't get out of my head that this new lifestyle will make me feel miserable and boring bc It'll be the same monotonous day over and over until the weekend comes. But that's what routine IS.

I need a new way to look at it so I can be disciplined and also be HAPPY.

Any advice?",10Dec2020,1

762,"Hi, I’ve been thinking a lot and I need some help here. I’ve been remembering some weird things that happened in my childhood and I remember a 16 year old that was really close to my family would kiss me (with tongue) even though I was only 6-8. If that wasn’t enough, he frequently invited me to sit on his lap or in between his legs. I didn’t even realize what was going on or that that’s not what normal people do.  More could have happened, but when I think about it, it’s just too fuzzy or unclear for me to accuse him of it. I don’t know how much feedback I’ll get here under “legal advice,” but I’m honestly at such a loss on what to call this. I know it can’t be okay for 16 year olds to do that, so is there any legal charges that could have been pressed had I been able to share it at that time? What would I even call that experience? It’s been 10 years and I only recently opened up about it to my mom. I know I can’t do anything about it anymore regardless, but I think I just need some closure or clarity- something.",10Dec2020,1

In February of this year, I applied to be a moderator in a community with 4-5k daily active members, 25k monthly. For those familiar: it's a community on Amino. My role was to help the lead staff and nothing more.

In August, I was asked if I would like to become one of the three head staff, as one was stepping down. I didn't really have a choice, so I accepted. In October the promotion happened and I was granted all the tools I needed, such as banning members, etc.

What happened next is: my two co-leaders pretty much vanished. Other, smaller mods stepped down. the TLDR here is that I've been doing 90% of the work for over a month, and it's getting worse. my co-leaders won't respond to Discord messages and, as I am, I have no idea how to lead my community without help, as I haven't even been modding for a year. 

My mental health is frail and I would be lying if I said I never thought about deleting it all and disappearing. I'm more responsible than that, but I genuinely don't know how to get across that the work stopped paying for itself when everything started falling on me. It's more than just deleting posts and banning folks, we run events, challenges, and cultivate a front page, among other things. well, by we I mean, ""me"", who was happy to help but ended up having the whole thing dumped on me. 

my friend says to prioritize myself, university, and my growing graduation, but I know I can't step away, let alone suddenly, when the place couldn't function without me. I'm at a total loss.

766,"I love my boyfriend very much but quarantine has taken a serious toll in our relationship. Honestly, sometimes I don't really feel loved anymore.

A few quick facts about my situation:

\- This is my second relationship ever. I was married before to an abusive husband. I understand it can be hard for me to see red flags sometimes.  
\- My bf has been married before and has a lot more experience than me when it comes to dating  
\- When we started dating, he treated me like a princess. I felt like the most special woman in the world.  
\- My bf and I have been dating for almost two years and up until quarantine started, he was the most attentive and sweetest bf ever.

When quarantine started, my bf and I were living together abroad and we decided to come home. This was proven to be a bit problematic because we left a lot of friends behind and have no one here besides some old friend. We can't meet anyone because of covid. We are staying at my parents empty second house, which is nice, but rough because I feel lonely.

My bf spends all his available time playing video games. Neither of us are working. He will go hours without talking to me. I am the one who does most of the cleaning, cooking and talking. I feel very neglected and while I shower him with love, affection, relaxing body and face massages, I get nothing. He likes to walk to the shop alone because he enjoys the exercise. I have explained on several occasions how lonely I feel and I do not feel he wants to interact with me. Quite frankly, I feel that he knows I will always be there for him like a puppy dog. He says he feels that way about me (?). His tone has changed a lot since quarantine started too. He is quite cold and dismissive now. I pointed that out many times but he says he does not really see what I mean.

He says he is struggling too, which is true. He says he has a hard time relating to me because I have nothing to do. This is partially true, I feel so very bored at this point. I have gone through my reading, phase, video game phase, exercise phase, self care phase, cooking phase, baking phase, binging everything on netflix phase and now I am quite lonely. I cannot really meet with any of my friends here because covid is quite bad.

A few months ago, I found out he was on Tinder. He talked to a few girls, nothing really beyond, ""Hi, how are you?"" but it felt like a punch in the gut. Then I found some pretty sexual texts between him and a friend. He explained it was just fun and games and they never meant it as sexual. It was just something they have been doing for way longer than we have been dating.

When we have a fight or we are both in a sour mood, I am the one who has to bring it up so we can make up. We have broken up a few times during quarantine, always coming back together almost immediately. However, I feel like I am the one who has to initiate conversations so we can try to resolve issues. He will do no such thing. I hate the feeling that he will not fight for our relationship. I have brought this up too. He said he would change, but nothing has.

I feel like I am in a one sided relationship. I hate the feeling that I lost the most amazing boyfriend I had before quarantine. I hate feeling that I have to maybe play ""hard to get"" to reignite his interest in me. I am getting over the fact that my very adult \[39M\] boyfriend is acting like an uninterested boytoy.

I am hoping things will go back to normal after quarantine, but I also do not want to waste my time. Am I overreacting and things will go back to normal after quarantine is over or is he not treating me nicely?

Thanks guys!

I’ve been recommended to speak to someone about what really interests me but I’m a very private guy so I don’t like looking to people for help.

He didn’t spend his money wisely until I told him a while after we first met that he shouldn’t buy everything he sees because he has a credit card).

I can get this jewelry from him and pay, say, $50,000, or I can buy it from a place like Blue Nile and pay $30,000. Do I bite the bullet and pay an extra $20k unnecessarily just because we're friends and I have the ability to do so? Or is $20k so significant that there's no effing way I should pay him that much?

Playing basketball has always been a passion of mine and has always managed to come back even after periods of disinterest.

i like how he actually invites me to go places to get drinks or snacks and stuff, and i always apreciate it, he volunteers to go with me, stuff like that, and we chat in class. he offers to buy me stuff during lunch, makes it clear that he was just kidding when he ribs me. i rly apreciate this of him.

I feel worthless, inconsequential and disgusted. I wanted to throw up all day.

**What happened?**

Yesterday I learned that a girl I had a relationship with a few years ago had been using me and was making fun of me behind my back. This is not something that surprised me, but I did not know what had continued long after we break. When we were together she used to be aggressive with me and make hurtful jokes at my expense plus she always acted different when we were alone or with her friends.

Her ex-boyfriend before me published a series of conversations from when she and I were together in which she wrote him how disgusting and disposable I was for her. I fully understand that my feelings were not reciprocal, but I don't understand the contempt.

**A bit of background**

We met when we were 16 years old. Her ex-boyfriend at the time was about 21 years old. When they met she was 14 years old, and he groomed her for two years. She once told me that he tried to rape her, and yet she kept having feelings for him and seeing him.

We were together for half a year. Some time has passed since we break but I keep thinking about that and that sh\*t keeps affecting me in my new relationships. I would like to know if she was intentionally using me or was just equally confused.

**What I feel?**

First I think i don't deserve to fell bad about myself because she obviously had been through worse things.

I want to talk to someone, but I don't understand why or what for. I don't have any friends and I'm too disconnected of my family that I don't know if they will care or understand.

Yesterday I felt vitalized and wanted to exercise, I had a terrible need to be hit in the center of the stomach and put pressure on my chest. Today I tried to exercise and I feel like I couldn't breathe. Today I didn't want to eat, I just wanted to vomit.

I hope to feel better in a few days but I don't know how. Maybe time will help me forget but I don't know I want that or if I will continue to recall this memory over and over. I would like to see a therapist to find health, but I have no money and I don't know how his diagnosis will affect me. I don't know what emotions I am feeling or if what I think I want is distorted by my emotion.

Till what I know she had driven her life to the hedonism and doesn't care abut people opinion of her actions, but she keeps talking about mental health and healthy relationships. I fell angry every time she talks about that, like someone who is in the position to judge other people or if she ever cares about the hurt she makes.

I just need another mind to think about this because mine is too immerse in it and I can't trust in my ideas.

growing up I had the worst relationship with my mom. I’ve never really opened up to her because  everything I have said just gets used against me. 

Here’s the thing, she always lies. I mean always! on everything. So everything she tells me i take with a grain of salt or simply assume she’s lying. I would even say she goes as far gaslighting every once in a while. Since forever she always likes it when others pity her. Constantly victimizing herself and making other feel like shit. A drama queen at times. I’ve asked her to stop for years and she just won’t. 

For the past 5 years she’d always say “I can’t wait til you move out” or “go live with your dad”. Until she moved on to retirement and a few months in all the sudden she needs me and can’t stand living by herself because it’s too lonely. She’s 55. 

I don’t think she can sleep anymore and she’s been acting extremely weak. Limping everywhere and saying she tired. My dad told me it’s lethargy and she’s sick but won’t go into it. Everytime she brings up her being sick and not having much time left. I walk away because I feel like this is an act but i know if isn’t and something does happen I’d kill myself. I can’t even have a conversation with her without crying anymore so i’ve been pushing her away. And I don’t want to actually have a conversation about it with her because I can’t handle anymore lies not to mention she has lied about her health in the past.

I try to distance myself from their problems as much as I can but I always get horrible anxiety towards Christmas period. I literally fear visiting them, I have so much trauma from all these fights and her saying the worst things to my dad and I.

My sister even thinks that I am selfish for not understanding our mum and for ruining Christmas for everyone. Thing is, I don't know how to ""accept"" such behavour which has caused me so much of my mental health issues.

813,"22F. Avid fiction reader (WILL NOT put a book down until I am done reading). Master procrastinator. 

I began med school in 2017. The initial months were kinda messed up but I got a hold of it. Then came Year 2 and I was the biggest mess ever. I procrastinated everything I had to study and scored lesser on my exams than I usually do and my dad was a little disappointed cause throughout school I always scored 90% and above. I basically had no motivation to do anything, not even read my beloved unread books. I just binge-watched movies and series. Then I went to Year 3 and tried very hard to turn my habits around. Failed. But I managed 85% on my exams somehow. I don't care about marks btw but they are important for my future internship so I have to get good scores. 

Then I started clinical rotations in Feb 2020. I was really pumped and excited for this. Started out great for 4 weeks and then the pandemic hit and my country went into lockdown. For a month, I did nothing. I created an Instagram account (had one earlier, and deleted it in 2017 cause it felt useless), and watched so many series I cannot even remember. Had no motivation to read any books. Then online uni began and for a week I listened, made notes then I went off track. I would start doing other things, everything except listen. I did not even reattempt to listen. I did not even study by myself everything I was missing. I also stopped watching all the stuff I was watching. And since then, all I have done is list down everything I wanted to study and do but I have done nothing. Idk what is happening to me. 

In September, clinical rotations restarted and we had lesser online uni and I was really happy about that. In October, I tried to fix my daily schedule and began planning what I would do for the next 2 hrs instead of planning for the whole day. Did that fairly well for a month then went back to procrastinating. 

Now it is December. On the 1st of Dec, I listed out a few things I wanted to achieve in the next one month such as - read at least 5 books, study 3 at least new topics every day, workout, decrease Instagram usage, etc. It has been 10 days and I have done nothing. I mean NOTHING. Studying a new topic is taking me ages when it shouldn't (usually takes me 3 hrs). I have finals in Jan 2021 and I am really panicking right now because I have loads to study. I never leave anything to study right before the exam because I generally get very nervous before exams, and almost every night before exam, I end up crying, sweating, trembling, my heart races and I feel so scared even if I have prepared for them quite well. I don't dream big, my only big dream ever has been to become a medical doctor, and when I manage to get down to doing something, I do it passionately. But I don't have any motivation right now, I just keep procrastinating. I cannot keep on going like this, feeling every single minute that I have made a mess out of my life. I feel SO helpless. And I need advice. Serious advice. Thank you and sorry for it being so long. 

PS I am going to permanently delete my Instagram right now, I keep all contacts on WhatsApp anyway. Also, I don't think I have lost my love for books, my happiest moment this whole trash year was when I impulsively bought a book at the mall on Tuesday. Been stuck at home from Mar to Aug, I finally went to the mall after so long.",10Dec2020,1

To every reader, thank you in advance for putting up with my s\*\*t.

I am 22M. 159 IQ, Born to rich family, very good looking. Patethic in a sence, no strenght of will whatsoever, my personality is as interesting as terms of use that no1 is reading.  
I have no support from my family. They are homofobic, rasists, xenophobic, bigots, thieves, and due to the fact that i am not same, they attack me emotionaly every day. Endless disapproval of me, of how i think, what i do, how i behave, all i do is wrong, how i think is wrong, i am wrong generally and with that i put up qietly since i was 15.  
When i was 14, i fell in love with certain lady. And since that day i started to believe in that ""Love on first sight, THE ONE"" crap. Becouse it happened to me. Since our first meeting, we saw each other maybe 6 times, as she lives far away, and every time i saw her my feelings grew. Finally last year i gathered whatever willpower i had and wrote her msg about how i feel. First of all, she already has boyfriend, and it felt wrong, but i did it anyway. And i got answer. Exactly what i suspected. She wrote it kindly, but still for me it is unbearable. And even though my one half is happy for her happiness and would bleed for her, the other half suffers quietly. Now i know a lot of people would say move on, find some1 else. But i can't. And sometimes i even wanted to forget, but love never went away. And after a while i realized that if i could have moved one, it wouldn't be love but something despicable and animalistic.  
Lately i am questioning everything, i doubt almost everything i do or say, my confidence is non existing and i spent last 10 month closed in my room playing video games. I have no idea why should i do anything. What is purpose of my life if i am gonna die in 60 years or so and the only person i dreamt of spending that time with won't be part of it?

We got back together but he insisted that we had to kiss (we're in high school btw). I told him I was okay with that, once I felt comfortable doing so. The first time we hung out after getting back together, he tried to kiss me and got mad when I refused. The time after that we were with his friends, and he asked them to leave for a minute. He leaned in and I pulled away, and then he pushed his lips onto mine anyway. I had forgotten about this until I was describing our first kiss. I realized that he forced his lips onto mine and he kept describing it as a 'movie moment' but honestly now i feel horrified that he blatantly disobeyed my boundaries like that.

I was terrified to hang out with him or kiss him for the next almost month, but eventually I warmed up to it. I would've kissed him eventually, but I feel so cheated that he couldn't wait until I was comfortable.

i feel like i'm going to throw up because he texted me and asked why I was telling people this and said: I would appreciate if you could stop picking our relationship apart into the bad, it was an overall good relationship. I wish the best for you, thanks.

Partner has ocd (diagnosed several years ago, still on meds and goes to therapy). At the beginning of our relationship (abt 1 year ago) I would consider myself mentally healthy but as we’ve grown closer I’ve realized some striking similarities between what he describes as traits of mental illness and things I do and have always thought of as normal. Some examples
1. Before him I didn’t know that ocd could be pure obsession over something for days on end. This happens to me all the time. I’ve obsessed over whether I was pregnant (when we weren’t even sexually active yet and the test was neg), whether I have free will, and one really awful spiral I now recognize has traits of pocd. This is just to name a few
2. I get these sharp, disturbing thoughts out of nowhere . Doesn’t happen all the time and usually relates to a certain subject matter I don’t want to mention but it definitley bothers me
3. I think really, really strange things and don’t know how to recognize that they’re probably irrational. For example a friend asked for my address today (most likely for a surprise Xmas thing) but I couldn’t get out of my head that they had realized something about me I hadn’t realized about myself and were sending authorities after me. Rationally, I was able to get out of that before it spiraled but it was hard.
4. While I on some level realize these are probably related to some form of ocd, even on a mild level, I keep obsessing that I’m making the whole thing up and blowing it out of proportion. This is what has stopped me from bringing it up with my partner: fear that I’ve got it all wrong and he’ll think I’m trying to leech of his identity or something.

834,"Hey all, I'm currently an undergraduate in college and have been feeling extra depressed this semester :(. I moved in with some friends on campus, but honestly the experience has been nothing like I imagined. They're pretty outgoing, and are always on calls/hanging out with others and it's made me feel quite lonely. I do believe that internally, just as an introvert, I don't require as much social interaction typically. But living with them has made me feel like I'm not talking to enough people, and has really hightened my feelings of loneliness and depression. I'm not sure if this is just because I feel like I should be socializing more but don't know who to reach out to (comparing myself to my roommates), or if I really do need to socialize more. I know this post was kind of all over the place, but really had to get this off my chest as I feel it's been giving me a bit of anxiety as well. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",10Dec2020,1

838,"Hello, I have a yapper. She's literally the yappiest dog I've ever met. I have few pet peeves in life but a yappy dog is probably top of the list. I feel like we're ""those"" neighbors. I feel like I can feel my dog's frustration when she's barking incessantly. And for obvious reasons, it's just annoying. I don't feel like my wife is remotely on board with how annoying and frustrating it is. Like obviously it bugs her from time to time, but she says she grew up with yappy dogs and it's fine. I grew up with poorly behaved dogs and that's exactly why it's not fine to me. My wife is incredibly sensitive to our dogs needs and is also very sensitive about certain things in the environment. Whereas I'm, well, not. Her sensitivities make it difficult to find a meaningful solution. Right now we've put up a baby gate blocking off one window room which has helped, but she still sees through two others and barks all day and when she sees someone she rushes downstairs through the dog door then barks at them through the fence. She's a 65 lb hound dog so not only is it loud and obnoxious, it's a little scary I'm sure for passers-by. During busier times I'll just shut the dog door, but then she just barks from inside the house. Here are some of the things we've tried or thought of trying and why it won't work.

&amp;#x200B;

Shock Collar - She's terrified of it and it's obviously kind of cruel

Citronella Collar - We use this often, but my wife takes it off every time I put it on or every time she stops barking. Apparently the dog behaviorist said we shouldn't leave it on too long, and my wife thinks it only works as a training device when used after she barks, then we take it off and put it back on when she barks again. It's a terrble system.

Window film to block the windows - It's an Aesthetic issue, we want to see out our windows and covering up just the lower part that the dogs see-through looks bad.

Walks - They help but only so much. Admittedly this is something we could be much better about although they do have a large yard to play in.

Loud noise/yelling - This only works for a short time to distract her or make her feel bad, I don't like yelling as a fear-based tactic although I resort to it when I have no other option.

Rewarding her for being quiet - Honestly we've barely tried it, but with poor results. I don't even understand how this training method is executed. She's quiet 95% of the day. Do I just constantly reward her? Maybe if I found the right method I could get on board, I just don't really understand it.

High Frequency loud noise devices at bark points - These just didn't work

Vocal cord removal - Honestly I've seriously considered this. It's not good for the dog for us to be so frustrated with her all the time. It's not good for the vibe of the house to be constantly annoyed. I doubt we will ever go this route, but it's not off the table.",10Dec2020,1

The problem is she refuses to recognize them. she wants to be a therapist, and prides herself on being perfect and being a good friend. however she’s been losing a lot of friends lately (other than me). they all said the same thing to her, that they felt she was being selfish and only cares about herself and her own needs, and they all said they needed space. instead of reflecting on this and trying to look within herself to change for the better, she quickly blames them for being mean and claims she did nothing wrong. i don’t know what to say anymore, i can’t just tell her that they’re right and she’s being a bad friend lately, because she doesn’t accept criticism. in addition, she has depression and anxiety and she spirals very quickly and i do not want her to get hurt. she only wants me to tell her what she wants to hear, which is that she’s done nothing wrong and she’s better off without them. this is all not true, she’s losing friends and she’s losing me lately but i don’t know what to do. how do i approach this?? i’m running out of ways to divert when she brings up how mad she is that her ex friends called her selfish, and that seems to be about the only thing we talk about now. i can’t tell you when the last time she asked anything about me was. i’m really starting to agree with what all of the other friends said but i want to know if there is something else i can do first because it hurts, this friendship is hurting me and i’m scared of hurting her and i don’t know what to do :-/",10Dec2020,1

843,"In the fall I began my freshman semester in college and moved into the dorms. At the same time, my sister started her freshman year of high school.

Her classes were hybrid for a while before moving fully online. She went to classes in-person fine and never missed one, but the online meetings are a different story.

Her most frequently missed class is math at 8 am, which she misses almost regularly. She claims it's a mixture of her alarm ""not going off"" or her ""going back to sleep,"" which, sure, I guess I can understand that. ...but nearly everyday? 

So far this school year, she has racked up 31 unexcused absenses from classes. The school social worker also told us that she's pretty close to getting truancy because of this.

I've tried everything I can considering I'm not home, but I really don't know what I can do.

At this point, I'm trying to get my grandma to wake her up and make her attend class in the kitchen (just so we have confirmation she is awake).

I think her biggest problem is waking up and staying awake until class, but her grades are suffering from it.

Our family isn't very ""well off,"" so I really worry about her because I don't want her to fall down the same path as our parents...

I guess my biggest question is this: how could I force/motivate/make sure she is awake for class?

845,"Hi I'm a fifteen year old boy. One day around 3/2 months ago I had the brilliant idea to get drunk. I had consumed alcohol before, though only really in small quantities without any real effect. One time however I drank quite a lot and started to actually feel drunk. It was quite a good feeling so about a week later when none was home I decided to get even more drunk. I started off with a beer and some liquor. Scared to lose the drunk feeling I drank even more liquor. I was a little unfazed for a while until it finally kicked in. and oh boy did it kick in I was mumbling and stumbling around my home. Trying to pick something up I accidentally hit the back of my head pretty hard on a metal pole under my desk. Then my mom came home unannounced. Scared to let her see me in this state I quickly went to the bathroom. When I entered the bathroom I began to notice my massive stomach ache. I was probably in that bathroom for a little over an hour until my mom came to check on me. I talked a bit with her and went downstairs. While going down the stairs I realized my stomach ache began to feel more and more severe for every step. I tried running down and into my room, but I was too late and I ended up puking right at the doorstep to my room. My mom came down after this and I was super ashamed of myself. Thankfully she handled it well and cleaned up the mess and gave me a glass of water. We had a talk about it and I ended up falling asleep almost instantly. When I woke up the next morning I had a headache, saw double for about and hour and my eyes hurt. I already had glasses though it wasn't very serious and a father who uses glasses. I thought it was just because of what had happened the night before. However when when a week and a half had passed i started getting a little worried. I could still feel the headache in the back of my head and my eyes still hurt, but most of all something just felt off. I felt dumber. since then I have gotten a new pair of glasses, but my eyes still feel weird. But the thing that bugs me the most is the feeling of having a constant headache. I feel like I am never truly at peace, My head feels slower and often I forget things I was just thinking about. Am I just depressed? Should I get my head checked because I bumped it in the desk or is it normal to feel this different after consuming large amounts of alcohol. Please help me.

I also want to clarify that I am not proud of what I did and haven't repeated it since.

tl;dr

I'm fifteen got super drunk. Ended up hitting my the back of my head pretty hard on steel part of desk.  Puked and fell asleep. after this have been felling dumber and like I have a constant headache and worse sight . Happened 2/3 months ago.

852,"Hi - thanks for reading.

I'm hoping this won't be a big wall of text - I'll try to keep it short but a lot of this will probably be me venting. I'm looking for another perspective, maybe a story from someone who has been in a similar position.

I've been at my current employer for about 3 years now - 2 spent in a junior role and 1 spent in a senior role as a manager of 2 colleagues. I'm in the UK, work is office based &amp; currently working from home for the most part atm. Salary isn't bad, about £29k since taking on the Senior role. Office is a few miles down the road, so a very easy commute. I have been reasonably happy up until recently.

The last couple of months I have been feeling pretty weighed down by work, a feeling of anxiety hanging over me, longing for the weekends/holidays and getting frustrated with tasks and people. A few times I considered looking for other jobs, but being in the middle of covid I didn't follow through. I take on a lot of the jobs, for the main reason that it won't really get done to a decent standard otherwise, but also have to manage a team of 2 which brings its own work providing help and support, team management, work allocations, performance reporting, you know all that boring office crap.

I decided it was time for a change &amp; applied for another role in the business which I have an upcoming interview for soon. I'm not even sure if it is something I want to do, but I just want to get away from the work I'm doing now. If I get the job, it will probably be a minimum 3 months before I can start in order to recruit and hand over my role. The new role will continue to be office based, but with an opportunity to allow me to work from home permanently - this would allow me to move elsewhere in the UK where housing is more affordable.

A few weeks ago, our area had a complete restructure - With 4 days notice I was given management responsibility for 4 more people (6 total now), in addition to being responsible for some of their prev. areas of work which I have no knowledge or understanding of, with pressing deadlines coming up with financial implications if missed. My new manager is entirely new to the business, and so will likely have to lean on me a lot when it comes to the grunt work - training, reporting, project management, people managment etc etc. So now I feel a mess at work, have all these tasks, duties and responsibilities that I was never even privvy too, don't want to do, haven't recieved any additional salary increase or change of job description. The anxiety is now really building and I'm worried it will be taking a toll on my health. These are how I see my current options:

- Hope I get offered the new position, take the salary increase and try the role out. Spend 3 more months in the current role for hand over and I hope I like the new position. 

- Don't get offered the new position and start looking for a new job. Try and find an interesting role amongst Covid and hope I get offered the job and hand in notice as soon as I can. 

- Stay in my current position - Take my moans and unhappiness to manager/HR and try to manage this with the company - Negotiate a change of job description &amp; salary increase. I'm a bit tired of managing people, I just want to do my own work and don't aspire to manage people in the future. My boss seemed a bit taken back when I said this.

- Don't get offered a new role, hand in my notice and live off of savings whilst I work on finding a new career (approx. 10 months of living costs saved) - maybe look at jobs in other areas of the country

After typing this all out I actually feel like I'm making a big deal over nothing... I'm just tired of constantly feeling stressed and anxious about work. I go to work for a pay check at the end of the month, and I understand that few people are going to make money by doing something they really enjoy, but I can't carry on like this for much longer.

If covid wasn't a thing I would have handed my notice in long ago and be travelling or on a working holiday visa. Boooo covid!

858,"So I met this friend about 4/5 years ago when I moved to a new city and didn't know a lot of people. It started out fun as I was still looking for a job and had lots of free time and they only worked part time and were always down to hang out. 


As soon as I got a job I felt the energy in the friendship begin to shift. They were so demanding of my time and energy and they always took my no's super hard and very personally. Not only am I an introvert but I also have some very real mental health issues that make me exhausted on top of working full-time at a stressful job. I got no sympathy from them and they constantly asked if I was mad at them or what have you when I was just fucking tired and couldn't hang out all the time. When I did have them over, they would overstay their welcome (11pm on a work night) when I had to wake up early but they didn't because of their part time work schedule. They're also a very competitive person and when we would get together to play games would be that really exhausting person who took a win or a loss super seriously... really took the fun out of playing. They're also the kind of person who will nitpick and pull apart everything you say. And if you say something they disagree with they'll let you know (I'm talking inconsequential shit). Sounds exhausting right? 


I know a lot of it is from their childhood, growing up with a very hypercritical mother, seeing their parents relationship fall apart after their father cheated and being compared to their more attractive siblings (their words not mine) and not having a ton of close friends in life. As a result they're highly critical themselves, competitive, extremely needy and always have to be in control, and always trying to do things for me (which I find infuriating). They also didn't feel as 'worldly' or 'sophisticated' as us (again their insecurities not ours) and always had to point it out when no one else did. As a result I was constantly stroking their ego and complementing them to try and boost their self esteem. 


Now that most of the complaints are out of the way, I do want to give them a list of positives. They can be extremely fun! They were some of the first friends my partner and I made here and they introduced us to other great people. They introduced us to new hobbies and always wanted to try something new. They're intelligent and are a wonderful conversationalist. We bonded a lot over having shitty mums. They are a really giving person, which is a double edged sword because they expect the same level of output in return. I'm talking gifts, time, energy, their possessions. Very generous. Which is why this is all so upsetting. There's a really great person and friend under the needy, jealous, possessive, competitive crap borne out of their insecurities. That's why I'm so conflicted. And every time we've had discussions about boundaries or they've gotten a 'no' they take it so personally and get really hurt. 


I should mention that they ended up moving far away about two years ago and we did go to visit them. I think this physical distance was much needed on my part but now I can feel the emotional distance growing wider. I can tell they really want to bitch me out over the fact that I don't text back often. It's a flaw of mine that I own and all of my other loved ones are patient with me. My own best friend I don't talk to for months at a time. It's just not something I'm good at. But it's not because I don't care. And that's the thing anytime I've 'let them down' it's like they make a mental tally of all the times I wasn't a perfect friend and it's like it erased all previous effort I've put into the relationship. They also get passive aggressive and leave me on read when I do respond to give me a taste of my own medicine...which doesn't work btw lol. The more I feel like I'm on their shit-list the more I pull away and shut down... ironic huh?


I have to say that I feel undervalued because I feel like I went above and beyond for them throughout our friendship. We regularly hung out, I also got them a lot of gifts, we planned activities too and hosted a lot at our place. I even hosted and planned a birthday party for them that they described as ""something no one had ever done for them and the most memorable birthday they ever had"". We went to visit them after they moved. I made picture collage I mailed to them, sent Xmas gifts. I feel so stupid having to list this out like it's a fucking ledger but that's how they make me feel. They make me feel like I'm losing at a game I never realized I entered.


I've asked mutual friends if this is something they noticed and they did. One friend said they would complain to them whenever I wasn't available like a child fussing over not getting a toy they wanted. I've also asked people outside of the relationship who don't know this person and one friend was disturbed by the level of fixation they had with me. 


I have a hard time trusting my own intuition and needs, which is why I thought I'd ask here. So reddit, is this relationship toxic or something worth fighting for? If so, what should I do?",10Dec2020,1

862,"Unfortunately I did something pretty bad, and got caught.

The good news is that they're trying to avoid putting more people in jail right now (for obvious reasons), so in a sense I was lucky...

...But sadly my crime wasn't ""minor"" enough that community service or straight probation was enough.

I accepted a plea deal to avoid jail time (normally not possible for this crime), but part of my probation conditions will be smelling this really-horrible-smelling-stuff for 5 minutes straight, on 4 separate occasions.

No idea what it is, other than that it's not considered harmful. My lawyer told me that ""malodorants"" have started to be used in jails here as a more humane alternative to solitary confinement, to deter prison fights / rule violations...so I guess with 2020 being how it is, it's now being used for criminal offenses too.

So how do I deal with it exactly? I can't put anything in my nose to ""cover"" the smell (like that VapoRub stuff was explicitly mentioned) or anything else to avoid it. So I'm not sure how to handle it, because even dog poop makes me gag, so...how do I make this bearable so I don't vomit?",10Dec2020,1
863,"This is going to be a very lengthy explanation of why I am losing my mind. In March of 2018 I lost my soulmate. My mother passed away from a failed liver. At age 19 I had no idea how to continue to live without my best friend. She was the person who gave me life and living without my mommy didn’t seem physically possible. In the last few days of her life I knew I wasn’t going to be able to process what was happening so I took my last $200 I had and went and adopted a 75lb pitbull. Why him? I don’t know. I was desperate for companionship and I thought he had kind eyes. We have spent the past two and a half years together and it has been rough. He isn’t a good dog. He doesn’t get along with other animals, he only listens to my commands (sometimes), he has separation anxiety, he runs away. Don’t get me wrong, he is all that I have and I am all that he has. We love eachother very much and we rely on eachother to get through the day. After my mom passed away, the only reason I would even leave my apartment was because I knew I had to walk the dog. He kept me going. My living situation has changed since then and now I don’t know what to do with him. See I had to move back into my grandmas home that I grew up in when my mom passed because I quit working and couldn’t afford rent. In September of 2019 my grandma passed away and now the family that owns her house is kicking me out. Now my dog has caused all kinds of damage to my room from having separation anxiety. He has eaten the wood paneling, scratched the door to shreds, and has even escaped expensive heavy duty crates/kennels. The issue is he tends to hurt himself while doing that. I do have an emotional support animal letter from my provider but apartments are still against having a 75lb pitbull living in their units. He is damaging to things. I still have not processed my mothers death, I still have all of her things in storage. I got the dog to help me cope but I didn’t know all of the things that come along with being a pet owner. My life was falling apart and I made a spontaneous choice that will always impact me. The dog is my big stinky baby and I love him so much but he causes me so much stress at the same time because I come home and my drywall is tore up and he peed on my things. We run and walk several times a day. It isn’t like I don’t spend time with him it’s just that he’s stressed when I’m not home. I stress about him when I’m not with him. So it’s come down to my living situation or my mental health. Do I drive myself into a deep depression and have no reason left to life because I gave up my dog? Or do I suffer the consequences of not having a place to live? I can’t just give him back to the shelter because he is a pitbull and will be so quick to be euthanized. Even if he got adopted I couldn’t imagine him being abused or abandoned by another person. I almost would feel better to take him out and shoot him myself so I know he’s not suffering at the hands of another human. But he’s healthy, he’s a STRONG healthy 5 year old pit. I love my dog but I didn’t know it would be like this. I can’t live with myself thinking he’s shivering outside tied up to someone else’s house. I can’t afford to keep moving and losing security deposits. I can’t lose my dog because then I am forced to process my moms death. I am overwhelmed.

I am confident he didn't give it to anyone because both of us had our hearing to defend ourselves and had an opportunity to shift blame. But both of us in the meeting said we didn't send it to anyone else. Anyway, both of us will be failing the course, and this will be going to the dean. As mad at myself as I am, it is what I deserve.

What I am wondering at this point is this. What happens from here? Even if I don't get expelled, is there any point in even bothering to finish and get my degree?

867,"So I've noticed the drastic difference between me and my bf's sex drive. His is really high all the time and he always wants sex. I want to have sex just as much but its always too rough for me (it causes me a lot of pain, i usually needed a day or so to recover) and his aggressiveness makes me feel trapped and uncomfortable (huge turn off for someone who likes their space). We live together but only spend time together when we're about to sleep or have sex. I don't feel very connected to him because of this. I love him a lot. And I do tell him how I feel regularly but it never seems to sink in. I don't want to give up on our relationship, I just want us to listen to each other and learn to compromise. I will admit that we're both stubborn but I try my best to think ahead for both of us which can make me feel like his mother because I cook, I clean, I go to work and I study, he stays at home, studies and gets furlough and then pounces on me when I get home. Thats probably the reason why I don't want to have sex; I don't want to take care of some man child.

873,"I’ve posted this in two other groups, but I want as much advice as I can gather.

So here’s a little background. I’ve known him almost all my life because we went to the same school for forever. I developed a friendship with him in 8th grade and we almost instantly became bestfriends. It wasn’t until my sophomore year that I started to catch real feelings for him and started thinking about a relationship. So, we started talking until I was finally allowed to officially date him when I was 16. However, about two weeks before we started officially dating, my grandpa (whom I do not speak to even prior to this or have a good relationship with) came up to the two of us at church and said “ya know our families are sorta kinda kin.” Absolutely mortifying to think that after a year or two of working toward a relationship with someone, it might all go to waste. So of course I bawled my eyes out and went to the person I thought would have an answer: my great grandma. My great grandpa’s side of the family is the side that shares a relation to my boyfriend’s family, so I figured she might know. She informed my mom that there was no familial relation that she was aware of. However, I got curious and asked about it again recently and my grandpa’s brother informed me that my great grandpa was related to some of my boyfriend’s family. So, I did some (much regretted) digging through the family tree only to find that we share a set of greatx4 grandparents born in 1848 and that we are in fact 5th cousins. I have been crying almost daily about it for 3 1/2 weeks now at the thought of losing him over this because I know he’s the boy I want to be with for the rest of my life. Say what you want because we’re young, but when you know you know. He has no problem with the relation and considers it to be completely irrelevant but I’m uncomfortable with the idea. I know that if I’d researched everything from the start, this might have been the only thing that would’ve stopped me from starting a relationship with him. But we dismissed the idea because we were told there wasn’t a relation. I can’t stop thinking about how the only reason from the start that we carried on 100% was because I was told something that I believed. I can’t say I would’ve accepted it had I known the fact from the start and carried on, which breaks my heart. But I had already fallen in love and decided I wanted a relationship before. I want nothing more than to be able to get over this and let everything go back to normal, but I feel like we have been living a lie this whole time. It’s weighing heavy on my heart and our relationship and I don’t know where to go with this. And how do I stop associating him with this situation and get over it?",10Dec2020,1

881,"So my dad cheated  on my mother many times. And  he left me in emotionally abandoned and stuff. Being a young adult women, I have realised I have a  deep hatred for men. It has become femcel-like and I cannot stand living my life this way. I have brothers too and I dont hate them, and it is not fair to them at all. They went through all the same things I did, and I dont want to project it onto them.   

Things that have fed it are going on dates with men who just talk about my body or porn stars on dates. I felt belittled. Or just talk about my looks.  It all felt vey sexualised. Even the nice guys had their motives. It made me feel grossed out. 

I started to read the incels pages and pages that talked about women as if they were meat. They would talk about how they were not hot enough or tight enough or anything enough. I felt overwhelmed, and stupidly fed these things to myself. I felt like I was just something to use and throw away when I get to be older and less attractive. I hated men for that feeling. My guy friends would tell me they felt disapopointed by womens bodies during sexual encounters. 

I fed the rhetoric to myself, and I used it on my ex bf. I told him horrible things like he just thought about fucking other women and he was just using me. I told him that all he wants is a younger women and would rather be with them and I wasnt good enough. 

This is probably all self hate being projected on other people. I really dont want to see all men this way. For the sake of my brothers and everyone. I know I sound like the daddy issues girl. I hate it. I dont want to let these things control me and who I am.

Because it was clear that I wasn't making progress even though I could identify what problems were in my life and as a result I felt really powerless, whereas I thought journaling was meant to make you feel empowered and more self aware? WTF!? Am I expecting too much?

I tried to remedy this by not writing brain-dumps, but instead writing as a means of asking myself specific questions ""how am I going to solve this problem?"" and **importantly ask myself ""What will I do next""**. But since I didn't have the answers... it would just end. Every journal entry ended with ""I don't know what to do, otherwise I'd be doing it."" **So I gave up keeping a journal because clearly the act of writing down things doesn't lead to constructive or helpful actions**

The only place I've found keeping a journal helps is if I'm working on a project, I can write down ""this piece of software didn't do what I wanted until I changed settings X Y &amp; Z"" or ""we managed to finish on time today because I wrote a document that acted as a checklist and it had these details Q W V, but I didn't use V that much..."".

886,"Hi reddit,

let me start off by saying that I \[24M\] am not a very social person. I rarely socialized in my life and if I did then it was mostly through the internet.

Few weeks ago I found a new circle of friends online and I enjoyed playing and spending time with them on voice chat. However as time moved on I realized more and more that all of them are so much better than me in most activities and are also generally way more knowledgeable than me in most things. In group conversations I feel like I am just a silent listener who can't give any good input even though I feel like I should be. So I started feeling pretty useless and ended up forcing myself to pick up more hobbies and work more on myself to make myself more interesting, which went pretty well at the beginning but I am getting this feeling that I will never catch up to them and feel like giving up. I end up spending a lot of time with them because I think this is a good opportunity to learn about socializing and also get to know a lot of stuff since they are so knowledgeable but I feel inferior almost every day and it is not a great feeling. I feel like this is the path I have to go if I ever want to get better but I still don't know how it would be possible for me to become more interesting/skilled/knowledgeable than them as I am pretty far behind. Also, if I don't spend time with them I feel even worse because I get the feeling of missing out on something important and falling behind even further. I don't want to leave them but I also don't feel well in this situation. 

Do you think I should just suffer through it until it gets better and work more on myself to avoid this in the future or is there anything better? I really hope someone has been in this situation before.

890,"I don't even know where to begin with this girl (my crush).

She's beautiful in every way. Her luscious bangs. Her radiant smile. Those adorable green eyes. The way she appears (every time I look at a picture of her or see her in person, my heart can't help but beat loudly and proudly). That softspoken tone she has every time she speaks; it literally soothes me when I hear it. But most of all, her voice as both a writer and a human being is what truly speaks to me the most. She recently wrote a piece on insecurity and being self-conscious about yourself, something that I have been struggling with for a very long time. I'm the type of person who can't look at himself in the mirror; the type of person who believes that any and all compliments being given to him are out of pity or guilt (to the extent that I accuse my own mother of having ""mom goggles""). And it's for that reason why I've never asked anyone out, because I was always so afraid to tell someone how I feel about them, fearing that I may get rejected. But her piece, in particular, made me feel legitimately emotional, so much so that I told her how much I loved it over an email thread. Her response went like this: ""You have no idea how much your words mean to me in regard to your response to my article. I felt very vulnerable in sharing my writing at all, let alone on a topic so anxiety-inducing. I am so glad that you connected with it, and I am shocked that you are insecure about your smile because I think you have a great smile! It shows how most of our insecurities only exist in our heads. Also, I am very self-conscious of my writing because I am not as well-spoken as you are and my vocabulary is certainly lacking (I envy your speaking and writing abilities in class), so I think I lean on my ability to be raw and emotional to connect to the reader. Again, thank you so much for your kind words of encouragement, I honestly cannot thank you enough."" I think anyone would be the luckiest guy in the entire world to have her in their arms. Not necessarily to engage in intercourse, but to simply cuddle with her; to be there for her; to embrace her.

But lately, I've been feeling really depressed. Not only because I don't know how to tell her how I feel, but also because of those insecurities and how I feel about myself. To put it plainly, I feel worthless inside, believing that nobody loves me. Believing that everything she said in response to my reaction (specifically about my smile) was done out of self-pity for me. Last week, I spent three consecutive nights crying to myself for a couple of nights, I really am that depressed. And as an aspiring filmmaker, I've also been thinking about making a film that addresses everything I've been feeling about insecurities and about my identity. A film that is simply me being honest about myself, talking to the camera about everything that I feel. I don't intend to also talk about how I feel about her, but part of me really wants to (but don't worry, I won't). But my fear is that this film will turn her off; that my honesty and vulnerability will lead her to think that I'm too unstable. Yet, her article posits that honesty and vulnerability are what she especially values. So I honestly don't know what to do anymore. She definitely knows that I exist, and we've had conversations before. But I just feel like every time I attempt to tell her something or compliment her, I begin to believe that her response is because she feels bad for me. Like, ""Oh that's sweet and maybe he doesn't have too many friends, so I'll throw him a bone to make him feel better."" I'm worthless, aren't I? That's what I am.

I just really want to tell her. But I don't know if I can. Should I start off gradually, becoming friends with her first? Or should I just let it all out in a message to her? Everyone is telling me different things, and I simply don't know anymore. I really want to confess to her, but maybe I should just take it slow. The last thing I want to do is taint our friendship or whatever we have. I just get so preoccupied with the fact that I think she hates me.

Because I've been absolutely crushed before and she's like infinitely better than any of those heartbreaks. I fear she's going to destroy me. I understand that's part of the gamble but I can't decide what to do and I fear it's starting to put a strain on our relationship. She wants to hang out all the time and text when we're not, which is great! I love it. But when it comes to hanging out, I fear she's going to get bored of me really fast. 

I went through THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of rejections on tinder. Nobody wants to spend with me. But she does. And I don't know why. I've bailed on her more times that I'd care to admit and it makes me so mad at myself. Because I do want to see her and I miss her and her touch. But I'm so worried she's going to see my complete guard-is-down-side and bolt. She asks what I do all day when I make excuses and it's embarrassing for me to say-- well, I wrote two sentences on a vague story idea I have before I decided to switch my attention to the market so I could time the exit of a trade, while I waited for steam to refund a video game because it was such a disappointment to me that it now has me questioning my identity lmao it sound so stupid, dumb, boring and lame! And thousands before her ignored me after they found out who I was but now one is curious about it? She tells me she just wants to hang out, be around me and we can each do our own things. I've never had anyone in my entire life express this level of interest in me.

What do I do? How do I... proceed?",10Dec2020,1

894,"[obligatory apology: im on mobile and this is my first time posting]

So my sister has always been hard on me and we've never had the best relationship. 
When I was a kid she used to bully me pretty hard and my parents just let it happen, hoping I would stand up for myself and fight back. The thing is she isn't the easiest person to get along with, she's had a couple mental health challenges and has had a difficult time making friends because of her strong personality.
I never stood up for myself and she just kept being mean and rude or hostile to me. Im now 17 and she's 19 and back from university (because of covid) and I keep trying to find ways to talk to her and form a relationship but she doesn't seem to want that. She remains dismissive of me, or rude and gets mad at me. 
For some background, a year ago I tried to commit suicide and since she's been blaming me for all the hardships our family has had to deal with in this past year, which to be fair are my fault. I also have anxiety so maybe thats scewing my perspective? I just want her to like me. It's gotten so bad that my aunt (who lives across the continent) has been asking me about it, saying that she's noticed how hard on me she was since I was a toddler. 
Even though she's been mean to me, she's never hit me or hurt me in any way that I can remember.
I guess my question is what can I do to make this better? I want to have a real relationship ship with her but I almost have a panic attack any time I go to knock on her bedroom door.",10Dec2020,1
896,"So I asked my roommate for her rent up front for next month. I’ve run into a BIG fanatical crisis. Something I did not plan or expect. I just asked if she happen to have it (she does pretty well financially) and I’ve never asked her for anything before. But I just figured I’d ask. If she didn’t have it. No biggie. I thought I had it figured out and I texted her never mind. She replies “No worries. Let me know if anything changes.” 

So it did change. I owed more and I asked again. She sent it but was really rude about it. I offered to send it right back. I would rather suffer the consequences if it meant it was inconveniencing her or she was giving me what she had. I wouldn’t have accepted it at all. 

Now she’s not texting me back. It’s just strange. Why she would be upset or am I just being paranoid because I’m high?",10Dec2020,1
897,"I'm finding people increasingly more difficult to deal with. I was called racist, sexist, bitched at by anti-mask customers. I know this sounds bad but I began fearing middle aged white women, black women, and men in general. The cat calling from the male customers was somewhat frequent and some of them would talk down to me. 

I've gotten called racist and sexist on multiple occasions for minor mistakes and calling people ""dear"". I actually had a white lady try to grab me because I called her ""honey"" as per my cultural upbringing. Had a black woman throw a sign at my coworker because she thought we were racists who were hiding the real sales price because she was black. Got accused of racism for not taking expired coupons. Got accused of racism for telling a guy who was illegally parked to move. I'm now terrified to enforce rules on black customers. I froze up when told to tell some teenagers to leave because they were trashing the lobby with food. Literally went into the backroom and cried because I didn't want to have another Starbucks incident and end up filmed to be put on Twitter. Even though I was just doing my job. One of my black coworkers had to tell them to leave. 

Got told I hate America and my generation is destroying the country for telling a person to put on a mask. Got cussed out on multiple occasions for the company not offering military discounts. 

I had a mental breakdown in August and ended up being put in a therapy group with people just like my bad customers. One girl in particular would take over entire sessions and had to be kicked out because she would intentionally interrupt the white people in the group like ""your problems aren't bad. Try being black."" She unironically thought that the coronavirus was invented by whites to kill all the black people.

Being put in a group with somebody like this further reinforced my fear of confrontation over percieved racial injustice. Me forgetting to put napkins in a bag lead to a really nasty racial problem and being subjected to this type of abuse has left me paralyzed. I feel like everything I do. Every mistake I make. Will be perceived as a personal attack. Like it has many times before. I just want my life back",10Dec2020,1

I’m so done with everything everyday is the same it’s too much work to get up in the morning... I’ve had some hard shit to swallow as a kid, my parents are drug addicts and alcoholics I no longer talk to my mom anymore... some background info so u can get a better idea of what my life was like, I remember when garbage bags would be up in the windows and 3 mattress’s would be in the living room where all my parents did was sleep all day, if someone knocked at the door my first instinct would be to run into my room and hide.

I was in 5th or 6th grade when my mom gave me my first joint, I feel like I blame myself because it’s not like she forced me to do it but still she shouldn’t have given me it at all that’s not a mom. A mom wants what’s best for her kid, later down the road in grade 9 my mom asked me if I wanted to do speed with her one day that fucked me up big time same with crack and her prescription meds like Xanax, Trazodone, larazapam.

Our due date is today and I did my part and when I finished I asked her how her work was going. She asked me to send her my part of the work. I did not want to because I do not trust her.

I just want to watch from a closet, or hear it happening from another room. He is an extremely good looking man and is fantastic in bed. I want other women to experience it and I want them to love it. Sometimes it’s all I can think about. I don’t him to be romantic with other women, but I want him to give please them. The idea of a woman sending my boyfriend a nude is so hot to me that that alone could make me climax at this point.

she argues over the smallest things, and rarely apologises, and after that, she would text me basically saying how it’s my fault that her parents and the school knows, and that i should never have tried to get her help without her knowing, and that it’s my fault that her parents worry of her because of me. whenever i’ve done something that’s against her opinions, then she tells me that im her best friend only, and that i should tell her whenever i’ve secretly asked to get her help, otherwise she’ll get mad.

i feel like i have to filter what i say when i’m with her, or just not act like myself, and it sucks. she keeps repeating and telling me that friends of over 7 years will stay friends, so i’m scared to tell her that i don’t want to be friends with her anymore.

914,"Hi, passerby. Will you tell me your story? I know we’ve had different lives, hurt different people, run different races, lusted over different jewels. It occurs to me that the courses of our lives will never converge. I have never been who you are now, and I never will become who you once were, or who you will come to be. And while I have become who I am at this moment through good choices and bad mistakes, I cannot possibly have the insight that you have acquired in your quarter of our world. But my eyes are wide, I’m jealous and greedy and curious and I want to see what you see, because I want to use your experiences to my own, selfish benefit.

You are however old you have become: maybe you’re a teenager wrestling with existential questions, an old woman gone back to university, a Middle-Aged businessperson seeking redemption, honour and wealth, an influencer chasing fame and validation, a human who managed to dress themselves for a walk outside today for the first time in years. You have seen and experienced life in a unique way that I have not, and cannot, and yet yearn to espy for my own internal profit. Will you take my call, just for a moment? I wonder if we might both learn something.

May I introduce myself, briefly? I want you to know where I’m coming from. My mother died when I was 19, six years ago, when I was studying at university. She had been sick for two years and in the end she was ready. I did poorly that semester, of course, but I don’t beat myself up about it. I used the insurance money left over to take a mortgage and buy a small apartment in our city, which I rent out to pay the loan. In 2017, I finished my degree, late, but I was still proud. I doubled in Philosophy and History. I liked studying the Middle East, especially the Arab-Israeli conflict.

I didn’t go straight into a “proper” job, whatever that means, when I graduated. I worked in retail and saved. And then I travelled. I went to India and Sri Lanka, to Russia, Mongolia and China, around Europe. 

When I came home, I took a job at a bank for six months. But by then my field of vision had gotten too big, and the bank’s was too small. I left again, and went to finally see Israel and Palestine for myself. I walked into Jordan and Egypt, I flew to Turkey and hitchhiked through Georgia and Armenia.

After all this travelling, I thought I should come home and get a “proper” job. But instead, I detoured to spend a summer working in a hostel in the South Island of New Zealand. For fun. I was lucky enough to be in New Zealand when the pandemic started and the borders closed, and here I am now, a year later - 25-years-old, working in retail again, part-time, and enjoying my life in safety and beauty.

But, as you’ll have guessed, it feels like I’m on the precipice of making bad decisions. This is where your wisdom comes in.

I want to become somebody my mother would have been proud of. I don’t want to squander the unparalleled opportunity I have been given, growing up in a country with free healthcare, no such thing as private student loans, a government with masterful control over the virus, and the circumstance of owning an apartment (though, of course, I would give the latter back in a heartbeat if my mother could be returned to me). And yet it seems all too easy to brew a delicious, sweet tea  - and burn your tongue on the first sip.

Despite my degree and travel experiences, I am skill-less. I didn’t study carpentry, engineering, science, technology, medicine, law, plumbing. I studied things I cared about, and then dismissed gainful employment to seek personal gratification in travel and easy options. I learned more in the Middle East than I ever did at university, and yet this seems meaningless in our world. 

I am happy, safe, comfortable, relaxed. I have a positive affect, a good mood. I love my life. But this isn’t the same thing as being satisfied. I want to do and be more. I suppose, in a way, ultimately a comfortable amount of money will be a part of it. But more importantly, I want to contribute in some useful way. I want to be useful. I want to make my mother proud. Even if that can only ever be in my own head.

So at 25 I haven’t “made myself”, gotten marketable skills and started “building my empire”, as the YouTube gurus would have me berate myself about. 8 years after finishing high school and three years after graduating from university, I’m not really anybody, according to the internet. But I feel like I am somebody to myself, or at the very least a potential somebody. So what happens next?

The questions that I beg of you are contained within the stories I hope you’ll share with me. Your stories of success and failure, what you discovered was important and what didn’t really matter, in the end. Who are you, and where are you going? Does satisfaction ever arrive, or is it an endless treadmill? Does that mean we shouldn’t strive at all? Do you think I’ve failed? And by extension, what about yourself?

How do we not fuck it all up?

TL;DR - This disposable account wants to know who you are and what lessons it can draw from your life - and what your own lessons to others may teach yourself, if you’ll only give yourself the time to reflect on them.",10Dec2020,1
915,"First of all, apologies for the long read. So, for a little background, my family situation has been strenuous for most if not all of my life. My father has been unfaithful multiple times, and around two-three years ago had left my mother for his mistress. Since then, my mother and him have been divorced, with my sister (21), brother, and I all living with my mother. My father is living with his new wife, who we're all pretty sure only married him for a US citizenship. My parents are both from Taiwan, and we are an Asian American family (this comes into play later on). Long story short, neither of our parents are very good parents. Our father abandoned us, and our mother is a very anxious and neurotic woman. She has mentioned many times that she regrets having birthed us. That if only we didn't exist, she wouldn't have had to stay with our father. She wouldn't have had to live her shitty life she does. She has let up on this behavior but continues to be insufferable in many other aspects of everyday life. Especially now with Covid, all three of my siblings and I have had to deal with her insensitivity. She has called my sister a ""disgusting slut"" for having a, what I consider, healthy FWIB relationship. I am best friends with said FWIB and fully trust that their relationship together is a healthy friendship supplemented with just another activity that people enjoy doing together. I understand if my mother is not understanding of said relationship, with her more conservative views, but she didn't need to resort to such a reaction. A mother should never call their child disgusting. As for my brother, he has tried to get into the Informatics major at his school but failed to get in after his first attempt. He still can attempt many more times though. But, he has already taken the prerequisite classes and has a lot of credits piled up, so the wisest choice for him is to just not to take many classes right now until he can reapply with a better application. So he is only taking one class, but he is struggling in it. Not for lack of trying, but taking this particular class with his professor who isn't very well adjusted to online teaching, combined with TA's that don't know what they're talking about, it has been a struggle for him. He has also been proactive in trying to find an internship. None really available during Covid though. And he is also in a student project group, trying to develop some sort of web interface. However, that is also just barely trudging along due to its online nature. My mother doesn't see any of his effort, she only sees him as a lazy slack-off who only games. She makes comments along the lines of ""look at ""brother"", he's always happy with nothing to worry about since he's always gaming."" This is really irritating for my brother, as he is trying his hardest, yet that isn't being recognized, and she is not recognizing his struggles either and doesn't take his feelings seriously.

Another issue is that my mother will constantly bother him. She has a bedroom adjacent to his bedroom, and she keeps her clothing in his room. She has constantly just come in while he is sleeping and changed there and started conversing with him when he just wants his rest. She's the kind of person that, if he were to tell her to stop, which he has, she would retort back that he is ""disrespecting his mother. Don't use that tone with me. Yeah yeah, everything is MY fault. Nobody likes me in this house."" My brother hates her. She never shows gratitude when he helps her with grammar correction in any documents she produces for her work (her English is not that great). She has no respect for his space. And whenever he is feeling so overwhelmed with stress, she can freely enter into his area of the living room where his computer is located and just talk to him. My siblings and I all agree that when my mother is nearby, a sense of just irritation and shortness overcomes us. We care for her, but she is a difficult person who has the emotional maturity of a child. She says hurtful things without thinking and only regrets it hours after the fact, claims she will change, and then allows her emotions to be in control yet again when something such as us showing what she claims is disrespect towards her, or if we just can't do a task she wants us to do immediately. My brother wishes he had been born to a different mother, a different father. We kind of all do.

Another thing that he feels hopeless about is his self esteem. He is a shorter Asian guy. I think he is quite handsome and charming in his personality. But we all know, that especially at his age and in college, height matters. He hates looking at himself in the mirror, he hates going outside. Covid has made him feel trapped and want to be around people, but at the same time he hates being outside because people will see him. They will see him and only see that he is a short, skinny Asian guy. Other men look down on him, call him names like ""buddy"", treat him like a child although he is a grown man. At work, he has to look up to talk to taller customers both male and female, and he hates that. He hates that the girls he likes are taller than him, and that he's been told before that ""sorry, I'm just not into short guys"". He hates that he's afraid of being rejected in the future because of it. He understands that they are fully in the right to have preferences and reject him, but that doesn't change that fact. 

He is also very bitter that our 6'2"" father did not pass on his genes to him. In my brother's words he doesn't know just what went wrong. He despises my mother for her short genes that probably affected his own height, and that wouldn't matter if he loved her but he doesn't, so it's just even more reason to despise her.

He's never had a girlfriend before either.

And he's also confided in me that he has never been happy. He only games nowadays to escape life and smokes weed constantly to do so as well. He always has felt like a loser. He was a weird kid in elementary school, and always taken for a fool due to how his humor is, even though he is a very intelligent guy. He says that there's just no reason to keep living. He is stressed by college, nd maybe not being able to get into his wanted major, he has little hope with women, little self confidence, and even if he does get into his major, he doesn't want to spend 40 hrs a week just working away. He has been driven to tears consistently recently, and has been feeling suicidal as a result of all the stress, lack of parental support or understanding, and lack of seeing a possible happy future for himself.

I'm really worried for him. I plan on having a talk with my mother about giving him more space and not allowing as much of her hurtful words out at least near him, and I hope that goes well. But how else can I help him?",10Dec2020,1

I had a part-time job before at the pool but now the pool is closed for obvious purposes and I know I’ll be able to work there again in the summer. 

With my anxiety, I got comfortable working at that job since I’ve been working there since my junior year of high school. But I’m currently a college student who’s taking classes at home and I know I should get a job, but I fear change and thinking about working with new co-workers scares me and makes me stressed out.

The only job I contemplated on applying to was just working at a grocery store and then I think about all the people I have to talk to and I get stressed and I know I should fix this for my future if I’m going to apply for an actual job, but I have enough money right now since I’m not spending. My parents aren’t urging me to get a job, but I feel like I should do this to take advantage of how I’m home right now since I wouldn’t have a job usually on campus. Is there any easy way to shove my anxiety down a drain if I do decide to apply because I remember when I first started working at the pool, I had the same issue and it took three years for me to stop being anxious while working, but it was easier since my co-workers were my friends before I applied, and now I’m stepping into a new experience with no acquaintances and it’s stressing me out more than normal which is why I’ve avoided applying earlier in my semester",10Dec2020,1
918,"Hi reddit,

Around 1.5 months ago, I was dumped by my girlfriend of 4 months. Despite the relatively short amount of time we were together for, we were very close and had a strong connection. However, we both have trauma that (at the time) we weren’t confronting at all. This made us both codependent on each other, she wouldn’t communicate with me very well which resulted in me having to pry shit out of her whenever she’d be upset, and this resulted in me being quick to irritation/frustration whenever she’d be hiding stuff from me. Not to mention I have a quick temper. Throughout our relationship, I nearly broke up with her twice, and I suffered a major mental breakdown at one point.

In October she moved out of her strict household and into a dorm for her school right around when I started therapy up again, and for the first few days she was understandably a bit more distant because she was busy. Logically I understood this, but I couldn’t help and be reminded of a previous ex who became distant and broke up with me, which caused me to have a panic attack and spam her late one night. When she woke up in the morning, we talked about it and she ended up deciding to dump me because she felt like I wouldn’t give her the freedom she deserves. I tried to explain to her that the transition was rough on me, and that I’m going back to therapy in part to learn how to better control my emotional reactions. But it was no use, her mind was already made.

We tried to remain in contact with the possibility of getting back together in the future when “we were both better” (note that she likely suffers from BPD and had recently gotten medicated, but still hadn’t started seeing a therapist), but she quickly began to behave recklessly and not like herself. She would purposefully put herself in dangerous situations, and started drinking and using drugs again despite previously sweating them off, since she was addicted in the past. This culminated in me explaining to her that I think she needs to start seeing a therapist too, just like I was, and she promptly told me to fuck off. In my anger, and fearing that she had truly gone off the deep end, I threatened to call the police on her if she didn’t return my laptop I lent to her for school undamaged. In my defense, I no longer felt like I knew how she would behave considering how radically her personality seemed to have changed in a single week. But I realize that I probably overreacted. 

This led to us having an on and off friendship for the next few weeks, where we’d randomly hit each other up (primarily me initiating about 60-70% of the time). I was hoping that she would still trust me enough to communicate when she needed space and what her needs were. She did end up being hospitalized for a suicide attempt, and throughout that experience it at times felt like she blamed me for that. I felt super anxious from the lack of clarity on where we were moving towards or what we needed from each other, so I did try to clarify things with her simply because she wasn’t really communicating with me what she desired or needed, and I really didn’t want to overwhelm her or be a negative. I just wanted to support her as best as I could. In fact, one day she facetimed me when she was having a dissociative episode and we talked and caught up. It was really nice, and I was really proud of her for opening up to me, albeit briefly. 

However, things climaxed that night when one of her roommates randomly texted me accusing me of causing her a panic attack and all this stuff. I can tell he was trying to act as a mediator and protect her friend, which I can 100% respect. But he came off as really aggressive and condescending. He threatened to assault me after I told my ex that I was getting upset and wanted space, and he insulted my intelligence and my worth. This is where I finally drew the line, and I decided to block both her and her roommate. Before I did that, I told my ex how upset I was with her over how she didn’t handle this properly at all, that she should’ve told me she was overwhelmed and I would’ve definitely given her space, and that I was mad she never apologized for anything she did without me having to ASK her for an apology. Meanwhile, I went out of my way to confront where I wronged her and I apologized frequently. 

That was about two weeks ago now, and I have no intention of reaching out to her again. I did unblock her so she doesn’t even have the power of being blocked, and in case she wants to finally apologize in the future. But frankly I doubt she will. I’m at the point where I miss her but I don’t want her anymore, but more importantly I want to be able to not beat myself up over what I did. I’ve felt so guilty recently, it’s been eating away at me. I feel like I have a tendency to blame myself a bit too much, but I know I definitely fucked up. And I want to be able to accept what she did too, I want to stop being so mad with her. I want to understand that a lot of the shit that we did to each other is inexcusable, but it is worth noting that we are both starting down our paths towards self love. I want to accept the ways I wronged her and wronged myself, in the hope that one day soon I can let go and bury this pain. Thoughts?

Thank you!",10Dec2020,1

922,"I am (17F) graduating this year and currently enrolled in online schooling. My school year is divided into 4 semesters where I take two courses in 2 week intervals ie. one class for 2 weeks, other class for 2 weeks for a total of 22 school days per course. For seniors, the only course I must take to graduate is english, which I already have. In theory, I can graduate perfectly fine as long as I get 3 more elective credits. Here's the issue. I am currently taking chemistry and I am absolutely disinterested. I am also registered in a biology course at some point in the future but I doubt it will keep me interested to even learn. I think it may only be for STEM courses as I have taken a cooking and world issues class which I have really enjoyed. Humanities (history, music/art, social sciences, etc) have always been more interesting to me. 

I spend a lot of my in class time recording the lessons while I lie down playing on my switch because I feel absolutely no pull to even pay attention. It's confusing and I lack a lot of foundation from earlier grades (pandemic cut my grade 11 chemistry course in half). Of course my attitude towards school does not help, and I realise maybe I wouldn't be so confused if I actually paid attention. It feels so draining and I just do not want to learn the material. The teacher keeps mentioning this stuff will be useful in university. Yeah, maybe to students going into some sort of STEM program. I am currently planning on going into music for trombone, but the thought of uni drains me even more. 

I want to drop my chemistry (and possibly biology) course so badly, but I know my mom would not agree. At this point, I am too apathetic to really even care about the consequences besides the fact I may be screwing myself over in the future. I once wanted to go into environmental science, but my math grade has already closed that door, and the content in chemistry is not stimulating at all, so I have pretty much given up on environmental science. I honestly don't know what to do and where to go from here. None of my peers have been able to give reasonable advice besides relating to how fucked this year has been academically and how confused they are about the future, which doesn't really help the anxiety circulating it all. 

Should I drop the course, and deal with the consequences, or should I tough it out despite it maybe not even mattering in the end? How should I try to help this growing negativity and apathy towards school? I graduate in a couple months and I just want it to be over so badly I feel antsy.",10Dec2020,1
923,"TL;DR at the bottom.

My brother is a senior in high school and impossible to figure out what to get for Christmas. He LOVES roller coasters. By that I mean, he has watched nearly every video available on YouTube and read articles and watched videos from other sites all about roller coasters. (When I ride next to him on a coaster, he shouts fun facts at me over the rushing wind). He is planning to study mechanical engineering with a career goal to be a roller coaster designer.

He is involved with every leadership high school club imaginable so he is pretty busy. In his infrequent downtime, he plays video games like NHL and Minecraft. 

We have purchased the Planet Coaster video game for him already, but that's the only thing on his list. We considered a season pass to near by amusement parks. Unfortunately, we are concerned he wouldn't be able to use it due to COVID-19 and we are kind of stuck in limbo for that idea.

Are there other games / activities / camps we could consider getting for him or getting a membership for a person like him with his interests?

Advice from other coaster designers or coaster fanatics or mechanical engineers would be much appreciated!

925,So for backstory I’m a black 17M who’s always had depression but in my family they don’t believe in mental illness (even though my aunt has Down syndrome and lives with us) so there’s no point of bringing it up to my parents nor to anyone else so I just act happy go lucky and spontaneous( basically you’d never know I was depressed unless specifically stated) During July I started talking to this girl and she genuinely made me feel happy and still does and eventually I met her parents when I took her on a date on night and they were nice and they reminded me of my parents and I didn’t know why. Well starting on November first she told me that she has depression and her parents aren’t making it better because the mother is a control freak and the father just listens. Now I’m not good at giving advice so I jus try my best and now all she ever talks about is how she hates it there and how she can’t wait to leave and I try to comfort her but  it’s just really draining like every time I ask her how’s her day she just goes into the typical rant about how she hates it there and how she can’t wait to leave. We both are in high school in the same grade and I tell her just finish high school because we are almost done but it just goes in one ear and out the other. Before this she was really engaging in conversations and just a fun person to be around but it’s gotten to the point where almost every conversation is about how much she hates it there and honestly it’s really just draining and I don’t know what to do.

928,"Hi,

Recently has been a very difficult time for me, I am 19 and haven't faced many mental health problems but I am now at a point where i feel extremely overwhelmed.

I have developed an extreme fear of the idea of death, this is both the idea of the everlasting darkness and emptiness of death after you die alongside a fear that a family member of mine may die soon. I have lost sleep and appetite as my mind is only orientated around this idea of death. I try to distract myself but its near impossible that this thought doesnt come back soon. Epsically now with Covid being around, it appears every 24 hours you get the update of how real death is.

I feel like mostly any issue in life in fixable, i.e reparing a car, fixing a relationship, working towards stopping an addiciton. But any way i try to approach this idea of death, it isnt a fixable issue. Death is going to occur regardless and the idea of this is terrifying me.

Essentially, I am reaching out to see if anyone themselves has been through this and what has helped them. Frankly, I am desperate and need help with this issue. I've been in contact with a counselor but the weekly sessions have been meeting my needs and my fear isn't getting any better,

930,"This is a long and complicated family saga so thanks in advance for reading and I rly appreciate any advice.

Me (33f) and my half-sister (21f) didn’t grow up together and only have developed a relationship in the past few years. There’s a big age gap between us and we are very very different but at the same time I really care about her and want to help her.

I had no relationship with our dad for most of my life and was raised by my mom. Our dad had a lot of problems when he was younger (why I did not have a relationship with him) but actually has become super successful in the past 10 years in business and is doing well. He got in touch with me a few years ago and now we’ve made up and aren’t close but have a decent relationship. He has a lot of flaws but he does try at least somewhat. 

My sister was raised by her mom but did have more contact with our dad. He lived in another country from her but they’d see each other a few times a year for some visits and trips and he always paid child support for her. She also went to live with him a few times here and there. That being said, I definitely was the luckier sister in the sense I was raised in a safe, middle class home, had a good childhood, finished school and went to university, have had some issues but nothing major and now have a career that is going well and a really supportive husband.

She on the other hand dropped out of high school when she was very young, dealt with a lot of emotional and physical abuse growing up from her mother and is now engaged to her boyfriend (21m) and pregnant. Neither of them have finished high school or gone to college and they both haven’t been able to hold down jobs because of mental health issues. Both of them have mothers who are alcoholics and they currently live rent-free with a family member. 

Along with finding out my sister is pregnant, I also recently found out she is making porn online (I assume to make money). Since she doesn’t work all her energy seems to go to her social media and she has actually amassed a big following of tens of thousands. She has a real e-girl persona online and dresses in heavy makeup, crazy hair, cosplay costumes, etc. I know it’s super common in that subculture to be doing camgirl/ porn stuff but at the same time I don’t think it’s healthy for her since I know she’s struggled a lot with her mental health and has had a lot of traumatic experiences. I found it pretty easily and don’t think she’s rly trying to hide it that well — I look at her social media sometimes and it took about 5 clicks for me to find links to her porn Twitter and OnlyFans. That being said, most of the family doesn’t use social media and I think I’m the only one who knows about it. 

I’m really torn up and I don’t know what to do. She’s really excited about having a baby and I’m trying to be positive, supportive and hope for the best but there are so many red flags. My dad doesn’t use social media at all and has no idea about this whole online persona of hers or the porn stuff. He seems to think she’s okay, probably bc he doesn’t see what she’s posting online. She’s also gotten mad at me before for being judgemental and acting like her mother and refused to talk to me for short periods which makes having a good conversation about this tough.

The number one thing I’m worried about is her drinking, smoking/ vaping and smoking weed while she’s pregnant and I feel I need to do everything I can to make sure this baby is healthy and safe. She tries to be responsible and has a good heart but I don’t think the ppl around her are a good influence. 

I don’t know if I should tell my dad what’s going on, or talk to her, or just leave things. I also don’t know what any of us can really do since she’s very headstrong.

932,"So i lived with my mom for about seven years and would see my dad and my stepmom every other weekend. I have two older brothers  one who is nineteen lets call him joe and the other is 14 lets call him Quan then theres me im twelve years old the baby and only girl. So being the youngest and only girl i was obviously spoiled. But thing is my mom barley worked she had off and on relationships, smoked, drank, and we moved around a lot.  

So about three years ago my brother Quan said hey I want a better life lets go live with dad and I was like bet. ( Joe was are already living with my dad and stepmom) So we went through the whole court process and me and Quan were never there at court but we met with our lawyers and told them what we wanted. So from what my dad and step mom told me my mom didnt show up and barley fought for us. 

So we ended up coming to live with my dad. So my dad dosent want me and Quan to see my mom until were 18 because he thinks were mentally not ready. I agree that we might not be ready to see my mom this exact moment but six years thats a little much. So my biological mom has three brothers all of who have boys so before we came to live with my dad and stepmom we found out my tia  was pregnant and with a GIRL!! So at first i was like shit a girl im the only girl but then i was like okay im gonna have a prima.  The first few months my mom called a bit but I was pissed she didnt show up at court so i refused to talk to her and we saw her like twice. So here I am now twelve about to be thirteen and i havent seen any of that family for at least two years. And I REALLY wanna see them. Ive asked my dad when can i see my family ( not including my mom because I cant till im 18)  And he said till they call to see or talk to me. The thing is when you dont live or see ur family constantly they end up only calling on special occasions. So im pissed with my dad and stepmom and refuse to not give attitude to them. So my questions are:

Do I have a right to be mad at them?

Should I see my other side of the family? 

Should I even miss them?

So i blame my stepmom and dad?

937,"For context, I am a 16 year old girl. I know how absolutely ridiculous this post is, and how stupid, overemotional, and overreactive I am being. Trust me, I know. But I can’t stop feeling the way I do. Also, I should probably mention that there will be spoilers for the Maze Runner series below, if anyone is concerned about it. 

For what must be over four years now, I have been, quite frankly, in love with the character Newt from the Maze Runner. I’m talking romantic fanfiction. I’m talking crying at his death scene for years and years on end, shedding more tears over it than possibly anything else in my life. I’m talking attaching myself to this dude to an unhealthy degree - treating him as a confidant of sorts, someone who I can always, always go back to, always remind myself of to calm me down and to help me through things.

I also have OCD. For many years, I have had obsessive and compulsive thoughts and behaviours that have affected my life massively, and I have spent way too many waking moments stressing about specific things in OCD fashion. The subject of my OCD has changed over the years, but it has remained a constant obstacle in my life (however, I am doing a lot better now - I am seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist, and taking medication. I am doing better than I have for many years). 

Throughout my journey with OCD, the Maze Runner’s Newt has always been there, as insane and ridiculous and cringey and stupid as that sounds. When I’m having a bad OCD or anxiety spiral or am sad or anxious, I can think about him. I can think about a romantic scenario with him, daydreaming to steer my thoughts away. Even when I am happy, I can think of scenarios, of stories and of a myriad of unrealistic and ridiculous romances with him, and become happier and more content at the thought of him. I write cringey wattpad self insert fanfiction. I read cringey wattpad self insert fanfiction. All of this has been going on for four years, ever since I was an even cringeier twelve to thirteen year old.

The point is, this character is incredibly important to me. My stupid, cringey love of him has helped me through difficulties, has shaped me into the stupid, cringey teenage girl I am today (admittedly, however, I do hope that I am slightly less cringey than my thirteen year old self, who did all this far more frequently and without a touch of irony).

Yesterday, though, the author revealed that after  over ten years since the release of the first book, he believes Newt to be gay (although it is  implied that this is retrospective, and was not the author’s original intention, but something that has become clear to him after he finished the books and understands the character more deeply). I am extremely ashamed to say that I have shed many a tear since this announcement. But that makes me feel like an asshole. Because, of course, I am so, so glad to have some LGBTQ+ representation in a series I adore, and which completely lacks it. The world needs more LGBTQ+ diversity and representation in its media, and it’s incredible that this series has embraced that.

However, it feels disingenuous. It has been over a decade since the release, and the author (James Dashner) said this only in a reply tweet, because he was called out on not having enough LGBTQ+ representation in the Maze Runner series. It is pretty likely and almost obvious that he admitted this for the clout and to get money and sell his new book (which, incidentally, is about Newt, but I do not think touches upon his sexuality (I haven’t read it yet, but I don’t know why he would make an announcement if it’s already in a book that has been released for months, and I have not heard anyone discussing his sexuality being mentioned in the book)), which is horrible. If you want representation in your books, be a decent human being and write it. Don’t get the credit and clout for having diversity in your books, without actually having to write a gay character (it’s almost like J.K Rowling in that these authors want recognition for diversity without actually having to put diversity in their books, even though diversity is EXTREMELY important).

Also, the Maze Runner author James Dashner is a pretty massive dickhead and a horrible person. He has been accused of sexual assault multiple times (and has pretty much confirmed it to be true) which is disturbing and awful to say the least. So, I feel dirty congratulating this man on his diversity and his “brave admission” when it’s clear he’s not a good man, and is only adding representation when it benefits him, and for clout and money. I feel bad liking his books a lot of the time, because he is such a bad person, but I think it’s acceptable to love his books and characters without supporting him in any way, just like with J.K Rowling. I also downloaded the audiobook for his new book for free, so as not to give him a cent of my money. 

But of course, his announcement of Newt’s sexuality hurts on a more personal note. I’m upset. I have imagined many a life in many a scenario with this character, and my love of him has supported me greatly over the years. I don’t want him to be gay, because I want to be able to dream of a romantic relationship with him in my head, as I have done for the last four years (side note: yes, I know this is cringey, I know it’s embarrassing, but I really hope I’m not the only one who creates romantic scenarios with fictional people in their heads). 

But now, I’m so confused about it. Is it ethical? Am I invalidating the character’s sexuality by thinking of him as straight? Am I being a terrible person by wanting this much needed LGBTQ+ character representation to be straight? Am I being homophobic? That’s the last thing I want! Can I still write fanfiction? Do I leave my unfinished fanfictions be? Do I continue them? 

How can I be happy knowing that someone I love would never love me, even in a fantasy scenario? How can I relax knowing that if I think of comfort scenarios I revert back to when I’m sad might be homophobic and unethical?

Any help is wanted. Is it unethical and homophobic? Can I still write fanfiction with a female love interest? How do I get over my dumb and ridiculous feeling of absolute heartbreak?

TLDR; (though I think reading the entire post and its details would make more sense) My favourite character whom I love and adore and has been a place of comfort romantically for me throughout both tough and easy times throughout my life has been revealed to be gay. I am uneasy and conflicted, and I need advice about how to continue with my life.

One last time, I know how cringey and stupid this post is. I know it’s ridiculous. I know self insert romance fanfiction is stupid and fantasy romance with fictional characters is even worse. Trust me, I know, but I still feel upset, which is annoying, to say the least.",10Dec2020,1
938,"I was trying to do my boyfriends laundry while he was at work and I think I broke his washing machine and nothing will dry

So basically I’m visiting my boyfriend for a week and wanted to do his laundry while he was at work. So I started with his comforter because I thought it would be nice for him to come home and sleep in clean bedding.

So I wash it as I have before. Go downstairs when it is finished to take it out of the washer and the washer is filled with water. So I squeeze everything out to the best of my ability and put it in the dryer for 110 minutes. The washer is still broken, but if I can dry the bedding he’ll be more understanding 


So I come after the 110 minutes and the blanket is still soaking wet. I’m freaking out at this point. I put it on for another 110 minutes. I don’t know what to do. He won’t be home for 10 more hours.

Oh, and did I mention he shares a basement with other people in the condo? So I didn’t only ruin his washer and dryer, I ruined other peoples. 

How do I get the blanket dry? I really have nowhere to hang it and he doesn’t have a blow dryer. I flew here so I don’t have a car or anything and the city isn’t big enough to have Uber.
