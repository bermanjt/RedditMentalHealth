0,"I have been friends with a person for quite awhile now and we both have younger children. She has a child with developmental issues. My son asked “why is he so obnoxious?” Because he honestly is and children don’t understand that you can’t just say stuff like that. I told him it was not a nice thing to say but my friend said “why are you so obnoxious?” I just kind of looked at her like wtf but then moved on and we left shortly. Then when we got home my son was crying that he doesn’t have any friends which was random because he hasn’t been anywhere where that would be an issue because of the virus and even when he was at school friends were never a problem as he always had plenty and got along with everyone. I think his issues May have been related to what my friend said. Now I’m not really sure what to do as she obviously felt justified in saying that to my son since he said something about her child who she is protective of. But I honestly don’t want to see her again if that’s how she thinks she can talk to my child. At the same time I don’t want to throw away a decade long friendship over an impulsive comment. 

TLDR my friend insulted my child and I’m not sure what to do",24May2020,1
2,"I apologize if this isn’t the forum to post this to, just let me know and I’ll remove it.

This is really hard for me to post, I just don’t know what to do. My parents both are recovering alcoholics. They already have a lot of issues I won’t get into, so when they drink, it’s just awful. 
They’ve NEVER touched a drop of alcohol my whole life because they wanted better for me, but once like seven years ago they slipped up for the first time. It was a hot mess.
Recently however they’ve both started slipping up. It’s been almost a year of random slip ups, and they refuse to talk to me about it after the fact.
They also always drag me into it to try and help, and I can’t say no because I always feel bad leaving my mom to deal with my drunk dad or my dad to deal with my drunk mom. I’m the peacemaker usually, and that’s even stopped working recently and it makes it worse. 
I’m honestly scared they’re going to end up hurt, in jail, or  dead and I just don’t know what to do.
How do you go about talking to a alcoholic who is in denial? Have any of you gotten your family help that was stubborn at first?  How did you make them *or how did you get yourself* to realize how serious it was getting? 
Any information on how maybe I can talk to them about this will help. Thank you ❤️",24May2020,1
4,"I’m 17 &amp; i have an abusive mom &amp; a dad that’s not really in my life. Anyways, I’m pretty much a happy person in general and I don’t let their toxic past affect me. But, my mom seems to take out her anger and all he unresolved issues on me ALL the time! It’s like everything that goes wrong it’s always my fault. Or I’m called a liar, piece of shit, bitch, etc and she will physically try and hit me, or even get mad and tell me to get out (I have no where else to go). And I’m honestly just so sick of it. There’s days where I contemplate suicide, but I know I’m way better than that. I’m supposed to be going away to college in the fall (hopefully) &amp; I’m really can’t wait for that because I won’t have to be home.

5,"So I was walking home one day, before this corona situation, and this guy and his friend started coming near me and said I’m fit which was weird just because for the most of my life I have been overweight. I’ve never been obese or anything but I’ve just never been skinny. I just didn’t know how to react to the situation so I just walked away. Was he just making fun of how I look? I mean, he didn’t look like he was being mean but considering the situation I don’t know.",24May2020,1

8,"I dont know if I'm over exaggerating or if it's a valid feeling, but I had this teacher in middle school who taught my favorite class. Everyone loved him and he was literally the coolest. He is 30 and I'm a 20 year old female. I started going to this church group where we would get together and sing and he was there. It was super cool being able to sing with my friends and meet new people AND my favorite middle school teacher was there. It was really cool and great. I'm still connected with this group of friends, they're all so nice and good people. We're all around the same age (early to mid and late 20s.) This group always wants to get together again and we have a group chat where we plan to do zoom sessions and live video chats. Well everytime I post on my social media my old middle school teacher always slides up and says nice things like ""you're so beautiful! We need to hang out sometime!"" And usually i say ""yeah I've been so busy!"" To not get his hopes up and kinda shut down the idea, but he always says ""oh well what days do you work?"" And ""how about the weekend?"" He knows I have a boyfriend so I will usually say I have plans with my boyfriend and he keeps perusing to where I just read it and dont say anything. Today he posted a pic of his new car on the group chat and everyone was replying to it. He was saying we should all go somewhere in it because it's a large SUV and all i said was ""wow nice car"" because everyone was saying stuff in the chat and now hes back in my dms, direct messaging me asking if I wanna go somewhere with him and he can pick me up. I kinda just ignored it. He also followed me on Instagram and liked a picture of me in my bathing suit which was sorta awkward. I noticed he follows all the other females he had in middle school and even liked some of an acquaintance's inappropriate pictures she posted of her stripping at a club on her spam. I've tried to give strong vibes towards him that I dont want to hang out with him exclusively but he keeps trying and it's weird. Am I overreacting?",24May2020,1

10,"So we have a neighbor who lives a couple houses over in a rental (I own my house).  The people who live there are a family with a teenage  ish male that does the following

1. Revs his engine throughout the day .  I asked him nicely to stop now he does it to be a dick
2. Drives too fast in our neighborhood
3. Has loud conversations in the driveway at all hours of the night
4. Has noisy friends over at all hours (even during quarantine its been like a fricking hostel over there

Talking to these people doesn’t seems to help and I know that at least two other neighbors despise these degenerates.

I’m just not sure what to do to try and get this remedied.  Should i try to figure out who the landlord is?  Call the cops? Send them a box of gummy dicks?

Help would be greatly appreciated on this one",24May2020,1
11,"Pre COVID - I have an older more established professional friend who offered me to stay at her place and study and take one of my exams. I wasn’t suppose to arrive till late April and my exam was in June. I didn’t want to go home so I was super tempted. I asked her how much rent would be and she said nothing, come save some money. 

Flash forward. COVID-19 happened and she was afraid of travel bans so I ended driving 1500 miles in late March to stay with her, her partner and kid.

Flash forward it is now almost the end of May. There is no denying it I am feeling uncomfortable. I am also pretty sure I am very depressed and stressed because I’ve gotten a lot of school work. I rarely come out of my room but I also have a ton of stuff to do. I don’t really use the kitchen. I take out the recycling and trash. 

I also feel guilty about eating their  food. Which is why I rarely eat or use their kitchen.  I already felt uncomfortable. There’s already barely any room in their fridge for me to buy my own food. 

I started to feel weird about two weeks ago when I felt like my friend was way more tense and agitated and snappish and would often ignore me. Stopped offering me anything in their home. 

The other day friend hired professional cleaners cleaners. I was a bit aghast. She didn’t like the job the professional cleaners did and then I realized how particular she is. I was planning on offering her money for the professional cleaners but the icing on top is that I’ve never been able to find a private moment between me and her. I don’t know what to say - I am afraid. 

Her partner made a comment this morning about how he didn’t want to live in close quarters with anyone right now who wasn’t immediate family after friend started discussing camping trip with  another family with him. I was right there. I felt like that was a jab. 

I know at this point I need to have a serious conversation with the friend about how much I appreciate what theyve done for me and I’ve stayed with them a long time and times are tough - so I want to give her money for how long I’ve stayed and thank her for opening up her home to me   - and let her know I’ll be out in 1 week. I found some temporary situations and will be staying there until my exam. 

I guess I need some advice and encouragement about how to bring up this up to my friend. I for some reason at very afraid and anxious. It is almost easier for me to leave and leave behind a sparking clean room and card with money and gifts. But I know it would confuse her so I need to actually have an actual conversation and how to create this conversation because every opening I’m looking for always gets delayed. Like last night I bought cheese curds, beer, pizza and booze but they had company stayed so late that I wasn’t able to say anything or find the perfect moment to get her alone. Please help me from feeling so overwhelmed and anxious and I guess how to create these openings. 


She could either refuse my money or she could tell me everything’s fine and freak out about me going somewhere else during COVID-19 because I don’t know anyone else in the state excluding her. Idk how to be honest or form the words.",24May2020,1
13,We were talking on the phone the other night and he said “I have to use the bathroom.” It really disturbed me because I imagined him pooping. I’ve had a problem with pooping and stuff like that since I was younger and I’d rather not picture people pooping. I’ve been disturbed since then. It disturbs me to think he pooped that night in the middle of the call. What should I do to get over this? It’s really bothering me.,24May2020,1
14,"We’ve been friends for about two years now. We live in different countries but we’ve only ever spoke through discoed and another site. He’s been through a lot the past year. Both parents died. He inherited his dads real estate company and is only 19. He’s constantly stressed out with having to take care of both his younger and older siblings. Trying to manage a company and also applying for unis while managing a relationship. 

I’ve helped him through a lot and have given him advice that he’s used to make his life easier. He’s easily one of my best friends and we’d do anything for eachother honestly. Thing is, just recently he hasn’t been active for two weeks. He last told me he was taking time off work to focus on himself and because he felt he earned a break from all the stress. He said this would give him more time to speak with me too which was good. He hasn’t spoken once. 

I know very little information. I know the names of his siblings and the city he lives but that’s it. Idk his surname. Idk how to find him or his siblings. I need to know how I can figure this out. How I can get help and how I can find out if he’s alive or not. With all he’s been through it wouldn’t surprise me if he killed himself. He’s told me he wouldn’t but he does have moments where he doesn’t think his life will work out. I just wish if he had killed him self that he’d tell me before hand.

19,"So we (I, 19M, and my parents 57F and 56M) just had a tornado warning in the county. It's canceled now, just a severe thunderstorm. We're getting the worst of it.

I talked to my mom about how relieving it is that we don't have to get the dogs and the cats downstairs to the basement since they're separated. She laughed at me and said the cats are on their own. I didn't explode or anything, but I just glared and said it wasn't funny, and she said she didn't want the cats to freak our and to have the dog barking.

Our cats are about 1, 8, and 16. The 16 year old cat came from my grandmother on my dad's side, and the 1 year old cat was a birthday present for my dad. 

My dad still mourns his grandmother and is upset about giving or throwing away her things, and he has a short temper. There have been periods of time when he's been rather explosive, though few and far out.

My mom's essentially implying we're willing to sacrifice the cats' lives just to not listen to barking. I'd like to convince her otherwise but who knows. Instead of working to train the dog to not charge at the cats every time he sees them (not to attack, but to play. He's frustrated over the gate we permanently have up), we separated them, and the 8yo and 16yo cats have been stuck upstairs for two years now. If it helps, the dog is a 4 year old German Shepherd so he definitely is vicious-looking, but he's scared of walking on/getting toys off of vents. I can't imagine how furious my dad would be if he knew my mom was willing to let his mother's cat and his birthday present die (and our 8 year old cat, too, obviously), and I can only imagine it leading to a heated divorce.

There's been little talk of letting the dog upstairs over the weekends and making sure the cats have a place to hide.

But I don't know. I'm pretty livid that my mom would rather let the cats die than to listen to barking. Any suggestions on how to deal with this?",24May2020,1
20,"I got married in January and hired a crappy photographer from Costa Rica (location of wedding).  As soon as I paid, this guy started dodging my calls and has broken all of the contract timelines set by HIM regarding pictures and photos deadlines.  I recently received the photos from him, but looking at them and comparing to the originals, he did nothing in editing; which is supposed to be part of the package.  

It's been 4 months and I have YET to receive the video that I paid extra for.

Any advice?  How can I at least review this guy?  He had a facebook that you could post a review on, but I saw that he got a few negative reviews from other people and looks like he took them down.

21,"I’m 14F, living in the Midwest of USA. My religious parents are making me go to a Lutheran private school despite knowing I’m an atheist - even an anti-theist. They have a strict dress code, which I’ll roughly outline below. 

Things that aren’t allowed:
• Distressed jeans, wearing jeans on days that don't end in 4
• Messy or dyed hair, “messy” clothing
• Non ear piercings or tattoos 
• Hats and sunglasses
• Sagging or form fitting clothes
• Sweatpants, joggers, leggings
• Blue denim 
• Flip flops, slides, crocs 
• Shorts (though boys are allowed to wear them)
• “Casual Graphic T-Shirts/Screen Print T’s as well as long and short crew neck T-shirts
are not allowed (Examples include sports team shirts, spirit T’s, [school initials] camp and club shirts)”

I’m planning to get my ears pierced (I already have them lobe pierced which was done when I was a baby) several more times, my hair is dark brown and I might dye parts of it black since it’s technically a “natural” color, I’ll wear rings, bracelets, chokers, basically anything that isn’t seen as “ladylike”, “classy”, “formal” and “modest”, but isn’t technically against their rules. I already paint my nails black on a regular basis, and though I usually don’t wear much makeup I’ll probably do some black eyeliner. 

I’ve also bought a bunch of Flying Spaghetti Monster merchandise (R’Amen). What else can I wear to generally disappoint my parents and gain the disapproval of the school staff?

Note: I honestly don’t usually try to be all “EdgYyYy” and “SpeCiLalall” and “QuIiRKy” but this is my personal way of having some fun at a stricter place than I’m used to. You know, teenage jackassery and all.",24May2020,1
22,"So my stepdad (60M) married my mom (47F) when i was like 12-13 or something I’m (20F) and i still live with them because i go to a university and can’t afford to live on my own. I grew up without a dad and it really didn’t bother me, eventually my mom started dating and i didn’t like it because i was so used to it being me, her and my brother. Eventually she met my stepdad and they started dating... back then i knew i wasn’t going to like him. So we moved in with him by that time my brother moved out so it was just me. I hated it Bc i hated his house and i had no one my age around. Eventually they had a house built and we moved. When we moved this is when everything changed. My mom started acting way different and was super strict and i couldn’t do anything. She started being mean and eventually got on medication and things so it calmed down. But my mom wasn’t like this and I’m convinced my stepdad has brainwashed and brainwashed her into thinking I’m such a bad person. He always tries to say I’m lying and accuses me of things but he puts in a joking manner(like smoking weed or having weed in my car or in the house)  but i can tell he’s serious because he says the same things ALL the time. He keeps talking about how I smell like weed or I have weed in my room, or when I laugh too much that I’m high. He’s even got my mom believing it and she tried to scare me by saying she’ll drug test me. I don’t smoke weed obviously. I always catch him staring at girls butts in public or even just staring at them (girls my age or young looking). He makes weird jokes and just seems like a pervy to me. Anyway eventually him and my mom got into this big fight and he called her a “bitch” and i listen to the way he talks to her and treats her and I just hate it. He’s said so many things that i can’t forget about. When i turned 19 he gave me his car and bought me a MacBook. Of course i appreciated and thanked him. But other day me and my mom were in the car and she told me i needed to “include him in things” because i only talk to her really and show her things. I tried explaining to her that i don’t see us being close because i went so long without a father that i don’t want him trying to fill that spot. Then she tried to guilt trip me by mentioning all the things he’s bought me and gave me including the car. Like i said i appreciate everything but this won’t make me like him more. His own children don’t talk to him really and one of them pretty much hates him and has him blocked. I feel like my mom wants me to be close with him because his own children aren’t. Sometimes my mom will even call him “my dad” which I really don’t like. I try to not say anything and be nice to him. But my mom keeps trying to force us to be close. I don’t entirely hate him or anything he just weirds me out and i don’t like him that much at times. I never complain because i want my mom to be happy but I’m tired of her complaining to me about it. I’m tired of hearing “you need to talk to him” and “go ask your stepdad”. I feel like my mom wants me to kiss the ground he walks on because he has bought me things. When he does anything for me i say thank you. But what should i do ? Every time i talk to my mom about she just tries to guilt trip me about the things he’s bought me. Keep in mind this isn’t even the HALF but this was already long and i didn’t want to make it too long.

23,"My (35F) Sisters-in-law, A, (39), appears to be having a mental break of some kind. We are in FL and as Corona got serious and we shut things down, the odd, secretive behavior became worse. One big example was as Shelter in Place started, she didn’t tell anyone, left her two children and husband, and drove to Savannah, GA for the weekend. She turned off her phone and didn’t answer any calls or texts for about 7 hours. Around 10:30 pm that night, she returned texts - very brief - and said, “just needed some “me time” and took a drive. I’m in Georgia now and staying overnight.” It took teeth pulling to find out she was at a cute hotel in Savannah and stayed Friday and Saturday night, returning Sunday. She wouldn’t give any details of why or what happened. We were all extremely worried. She has a family history of mental illness and suicide, including her parents. 

A few other things have happened, but this next one is what I need advice on. She has planned another “semi-secret trip.” It’s a possibly 7 day road trip to NYC up the east coast from FL. She’s only taking her 18 year old who will graduate next week. She’s leaving next Saturday, rented a vehicle, and we have no idea outside of those details what’s going on.

Problem is, she has really been ignoring things like wearing a mask, social distancing, etc. I have a compromised immune system and so does my partner. We’ve discussed this with her and she just laughs it off. This trip has us very worried. Everyone coming to FL from the tri-state area is supposed to self isolate for 14 days. She has no plan to do this. 

Do you advise we ask her and her family to not visit for the next 14 days once they return? I feel pretty strongly about this but have a hard time telling people things like this. Would love advice.",24May2020,1

26,"Kind of long but PLEASE read!! So I’m a part time supervisor at UPS, self employed makeup artist on the side. My coworker from UPS asked me to do her makeup for the second time. The first time I did her makeup I gave her a VERY discounted rate, as I did this time. Both times I only charged her $50 trying to hook her up because she’s my coworker and she’s also best friends with my cousin (who is also both of our coworkers). I would charge anyone else $80 which is standard. And usually it has to be very worth it for me to accept a client if it means I have to wake up on the weekend after 5 long shifts and only 2 hours of sleep. (The case both times) and then you have to take into account the time spent cleaning brushes, the cost of product used, my travel to you etc etc. Luckily she only lives just down the road from me. Anyway I was happy to do this for her again especially because last time I did her makeup, I was so tired that I forgot to put blush on her and I felt bad about it even though she must not have noticed. So she loved her makeup today just as she did last time. I even offered to let her hold on to the lipstick I used on her for touch ups if she could just give it back to me at work on Monday. Right as I’m about to leave she asked how much she owed me, I said $50 is fine same as last time. She then asked if she could give me split payments, like $25 today and $25 next week when we get paid, because she’s low on money right now. I said ok that’s fine honestly I just wanted to get home. But the more I think about it the more I feel taken advantage of. Why couldn’t she have been transparent and asked me if that was okay before I had already done her makeup? And now it’s been 4 hours since I left her house and I still haven’t even received the $25. I’m all for helping people out as a matter of fact I sent my best friend and aunt a combined $200 for groceries about a month ago and haven’t even thought about asking for repayment, because they lost their jobs due to COVID-19. The thing is though, this coworker still lives with her parents, makes over $18 an hour and $400 a week just like me, didn’t have to pay for her college or her car, has no kids, she literally has zero responsibilities and no known hardships. If she didn’t have $50 to spend you would think she would’ve not gotten her makeup done or would have asked in advance if she could pay the money later. I’m not her mom, or even her friend, for her to ask such a favor. But on the other hand I’m not hurting for money and I feel like she’s bound to pay me eventually because we work together and she’s friends with my cousin (also I know where she lives lol). Any opinions on this matter would be much appreciated!!",24May2020,1
27,"Meet him when we were freshmen in high school 13 years ago. The one constant we've had is playing online. We'd hang out but we're but more comfortable indoors where we can unwind. But recently it just feels like he's actively avoiding me now. There's this guy he became friends with our senior year of high school who is now basically family to him cuz he married his cousin and had kids with. Never really liked the guy that much. So with that guy I've pretty much already moved on from. Don't care for him anymore. But now my best friend is very wishy-washy with me. One day he can be asking me to get on Xbox and play and then he can ignore me when I text him for days. Get that we both have kids and priorities but it's not like he can't play or anything cuz I know he's playing just has his status as offline so I can't tell he's playing. And he's playing with this other friend. Just annoying cuz my best friend and I moved from PS4 to Xbox and made plans to play Halo and Gears and just have fun and as soon as we do, this other guy becomes very possessive and doesn't like that I'm playing with him. Worse is that my best friend and I could be playing then he'll drop everything and go running to play with this guy. Like screw me right? The worst thing my best friend did was move from here Illinois to Texas cuz that's where his wife is from. And he didn't even say bye or anything. Found out a year after he left. That really hurt cuz I didn't even get a bye. So now playing online with him is the only way I can ever spend time with him but he's acting up. Just don't know what to do. Maybe just take myself out of the friendship and let them be? Cuz I know it's selfish to ask him to cut off his friend cuz they're basically family. Just sucks cuz if I did, they wouldn't care or ask why I'm upset.",24May2020,1

38,"Hi. I’ve been struggling with finding joy in my life. 
I often feel sad, defeated and really lonely. 
I’m from a small town where everyone knows everyone and even worse my family owns a business that I can’t escape. 
I love my family and our business but I can’t find the heart to be around. 
My boyfriend lives across the country and I haven’t seen him in person in 3 months. 
I’m broke because of being furloughed and I’m just trying my hardest to keep it together. 
My boyfriend has had it with me being angry and just down right depressed all the time. 
I get it. It’s hard to be around someone who is just constantly complaining, constantly crying. 
I’ve lost my light and my love for the world. 
I don’t have any REAL friends I can count on. I don’t feel like any of them are genuine and really care but that’s another story. 
I came here to ask some strangers how they make themselves happy when there’s no one else to turn to. 
What do you do when you’re alone? When you are sobbing tears and you can’t see the next day? 
How do you calm nerves and relax?

One of them even resorted to calling me abusive!

After all I do for them. I gave them a nice home to grow up in. I work my ass off for them but they can't lift a finger for me! I never hit them. They don't know what true abuse even is! I sware they're both delusional and made up this fairytale about me. I'm a good mother!

I've talked to my girl friends about them and they all agree that my daughters are deadbeats. I wanted to be frank with them so I revieled what my friends think and they got all upset. Now they're not talking to me and ignoring me for speaking the truth.

Even before that they weren't keen on hanging out with me. They're so selfish that they can't even see how lonely they make me feel. I don't get to have someone to hang out with during this lockdown but neither of them bother even saying goodmorning! What about my feelings in all this? Do they not matter at all?

43,"We wanted a dog for a while. Suddenly, we get a call from a friend (of a friend) who had this Puggle (Beagle/Pug) for 3 days after adopting him, but they couldn't have him since he was moving. We took him in, but my parents didn't allow him inside at all but instead on the deck because of the shedding and smell. He was a chubby, happy dog (smelled a bit) when he first came into the house who loved to sniff everything.

3 Months on though, he barks at our window every time we are having dinner, when he wants a walk or when he's cold. Our parents get fed up with him, except my brother and I. We try to stay outside with him but that isn't always possible. We give him everything he needs but I just know that he isn't as happy as he could be and we can't develop a strong bond together if he's outside all the time, because it's inevitable that I will need to come inside and leave him. He was such a happy dog beforehand and I don't know what's happened; we take him on walks and socialise him as much as we can but I know that if he was inside he could not do that. Basically, I don't think he's a good fit for my family. 

Other families that don't mind shedding inside their house would be such a great fit for him (due to his breed as well) and I don't think that is us. I'm thinking about shedding light on this to them and trying to find a workaround such as bringing him to a rescue home or having another dog to keep him company (probably not financially ready for that) and finally, after a while, getting a new dog or puppy that is suitable for our home.",24May2020,1

tl;dr
I have over 30 stuff animals that I sleep with every night. I don’t want to let them go but I need to. How do I do this?

———

I have a plethora of stuff animals (at least 30) that I sleep with every night. My father always tells me that I need to get rid of them. Almost every time we talk, he comments about my face. I have breakouts sometimes—also a red face apparently—which I’ve always blamed on puberty doing its job, but now that I think about it, most of my SAs go untouched so they collect dust, so I actually see where he’s coming from now.

However, I can’t bring myself to put them away—not a single one.

I’ve always had a bit of a hoarding problem. When I have to clean my room, I often come across something that use to have value back when I got it, so it makes me scared to throw it away because it use to mean something special to me. I’ve overcome this a little, but with the SAs, I will not budge with them.

I’m not 100% sure, but I’ve come up with 2 possible conclusions as to why:

1) I feel lonely a lot and the SAs gave me comfort during those times. I don’t have a very close relationship with either of my parents. Conversations have always felt awkward and I’d often mumble short sentences or sometimes not even respond at all.

2) Potential attachment issues or hoarding problems.

50,"A little context:

\-In order to do all of my daily tasks at college I bought what I thought at the time was a top of the line HP laptop. Needless to say, looking back now, it was way overpriced and I have the sneaking suspicion that some of my parts were ""lacking"". While this computer is good enough to run what I need in college, it doesn't do everything I want.

With that being said, I have the option of spending \~$1700 on a desktop that would handle literally anything i need it to.... which would leave me with $800 in refund. As much as I want this desktop for its ability to do ""anything"" part of me also feels like I'm just justifying my wasting of money on something not so necessarily important. I don't know if its just selfishness and greed guiding my decision towards buying it or if its actually a good decision to invest in an upgrade. Is the overkill worth it?

Side note: i obviously understand how much of a privilege having money during this crisis is and how much of a not-so-serious problem this is in the grand scheme of things. What I'm more-so worried about is that this is going to serve as a precedent for me deciding to avoid getting what i want/what would make me happy because i would feel like that is selfish and consequently never doing anything I want to do.",24May2020,1
51,"Let me start off my saying I’m 17. Our HAO sent new pool rules to home owners that are completely unfair.

How the hell are teens who are out of school supposed to go to the pool this summer? Most of our parents work 9-5 jobs so we would have to wait for the weekend when everyone and their 3rd cousins are trying to get in also. So ultimately if your under 18 you can kiss your summer goodbye.

She told since I’m 19, I can do whatever if I want to have a relationship with my bio. Mother but I just don’t see myself calling her a second mom. 

My brother and I met met at a location the other day and she was checking up on our lives and giving us motherly tips and talking about the big family on our other side. 

She told her side of the story which didn’t match up with what my mother had told us. 

My bio. mom has been in trouble with her 4-6 six other kids years ago and been taken to court and she had stated, she wanted us back and couldn’t do nothing about it after losing the case. “Y’all were taken from me from (DYFS) and they wanted to.” 

She did talk about our father who eventually died in 2012? He was drug addict and child abuser ( I was told from my mother) my bio. mother didn’t mention but  that he was in and out of prison and was intellectually smart. She saying at least we can move on after many years were missed.

58,"First post on Reddit, and it's exactly what it says on the tin. I should probably provide a bit of context;

I may be a cannibal. I say 'may' because these cannibalistic urges are directed towards one person. I'll get into that a bit later.

I cannot control myself whenever I see something that reminds me of said person, or any sort of raw meat. If I see a butchers, I start drooling. If I see a \[person's favourite animal\], I have to restrain myself from hyperventilating. Recently, everything around me has started reminding me more and more of said person.

The person in question isn't an enemy or coworker or so on so forth; it's someone I have known for a large amount of my life. I consider them a crush, someone I truly love. Whenever I see them, I feel elated. I feel as if I've been brought into a hallucinogenic drug trip, running in a field of daisies. However, they make me hungry.

I've recently had dreams and fantasies of them. (Of course there were sexual ones, but those aren't the focus.) I've dreamt holding them close and gently biting into their neck. I've had fantasies of clenching my teeth around their leg and pulling out a chunk. I can't eat any chewy foods, because they remind me of these fantasies and make me starve.

I don't intend to hurt my crush. I love them to death, and everything I do in my life is dedicated to them. I've practically sold my soul to them, throwing away my life just to see them safe and happy. I know these fantasies will hurt them, and I don't intend on acting on them. I've had many a breakdown in which I long for their flesh.

How do I suppress my cannibalistic urges to avoid hurting them?

(If it makes any difference, they know about my feelings and said urges. They reciprocate them, but our relationship is heavily long distance, so I don't feel as if s/o is a proper title for them.)  
(Note: Unless it's the final option, I won't seek therapy. I have anxiety that won't allow me to say anything that'll even slightly damage my relationship with my therapist, and I'd rather leave it as a last resort.)

60,"tldr; what are some useful resources/hacks, general advice, and preparations (legal, financial, etc) that a kid should make before they move out at 17? (into a converted cargo van)

so ive lived at boarding school for the past two years with the exception of weekends and holidays at home. i originally was really motivated to go because my home life is really detrimental to my mental health (my abusive dad and his abusive gf) and a lot of other areas of my life. when i did come home id work most of the time. so needless to say, i havent spent a lot of the past two years with my family and its done wonders for my mental health (still in a pretty low place but not nearly as bad or consistently as two years ago). 

with this whole quarantine ive been realizing that i really can’t stay in this place. it almost caused me to fail all of my classes (luckily i have amazing teachers and counselors who helped me pass all my classes with Bs and even some As) and is a trigger to me for a lot of unhealthy behaviors and mindsets. my school has already announced that we will continue with online learning during first semester. i realized that living at home would not be a good idea as my grades are really important to me and i want to be able to focus on being my best self instead of fending off my family and exacerbated detrimental behaviors.

i planned on buying a van this summer and working during my senior year to convert it into a mobile home and taking a road trip after my graduation to end up wherever i end up going to college. i figured that if i could buy a van soon, enlist some friends (i have a lot of friends who want to help), and work my ass off i could get it spick and span in time to hit the road or at least move into it and find somewhere to park it away from my father. i could do school and work and just not worry about him all the time. my dad is a little avoidant of his parenting responsibilities and ive been living on my own for the past 2 years so i have a lot of experience with “adulting” like making appointments and big decisions by myself and making sure paper work and chores and whatever needs to get done gets done. i figure stuff out for myself and do it for myself. i havent had a LOT of experience handling money (i have a job and pay for all of my clothes, groceries, hygiene, gas, etc but no bills or stuff like that) but i want to do more research and come up with a plan. 

ive been making some spreadsheets of how many hours i plan on working and what i expect my salary to be and trying to figure out how i can live on that budget in my van and also saving up money (aside from paying for the van itself and conversion) to live during the school year (my work is seasonal and my hours decrease starting in august-september until season ends in november, but i might try to get another job to make money in the winter) and basically after all this explanation im saying i dont know what i dont know and would really appreciate any useful resources/hacks, general advice, and any preparations (financial, legal, documentation, etc) that a 17 year old would forget/not know to make. thanks for being understanding :))",24May2020,1

67,"Mental breakdown at the beginning of a relationship

I’ll try to make the story short. I’ve dealt with several mental health issues my whole life, doctors and psychiatrists can’t quite put a name on it, I’ve been diagnosed with things like bipolar, borderline and cptsd and nobody can really figure it out. The diagnoses that are for sure are adhd, depression and anxiety. 
I was going through a bad depression for about 5 years and using drugs and alcohol to self medicate. I met a man who I thought was the love of my life. We had met in passing before but matched on tinder and it was an instant click from the first date. He was the avoidant type but his shyness  and introverted nature were appealing to me. While we were out our second date I got a call telling my my best friend had been killed in a car accident, 3 weeks later I lost my job and 2 weeks after that my home got broken into and I lost everything of value. I went on a self harming downhill spiral and looking back I now know I had a full on mental breakdown. I was irritable about everything, suicidal and out of control. My now ex wanted to break up a couple of times but I always begged him to stay. It took me a couple of months to get in with a psychiatrist, get put on an anti psychotic and I stopped drinking and doing drugs. I tried everything I could to save my relationship, but it was built in such shaky ground that there was deep lack of trust and respect from both sides. We loved eachother a lot and tried to make it work, but a lot of his actions were so triggering to me that I was a horrible girlfriend. I was mean, clingy, needy, always sad, always angry and always looking for a reason to pick up a fight. Needless to say the relationship ended at around the one year mark. 

I began therapy the week the relationship ended, and enrolled in a DBT program ( dialectical behavioural therapy) a few months after. I’ve spent anywhere from 3 to 6 hours a week working on my traumas, triggers, responses and overall getting myself to a safe place mentally. I am doing really well right now, and I’ve learnt so much. 

The sad part is that now when I look back at my relationship I can see all the things that I did wrong, I can see how toxic I was and how much my trauma was making me into an unbearable person. I see how much pain i must have brought to my ex and it makes me incredibly sad. He’s no saint and I’m not saying the fault was all mine, but a good part of it is and I’m trying to take responsibility for my share ( which really was the majority). I was abusive, I was toxic and acted in ways that could be perceived as manipulative without even realizing it. ( took a lot of therapy to realize what I was doing, why and how to change it in the future).

When I tried to talk to him a month after the breakup, he never replied. And I don’t blame him tbh. I can only imagine the pain I must have put him through. It’s been 8 months since we broke up, and I am in a completely different space mentally and emotionally. I feel like I want to reach out again, but this time just to acknowledge my responsibility in the relationship and apologize. I dated a highly manipulative person before him and I know that maybe even just an apology from that one ex could have helped me not feel like such a piece of shit and wouldn’t have made me so traumatized when it comes to relationships. 

There’s a part of me that hopes we might still have a future and I’m able to right my wrongs, but I’m not counting on it or expecting it. But I feel that if I don’t apologize the guilt might also make it hard for me to move forward with my life, even if that is with someone else. And I might regret it forever if I don’t at least see if there is a little bit of hope.I’m afraid that if I don’t open up with him about all the things I’ve discovered about my actions he might be blaming himself as I’ve done with my own toxic relationships before as well. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Any input or advice would be really appreciated.",24May2020,1
68,"I’m from AZ but currently live in TX. I’ve lived in TX for more of my life but still have some family in AZ and CA. I’m really wanting to go back home! I feel like I need the change and I want the change. I’d also be close to travel to more places that I’d like. My lease is up at the end of July. There are also lots of cons to moving. My job is here, my church, friends that are like family. If I go to AZ I’d be starting completely over and fresh. It sounds nice though... There’s so much that goes into this so I’m just seeking advice. I’m not sure how to decide and if I do move how to tell everyone. Please help!!! 😭",24May2020,1
69,"* PSA LONG STORY 

Me and my boyfriend recently moved into a 1 bedroom apt located at the bottom level of a 3 story home. The entire home is owned by my boyfriends older cousin, and that cousins 2 sons take care of collecting the rent, and maintenance. 


When we moved here, we were told by the one of the sons (aka our main go-to guy) that we could use the laundry room. - They even put a door leading from our apartment to the laundry room. - After a week of being here, we noticed one of the tenants was leaving their clothes in the dryer for over 5 days &amp; by that time, we were waiting days to do our laundry... So, we put their dried clothes in a clean basket and left a nice quaint note. I felt bad about it but cmon, we all live here. 


Soon after we found out the woman who lives/owns in the next house over is actually doing her laundry in the laundry room at our house. The story is that a man who used to live in our home originally bought them but then he moved and gifted them to her because she has no space in her basement. So found out through the other tenants that is what not them who was leaving the clothes, it was that women next door.... My boyfriend saw her standing outside one day and we introduced ourselves and apologized for having to put her clothes in the basket but we had to do our laundry. She came off as really nice and said not to worry about it she kept talking about her sick daughter who has brain cancer and we just felt bad for her....at first.


A day later, we found out the family above us has their own set of washer and dryers that they use. (Since there is 2 sets of washer and dryers in the laundry room.....) so this means we share the one washer and dryer with the old women on the second floor  and the women next door. The next time I went to do laundry there was a note in the washer and dryer “ONLY FOR SECOND FLOOR” and a note in the basket we had left for the next door neighbor “WASHER AND DRYER IS NOT FOR YOU. ONLY FOR SECOND FLOOR. IT WAS NEVER USED BY THE LOWER LEVEL” 


Safe to say, we were so confused because we were told we could use this laundry room, they even built us a door.... We thought, it couldn’t have been the women next door who wrote this. She was so nice to us. When we saw the old women on the second floor, she said she doesn’t do laundry too much and it definitely wasn’t her, and that the women next door own them. We believed her. 

So when we went to pay rent, we spoke to the landlords son and he said “yeah the lower level tenants before us never used the laundry room but we will speak to the women next door because she technically owns and see if she will compromise” 

We get a call a couple hours later “yes we can use them” yay! We were happy everything worked out, the last thing we would want is any trouble. 

A couple days later I was doing a wash and went to flip it to the dryer. I immediately noticed dryer lint catcher was missing I was terrified to put the clothes in there without that because that is a fire hazard. 

About two days went by and we get a call from our landlord who sounds very frustrated. He says he heard we stole the lint catcher. We were baffled and told him otherwise. 
After great call it magically shows up. 
A few more days go by and I went to put a new load in, I noticed there were clothes in the washer and dryer. Okay, no problem I can wait. 
Next day, same clothes 
Next day, same clothes.
4 day’s later, same clothes. This kept on for about two weeks. 
We were getting so frustrated and decided we would have to take the clothes out put it in a bag, do our laundry and then put her clothes back. 

Next time we went to pay rent we told the landlords son and he agreed that she is definitely playing games with us. He jokingly told us to “just throw her clothes on the floor because we have every right to use those machines. Of course we would never do that, although we REALLY wanted to. Landlord calls her again, apparently she was nice and apologized. 
2 days later, she put a small lock on the washer plug so we couldn’t plug it in. We were livid. 


My boyfriend cut the lock off... lol 


A couple days after that, we get a call from the landlords son asking us if everything is okay because he heard that the women next door is claiming we are stealing her detergent and dryer sheets. Keep in mind THERE IS A CAMERA IN THERE. We said “of course we would never do that and said she put a lock on the plug so we cut it off.” The landlords son was so mad over the fact that she would put a lock on the washer and he immediately came out to our apartment. 

We talked about everything that has happened and the landlord and my boyfriend went over to the women’s house and sorted everything out. They came to an agreement that it was all a big misunderstanding, that she thought we were mad at her that she so sorry blah blah blah.. So at his point I am so mad &amp; I know she is a phony liar and I don’t believe a word that comes out of her mouth. Anyways she gives her # to my bf and says if she ever leaves clothing in there to text her or text her about anything. 

3 days later, NEW LOCK ON THE WASHER. 

We text her and she makes up some excuse about how she put it there before we talk and meant to take it off but has been so busy with her sick daughter and just keeps making up all these excuses. But she does end up taking it off. 

Today we get a text from her now STILL accusing us of stealing laundry detergent, dryer sheets, and now apparently claiming her clothes are getting fucked up in the wash and that the machines are nasty. 

Let me tell you, I am a clean women. I like things neat clean and I’m always organized. For someone to keep constantly accusing me of doing something like that, I am fed up. 
All of her  text and in person confrontations have only been through my BF. But now I am so mad, I want to text her and put her on blast... but I’m scared of losing laundry privileges. It’s like she loves having the power over us will do anything to make us look bad and drive us away. 
The landlord is on our side but my bf is saying we shouldn’t go to him no more it will just annoy him more and that’s why we have her phone number now. 

Idk what to do.",24May2020,1
70,"I'm almost sixteen, my sister is twelve, our parents are crazy. They keep fighting all day long, throwing things, and yelling at each other and my sister has been doing this really weird thing in which she sets an alarm for 72 hours where she eats nothing at all except for water and when that time is up, she eats a few fruits and that's it. Moreover, she keeps working out and I don't know how she's surviving. Additionally, she lost around 20 kg (she wasn't overweight to begin with) and she's really pale and skinny, her bones are showing, she hasn't gotten her period for two months straight now. I tried talking to my parents about this, but they simply ignored the matter and my dad said she was trying to be cool, I know she isn't. They eat in front of her like it's nothing and they don't try to talk to her about it or anything of the sort, they just brush it off. I'm really worried about her, I tried talking to her and telling her that she's still growing and that her bones will be used up for nutrition at this rate, but she yelled at me to leave her alone, I don't blame her for that though because she's usually so kind and caring. How can I help her?",24May2020,1

I want this person in jail, out of my complex, and more importantly, for her to be safe. What are my options? How can I make sure this piece of shit gets what he deserves. If it comes down to it and I have to make an official statement, I will. I have guns so if he decides to take revenge on me, I can and will defend myself if I have to. I just would like to avoid that as a possibility if there is any way to do so, but what I can't live with is if nothing happens to him for what I witnessed.",24May2020,1

She must have been suffering all this time and I couldn’t be there for her. We didn’t hear anything from her all day until that message and I barely even questioned it.

It sounds like they strapped 30lb ankle weights on and are practicing to be monsters for an upcoming play.

I later overheard, when she was talking to my brother, that she thinks that im making something up. I don’t even know what to do, she clearly hears the cat crying and she thinks it wants to play.

79,"I’m not trying to come off as shallow or that I only care about looks, but whenever my husband wears his glasses I get turned off. When we have sex, I kindly take off his glasses because I just can’t when he has them on. 

I really do like it better when he wears his contacts. I’ve asked why he doesn’t wear contacts more often, and his response is that he prefers glasses because he often forgets to take out his contacts at night. Plus his contacts sometimes bothers his eyes. 

He is slightly sensitive about the way he looks with his glasses. I’m not sure of a gentle and kind way of telling him that I’m more attracted to him when he doesn’t wear his glasses. I’d hate to make him feel more insecure about his eyesight, which he has no control over. 

I prefer no glasses, but it’s his body so I don’t know if I should even be able to ask him to wear his contacts instead of glasses. 

TL;DR I’m not attracted to my husband when he wears glasses. Do I have a right to ask him to wear his contacts more often, and what would be the best way to go about it?",24May2020,1
80,"I'll try to keep this short. I'm 15(f) and have 4 older siblings, 1 is a senior in high school and the other 3 are in college. They're all really smart, studying to be teachers/engineers/doctors.

All my siblings have always gotten all As and maybe a few Bs. 

I can hear the disappointment in my parent's voices whenever they talk to me about school. I'm just not passionate enough about the subjects I'm taking. i really wish I wanted to be a doctor so I could care about science and math but math just doesn't make sense to me no matter how hard I try. 

My personality doesn't really make up for my lack of being smart. I'm not funny or talented or extraordinarily pretty. I have social anxiety and don't have many friends. as you can probably guess, my siblings are the exact opposite.

I just can't help feeling like the unwanted burden whenever I'm around my family, the disappointment. I don't want to sound whiny or anything but the feeling is ruining my already stale relationship with my parents. I know they love me no matter what but i just wish i could have something to make them proud of me.

The players. 


Me = Me (Using a Throwaway)28M
GF = My girlfriend 27F
MR = Male Roommate 26?M
FR = Female Roommate. 26?F


Backstory: I live with my two roommates who are a couple. I have a dog and so do they. My dog has anxiety issues and can be destructive if she doesn't get exercise or isn't watched. It really just happens randomly. She did have a spell where she was going to the bathroom on one spot in the living room. And they were very chill about it. *Important for later*. 
GF works in the NICU of a Hospital taking care of babies who have NO immune system. Since my girlfriend works over nights and random days we don't get to see each other as much as we would like. She always comes to me because of afore mentioned issues with my dog. (yes typically My Dog ITA). So FR decided to give GF a key to the house. I didn't ask her to or anything. And she said that GF is always welcome. Since this whole Covid lockdown GF has been extremely careful. I am the only person she sees. Her parents live about 18 hours from us. GF not allowed dogs at her apartment for any amount of time. 

So. GF came over on Friday. I had injured myself playing a sport because I'm dumb. So we just hung out. I hadn't expressly told them she was coming over, I typically don't because they have always just said yeah it's fine. Hasn't been an issue. Roommates know GF does everything she can to not get exposed. GF knows I share this house with two other people and that they still want to have a social life even though we are supposed to be quarantined. So in order to not be completely alone this entire quarantine she has taken the risks of coming over knowing that other people have been here just so that she isn't stuck alone in her apartment always. When she is over we have always made it known we would prefer it just be us 4. Well. Today Roommates were off taking care of some family business and then I got a message stating that 2 of roommates friends who had been over last weekend were coming over for a fire. I was being told and not asked. GF felt hurt and uncomfortable and left before they got back. She doesn't feel welcome and also like they did it on purpose knowing we would ask them not to. But she also knows that she doesn't live here. Company shows up and waits in their car. Roommates show up. And they all come inside with dinner. I wait until FR and company go outside after eating dinner inside and MR is a bit behind them and I pull him aside. Convo is basically as follows


Me - Hey man. I'm not mad at you or anything. But I'm upset with how this happened. And I would like to talk about it later. I don't want to ruin your night but GF and I are both a little hurt and upset. 

MR - Alright man

Me - Just like, you guys know GF is trying to keep a low profile because of work. And you guys didn't ask if these people could come over. You just told me.

MR - Well you didn't ask if GF could come over. And they are letting up on the Quarantine restrictions anyways. 

Me - Okay, well I have always been told that she is welcome here and it had never been an issue. 

MR - Its not. But when it conflicts with us doing stuff then it does. And you know you are always welcome to go there we told you we would watch your dog. 

Me - yeah but when I'm gone I get anxious because I don't want her to cause any issues because even though you guys have been great about it and don't make it into a big deal it just makes me feel like shit and I hate having that hanging in the house. Like knowing it's an issue but you guys aren't making it one.

MR - Idk man you know you can always go there I'm sure she doesn't love always having to come here all the time. I know FR didn't like it that's part of why we moved in here. (He lived 2.5 to 3 hours away) 

Me - idk sorry man. I don't mean to keep you inside we can talk about this later. 

So Reddit. 

Am I the Asshole? Should I not have said anything? Or should I stand my ground? My poor GF blames herself and won't stop apologizing and left here in tears. Which makes me incredibly upset because she is the sweetest person alive and doesn't want any conflict especially not when she feels it's her fault. I think my roommates were rude and inconsiderate. But I'm worried I may be wearing out my welcome and my GFs. Lend me a hand kind or unkind internet strangers. I need you.

88,"August 2019 I started dating my boyfriend up until a couple days ago. I truly thought he was the love of my life. I still do.

We talked in person on Wednesday as I picked up my things. The way he talks about our relationship sounds so passionate. He says he loves me but deep down I know he wants it to work but he’s staying strong and saying he’s tired of trying and doesn’t want to waste time since he’s a couple years older than me.

We started having problems January 2020. His sister tried killing herself and I quit my job in December. We weren’t living together but I was there all the time with basically all my things.

In late February, I wasn't getting my period and didn’t know what to do. I was scared to tell him because of what had happened to his sister. I wanted to protect him and not make him more heartbroken. I felt bad because he was so frustrated and sad dealing with family issues. I'm also stressed dealing with unemployment as well.

Today I'm taking the abortion pill. I told him I was pregnant a couple days ago through text right after picking up my things since he wanted to keep it very brief. Now I think he is confused on whether or not I had the abortion. I wanted to tell him so badly sooner I was pregnant but out of love I thought it was my time to support him as I believe family comes first and I knew an abortion was what was necessary in the end. So I didn’t tell him yet..I wanted to I never had the intention of lying or hiding it. I told him before the abortion...

Everyday I wanted to blurt it out and just tell him, I'm pregnant but felt like I couldn’t find the right moment? Because of this I found myself wanting a deeper connection with him I wasn’t achieving. I became lacking in communication even though I wanted it and just start picking fights at absolutely nothing that made me seem jealous and hard to be around. I literally got jealous that he was talking to his female co-worker about what he was cooking for dinner. Our conversation lagged through out the day because we were quarantined together and spent time 24/7. I wasn’t really jealous of the woman but more so the convo he was having with her?

I wanted to tell him I'm pregnant but I was already stressed out with everything going on with his family, pandemic, his job, my job. How was I supposed to say anything???

Our fights got worse and more often until we finally broke up. I just kept saying nothing was wrong when he asked me. But obviously he could sense there was.

When I finally admitted I'm pregnant (through text) and he was so upset and sad. I think he thinks I already had the abortion though, even though I'm taking the pill today. It's hard to communicate over text.

He’s so mad with me and says this is something he can never look past (even though we agreed if i ever got pregnant i'd get an abortion). He said it wasn’t my call to make in not telling him even though as he would have taken care of me... I was explaining I was protecting him and he thinks it’s just a ploy to get him back.

The last thing he’s texted me is “this is something I can’t look past"" 2 days ago. I’ve texted him a lot since but he’s not responding. I think he thinks the abortion already happened but it's today! I don't know what he's thinking.

Basically I waited too long.. until he broke up with me, to tell him I'm pregnant.

I feel so sad and guilty what do I do???? is it over???",24May2020,1
89,"So I don’t know if I should post this on r/relationshipadvice or here so I decided both.

So me (16F) and best friend (16M) have been friends since we were 3 and I recently started to like him. There’s a couple problems though. 

1) I live a two and a half hour drive from him (I moved when we were 13).

2) I have severe social anxiety and I don’t have the balls to ask him.

3) I haven’t kept in contact with him as I should. Just the streaks thing on Snapchat and the occasional stupid conversations we have. (We talked about if our dogs harness is the same lmao)

4) Not only that I suffer from social anxiety I am also socially awkward and terrible at starting conversations, I am worse about talking about this kind of topic. 

Just a side note, my younger brother told me a couple months ago that he overheard my friend talking to another guy (he didn’t tell me who) and apparently my friend said that he thought I was cute. And just to let you know, he doesn’t know about my crush on him.

93,"I am writing this on a throwaway because it's extremely embarassing to talk about. I'll start from the beginning.

So I'm at a party with a couple friends and one of my friends introduces me to ""Nate."" Nate and I hit it off pretty well and we have an amazing time. I end up getting his number and go back to my house with my friends.

Nate and I start talking the next day and we seem to have a lot of chemistry. This goes on for about a month when we finally decide to go on a date. 

We continue to have a great time and about a month later we make our relationship official.

Everything seems to go great, my lease was almost over with my current roommate, and 6 months in, we decide that I should move in with him.

That's where everything goes bad. He's super controlling, he starts to pressure me into sex. Completely different person. He would start fights over the littlest things, blame me for ""cheating"" on him when I went out to the movies with my GIRL friends, and honestly got super obsessed with me. He was starting to scare me.

I lived with him for another 6 months, then recently put a downpayment on another apartment with a friend in secret because I wasn't sure if he would do something crazy/freak out. I figured I would just up and disappear the next day after I broke up with him.

So on Thursday I told him I was breaking up with him. He was yelling at me and made me sleep on the couch. 

The next morning, he was already at work, and I went to go pack my things and my friend helped me. 

I grab some clothes, a couple small household items I paid for, and a lockbox. (Now I should mention, this lockbox contained $250, a couple of other small items, and 2 sex toys+lube.) I didn't make sure to open it up before I brought it back to my new place because we were in a rush and I didn't want to stay any longer than I had to.

So we put everything into my friend's and my car and we bring it to my new apartment.

I start unpacking and feeling relieved that I don't have to live in that situation anymore. 


Fast forward to today:

My roommate was out at a small party and I had the house to myself. So I unlocked my lockbox and noticed that my cash was missing (my ex had the combination) and I was furious. He robbed me. When I went to check to see if he did anything else, I noticed the Ziplock gallon baggie I keep my sex toys in was covered in a white liquid.

I looked at my lube bottle and it wasn't opened and the lube color was clear, not a gooey and white. I honestly wanted to vomit. 

It wasn't mine either because I ALWAYS clean my toys off right after use. And lets be honest, male's semen and female's fluids are way different from eachother. It was definitely his.

I feel absolutely violated and I don't know if he's ever done this before. 

What should I do?

Should I take it to the police? Do I have a case to take it to the police?

Should I just throw it out and not think about it?

I feel like I should do something so he doesn't do this to other women. I also plan on getting a pregnancy test in case he was trying to get me pregnant or something.",24May2020,1
94,"Me and my twin sister (both f/19) are worried about my fathers drinking habits. I know that alcoholism runs in the family and HIS fathers death was related to alcohol withdrawal. Right now he drinks almost a bottle or two of red wine a night and has blacked out almost weekly. Both when he has friends over and just on regular nights, like when we are playing cards. He stumbles around and has hurt himself when under the influence. 

I am really worried about him and I want to see him grow old. His drinking has definitely caused fights between him and my mom so I dont want to bring anything up with her, she obviously knows and they would just argue more. I dont know if it is my place to bring it up but I have younger sisters and I want to protect them. Im not sure what to do or how to bring it up, if I even should.

Every single time I’ve been to one I can never relax. I always think that my food has been tampered with and that they’ve spit in it or something. 

I think about how they might of put something in my food like glass or a hair or plastic and it just freaks me out.

99,"I got admitted to the University of Virginia for the upcoming school year. I’ve always been interested in the humanities and up until recently I’d planned on being a lawyer after doing 4 years in the Army (I’m doing ROTC in college).

Recently, though, I’ve found myself wanting a career with more flexibility and family time and that doesn’t require grad school. I’m leaning towards firefighting, being a park ranger, or starting my own business of some sort. Honestly, I don’t really know what I want to do, but the long hours, high stress, and minimal flexibility of a law career no longer appeal to me.

The problem is that thinking about going into a “less prestigious” or less academically challenging career makes me feel like I’ll be wasting my UVA degree and letting my family down. Up until this point, I’ve been stereotypically successful; I did Speech and Debate, I was captain of my most important extracurricular, etc. I just feel like everything I’ve done up until now would be pointless if I became a firefighter or something similar.

I just feel directionless and really anxious that I don’t have a driving passion in life anymore. I’m not good at STEM, otherwise I’d be an engineer or something. All my academic “talent” seems pointless and useless now because who the hell wants a humanities degree? and what can I do with one other than law or teaching? I just want to live in the mountains and hike and fish and raise kids but I don’t know what to do for a career and it’s really bothering me.

104,"My friend recently had a small party at their house, which I didn't go to because I'm social distancing. My partner and I have been exceedingly cautious and have gone beyond recommended guidelines (I'm a doctor, and I work in an area related to public health). 

However, I woke up this morning to see that his partner had tagged me in a ""housewarming party"" post, saying thanks to all of their friends for coming, with an older photo of us amongst the rest of the party photos. It was in the same spot in their house, with the same lighting, and although if you really scrutinise it you can see that they're wearing different clothes and have (very slightly) different hair, it looks very much like my partner and I were at this party amongst the rest of the guests. I know that there wasn't any malicious intent behind it, that she was just trying to include us because we couldn't make it.

In the country I live in, five people are allowed in a private household at one time. What they did wasn't technically illegal - they had a gathering of five guests (plus them), but when you glance at the post, it looks like a lot more: you see a photo of seven people (their guests) and a photo of four people (them and us on a different night) right beside each other, making it look very much like it was an illegal gathering.

I politely asked her to take down the photo of me (and she has), but by the time I had seen it, it had been ten hours, and many people had liked it or commented on it. It would be bad enough knowing that anyone I've ever met could have seen me ""breaking the law"" (particularly because I never post on social media so this would be my one of very few tagged posts of me ever), but I'm a doctor working in public health! And they're doctors too! And probably over half of our facebook friends are doctors! This is something that could potentially be pretty damaging to my reputation (not to mention that I'm also an immigrant currently applying for citizenship, and I don't think it's great that there's ""evidence"" of me breaking the law posted to social media).

&amp;#x200B;

I confirmed with other friends that it looks very much like I was at a house party, and that of course anyone who saw it would assume I attended a house party (Occam's razor). They also tell me I'm probably overreacting and they didn't think too much of it when they saw the post pop up on their newsfeed, that I've done all that I can, and that I should now try to forget about it.

&amp;#x200B;

My job gave me the option of working at another office close to my home. My question is this: should I leave my city and move to the home office, stack up cash and look for another position? This was my first job out of college and I honestly don't really enjoy doing it at all. I just don't know if resigning a lease would be ideal for me. In addition, the job is highly volatile; I don’t know when the next person will get canned. On the flip side, I don’t really want to move in with my folks because that could lead me the being complacent

I applied to law school this past year and the second lie I told her was that I received an interview from a school when I actually didn’t.

I don’t know why I lied about these things, I guess I was just trying to make myself sound more impressive.

111,"I (f17) currently live with my mum, stepfather and brother. I'm in my final year of high school. For as long as I can remember, my parents have been physically, verbally and emotionally abusive. They have only gotten worse as we get older and no matter what I know they won't change. No matter how much I try to keep the peace they lash out and hurt us. My best friend is living in an apartment bought by her dad and she lives between staying in the apartment and in the main house with her family (they have a good stable relationship) and she is insisting I move in with her after my most recent incident with my family. Also just want to say in my country/state corona restrictions are lifted. My mum is suspicious I've wanted to move out for a while and brings up how people who move out end up high school drop outs and drug addicts. The thing is I care a lot about school but my parents locked me in my room this weekend without access to my laptop so I couldn't talk to anyone, but I couldn't do my schoolwork either. I now have a few hours to do an assignment when I needed the whole weekend to work on multiple assignments. They also made me miss online school on Friday without my laptop or phone. My friend (when I'm allowed out) invites me to her house and helps me study and do my work in a safe and quiet environment. She wants to do vetinary medicine and is really passionate about school.

Meaning they want to minimize the people suing them for their well earned over time pay! What do y’all think should I tell everyone? And make those selfish elitist bastards pay?

I lost all my friends and the guy I thought I liked (he told me that he only liked me for my body and wanted to be fwb) and I was sexually assaulted by some I thought was a friend in front of my close friends. I got drunk in my high school friend’s dorm because of losing all of my other friends over a dumb fight. I got drunk over her pressuring me to continue because she wanted to see how I acted. My other friend whom I thought was okay locked his legs around me put is hand around my throat stuck his hand down my chest and stuck is hand down my throat on various occasions and those were the only things I could remember. I didn’t say I was okay with this hence I was under the influence and could say yes. My other friends (who were girls) just sat there and let it happen. The next day all they could do was laugh about it and talk about what I did. I didn’t react at first but the a month goes by and all I keep thinking is it was my fault and if I didn’t wear an accessible shirt or got pressured into drinking it would never had happened. I keep blaming myself and I don’t know how to feel. When I think of what happened a pit in my stomach builds and I get nauseous.

Ok so here’s my situation. I just got out of a 7 month relationship with a 24m year old who had just gotten his degree lives with parents and has pretty much a job lined up for him by his parents. My ex left me for his own reasons. I suspect boredom or the fact I’m going absolutely no where in life. But regardless the relationship has opened my eyes and I finally see the light in a sense. I was just using the relationship to hide from myself but I was torn up when he dumped me. 
I am about to be 27f years old I was pursuing a degree in japanese when I started college in 2012, which I know very well, but I completely maxed out my student loans by transferring schools multiple times because I always run away when things get hard and they’re usually always caused by a relationship I was in. I have no degree yet and work as a server. I also feel like my interest in japanese has gone down significantly because honestly what could I do with this and live a comfortable life ? I feel like I’m too old and washed up to accomplish anything now. 
I feel like I just really want to focus on myself and I don’t know what to do because all of the past mistakes I made are so huge and I feel like I can’t recover. I was working as a server before the shutdown I’m not sure if I’ll have my job back but I absolutely loathe serving anyways. I have a terrible credit score, no more loans available to take out, and no hope. I even owe my current university another few grand that I haven’t paid back yet. The one good thing I have is a car that I paid off from a loan that I took out when my credit was good. I have student loan debt and some credit card debt. I’m trying to pay off all of the debt that’s not part of my student loans to raise my credit. 
I also suffer immensely from low self esteem due to my teeth. I really want braces as well because they are pretty bad. 
I also live with two roommates. One is in grad school and making a good amount. The other is in the exact same boat as me. I look at him and see he’s going no where too and it adds to my depression. I desperately want to move out of this crappy apartment and live on my own. My roommate who is in a similar situation is an extremely negative unmotivated person.  I want to surround myself with people that are motivated because I know it would help me too. I feel trapped I want to give up everyday but at the same time I don’t want to live like this anymore. 
How can I get my degree or should I even bother trying ? I don’t know what to do anymore and I just want to know if anyone else has been in a similar situation.

I am no longer bitter but I am holding you accountable for continuing contact with ___. I wont ask you to cut him out of your life. I know that I can't handle being around someone who makes excuses for his actions. I have come to the conclusion that my most healthy option is to distance myself from both of you.  I know that my choice will hurt you, which isnt my intent. I will always have love for both of you but that doesn't mean its healthy for me to continue contact. I am happy you are doing better even with how the past year has been. I don't wish anything negative on you and ___. It just messes with my mind to be around you and know that you still care about the person who hurt me most. I dont think ___ even understand how negatively he impacted my life. I dont want to harbor resentment which is why I'm removing myself from the equation. Some of the things you and dad have asked of me are more than what I'm willing to forgive and forget, such as asking me to close the case against ___. I know you love ____ and wanted to protect him but I think its fair to say you should have had the same empathy for me. You need to understand the anguish I felt keeping that secret and then to not be believed was my worst nightmare. For me to be able to move on and heal and try to understand your side I need to distance myself.

128,"Okay so my mum’s bday is in July, and I literally cannot leave the house because two people are not allowed out of the house at the same time, and I’m not allowed to drive so my mum would’ve had to drive me, but then that would be two people. So that means I can’t go shopping.

And I can’t do online shopping, because me and my mum share a PayPal so she sees everything I buy.

I’m in the process of making a faux-taxidermy stag head (we’re a strange family, I know.) for her, but we never get each other just one present, we always get multiple. And I’m the only one who buys her birthday presents, so it’s a lot of responsibility.

I would love to try cooking or baking something for her, but to put it simply she doesn’t trust my cooking skills at all

She also wouldn’t like my cleaning the house or doing extra chores as a gift, because she’s a bit of a neat freak and enjoys cleaning and wouldn’t trust me to get the job done properly

So does anybody have any decent ideas for gifts? My options are basically limited to stuff I can do at home, so any basic ideas would be much appreciated",24May2020,1
129,"This is my first ever Reddit post and I'm on mobile, so forgive me if there are errors. 

So, I(20F) have this close friend(23M) who I've known since I was really young. About 8 months ago, he and his girlfriend broke up and it hit him hard, mostly because this is the first real relationship he has been in. I made it a point to be there for him whenever he needed me, because all I could possibly do was answer his texts/calls, etc, cuz he lives in the next state and I couldn't physically be there for him. 

Here's where the problem is, as much as I love him and I tried my best to be there for him, he would only call if he was having a problem, barely spoke to me otherwise during this period. Now, I usually wouldn't have a problem with it if it didn't happen too often, but it did. And after the first few months, I realized that it was starting to mess with my head (I have a bipolar disorder and was going through a lot of messed up stuff on my own), so, I was considering telling him that I can't be there all the time for him. Every time I tried talking about it, he would almost instinctively say,""You're the only person I can talk to about this"" and it made me feel insanely guilty, so I tried getting him a therapist, (only after asking if he wanted to talk to one) he didn't like any of them and said that he preferred talking to me.

Fast forward to the first week of May, and we're talking about stuff as usual, he started talking about self-harm. I struggled with self-harm for 7 years and for the first time in a long time, I was about 3 months clean at that point. Initially I didn't mind the conversation because it was just mentioning it and then us talking about why we did it. Halfway through, he starts describing it in detail, specifically talking about bleeding and deep cuts, etc. It was starting to mess with me, so I asked him to stop because it was triggering, he agreed, but went on for a good 5 minutes after. We hung up after that, and the next day, I decided to tell him that I didn't feel like talking because I was in a weird headspace. 

A week passes and he insists on video calling, I kept telling him that I didn't feel like talking and that I really just wanted some space, but he said he was just checking on me, I said that was sweet of him, but I just wanted to be alone atm, he said something along the lines of,""did you consider the fact that I didn't want to be alone"", I finally said that i understand that he's going through stuff, but I can't be there for him right now because I desperately needed to take care of myself. He proceeded to get really mad at me, was borderline yelling and saying things like,""Oh, I'm not some lost puppy who needs you"" and ""I'm not some charity case"",  so I said I didn't imply that at all, I just said I couldn't be there for him because I wasn't feeling okay when he said he didn't want to be alone. He got annoyed and hung up, I felt bad and sent him a text, apologizing, because I thought I was rude. He just left me on read and hasn't spoken to me since and I have tried checking up on him, he's just been very rude so far. I feel like crap over the whole ordeal. I would like any advice on how to deal with this right now, please.",24May2020,1
130,"I write about this a lot. For the past two years of my friendship with this woman, I have harbored envy towards her. She has a lot of friends. She has a lot of money. She is always traveling, buying more clothes, and she lives in an expensive gated apartment. Wherever we go, guys are always  approaching her. I am not exaggerating either. She only wears mascara and lipstick and guys are crazy about her. She is more fun than me. She is always going to parties, concerts, etc.  I am a home body. She does not even have to talk to people, she just gets invited. Once one relationship with a guy ends, another guy is waiting for her. She is able to hook up with no strings attached. I always get emotionally invested in FWB and they end horribly. She is the popular cool college girl. I always afraid of introducing her to guys I was interested in because I feel like if they saw her they would lose interest in me.

She nitpicks every little thing I do wrong and criticizes me everything from an unintentional text tone change to telling her I’m frustrated. That’s not to say I’m perfect because I have gotten irrationally upset a couple times but when that happens I have to grovel and beg for forgiveness whereas when it’s the other way around I have to consol her for making her feel bad about correcting my mistake. I need space and possibly to end the relationship but if I tell her she’d become upset and breakdown and I don’t want the blame and guilt trips that comes with it. Is there another way around it?,24May2020,1

My parents aren’t religious. I have never been religious. But what if Hell is real. All the time I’m trying to tap into my memory and think of the best rebuttals against god I know.

Is it that he was unhappy with me or bored of being with me? If that is the case then why not break up with me instead of stringing me along and having me looking like a jackass out here thinking he is faithful and loyal to me while I am to him as well. What is the point of that? Why cheat on someone you claim to love and stay with them? Why do that to them? Why not be honest? Why not just leave them?  I find that is so disgusting honestly. I mean yes women cheat too but I just don't understand how people can do that? Some will say it's complicated and they cheat bc it was easy and they don't want to lose their partner but then if that person meant something to you and if you genuinely really loved them then you would never ever consider cheating right? That is just my take on it.

My ex wrote to me saying that she really missed me and saying that she really wanted to be friends. I told her sure, we could be friends. Since I feel comfortable talking to her and even hang out after the breakup.

Our main way of communicating has been through Snapchat. We now have a streak of 48 days since she asked me the initial question.

I have asked her on several occations is she wanted to watch a movie or hang out for a while. Every single time she has turned me down. When she does turn me down I tell her it's okay and to just tell me whenever she has time. She has not done so yet.

This just makes me feel like I am the only one who is putting effort into this friendship. And I am not sure if it is worth my time/effort.

136,"While looking at a list of electives for my school a few months ago, I saw that my school offers a lot of drama/theatre classes. I had already gotten interested in acting last year, and I almost joined the drama club but couldn't because I was scared that I wouldn't be good enough. But now, after watching lots of movies in quarantine and watching interviews with actresses like Rooney Mara, Cate Blanchett, Sarah Paulson, and Sandra Bullock, I'm really interested in acting. I don't have any acting experience, so I don't know if I would be good at it or not, but I would love to try it. I know actresses like Rooney Mara are actually quite shy in real life but can act like a completely different person when they're in character. And that's what I love about acting, that you could be a super shy person in real life but transform into someone evil or badass in character. I love the idea that you could be someone else, completely different than you, for a few hours. Even if I try acting and it's just not right for me, I would also want to try different things in the film industry, like directing or film editing. I know the acting industry is extremely competitive and usually more outgoing and fun people get noticed more than quiet and shy people. So, do you think that a shy person like me could be an actress or is it too hard? Also, even if you don't have advice, I would love some encouragement - I'm really nervous about joining drama club or trying drama electives since I've never tried anything like it before and I'm afraid that I'll keep messing up if I actually try it, and I don't want to chicken out. For once, I want to try something completely new without constantly worrying about judgement from others or thinking that I won't be good enough - and who knows, I might actually end up really liking it or even being good at it.

I’m of course happy to try and help but it sucks because I usually just get shut down. I’m not naive enough to think I can fix him, but he says he wants to be heard and never feels like he is. I suppose like most men I have a problem with suggesting solutions rather than just listening to a problem but I feel MORE useless just saying “that sucks.” And of course to top it off, I know how selfish it is of me to get tired of it because it’s a real problem, but I can’t help but get tired of it. I’m nervous to say I need a day to myself because it usually leads to me being an emotional support over the phone. I’m human and I have very little emotional capacity to begin with; I’ve been to therapy myself for exactly this reason. My specific questions are: how do I help him without actively ‘helping’ him?

I still love animals, but I'm not sure if it's what I want to do anymore. Recently I've refound my passion for cars (I used to enjoy them as a little kid, but never realized how interested I was until a little less than a year ago). I've been obsessed ever since and I love working on my car, cleaning it, trying to make it nice with the money I have.

I've been offered a job at a local tire shop and it has better pay than my current job, but they aren't as flexible with my school schedule. This was a month or two ago so I don't know if the offer still stands, but I've been thinking about going back and asking. I've been at my current job for 2 years with one $1 raise. Since that raise I have taken on sooooo much more responsibility and I'm working more, but my boss won't give me a raise because I have to ""earn it"". 

 My boyfriend thinks I should ditch the wildlife ecology degree and my job and go to school to learn about cars + work at a mechanic shop as an apprentice.

We had a break for a few days about a week ago and he watched porn in that time. I’m so so so so insecure and knowing he watches it at all makes me feel so uncomfortable with myself.

146,"My (17M) relationship with my dad (48) is completely broken. We used to be relatively close when I was younger, but then I started to realize that some of the ways he was treating me was not okay. For example, if I got into an argument with my younger siblings he would always end the fight by saying something along the lines of ""god you're such a bully. You're nothing but a mean boy"" and then send me to my room even. And I distinctively remember one time when I was about 12 when I started yelling at him and telling him ""stop it I'm not a bully!"" and he slapped me for talking back, I then ran into the bathroom while crying and he chased after me, when I closed the door he started banging on it and hit it so hard that it broke the door knob and frame and he pulled me out so he could explain why I was in the wrong all while I was screaming and crying, I had never been so scared in my entire life. I never looked at him the same since.

And I have tried to express my hated of being called a bully and a mean boy after that but he just thinks of it as a joke ""come on, it doesn't mean anything"" and he acted like all the terrible things he had said to me were an inside joke between us 

And then I came out as gay to **ONLY** my mom when I was 14 and she said ""I can't keep secrets from your dad, that's not the kind of relationship we have"" and so, even though I begged her not to, she told him later that night. I don't think he has seen me the same way since. He would constantly get mad if me and my brother were talking about boys I liked, and sometimes he would talk about all my female friends as if I was dating them all at once, even asking ""when are you going to ask out \[x\]"" And when I started dating my current partner, my dad just stared with a mixture of disappointment, disgust, and resignation on his face, and it hurts me in a way I could never explain. 

I really want to fix things with him, he is a flawed man, but I love him dearly and we do get along most of the time now,  I just want things to be good between us, I want to be comfortable with inviting him to my wedding if me and my partner decide to get married in the future and I want to feel comfortable with having him around my kids if I end up having any, but  I just don't think I can if I can't fix things between us soon.",24May2020,1

148,"First I left my job and then I thought id quickly get a new job and apartment but I got sick and spent my money on hotels and getting better. Had just enough money for a lease starting june 1st. But since there were 2 weeks between that day and june 1st when i wasnt going to have enough money living off of hotels,  I decided to go to a homeless shelter for 2 weeks.

When I got there, people immediately started to notice i wasnt ""actually homeless"". i had a nice winter coat, nice belongings, and was from a pretty wealthy town. It was almost offensive that id take this place as a place to wait for my apartment. 

I want to just up and leave, but its killing me that I have upset so many people and dont know how to leave without wrecking peoples lives a bit. a lot of the staff members are pissed for the above reasons. I told them the pandemic caused me to be jobless and homeless. But im not really""homeless"". 

Then, these people were getting all excited over me and really wanted me to play pool with them so they taught me. They spent an entire week explaining and teaching me the game. with everyone saying words of encouragement. when i kept forgetting the rules a week into it and not getting better, after everyone paying specialized attention to me, they got pissed. The manager who taught me did not show up to play with us the day after he realized i wasnt getting better and looked actually sad. People had to purposefully slow themselves down for the entire evening and take long breaks so I could ""win"".

The reason im having particular trouble leaving is because this one guy seemed to really want me to mentor him. He was all, ""you went to a good school and im trying to get through college and i want you to be a role model"". He witnessed everyone teaching me for an entire week and still forgetting the rules and not getting better. We were playing one on one and he kept expecting me to win but i was really just not that good but i didnt want to convey that to him. So i started not trying on purpose and he could tell and that pissed him off even more. I told him i could play him tomorrow but i want to just leave tomorrow. And run away someplace far far away.

When I [20M] was 12, my mum bought me a risky Christmas present that she said I could return if I didn’t like it. I asked if she could swap it out for me on the day I wasn’t going to see m dad. Once I got back a few weeks later, she was convinced that she Ad given me the money for the present. Innocent enough right? A few years down the line she admitted that she knew she hadn’t given me the money. Now it wasn’t much, a £40 present to be precise, but I felt fooled. It makes me resent her that she lied to me. Is this irrational?


Around the same age, my mum would make my pack lunch or give me lunch money before I caught the bus to school. This is hard for me to say, it goes under my skin to type this. One day before school, I was ready, waiting for my mum to sort my lunch. My mum an her boyfriend were having sex, I was sat on the sofa and my mums bed was directly above, upstairs. The bed was banging was so loud, I remember sitting there sulking, angry and upset, waiting to be sorted. In the last minute my mum rushes downstairs to give my lunch money an I end up missing my school bus by minutes. This defo wasn’t a regular occupancy, but I swear this planted something in my head. I hated being forgotten about that morning.

154,"Yeah I know, pretty insane. Basically, I (16F) was at my boyfriends (17M) house and we were babysitting his younger siblings. I happened to be wearing some jean shorts and a big sweatshirt because it was pretty hot outside. Then his youngest sister, 7, asks me to play with her. I say yes obviously, but I said that I didnt really want to play outside at the moment because it was really hot and I didnt want to take off my sweatshirt because i was wearing a sports bra underneath it. She gets a little whiny about it and throws a fit like little kids do, and his 8 year old brother chimes in and says that I'm gross for wearing a sports bra, and that I guess I dont wear underwear?? Which is silly and not true, but hey kids are goofballs. So they run out and tell their mom that I was only wearing a sports bra and that I didnt wear underwear and all this stuff, and she comes in raging and starts screaming at me that her children come first and I'm awful for not really wanting to go outside at the moment, and asking me what I had on underneath my sweatshirt. She then proceeds to call me a little slut and not a woman, says that everything I wear is trashy, calls me a bitch, gets very close to my face to the point where spit is flying. Once she was finished I got my things together and walked home bawling my eyes out. Mind you, her usually blue eyes were almost totally black from her pupils being so large. She has had trouble with addiction in the past and my boyfriends father has a history of being domestically violent as well, and while this was happening he was twirling his thumbs with his head down. The environment is this house is not very good at all. They are unemployed but somehow constantly gone, my boyfriend practically raises those children and is always watching them and whenever I go over there we are usually playing with them outside, going on walks, getting icecream and pizza, all the good stuff. I am definitely never going over there again that's for sure. To be honest the fact she called me names I've never been called by a grown woman before isnt what bothers me, what bothers me is that those children are around that every single day. It was shocking to see my boyfriend brush it off an act like it's not a big deal, but I realized that this is all hes ever been around. Is there any way I can do anything about this to help him and his siblings?",24May2020,1

159,"This is going to be a long story, so I apologize in advance.

I am in a bit of an awkward situation right now. This all started in mid-March when school got cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For context, I am a 17 year old female and I just recently came to terms with the fact that I'm bisexual. Anyways, on the last day we had school I came home crying because of the fact that I was most likely never going to see my crush, who is also a female, again as she is a senior and is graduating this year.

Naturally, my mom asked me why I was crying and of course I wasn't going to tell her that I was sad over the fact that I was never going to see the girl I fell in love with ever again, so I just told her that I was going to miss seeing my friends. However, my mom knows me well and asked if it was because of a boy I liked. I preceded to cry even more because I was thinking of my female crush. My mom then realized that the reason I was crying was because of someone I had a crush on, so naturally she was curious as to who this person was.

After she comforted me and I stopped crying for awhile, she asked who the name of this crush is, but I wouldn't tell her for obvious reasons. All I told her was that my crush was a senior. However, being the curious person she is, she grabbed my school yearbook and pointed to each of the senior boys' pictures asking ""Is this him?"" until I answered. Here is where the problem started: I'm not sure why, but I smile when I'm nervous or uncomfortable about something. I was starting to get uncomfortable with her trying to get an answer out of me as to who this crush of mine was, so I nervously smiled just as she was pointing to this boy named Caleb. Because of that, she assumed that Caleb was the boy I was crying over. I was annoyed and uncomfortable, so I just agreed with her that he was the boy I liked, figuring that was the end of it and my mom would never ask me about it again.

Fast forward to May, both of my parents still have not forgotten about this crush. My mom continues to ask me about ""him"" almost every single week and she assumes I'm constantly texting ""him"" whenever I'm on my phone. That's not even the worst part though. She looked his name up on Instagram today, and sure enough, this Caleb kid has an Instagram profile. And on his bio it says he is taken. So now my mom thinks I am dating some boy named Caleb when really I just have a crush on a girl.

I am beginning to feel quite annoyed with my mom asking me about a boy that doesn't even know I exist and I also hate lying, so I've been thinking about coming out to my family as bisexual for awhile now and explaining the real reason for why I came home from school crying on the last day we were there. But there's also a part of me that's scared they won't accept me for who I am, even though I know they are supportive parents that will love me no matter what. What should I do in this situation?

Tl;dr: Came home from school crying on the last day we were there and my mom assumed it was because of a boy I liked. Now she thinks we are dating and I'm contemplating whether or not I should tell my parents the truth about my crush and me being bisexual",24May2020,1
160,"Unlike stripping, phone sex is remote. Unlike camming, it’s faceless. 

So, unlike them both, it attracts the perviest pervs.

That’s my favorite thing. I love it so much that I’m going to start my own phone sex business.

I survived a childhood of pedophilic incest and narcissistic abuse. Accepting the roots of my current deviance hasn’t changed it—it’s made me less ashamed. 

Ageplay and incest fantasy will be my brand identity and niche. Entertaining possible pedophiles sounds gross and... trust me, it is... but it’s also a skill. It’s a very marketable skill that my life has trained me to have. 

Capitalizing on it feels like reclaiming and transforming what once killed me inside to something that fulfills me. Or does it?

My honest long-term dream is to start a nonprofit for child sexual abuse victims and survivors. Would a history of owning a pedo phone sex business wreck my credibility?

Or maybe businesses like mine help society by redirecting pedo attention away from... actual kids? 

Oof. I’m confused about it. 

All I know is, what I do feels good to me, an adult woman; it feels good to them; and it pays my bills.

It’s the first time in my life I haven’t kicked at walls, wishing all pedophiles could drop dead right now.

164,"Hello! A few months ago I put extension braids in my hair for the first time. It’s was very exciting participating in this part of my culture for the first time. It was also meaningful because I took the time to do it myself. It took me a total of 24 hours over the course of two days to do my own braids (for the very first time). Those braids only lasted 3 weeks because I’m not a professional and wasn’t able to put them in tight enough for them to last longer without growing out or frizzing rather early. Since the stay at home order, I’ve been having issues maintaining my hair because I don’t see the point in doing it if I’m not going out. This mindset has caused me to go days without washing my hair (more than usual) and in general just being annoyed with my hair. I thought about cutting it so that it was more manageable but I really wanted the length to grow out. My solution was to put my hair into braids once again, but this time it’s different. Since I haven’t been motivated to do my hair since the stay at home order, it’s been hard to keep motivation in braiding my hair. I’m not even half way done and it’s been 3 days. I’ve been avoiding going outside to even get groceries because I don’t want to wear a bonnet outside while I’m doing my hair. I don’t know why it’s such a big deal for me, but I feel like my inability to be motivated to do my hair is making me feel trapped??? Somehow????

166,"Hi,

I really wanted to go to a specific school for high school (currently a freshman) last year but I was not accepted. This year, I tried again and finally was accepted. I am currently looking to transfer high schools from one Catholic College Prep to another. I was recently accepted into the arguably best Catholic College Prep in the state I live in, transferring from my current one (also respectable) to it next year. Should I do this?

Pros:

1. The school starts at 8:30 versus my current one starting at 7:50. This is the main reason, as it really takes a toll on myself and my dad to get up and drive to school at 6:50.
2. Better Speech and Debate/Programs. My current high school has an arguably more decorated but newer team so far, but their program is way better at the event that I compete in. Additionally, I really feel like a fresh start in my program would go a long way to help me out. The program I would transfer to would have a somewhat losing streak currently :(
3. Nicer campus. This is pretty self explanatory.
4. Better teachers. While somewhat subjective, it is a consensus that the vast majority of the teachers at this school are of higher quality. I have talked to a plethora of students there, and they all generally agree that the school is excellent in teaching quality and care. It is something I'm feeling is lacking at my current school, as I constantly here complains from students about teachers not doing their job well. This is the biggest advantage in my opinion.
5. They allow me to take Calc BC before Junior Year, which would allow me to take AP stats my senior year, which is just a benefit I'm interested in. My current school won't allow me to do so.
6. I used to play ice hockey, and this school offers that program as a club sport for me to get back into playing again. I really wish I could do that at our current school, but there is not enough interest :(
7. It has a more prestigious feel, just a personal opinion.

Cons:

1. I'm losing a leadership position in a small school club next year for pre-med. Arguably, I could start a pre-med club at the new school, but I still feel bad about losing it.
2. My school's current speech and debate team is more decorated as a program itself, which I feel bad about losing out on. (multiple recent state championships)

I'm really wondering if I should do this. My gut tells me it's a good idea, but I'm afraid losing this leadership position would spell disaster for my application, plus losing out on being part of a really s&amp;d team. I also don't know if I can get some credit for being selected as an officer (could I put this on my application in future years?)

Additionally, would it be advisable for me to put on my application that my dad's health and wellbeing is the main reason I want to transfer? I really don't like making my dad get up so early in the morning, and it takes a toll on myself as well :(

P.S. It's an all-boys school? Do colleges hate/love this or have any feelings on it?

Any advice is welcome! I'm really stressing out right now.",24May2020,1

169,"Hello. This post isn’t intended to be racist and I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, if not, I’d appreciate being pointed to the right subreddit. Also, I’m not sure if this makes me racist or not, so I apologize in advance.

I’m 19 F and I’m light skin African American and could pass as racially ambiguous. Ive been thinking about this a lot and I’m starting to feel like a racist and hateful person when I’m truly not. Here are some of the events that occurred in my life that are making me start to think that I hate white people:

- Growing up, I went to a predominantly white school. I was always a smart, quiet kid in elementary school. I had a lot of nice white teachers and didn’t have my first black teacher until middle school. White students would always single me out and make me feel unwanted and I hung out with kids of color. I endured a lot of bullying and only a few white students wanted to be friends with me.

- In middle school, I started to have crushes and tried really hard to be white. I straightened my hair and always tried my best to fit in. None of the white boys were ever interested me and I was constantly rejected. 

- In high school, I changed schools and went to a mixed school with a lot more people of color. I finally felt like I fit in somewhere and started to accept myself. I grew into my looks quite a bit.

- Now in present day, in college, I’ve noticed that society is changing a lot. Natural hair is becoming acceptable, black women are starting to be viewed as beautiful. White men have shown interest in me, but I’ve always felt weird or sick when they tried to flirt with me. Why are finding me beautiful now? 
I’ve had people say: “I’ve never dated a black girl before!”, “I know how it feels to be discriminated against due to my adhd!”, “I’ve hung out with plenty of black people growing up!”, “I took an African dance class once!”, and of course the n word around me.

It’s getting to the point where I can’t talk to or listen a white person without thinking they are ignorant and/or racist. I stopped talking to this one guy that my friend introduced me to and that I really liked because he was white and tried to act like he knew what it was like to racial discriminated against. He also claimed that white privilege doesn’t exist and it’s just as hard for white people in America as black people. 

I physically get ill and try to politely abandon conversation with white people. I can order food with them at restaurants and work with them. I just can’t help but feel resentful and sick when they try to strike up a conversation with me, try to get to know me or flirt with me. 

I’d also like to add that I’m very respectful, I don’t try to avoid them and will never, ever think I’m better than them. I only get a feeling of resentment towards them when they try to connect with me. I feel like they have done so much to hurt me, tear down my race, blindly share ignorance and oppress me that I will never be able to befriend or even date a white person. 

Any thoughts or advice? I don’t want to feel this way anymore.",24May2020,1
170,"Ok so my mom and I dont get along. And so I want to live with her anymore. I just dont know how to ask to move out.

172,"
I have recently become interested in trying to be a better me. 

This was all triggered by a recent break up; I got dumped almost a month ago, and it sucked. I was not with this person for a long time at all; knew each other for two months, were together for one, and then that was it. 

I know we moved fairly quickly, in my head I thought: “I feel like you should just KNOW when you want to be with someone.” And so we became partners after a month of knowing each other. 

I feel as though this thought process had been implemented by social media and others’ experiences with relationships. This idea of just KNOWING when you want to be with someone. 

But I’m not saying that to blame others’ for the fall of my relationship. 

My partner decided to end things after an argument about him requesting to hangout with my girl friend, just the two of them, even though I was readily available to hangout at that moment as well. It was...abnormal to me for a partner to ask that. 

I won’t go too much into details about what happened because that’s not the point of this post. But the reasoning for the break up was that my partner said he would never feel the same way I felt about him; I had stronger feelings for him than he did for me. He wasn’t happy in the relationship. 

I cried, for days, because I felt so many emotions and feelings for him. And that sadness slowly turned into anger and then indifference. 

I began to reflect on who I was in the relationship, what I did wrong, what I did right, if I bettered him or remained a stagnant part of his life. This led me to reflect on myself. 

I attach quite easily to people and begin to develop feelings in relationships faster than most people. I accept people’s flaws even when they do not accept mine, and am unsure if it is because I am scared to lose them or want them to feel accepted by me. 

I care a lot about what others think of me, as much as I hate to admit that. I base my appearance and hide parts of my personality around those I want to impress or where I am going. I feel that I care TOO much about what people think of me. When someone does not like me, it makes me worry about what they’re saying about me and how it’s influencing the way others think of me. 

I am insecure about my appearance, my weight, my face, etc. I am so focused on my appearance at times it scares me. I’ve lost 15 pounds in the two months, which is a lot for me. I get very happy when I stand on the scale and it shows weight loss and become majorly depressed when it shows I’ve gained back one pound. I don’t feel sexy, I don’t feel confident in myself. 

I am just as insecure about my career, my life, where I am going. I dropped out of college after two years. I decided cosmetology school but with the pandemic and life problems, I decided to take a break and come back to it. Now I’m just hosting at a fine dining restaurant where I’m not happy, and feel misplaced. I have debt, like thousands of it, and I’m scared. 

YET, throughout all this, and after being broken up with, I began to reflect on who I am, who I was, and who I would like to be. 

I’ve dealt with a lot of crap in the past, things that literally sound like they’re out of a movie. As a teen, I was very very insecure, very unhappy, and dealt with things no one should have to deal with. As an “adult,” I’ve dealt with some things for sure, but not as traumatic as I did in high school. I feel a bit more secure but not fully, I thought I had a plan but I do not. 

I am beginning to smoke more weed, and it’s helped numb my emotions and thoughts but has also gotten me stuck in my thoughts if I’m really really high. After getting super high, I either become a bit more “enlightened” on my life and it’s a positive outcome OR I am drowning in negative thoughts and often lead myself into a pool of self pity. I also do more drugs like MDMA, shrooms. Those things. MDMA most definitely helps numb my pain. But shrooms are something completely different; I come out better, more mindful. I have had bad trips though. 

I also have began to understand a bit of manifestation and how to become a better person, and am trying to hold back rather than reacting to things in a split second, causing more damage. 

I WANT to become more aware of how I project myself onto others, I want to feel less attached to strangers that show me a small amount of kindness and care. Not to not appreciate them, but to not become divulged into them when that’s not what they want nor would it have a positive outcome for me. 

I want to learn how to deal with a new friendship that’s kind of more than that but most definitely not a relationship. How can I not become emotionally attached to that person?

How can I love myself more? Is meditation the answer? Should I continue practicing manifestation?

These are questions only I can answer of course, but I am posting this unnecessarily long and unnecessarily personal reflection in this subreddit, because I would like your ideas and thoughts of how I can better myself (like what has helped you) and if you share a similar experience to mine. I am interested in reading more about becoming more self aware, enlightened, and more loving of myself.

174,"Hi,

My dad loves dogs but my mom was scared of them and is really strict with cleanliness. When I was little, we had a dog that she didn't let inside. Which of course was wrong, we eventually gave the dog away to someone who could provide for him better.

Fast forward eighteen years, I got a medium-sized dog after doing a lot of research. I love him to death. Eventually, I took him to meet my parents, and my dad fell in love with him. My mom, to everyone's surprise include hers, started liking him. He's really hyper at my apartment, his training school, and his daycare. For some reason, he was really well behaved every time he visited their home pre-pandemic. She even let him on the couch (again, she's a bit neurotic about cleanliness). It didn't take long for her and my dad to repeatedly offer to look after him because I'm a single dog owner with a full-time job. The proposed that I get him on weekends, which I laughed off.

Fast forward to the pandemic. My dad spent a month with her at home constantly until the city started reopening. Now he's often going out with his friends again (which I don't like for obvious reasons) and she is lonely and depressed. She's not a big extrovert, but she likes to go dance classes and staying busy. She just called me and asked if she could try looking after him and see how it goes. Before, it was my dad regularly calling to ask. She doesn't want to adopt a dog so far, partly because she doesn't know how the shelter dogs will act in her home. She asked how I take care of him and doesn't have a problem with the responsibility ( she actually wants to bathe him more frequently). I suggested easier pets, such as cats and birds, but she wants a more affectionate pet like mine. My dog loves any person he meets.

I'm on the fence about this. I was worried about her getting COVID bacteria from him (I don't know we have it). But she would disinfect everything thoroughly and give him a bath. I've seen a few other Redditors mentioning that their parents took their dogs in during these times because they became even busier as medical staff, or they lost their jobs.

**Pros:**

She loves looking after people and I can see her enjoying his company even though animals are different. He's actually really clingy to people in general, and I feel bad on days I have to work in the office. I come home during lunch to let him out and play with him, but I wish I was around him more.

No daycare. My office is moving this week to the other side of town. We're working in the office rotationally, so I'm going to have to take him to daycare on my office days until I move (I already signed a lease) unless my parents look after him.

**Cons:**

I would eventually take him back, as early as two weeks. That might make her sad, or prompt her to adopt a dog (which is good). I'm just not sure.

She has an idea of what dog parenting takes because she often asks me out of curiosity. But she's still inexperienced.

Any advice is appreciated.

I always appreciate that however the problem is whenever there is something he asks, he thinks I have to do it or I have to say it because he thinks everything I owe in my life is because of him. I mean yes I appreciate to him I try to help him as much as I can but he wasn’t the one finish high school or doing all of the work in college or working double jobs to help my self and family I did those things.

Then I was so overwhelmed I left the house and break my fast outside. He is always like this isn’t the first time he is doing stuff like this, he thinks he owns me but I do not type of guy that I will do anything that people tell me to do.

Growing up my older brother and I seemed close at the time but looking back he was always very violent and unforgiving. He would constantly physically and mentally harm me because of our 3 year age difference. Of course I was an annoying, little twat that definitely bothered him at times and didn't learn, but does that justify his constant violent and damaging actions. My actions of being annoying is something that constantly causes a conflict in my mind of whether I deserved what I got. The real kicker to this is that my mother would always side with him. For example, last Thanksgiving he attempted to toss me down the stairs because he couldn't hear the tv. I was playing, admittedly rather loud, with my younger brothers when he tried this. My mother came in to break up the fight only for her to send me down stairs. Of course his pride was hurt so he came down and tried to beat me up like he always did. I was able to evade him by acting as if I was going to fight and then sprinted up the stairs. I believe he's always been the favorite because outside of how he acts towards me, he actually seems like a good person. To this day he still shows hate for me and will attempt to harm me if I displease his life at all. I don't what to do anymore and losing my life over the constant pain of feeling like I ruined everything. I just want to know if I really did deserve the damage and should accept it.",24May2020,1

181,"I decided to break up with my girlfriend because I lost my feelings for her and it was getting complicated for the both of us.


We had a lot of great moments, but I have been noticing problems on our relationship which I thought would have no impact on us. But it took a certain time where I can't handle those problems anymore and just lost my feelings for her.


Since we never live together, we mostly communicate through chatting, calling, and all kinds of those stuff. But we also go out on Saturdays or Holidays.


But since it's quarantine we haven't been able to go out and that's where my feelings got lost. She doesn't talk to me, I always try to start a conversation and sometimes she doesn't reply, or reply a day later.
She would completely ignore me a whole day. I don't know if she has a problem or she doesn't love me anymore.


I decided to call her and told her that this isn't gonns work for the both of us, and she started crying and asking why. I decided to tell her everything, what I felt and my thoughts.

Since she was my first Girlfriend I don't know how to cope to these situations.

183,"Hi,

My dad loves dogs but my mom was scared of them and is really strict with cleanliness. When I was little, we had a dog that she didn't let inside. Which of course was wrong, we eventually gave the dog away to someone who could provide for him better.

Fast forward eighteen years, I got a medium-sized dog after doing a lot of research. I love him to death. Eventually, I took him to meet my parents, and my dad fell in love with him. My mom, to everyone's surprise include hers, started liking him. He's really hyper at my apartment, his training school, and his daycare. For some reason, he was really well behaved every time he visited their home pre-pandemic. She even let him on the couch (again, she's a bit neurotic about cleanliness). It didn't take long for her and my dad to repeatedly offer to look after him because I'm a single dog owner with a full-time job. The proposed that I get him on weekends, which I laughed off.

Fast forward to the pandemic. My dad spent a month with her at home constantly until the city started reopening. Now he's often going out with his friends again (which I don't like for obvious reasons) and she is lonely and depressed. She's not a big extrovert, but she likes to go dance classes and staying busy. She just called me and asked if she could try looking after him and see how it goes. Before, it was my dad regularly calling to ask. She doesn't want to adopt a dog so far, partly because she doesn't know how the shelter dogs will act in her home. She asked how I take care of him and doesn't have a problem with the responsibility ( she actually wants to bathe him more frequently). I suggested easier pets, such as cats and birds, but she wants a more affectionate pet like mine. My dog loves any person he meets.

I'm on the fence about this. I was worried about her getting COVID bacteria from him (I don't know we have it). But she would disinfect everything thoroughly and give him a bath. I've seen a few other Redditors mentioning that their parents took their dogs in during these times because they became even busier as medical staff, or they lost their jobs.

**Pros:**

She loves looking after people and I can see her enjoying his company even though animals are different. He's actually really clingy to people in general, and I feel bad on days I have to work in the office. I come home during lunch to let him out and play with him, but I wish I was around him more.

No daycare. My office is moving this week to the other side of town. We're working in the office rotationally, so I'm going to have to take him to daycare on my office days until I move (I already signed a lease) unless my parents look after him.

My mom has actually had depression before and she's seen a doctor for it. She's been much better in recent years, but it's gradually coming back during this crisis.

**Cons:**

I would eventually take him back, as early as two weeks. That might make her sad, or prompt her to adopt a dog (which is good). I'm just not sure.

She has an idea of what dog parenting takes because she often asks me out of curiosity. But she's still inexperienced.

I would miss him a lot, a small con compared to what my mom is going through.

Any advice is appreciated.

tldr: My mom already likes my dog, and wants to try looking after him. Is it a bad idea?",24May2020,1

Ok so someone I know has this thing they do constantly. It starts once they are introduced to something new (whether it be clothes from a specific store, different animals, cleaning products, etc). They will subconsciously go out and buy another... and another of whatever it is for months, maybe years, at a time. And all of a sudden, they will realize they have too much of it and then they go out sooner or later again and start the trend over with something new. It wastes all their money; ITS NEVER ESSENTIAL ITEMS. One example: My sister showed this person her new pet bearded dragon... next thing we know, they had gone out to pet stores and reptile conventions for over two years purchasing bearded dragons and other exotic lizards for no reason. They never held them or interacted with these lizards. After two years, they sold them or even gave away these expensive lizards. GUESS THAT DISORDER BECAUSE I HAVE NO CLUE! :) :) :)",24May2020,1

186,"Okay, first off. I'm going to be paying a company to take care if this, regardless of the answers I get. So, kind of a long story. My parents bought this house in 1999. I've lived I  it for 19 years. I moved out 2 years ago, and recently moved back in. Well, my parents got a divorce 10 years ago, and my mom made it clear she wanted to screw my dad over, and take the house. She hasn't maintained it at all. The siding is rotting. Theres moss all over the roof. One section if the roof was leaking, so I paid to have it replaced. Now I'm worried about the well. A couple years ago, when  I didnt live here, my mother called me, and my brother that a tree fell, and destroyed the well house, and that she need us to come but the tree. Shortly before we left. Either my brother or me. Or both of us quickly put a wood panel from the destroyed well house over the well, and that was that. 2 years later, I randomly start thinking about the well. I go check on it, and its covered in vegetation, so I clear all that out. The wood panel we put on had either rotted, exposing about a 2-3"" gap, exposing the well water to foreign object. Either it rotted that way, or, we but it on wrong. So I took that off to look at the well water. It's kinda blueish greenish, and it has some sticks in it, which I took out, then i put another piece of plywood over it to avoid further contamination. I told my mom, and she wasnt worried, but I am, because she said it hasnt been cleaned in 10 years, and other than that, it was never cleaned. We got a cheap water test from the store, and it came back clean, but that cant be true. It hasnt been cleaned in 10 years, and he internet says its suppose to be cleaned once a year. My mom still thinks I'm overeating. So, do you think it's my responsibility? I know that it might be kind of my fault that its dirty, but it's my moms well, and she should have made sure that she learned about why it takes to maintain a well, but clearly she hasnt. Also, 2 years ago, when my brother, and I came to get the tree off, that its the first time over ever dont anything involving a well. Wouldnt any home owner who actually cares go, and check on the well sometimes?",24May2020,1

191,"I don’t really know how to explain this but I’ll do my best. I’ve known my roommate, I’ll call her Jill, for about a year and a half. I met her through a mutual friend and we decided to move in together pretty fast because I was already in the process of renewing the lease. I noticed some weird stuff about her almost immediately after she moved in, but we’ve always gotten along and she’s really clean so I kind of just ignored things when they would come up. But now that we’ve been quarantining together, I can help but notice her really weird behavior.

The reason why I think she has multiple personality disorder is because every couple of days her behavior changes really drastically between like 3 different personalities I guess? I don’t know how to explain it. Sometimes she’s exactly how she was when I met her, this really bubbly personality, kind of ditzy if I’m being honest but actually really smart if you listen to what she’s saying. Just overall a happy-go-lucky person. She always does her makeup when she’s like this and she dresses in girls clothes, sometimes she borrows mine. I don’t know how to describe it, she wears leggings and crop tops and heels and stuff.

Then, sometimes she’s completely different. She acts like a guy, almost? She’s much goofier and makes guy jokes? Again, I’m trying my best to explain but it’s difficult. She wears completely different clothing, like loose khakis and baggy sweaters/shirts. Not like she’s just having a lazy day, but like she’s dressing like a guy. Her mannerisms are completely different, too, and she sits differently and talks differently, the tone of her voice is different. It’s still her, like we can continue conversations we were having when she was acting more girly, but it’s like interacting with a completely different person.

And then sometimes she’s not like either of those personalities. She’s much more quiet and serious, and she doesn’t have any of her usual energy or enthusiasm. She obsessively makes lists. She’ll rewrite lists she’s already written and it’ll be the exact same thing she wrote before and she just replaces the old list with the new one. She actually gets really rude, too. The slightest thing sets her off. It’s not like we get into arguments it’s just like, I’ll walk into the room and she immediately stops what she’s going, gathers up all her things, and leaves the area. But when she’s like that for some reason she can cook really well? Like when she’s her other personalities she hates cooking and refuses to do it. She’ll make drinks and that’s it. But then when she’s the serious personality it’s like living with a professional chef. I don’t get it. When I tried to get her to cook when she was all happy-go-lucky she just looked at me like I was from another planet and giggled like she didn’t understand what I was asking her.

I looked up multiple personality disorder and I’m not a psychologist or anything but it seems to fit her. It said that childhood trauma can cause it, and I remember she told me about a bunch of horrific things her parents did to her when she was really young, like serious abuse. But she only ever talks about her childhood when she’s her serious personality. I mean even then she doesn’t really talk about it unless I specifically ask. Otherwise, she completely lies about her childhood. If she’s her happy-go-lucky personality she said that she grew up really wealthy with a sister, but if she’s her serious personality she told me that she grew up really poor with brothers.

Then she has these weird moments where she just acts totally insane. I remember once we were driving and she started screaming and crying and we pulled over and she was screaming about how all of her nails were coming off and she kept like pressing her nails down on the dashboard. I didn’t know what to do I just stared at her and tried to tell her it was okay and then after a few minutes she calmed down and started driving again.

The nail thing is actually really common like she has this obsession with her nails and her cuticles. She pushes back her cuticles and cuts them so close that they start bleeding. She covers them up with bandaids but I know what it is because I walked in on her in the bathroom like twice now when she’s doing it.

At this point I really just don’t know what to do. Can I even do anything? I mean I’ve never felt unsafe around her or anything, except maybe for that one time in the car but she pulled over pretty quickly. I just feel like I have some sort of responsibility? I haven’t talked to her boyfriend about it yet but I’m sure he’s aware of the different personalities. Maybe we could convince her to get checked out?

My ex and I moved into a double-wide trailer in 2015, and even though I was the one paying for it, when the title finally came both names were on the title.

Eventually broke up, I moved, had to change my number three times. Harassment kept coming, and I had him waiting for me in the parking lot of my old job. I tried to get a restraining order, didn't work. I had to quit my job and moved again to get away from him.

I just got a Facebook message from a new account of his telling me I had to transfer over the title or I would be sued for back rent. I signed paperwork with the park and they took me off the rental agreement a long time ago. I do want it out of my name but I have no idea what I am doing. I was told to go to Redding, CA and transfer the title at some state building, I drove there and it had been closed, the next closest one is in Sacramento. I'm not comfortable driving that far and in such a big city. I was told that I didn't have to go there I could do it from the DMV. Now I'm even more confused.

It seems obvious, that I should be doing the second option. But, I’m a very emotional dude. Once I meet a nice girl.. I get attached. QUICK. 

A new girl (she’s 3 years older then me), started at my store a few weeks ago, and we’ve gotten along REALLY well. The only thing is she has a kid, but other then that she’s just the best person and we get along great. 

Any who, I’m also studying to take my real estate exam next month and that’s something I’d be doing together with my father, who’s also studying to get his license to sell real estate. 

I sort of have it good. I don’t pay rent, I pay over $300 for a car payment and pay for minor bills like my phone , car insurance and credit cards. 

Besides real estate, I’ve been working out/eating healthier (lost nearly 25 pounds since November), in the process of learning guitar, and now I want to learn about investing in the stock market. 

I feel like I went overboard , opening accounts with TD Ameritrade and Robinhood. It was completely on impulse without any thought put into it. Now I have to wait for both of them to approve my accounts. 

I have no idea how to invest or how to set up my accounts. I guess I’ve put a lot on my plate that now it’s hard to balance it all out and prioritize what I should be focusing on mainly. I’m very paranoid about not being successful that I try to do all of these things all at once. 

In the back of my head, there’s always that urge to go and meet the girl of my dreams. But, my feelings get the best of me sometimes and neglect the important things in life.

She still wanted to leave me for him though. So I called her mom and explained the situation to her, hoping she could get her to leave him and come back to me.

209,"Hi! 👋First time posting here, any advice would be greatly appreciated. So me (16Nonbinary) and my friend (16M) have been on the phone with eachother pretty much every second since self isolation started. Sometimes we just talk, but a lot of the time we're playing video games, mostly Call of Duty Warzone and Minecraft. It's been fun mostly, but I've noticed lately that he seems to constantly question my intelligence. If I don't notice something like an enemy he'll spend a minute calling me an idiot/dumbass. Any decision I make that he doesn't get is a 'dumbass move'. He always says it really annoys him that I'm not competitive. It's to the point where it feels like I can't do anything without having my intelligence questioned, and that he thinks he's superior to me in everything we do. Am I being too sensitive? Is he just joking? Should I confront him? Any help is appreciated 👌",24May2020,1
210,"Long story short, I’m a student driver. We have to take 3 two hour long sessions with a driving school before our driving test. I was on my third today and it was awful. I had a migraine, I had to go to the bathroom, I had a stomach bug, and the instructor was awful. I was in the worst shape and I definitely should not have been driving but because of corona virus I couldn’t reschedule. Well I just barely ran a red light by accident because we were practicing doing slow downs to yellow. The guy didn’t mark anything and seemed cool with it but I’m terrified out of my mind. I was in a driving school car. Can somebody tell me how that works? Will the driving school receive the red light notice and send it to my parents? Will I get in huge trouble? Did it even take a picture?",24May2020,1

214,"My family has taken social distancing pretty seriously, because my grandparents are living with us.  We go outside wearing masks when we walk our dog or get groceries, they make us shower right away from coming back if we meet anyone, etc.

This bothers me a little bit because I’ve seen on snapchat him hanging out with his friends, at house parties still.

I actually have a good bit saved up, but I'm afraid that when I move out of home I'll loose money far faster than I assume, and I'd rather look at the cheapest options possible.

The person who I'm splitting rent with, however, has decided that they are the most interested in a luxury department that costs $1,600, saying that if we split it, it'll only be $800 each. 

Should I put my foot down and say that if they want to live in a luxury appartment that I'll pay half of what our regular rent would've been (around $300-400) and they can pay the rest? Or would I be kinda an asshole for not spending 50/50 with them?

218,"Hi everyone! I’ll try and keep this short and I’ll try to not ramble on. 
About 5..maybe 6 years ago I got a kitten. I named him Haywire. He was the best kitten and he grew into a very loving handsome little companion. I was an idiot and did not get him fixed. (I will admit at the time I was uneducated on this matter and didn’t think getting him fixed was a big deal. Please don’t judge me, I’ve educated myself and now I know it’s best for cat pets to be fixed) after about 2 years he ran away. I was so heartbroken. He was such a happy little dude, I didn’t think he’d leave me. Well duh!! He’s not neutered of course he’s going to travel to find some erm..pussy. (Sorry lol!) So the seasons change and time goes on, (I assume he’s dead) Then spring rolls around and  low and behold! The little bastard shows up in my back yard. It’s been almost a year since I’ve seen him! He’s huge! He’s rough looking, but I love him up, feed him, leave water out for him. I forced him inside the house and he immediately sprayed and sort of went berserk, so I let him back out. He disappeared for another year and came back again in May. Where I live we have pretty hardcore winters so I really don’t think he’s wild. Unless he’s that smart and lucky... I sort of believe he has another owner, however like I said he’s very rough looking and not very clean and still not neutered. Last May he would come and go but never stay. He finally disappeared for good during the summer months. Until today. Just like every year, I’m outside enjoying my gardening when Haywire comes strutting his ass through my back yard and greets me with his little nudges and homely meows. I am certain I will see him at least another few times before the cold season sets in. So! The advice I need is- should I scoop him up, take him to the vet and get him neutered, get him his shots, and what ever else he may need to be healthy? Should I keep him? Or since it’s been so long and he’s basically living his own life estranged from me do I just leave him alone and let him be? If he is living wild than he’s living on borrowed time. But I think it would be very hard to keep him here at home. If he has a new preferred owner than I don’t want to take him away from that either. But on the other side of things he’s technically my cat, and he obviously remembers his home as he shows up every year. I don’t really know what’s best for him at this point. Any advice would be much appreciated. 
Again please don’t judge me. I have a cat and a dog who I’ve been very responsible with. Both neutered and happy and healthy. I’ve learned from my mistakes. 
Thank you!",24May2020,1

Mainly cause we talked so much during last summer and now this ones already here and well she's not.

221,"Background: So I'm 18 just graduated from high school. I've always been told I act, maturely, older than my age.  I don't plan on going to college right now. I don't think I'm that attractive (hence to why I'm on a diet right now) but other people say I am. But no girl has ever said ""you're so hot"" or anything like that. I'm going to go to tech school for heating and air conditioning. I work at a local grocery store as an office clerk full time. Everybody at work loves working with me because I understand people. My manager loves it when I work, the store manager has said I'm one of the most valuable people in the store and if I wanted to, I could move up in the retail business. What most people don't see is my struggle with depression, cutting and suicide.  I try to not let that affect my work. I try to hide it. We wear long sleeve shirts at work and now I can't roll my sleeves up because of the judgment that will come.  When people say ""how are you doing?"" It's always the same response ""good"" or ""fine."" I don't tell people about how I'm feeling. I only let a few of my close friends know about how I'm actually feeling. Because what would be someone's response to ""I feel suicidal today"" ""I feel like it would be better if I wasn't here?"" I do my best to cover it up. But some days I just can't handle it and it does affect my work. I've never fucked up really bad or anything I just don't perform how I usually do. I've had 1 girlfriend in my life and it only lasted for 3 months. I just feel like no girl wants me. No girls I've met want a serious relationship and just end up being friends. But I just want someone to love me as much as I love them. I mean am I asking too much for someone to cuddle with me for hours on end? Am I asking too much if I want to feel wanted by my SO? I just want to find the love of my life and be happy and feel wanted and them love me as much as I love them and put as much effort into the relationship as I do. I want someone to care about the things I do. It really hits you hard when you're drunk and realize nobody but your family really cares about you. I want someone to care about me and want me and need me. Yes I'm very insecure about myself and everything about myself. Tonight is one of those nights where I feel like it'd be better if I wasn't here.

223,"My VA disability recently got updated. I received a decent back pay from this. I will be finishing my Masters in December. My wife will have her BA in March of 2021. 

With this money there is an opportunity to move to a potentially nicer neighborhood or home for the next year while my wife and I finish our degrees. 

Basically if we choose to move, which would likely only be for one year, we would end up with half as much in our savings than if we just stayed put. 


Another way to look at it. If we stay put we have enough saved to not gain another cent, and we’d be good on bills for the next 3ish years. If we moved we’d only be good for about 1.5 years without earning another penny.


Everybody we’ve asked for advice from has told us to do what we want. or do what we feel would be best. We’re both just so torn on what to do at this point that we cannot really decide.

228,"I’ve done awful things in the past. I mean big time. I was an abuser and hurt my ex and her family. I was very controlling and manipulative. Ive done many awful things but the worst thing I did was try and talk her into doing sexual stuff with her slightly younger, but at the time, underage sisters and to record it. My ex and I had just graduated high school and they were still in high school. These conversations were all through text and her sisters saw the messages while she was away from her phone and the authorities were contacted. I want to note that nothing sexual actually happened thankfully. I should have been locked up but they decided not to press charges. I got off easy. Unfortunately, the relationship didn’t end there and I was still abusive towards her. I was possessive and had to know where she was and what she was doing or else I would freak out. Day in and day out I just ruled over her. She eventually had enough and left me. I don’t blame her of course and I have no ill feelings towards her. This all happened about 7 years ago and everyday it still haunts me. I thought of contacting my ex thinking that closure would help, but my therapist doesn’t think it’s a good idea so I’m not going to. She’s married now so popping up in her life out of the blue would be inappropriate and selfish to do. My therapist thinks I’m beating myself up too much but they don’t know about the crimes I did. I’m so ashamed of it and wish it never happened so it’s hard to talk about. My ex’s sisters and their mom has forgiven me, but I can’t forgive myself for it. Even if my ex forgave me, I’d probably still be eaten up by this guilt everyday. I always wanted to be the kind of person that people looked up to. I feel so evil and I hate myself.

230,"Using my dummy porn account because I don’t feel like making a fresh throwaway.

I recently came out as trans-pan to a friends group I recently fell into, and most of them are LGBT as well and everyone was very accepting. For the record I identify as female.

That said, we had a party a few weeks back (yeah yeah I know social distancing), and I hadn’t slept much that night so the host offered me and a few others to crash there. One of the other people crashing here was this person, we’ll call him K.

Now, nothing about K is initially intimidating or strikes you as someone who might be a predator. He’s very boisterous and comedic and effeminately gay. Nothing about him seemed inherently dangerous, so in a room with 15 other people I barely know I didn’t really take notice of him, partly because I don’t find him attractive. At most, I found him slightly annoying but chalked it up to us all being drunk.

Fast forward to me being the first one to go crash, I passed out in one of the bedrooms the host set me up in. A couple of people woke me up in the interim but eventually K comes in real late and was going to sleep in there as well. At this point I’m really out of it, and only vaguely aware that he’d entered. He lays down, and I think he’s just gonna crash, its a queen sized mattress and there’s plenty of room.

Before long however he’s spooning me, and then starts groping me, going just about everywhere except my genitalia. I was so nervous I was afraid to move. I didn’t want to say anything or give any indication that I was awake and aware, I didn’t know what he’d do. In hindsight I think he mistook my inaction as consent. I just didn’t know what to do.

Next day he’s trying to act all interested and affectionate, making it very clear he’s into me. This pattern builds over the following weeks and people start to notice, some start to get the wrong idea and I keep trying to push him away and let him down easy because I don’t want to alienate myself by starting a drama, I didn’t have a lot of friends up to this point and part of me doesn’t wanna lose what I’d found, but I digress. I was afraid to confront him.

Finally though we get to two days ago. Me and K are both hanging with a girl that I’m kind of into, we’ll call her C. It’s just the three of us.

Now K and C both have a particular high-energy chemistry between each other and a long personal history, I’m the newcomer. I ended up being there hanging with them for like over 24 hours and crashed there again. K comes into the room I’m sleeping in again and tries it again only this time I wake up and call him out and say this is not ok. He gets upset and leaves, acting like I’d led him on or something. (I heard later from C he spent that whole night after that pacing on the back deck.)

Next day, we’re still a bit drunk from the night before and still hanging, and we’re on the couch and he starts getting handsy and I keep pulling away. Finally C goes out for a cigarette and I lay into K. I tell him I’m not at all interested and that he needs to stop touching me because it makes me uncomfortable. He accepted it and we let it go, or at least I did, because I thought that was the end of it.

Now today C wanted to hang out, so we got sandwiches and went to the park and talked and she told me K had been talking shit about me, that he was crying and super hung up on me and apparently he led C to believe that I had consented, when I didn’t. He’s still hung up on that first night when I was mostly asleep and he didn’t ask permission. 

I told her everything I typed above, what I said to K about rejecting his advances, and that was when she told me he was a registered sex offender and that this had happened before, and she thought he’d been reformed. 

So now I’m afraid. And angry. This guy not only won’t let it go but he’s gonna try and alienate me to my new friends because I won’t sleep with him? And he’s a fucking sex offender? Like what do I do? If he touches me again, especially if it’s in front of someone else, I may end up hitting him, and I don’t want an assault charge but at the same time I don’t have the money to get legal involved. I don’t know what to do about it and I’m past the point of trying to spare his feelings now that I know this.


For the record, no one else in our group but C and myself know that K is a sex offender, presumably because no one bothered to google him.

What do I do? How do I get rid of him?",24May2020,1
231,"The past month or two, I (F) found myself kind of thinking about him a lot and just remembering memories with him. I thought I was just thinking in general, whatever. The past two weeks I thought, what if I like him? I really don’t know if I do. I struggle identifying emotions because I have depression that causes severe apathy, I really don’t feel a thing. I have been feeling this weird gut feeling and I think about him a lot. 

He has a girlfriend of 6 months if I’m remembering correctly and she is an angel. I love her, she is a sweet girl. He mentioned last week about him having some issues with her and honestly sounded like he was thinking about breaking up with her. I was surprised but also I was kind of glad? They have a good relationship from what I have seen and I like his girlfriend and I want the best for him/him to be happy but I don’t get why I would be somewhat glad if they broke up. Ever since then, I guess he thought about it more and really doesn’t think they will break up for a long time and I was weirdly disappointed. 

I only think I may like him is because I wouldn’t be feeling like this about his relationship unless I did. Also, when I first met him, I did fall in love with him but I had no clue why. He ended up liking me as well but I was convinced at the time he could’ve been gay or that if we got together it would make everything weird and some issues with my depression making me think stuff. The way I’m feeling now sort of resembles how I felt then. 

Also, I think his brother is gorgeous and have a stupid little crush on him but I know nothing would happen, whatever. With saying that my best friend lost A LOT of weight and has looked similar to his brother before. With losing the weight, I looks ACTUALLY like his brother. Its making me a little crazy because as I thought that his brother was hot and he looks identical to him, thats making me think that I think I like him. 

Ever since I first liked him, I have noticed that he always flirts with me. It is in a friendly way I believe but he DOES IT ALL THE TIME. Its hardcore but its what makes up our friendship together in a way. Also, I did hookup with him one time (didn’t have sex), but nothing else. He always brings it up and whenever we talk about the past, he will always mention “hey remember when we were in love with each other?” Also, I feel like I should note that his current girlfriend is kinda sorta exactly like me. Same hair color, similar personality, same morals. I don’t know. 

In addition to all that, I am a 19 year old that has never been in any sort of relationship and I don’t know what any lovey dovey things feel like. I haven’t had a crush on anyone since I was 14 years old and I never been on a date. All this talking like someone that’s in middle school is because I have a relationship mind 7th grade level. I don’t know how to do this shit. I don’t know if I am just lonely and need to find someone or if this is something I am truly feeling for my friend or even feeling anything at all. 

Sorry for this whole rant, I don’t know what to think or how I feel. Please help me, it would help. 

TL;DR: Not sure if I am falling in love with my friend because I have a lack of apathy due to depression or I was glad he was maybe going to break up with his girlfriend or if its because he lost weight and looks like his brother that I have a little crush on.",24May2020,1

235,"Ever since I moved to my new apartment 6 months ago, I've been forced to listen to the tortured screams of a donkey every. single. night. 

The guy living across from my apartment complex has a small farm (more like a big garden) along with a horse, a donkey, and three big aggressive dogs. I'm not sure what breed they are, I've never gotten a good look at them and have only seen the donkey once. His property is pretty big, but his animals are very loud and his dogs bark at anything from a mile away. 

Every night when I'm smoking I hear the wails of this pitiful creature often accompanied by crazed barking. Sometimes its really gut-wrenching. I've been living here 6 months and its every single night. Who knows how long this donkey has been being tortured by these dogs?

Im not really sure what I can do about it, I never see the donkey being abused by the dogs. idk really if they're just scaring it, I've never lived around a donkey, I dont know what their temperament is. It does seem to be in pain though. 

I dont know whether or not the owner suspects this, but he's a busy guy, I doubt hes home often. 

One big thing is, whether I'm wrong or right and I do something about it, I'm thinking my proximity to his house and the timing might lead him to believe it was me. 

He owns and rents out several of the condos here, *including my own*. All the neighbors around here have been living here for years, so why would he think it was them?

What would they even be able to do if I reported it?

236,"I've posted this before and one person did awnser but l would like more advice.

I live with my mom and her and me (16F) do not have the same vieuws on certain stuff. One of them being that she has a certain religion that she wants me to participate in and me not wanting to. She let me alone and never forced me to participate again after l disgused it with her. But she didn't listen this time.


My mom is a good person, caring, stern, always made sure we had everything we needed etc. But she is also a guilt tripper, get's angry easily and never wants to admit she's wrong. She also almost never says she's sorry and she's really stubborn, wich l am too. She is also really impatient and get's frustated easily. When we were kids she used to punish us for things we deserved and told us what it was that was bad but didn't tell us why. She also expects us to know stuff she didn't teach us and we have no interest in. 


She was raised in a farm and learned to do everything really young and she espected us to be the same. When l tell her l don't know what she is talking about or that l don't know how to do something, she compares me to herself at my age or asks me why l can't do/know something or why l didn't look it up. I always retort that she never trached me to do that or that l have no interest to look it up. She also has the mentality that kids can't give their opinion unless it's something concerning them personally. So basicly if she wants to go shopping with you that day and you don't want to, you have to go but if it's you not wanting a specifick color of shirt then it's okay.


Anyway she is a good mom and has sacrificed a lot for us, teached us values and respect and has gone through alot for us and l know that. But she is really irritating sometimes. Normally she understands l don't want to participate in her religious activity but our neighbor took interest so she forced me too participate too. It's nothing bad. Just reading the bible and praying. But l was so angry because she forced me to participate and didn't respect my opinion. I was moody the entire session and when the gest was going back home l just exploded and we began arguying. 


She said it was her duty as my mom to guide me on the right path and that god would come question her later if she didn't etc. We began hardcore arguying. It didn't help my moms partner was there too. I just couldn't anymore and basicly told ger that l can't wait till l'm 18 to finally get away from her and for her to leave me the hell alone. And more arguying ensued. 


I knew l hit her hard and l was sorry but she hurt me too and that is what she doesn't want to accept. She began telling me she expected this from my siblings but never me. I am the youngest and the only one who is studying and treated her right. So l didn't apologize untill l few days later after watching her drift. So we began talking and l was trying to apologize and she kept mentioning the things she's sacrifised and all the thing she did, endured and tried doing for her kids. And she also told me the story of how she almost died at my birth. But what she didn't mention was that she almost died because while pregnant woth me she had multiple kidney stones.


She was basicly guilt tripping me. She doesn't do it conciusly either. She didn't apologize to me mind you. After a long talk of me trying to explain myself to her and she guilt tripping me and me saying that l already knew all the things she went trough etc. I apologized, but now every time she brings it up and tries to make me feel bad about it.


I talked with my older brother and he said that l couldn't teach an old dog new tricks and that he knew what l was feeling but that l had to respect mom and that we need her in our lives and to just endure and ignore. My granny has told me the same thing, bit l already lost my patience ones.


I really need advice on how to handle her. She is dominican by the way. I was raised in a caribean island and my dad is also from there.
Sorry about grammatical and spelling errors, english isn't my first language.




TLDR: Mom and l don't see eye to eye and l ended up blowing up on her and seriously hurting her feelings (l apologized) and now l'm trying not to blow up again.",24May2020,1

The thing is, we’ve been talking for like a day now and she said she was wondering if I could go to the beach with her sometime. I told her sure but know damn well I prolly won’t do that, she’s also never asked me about my age which is sort of weird I guess and she also asked if we could FaceTime tonight to which I said sure because i want to know.

242,"I've always felt rather invisible, which when I was younger my mother told me it was younger for a middle child to feel that way and that it shouldn't matter. But, I'm starting to think it isn't just me beimg anxious.
Whenever I'm around my brother's friends, they ignore me and almost never speak to me. Which, okay, they're my brother's friends, not mine.
Then, I realised that even when I'm with my own friends, I can be around them for hours and not a single one will acknoweldge my presence.
But, I noticed, on the occassion where people do notice me, I really hate it. Like, I'll give my friend a gift and even them saying ""thank you"" makes me want to disappear.
I really like giving people things, like I would genuinely give away everything I had if I could. I love seeing people's faces and their reactions when they get a gift. But I hate it when they turn any attention to me, so I prefer to give everything anonymously.
If I could make everyone forget about me and just turn into some invisble entity that watches over people, I would do so in a heartbeat. And, I don't think that's normal. I feel like a freak for not wanting to be seen at all, for wishing I could just be a silent giver that's never acknoweldged. I used to hate feeling invisible, but now I can't stand being seen.
And the weird part is, no matter what I do, people almost never notice me anyway. I've gotten away with so much because most of the time it's like people can't even see or hear me.
Why am I like this? Is there anyone else that feels this way? Is there a way to fix it and be normal?",24May2020,1

244,"Background info: I came from a poor family and it has always made me believe that money is the most important thing in the world. At the age of 17 I got a scholarship at a university. I worked for 2 years while studying and graduated at 21. After graduating I decided to live alone with the money I collected. I dedicated myself entirely to my profession (almost every weekend) and I was lucky to be recognized. At the age of 25 I became a senior consultant (SAP) with a very good remuneration.

After getting some of what I wanted, I lost all my motivation. I no longer have the dedication to learn new things and keep improving. And that was all I had.
It made me think of the decisions I made in my life. I am almost 2 months without seeing anyone (Social distance). In my life whenever I felt that someone was trying to get close to me, I kept away. I never had any personal relationship. It seems that all these past 4 years have been meaningless.

I'm so used to living alone that I don't know if I'll be able to truly share my feelings with anyone. But for some reason l recently miss having someone close, being loved by someone. I am afraid to waste my youth for things that are not worth it.

246,"I am a 17 year old junior in high school who has spent the better part of the last three years convincing myself that I have close friends, but am slowly realizing that that is not the case. 

In my freshman year, I became best friends with someone I met in my geography class, and he introduced me to his friend group. For the sake of the story, let's call him John. I was as close as could be with these people, constantly hanging out, enjoying lunch together, and overall being a stable community. At the beginning of sophomore year, John's entry into drugs and other random circumstance led to this group falling apart, as well as my close relationship with John. 

As this era ended, I moved into the bulk of my sophomore year, where I met my current girlfriend, who I will call Miranda. I spent most of my year with Miranda and her three friends, but I quickly realized that they weren't super fond of me being around. I was the boy invading in their all-girl friend group, and Miranda was the only one of them who had a relationship. Feeling unwelcome in their group, I distanced myself during times like lunch, and tried to find a new place to stay. Miranda kept me company during this time, despite me not having any other close friends, so I thought nothing of it.

Moving into my junior year, my relationship with Miranda was still strong, but I still had nothing to do during most lunches as she was forced to divide her time between me and her friends. I spent this period of my high school experience getting closer to a group of people who had been friends with each other since freshman year. They all participated together in several in and out of school activities, including clubs, class council, and hanging out whenever they could. I got to a point where every day I would spend my lunches with this group, and slowly grew closer to them, but I still didn't feel like they were my friends. 

I put a lot of effort into hanging out with this group of people outside of school, but seemed to always run into issues. People would often have other things to do, and I could never tell if they genuinely didn't like me, or had other honest obligations. I managed to create a few opportunities to spend time with this group out of school, and they were the most fun I have had throughout my entire high school experience. I knew at this point that the group *did* like me as a person, which led me to believe that I had truly found a friend group where I fit in. 

Unfortunately, the group never put in the same effort that I did to hang out. Despite seemingly enjoying the time we spent together in school, I was seldom invited to their gatherings. I can recall two instances when one member of their group invited me to things, but aside from these two, nothing. It's not like the time we spent together was bad or anything, it just seemed like they never wanted to put in the effort to invite me. This group hung out essentially every day after school, and especially on weekends, but I could never get myself invited. 

My relationship with the group is extremely confusing to me, and I'm unsure of what I'm doing wrong. The only person I frequently talk with is Miranda, and all communication with the people in the friend group is through rare group-chats, or through things which I manage to coordinate. The advice I am looking for is if I should reach out to the group as a whole and ask for inclusion, accept and cherish the times that I can create something which they attend, or give up and try to find new friends entirely. I am extremely apprehensive to the first solution, as I fear that any attempt to make my grievances known will lead to pity and confusion, and ruin the relationship that I have with these people now.",24May2020,1

Because of the diagnosis, we're only allowed to see her through glass. And to be honest, I don't know if she even knows who we are anymore.

 I've not been the best family member in the last few years. I'm trying to get through college, it's my last term for my 4 year degree and of course, finals week. I don't know how I'm going to take any of this if she passes.  I'm scared about how I'll handle it. A friend passed 2 years ago and I was a mess for months.

I'm scared to ask for an extension. I was sick two weeks ago and fell behind a week, already granted an extension for that and got (mostly) caught up. 

I don't even know if I'll need one another one for this. They aren't some tests I can just churm out for an hour. I have 2 papers to finish, and in my third class an application. The third is a group based project. Of which is 2 art students and 1 other CS student not including myself. So a lot of the work is on me for it. This is the hardest one as the group decided to do an entire pivot changing what we're doing the last week, so there's a lot to get done still.

My family is probably leaving town to see her tomorrow. I'm probably going too. Being honest and frank, all I can think about right now is how she's likely to die alone, not knowing who anyone around her is, and with no contact due to the virus. Its killing me to think about.

250,"Hey.

For a while now my girlfriend of 5 months has been battling with depression after a series of bad events. My girlfriend was the victim of a sexual assault 2 years ago and this has caused many self esteem issues for her, as well as worsening her depression. She tells me that it wasn’t bad until recently, where she will often have breakdowns regarding the assault to the point of self harming again. All this has a big impact on our relationship, as seeing her like this upsets me greatly. 

I would like to speak to her mother about this, as my girlfriend doesn’t see the need to communicate about this type of stuff, and her mom is supportive, but doesn’t act on this due to the lack of persistence to do so by my girlfriend. 

I was wondering if this would be the right move? As I know that no amount of persuasion on my part would have my girlfriend talk to her mom about it. If so, how could I go about doing this?

His dream has always been to open a coffee shop/bakery which is our current plan that we've been working on for the last several years. However, I do not like being a barista and owning/managing a bakery doesn't appeal to me at all. I have extreme social anxiety and dealing with angry customers/making phone calls are probably the two things that I hate most and am worst at.

I told my husband that I don't want to do it and he said that he will support me in whatever else I want to pursue with no questions asked. My biggest issue right now is that I just don't know what I want to do. I really don't like meeting new people/dealing with strangers so ideally I could work with a group of people that I know well. I've taken loads of career aptitude tests but I don't really want to just jump into a random career. 

I should also say that I really enjoy photography, so I got a degree in Digital Media and started my own (successful) photography business which I've had for years, but this has caused me to slowly stop enjoying photography and I'm itching to dissolve my business and quit that.

How do people choose what career they want? Should I just pursue the bakery idea and see if I can make myself tolerate it?

260,"Usually when my parents come home drunk or whatever, they end up loudly having sex in the room next to my sister and I who share a bedroom. My sister is 11 years old and every time she's awake to hear it, she has panic attacks. 
I have many mental health issues including severe anxiety, and the feeling she describes is identical to how I experience panic attacks. She's expressed that she is uncomfortable with the topic when discussing it with my parents, but they continue to have sex late at night even when they're aware she's awake. 
She knows what sex is, however she views it as a dirty and uncomfortable subject and whenever she attempts to have a conversation with my mom or dad to try and stop it from happening again, she dances around having to imply she's talking about sex. 
I feel awful for her because of the fact that my parents never take her seriously, and usually end up laughing in her face about it. The conversations they do have usually end in a ""we won't do it again"" which, to no surprise, doesn't end up being true. She often asks me to explain to our parents why she's so upset, but I tell her that it's her responsibility to do that if it bothers her that much. 
Because of these experiences, she dreads our mother coming home after a night of drinking because she knows that she'll soon have to hear our parents having sex and go through another panic attack. 
I don't know how to help her, because obviously her problem isn't getting better and my parents don't take it seriously enough to want to help.

265,"#Expostion on my relationship with said teachers

So I’m in an advanced art program that lets me go downtown to join this class and do art with more of a constructive approach. It’s like making art with recycled garbage.. but it’s mostly working with clay as amateurs.

Throughout the year my teachers have made snide remarks, non-constructive criticism, disproportionately harsh remarks, and homophobic/transphobic jokes.

The environment they built wasn’t suitable for me to comfortably make art, because I was under the impression this was more of a lighthearted thing where we can express ourselves with some guidance from our teachers. But it was really trying to pump out as many projects as possible but only if it met our professors vision. 

There’s two of them, one middle aged woman and an older man.

I still did the work but I was pretty reluctant to. The male teacher lost his temper at me one time because I’m technically bad with clay, and he thinks telling me to not be sloppy will be better.

Just so it’s obvious, I don’t really do art, and my teachers new I didn’t have any experience in art other than like doodling.

#The situation now with the ‘Rona

Now I’m at home because of the ‘Rona, and I emailed them saying I’m stressed out because I’m trying to find a doctor, trying to afford college now that my dads practically unemployed, and I’m trying to figure out my living situation, and that because of this I don’t know if I can do much of anything. They ignored this email and called my ex-guardian older sister (that’s a long story). So when they called her it was to complain about how I’m not working. I tried to do some half-assed projects which they surprisingly liked, and they told me I could show them whatever I was working on.

I did some things here and there and they’ve gradually pushed away the rest of my peers because of their high expectations, and the video calls that last several hours which consist of mostly empty conversation. Which is why I also stopped joining the calls. Now the school year is ending and they’re threatening to fail me, even if I did some of the work.

To understand why they *shouldn’t fail me*, from a logistical sense and not just what’s my opinion, I’ll describe to you my school districts new grading policy with the virus situation. Students that have done no work at all, and haven’t joined a single call.. fail and must do summer school. Students that do some of the work pass and keep their letter grade from the last quarter, students that do better than last quarter get a letter grade.

So I’ve done a lot of work, but in proportion to the amount they’re assigning, I’ve done maybe 40% of it. From the beginning it was, I finish one project, here’s 5 different things I should do now as a continuation from my previous project. Once they threatened to fail me I went to the online classroom and did all of the assignments I missed, and having emailed my teachers, they said they wanted alterations to what I’ve done. 

And when I do listen to their recommendations, they tell me to do more, or to completely reverse their recommendation. They then wanted me to do a few projects that wasn’t posted online, but since I hadn’t joined the recent calls, I knew that was my fault for not knowing that. so of course I agreed. The deadline for these projects are next week, and I can finish them easily. The issue is that they’re going to tell me to change it, or to do something else, or that they didn’t like it, and those changes will take longer than a week.

I don’t have time to do this. This wasn’t really my priority. I’ve explained to them that I’m stressed out at home and I have multiple issues and they ignore it completely. My dad really is going to have a hard time paying for stuff, and I’m busy trying to finish scholarships. I’m trying to get into contact with the school I’m waitlisted one because it the cheapest one. Because I’ve bounced between guardians and now I’m 18, I have to find a new psychiatrist and a new therapist for my depression and anxiety, and I need to find a new prescription because the last one made me feel sick. I literally don’t know where I’m going to live anymore because the lease that’s under my parents name is ending soon, and my mom wants to move to Mexico.. while I don’t want her to go outside and get sick. All of this shit is keeping me real busy, and when I do have free time, I feel like I have no mental clarity to focus on any task, especially art.


So I’ve written up a list since halfway through the year of incidents that center around the misbehavior of my teachers, a short time after they occurred. I planned before this whole corona thing to talk to the director of the program about how my teachers need to be more careful of their behavior, or how he should reconsider that area of the program at all because myself and my peers felt miserable. More of a down to earth conversation about how a negative environment isn’t good for art, and it’s not the mission of the program. 

But I also think that this situation can look also pretty bad for my teachers. They also work as teachers outside the program, so then getting fired from this job won’t have any serious ramifications, and if it does then I’m glad.. not out of vengeance but out of them being bad teachers. 

Although, I think if I do this I will certainly be failed. My chances of failing are pretty high right now because my classmates think the teachers don’t really like me. Even though in person I’m very polite to them. I might have some leeway in convincing them to not fail me after the fact. But if I tell the director about how they’re sucky teachers, I’m afraid they can lock in my failing grade or alter it to a failing grade. 

I’m also afraid of my parents berating me for failing an art class and calling me a retard.


tl;dr my life is hard for me to manage because of a long list of reasons, and I don’t have time to focus on this class, but I’m gonna fail if I don’t do everything perfectly the way they want me to. So now I HAVE to put everything aside to commit to a class I think I’m going to fail anyways because the teachers don’t like me.",24May2020,1
266,"A while ago I started following this girl I knew back in elementary school. We were good friends and I think she liked me back then, but she moved away around 5th grade. Since then we haven't talked. However, a few months ago we started following each other on Instagram and have liked each other's posts. I really want to start talking to her again ~~because I think she's super attractive~~ but I don't know to start up a convo without seeming weird. We're both currently in HS. She moved maybe an hour or two away from me.  Any advice?

269,"Tl;dr - dad makes no effort, should I bother trying to boost our relationship?


Long story short: 
My dad moved like a 1 1/2 drive away, remarried and has a step son my age (26) and now a granddaughter.

I really appreciate his wife. She’s a gem. She is the only person who had tried to talk to me previously to 2020 and set up some dinners and catch ups - probably three times, none of which happened for one reason or another on both our parts. 

My dad has forgotten or refused to message my brother and I on any kind of special day. We have returned the favour, seeing as we are both before him in terms of birthday so we follow his standard. Except Christmas, which is when I get a customary call and go to his place for a big Christmas do with people I don’t know and only see once a year.

He hasn’t spoken to my brother (21) in at least five years, and had been lacklustre before that. He’s missed the kid’s graduation, all the important birthdays, his first girlfriend, getting his motorbike and car license... everything that is shaping him into the adult he has become. My brother is especially bitter about not having a father around, even if he doesn’t say so out loud.

And as for me... tbh, it crosses my mind unprompted at least twice a week. I have no closure on it. 

I don’t know why he doesn’t want me around, but my guess is I’m never good enough. From how much I look like my mother, my weight, piercings and hair colour to my career, my car, my aspirations... it’s always a let down. I think he builds up the image of me in his mind, and then whenever I see him again I wreck it and disappoint/embarrass him.

I’ve never been anything but friendly and bubbly when I speak to him or see him. He has no reason to not want me around for how I treat him. 

So at this point it’s like, why bother? Guy is an asshole. 

The dilemma is that I’ve always been similar to my dad than my mother. When he was being a good parent I loved him more than anything in the world. I would kill to have a fraction of that advice and love again.

As it is, I’ve gone so long without that kind of support I no longer really know what to do with it. My relationships outside of the family are at an arms length, and so are a great deal of the ones inside the family. I just expect that I’ll be left behind and have to handle everything on my own. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a sad sack about it. Obviously it’s a sucky situation. But I’d like to resolve it for my own mental health. 

If it were as easy as giving him a call - I tried that. I don’t have his phone number  any more, and he has no social media, so any contact will go to his wife. She’s always proven to be on the side of wanting us to have a better relationship, so maybe she knows something I don’t. 

I just don’t know what to do. He didn’t call me this year for Christmas. I haven’t spoken to him since January 2019. 

I’m pretty stilted when it comes to these feelings. I recognise they’ve been tucked away for a long time. I’m worried that I’m gonna get hurt if I start something and it fails, or if I pry and he confirms the reason he doesn’t want me is simply because I’m a disappointment. Where we are at now is this awful state of nonchalance and silence, but it’s at least safe. 

Thoughts? Advice? Similar situations and how they played out?",24May2020,1
270,"(20 M) For years now I've been dealing with this feeling that I'm being spied on by one of my parents. I want to find a way to stop it, permanently. 

To clarify, every so often I just get this feeling that they know way more about me than they should, as if they are looking at my social media accounts or even reading my mind at times. For example, just last night I was replying to someone on Twitter and talking with some people on Discord about a specific brand of ice cream sandwiches. Today, the parent went shopping and some time after they came back home they mentioned to me that _they bought ice cream sandwiches of that same brand_. ...We haven’t had ice cream sandwiches in this house for months. And I didn’t mention a single thing at all to them about it recently. That exact kind of thing happens from time to time. I say something online or even just think of something, and somehow the parent brings it up within the following days despite me not saying anything about it to them. 

Here’s the thing, though: they don’t have access to my computer at all: my PC is only ever accessed by me, and it’s just me and my parents at home, and they’re not particularly tech savvy. And they shouldn’t know about any of my social media b/c I never told it to them, nor anyone who could tell them. And I know it’s crazy to think they can actually read my mind, even if the paranoia makes me feel that way. But it just feels like some kind of prying and spying is happening. Maybe they’re checking ISP provided internet history? Can you even do that? Or maybe there’s like a camera or mic hidden in my room, but I don’t think that’s the case.

As result of all this I’ve become somewhat secretive over the years. I don’t tell them much, I don’t let them know much. It’s partially on them really, with the way they raised me. And it’s not even that I have anything particularly bad that I need to hide, but more like (and I imagine many people are like this) there are just things I don’t think they should know about, you know? Things you wouldn't want your parent or maybe even anyone around you to know. Unless I explicitly let them know, they shouldn’t know. That’s fair, right? I would like to be more open with them and let them know about my interests but this feeling that they’ve invaded my privacy makes me think they’re entirely undeserving of that. 

The big issue is I basically don’t entirely trust them, and they have some power over me, and so I don’t really know how I can approach them about it. Their grip on me has loosened some as I’ve gotten older but I still don’t know how to properly handle this. I’m worried that if I straight up ask they’ll say “yes” and then try punishing me in some way. Or somehow it is true but I’m not prepared enough with reasoning to convince them how wrong it is and to make them stop and forget the stuff they know that they shouldn’t know. Sometimes I treat them coldly and it makes me feel bad but simultaneously it feels like exactly what should be done. Like I’m in the wrong but in the right too. It’s so twisted because I know they _should_ be of the few people I can trust most but I fucking can’t and it's tiresome having that be the case.

It feels like I have just enough evidence to be convinced that they know more than they should, but not enough evidence to prove any kind of spying is going on. I’ve been stuck in that limbo for years. It really eats away at me from time to time, makes me anxious and sometimes a bit irate, but because it’s not an every day kind of thing I’m able to live with it. I kind of push it to the back of my mind and try to convince myself it isn’t real and I’m being dramatic and I should just move on. Sometimes I forget about it entirely, but it eventually comes back around. I don’t want to keep going like this forever. I feel like I’ll only really be free when I get my own place and don’t have to be in constant contact with them, but due to finances and some other reasons that isn’t realistic currently. 

**tl;dr:** I think they know more than they should but I'm not totally sure, and I don't know how to proceed. 

Thank you so much for reading. Any thoughts and advice would be appreciated.",24May2020,1

272,"I don't know how to begin with this, my hands are shaking and this might come across as a stream of consciousness as I'm also still trying to be helpful without sacraficing my mental health.

PS I'm on mobile, sorry for shitty formatting.

Someone I went to HS with hit me up like a year ago. We've talked here and there but he's usually a brick wall to talk to so I haven't gotten close to him.

A few weeks ago we had a deep conversation where I assured him that, no, he's not ""supposed"" to have family, that he should have one if he wants to and when it happens it happens. That he needs a therapist, that he can't expect love just because he's nice to someone. That just because someone rejects him doesn't mean he's not loveable. Etc. It was a 4hr convo, that's the important gist of it though.

Like a week after that he asked me to break quarantine to come see him because he hasn't seen anyone for like... 7 months. I said no, and he flipped out at me. Very rude, very disrespectful, saying I treated him like everyone else like he ""was the plague"" and honestly he was one ""you're a fat whore"" comment away from it sounding like a Nice Guy™. I muted notifications and told him not to message me until he realized how victimizing himself and being really passive aggressive was toxic and manipulative, and could apologize sincerely about it.

He messaged me like 3 more times that night with basic ""sorry :("" and ""I'm so stupid.... :("" So I ignored him. He messaged me again a week ago with just ""hi sorry again for what I did"" and I told him none of what he said was a proper apology, and to please read over the convo because I wanted to be friends but not at the cost of my mental health.

He messaged me tonight ""hi sorry, I was scared so I deleted everything you said"" so I resent the previous message with a ""no worries I gotchu."" Kind bitchy, I won't defend it. He said he'd deleted the whole convo so I sent the screenshots of taken with the thought of possibly putting them on here, but under a Nicer™ sub. He started talking about how he's suuuuuch an asshole, and he ""wasn't trying to hurt me"" basically every ALMOST apology he could muster without actually saying ""you're right. I messed up. I'm sorry, how can we move on from this?"" So I told him as much. That he wasn't really apologizing and I didn't want to talk if he was going to victimize himself and try to guilt me into forgiving him. 

I told him again, to read our conversations, I clearly spelled out what was wrong and I couldn't talk to him if he couldn't respect me enough to recognize the toxicity in his behavior and apologize. I told him I was done for the night and put my phone down. He proceeds to ignore that and call me. Thrice. In between about 15 messages about how awful he is and no one cares, how he wanted to apologize on the phone. I told him I was about to block him of he called one more time after I told him I was done for the night because he was disrespecting my wishes for space. 

He CALLS AGAIN LIKE 5 MINUTES LATER. Among the new messages I found, he randomly drops how his brother had apparently died this month?!?! 16, OD'd on something, and how I was treating him like he wasn't even a person. I told him I was sorry for his loss, I really was but I wasn't equipped emotionally to help him through that. That he needs some professional help. I've been lucky enough to still have everyone I'm close to, so I can't help in that way but he has my sympathy but that doesn't change that I'm uncomfortable with how he's treated me.

He said all the doctors are closed and he CANT get help, so I send him the suicide hotline, links to 7cups and Betterhelp and tell him that I don't know what to tell him, but please consider these as I can't help. He says he doesn't WANT the help and refuses to use the links I sent him. I say he obviously wants help or he wouldn't be reaching out to me. 

This convo has gone in circles about how I'm the one that's mistreated him, how his behavior is unhealthy, please consider help, he won't bother anyone ever again with his life and how I've treated him like literally everyone else and I don't care at all, round and round.

I don't know how to help. He's been toxic on my mental health since I told him I didn't want to break quarantine. I want to help, but I don't know how without hurting myself. I made myself a promise to not let myself be treated like this after my ex, but I also don't want to leave him without any help.  Any and all advice is welcome.

Tl;dr An acquaintance from HS hmu, started acting toxic when I wouldn't break quarantine to come see him. Told him he needs to apologize before we could keep talking, continued passive aggression and wouldn't apologize. Randomly tells me his brother died in the midst of me telling him I couldn't talk to him if he couldn't understand what he did wrong. I send him links for online counseling but he said he didn't want help. Idk how to help without hurting my mental state.",24May2020,1
273,"So I made a funny Tik Tok video, or so I think. There’s this trend going around where people use google translate to say “Roses are red, (insert a line)” and then follow it with a funny video clip of somebody saying something that rhymes with the text-to-speech dialogue from google translate.

My video says this:

The google translate reads: “Roses are red, I wanna make 6 figures, hold up—“ and then it cuts to a clip of one of my favorite YouTube reactors (african-american male) saying “is that the ice cream truck (expletive)”. The expletive is him saying the n-word, not with the -er; but with the a at the end, which we’ve all come to know as a commonly used term exclusive to the african-american community as a term of endearment, simply meaning “bro” or “friend”. 

I just wanted some opinions on this. I don’t want to post it if it’s unacceptable for me to post, but I really wasn’t sure. Is it socially acceptable for a white male to use footage of a black male using the word? I’m sorry if me having to ask this offends anybody. I don’t use the word personally. Not even when singing songs. I just thought the clip was funny, and he’s one of my favorite YouTubers.

277,"Hi, I’m a 19, soon to be 20 year old Film student at Edinburgh Napier University, Scotland. I just finished up my first year, passed all my classes, but due to COVID-19 I didn’t have any classes, online or otherwise since early March. 

I’m from Belfast, Northern Ireland, and moving to Edinburgh last year was extremely difficult. I had absolutely no family or friends here before moving. Most of the friends I’ve made here have moved back home due to COVID, and I’ve been living on my own in the university accommodation since March 21st. University for me costs £9,250 a year, just for tuition. Accommodation fee has been £671 a month, and I’ve paid that for 10 months. So in total, I’ve spent almost £16,000 this year alone and I’ve been pretty miserable. 

Even before COVID-19, my course has been extremely academic and elitist. I felt like a fish out of water and even though I passed all my classes I felt like I only just scraped. I have had multiple breakdowns, and without my boyfriend here I don’t think I would have made it. He has really been my rock throughout all of this. 

I’ve had a lot of time to think, and I’ve been thinking of moving back to Belfast and leaving university altogether, and doing a Level 5 HND course in Film production at Belfast Met College. I did a Level 3 BTEC at the same College and I honestly feel like I’ve learned a lot more and was a lot happier there. My dad is okay with my coming home and going to the Met, because Belfast has a much bigger film industry and the course is far more hands on and practical. I feel as though Film is an industry that cares more about experience rather than qualifications.

I do feel guilty about leaving. I’m telling my boyfriend about it all today, and I’m worried he’s going to leave me. I would be totally happy with doing Long Distance because it isn’t THAT far, it’s a plane journey but I’m only a few hours away, and I love the bones of him but I really don’t think I can put myself into that financial and stressful situation. There were many times during this year I almost had to go back into counselling because I couldn’t cope with the stress. If he can’t do long distance I know I have to let him go for my own sake and his. 

Has anyone else left Uni after the first year and done something different that can offer me some advice? I’ve been crying my eyes out over this for a few days, I’m moving back home for the summer in two weeks anyway, but this is a huge choice and I’m scared of letting everyone down. My whole family were so proud of me when I moved over here and I feel like I’m just a dropout and a quitter...",24May2020,1
278,"My mentor at work is somone I frequently go to for advice for years . We have a really good relationship - and he’s been there for me during some critical low points in my life. Everything seems fine at work.

I recently graduated with a Masters degree, and almost every single person at my company has congratulated me but not him. There have been plenty of opportunities too - on LinkedIn, on a post someone made at work. They had a party for me and he didn’t come.

I’m really confused. He jumps at the opportunity to help when it comes to work stuff, we talk about things related to work, I’ve let him know I appreciate him throughout. Why... hasn’t he expressed that he’s happy for me?

I know he doesn’t have a Masters degree and he’s said that you don’t need a piece of paper to prove what you know. So maybe he just doesn’t value it? That’s the only thing I can think of.

279,"I expect you’ll find this sad and pathetic but I’m at my ropes end. There was this girl I worked with long ago. We weren’t close at first but as time went by the more we talked and learn more about each other. I remember the first time I actually saw her. I can’t put it into words to explain how I felt. It was certain that I have fallen for her. We spent more and more time together. Sometimes we’d spend hours alone talking about nothing. I got a lot shit in my head that sometimes I believe only a bullet can vent out what’s in there. Whenever I was with her it was like nothing else existed but us. She was nice to me. She said things that I always wanted to hear. At one point she said that she loved me and I don’t take that word lightly. I doubted her words but watched how she acted. I acted differently one day and she took notice. The next day she went to a good friend of mine to learn more about me. She waited till we were alone for her to confront me about whatever issues I had going on. I never had anyone take an interest in me like that before. We weren’t on the same path in life. I was moving and she was moving on to college. During this whole time she was with someone which made me feel even worse. One day we were alone and decided to play hangman. She asked me if I was gonna miss her when she leaves for school. I told her yes. I asked if she would miss me when I move. She said of course. That night I felt like I was someone to someone. I’ve tried drugs, I’ve drank but none of those highs never came close to how high felt with her. I ended up being let go so I was afraid we wouldn’t see each other anymore. I knew I had to tell her how I felt before I left. I spent all day practicing in front of a mirror telling her how I felt. I planned on meeting by the river. I got her a white tulip. She ended up not coming. I felt like a fool. She couldn’t love me. What was I expecting? I messaged her telling her what was important and that I was fired. We rearranged the meet. I felt like it was a second chance. The day came and I asked if we were stilling good to meet. She told me no. She had been fired for No Call No Show. She blamed me saying that if I had told her earlier then she wouldn’t have been fired. We argued for a little. When it cooled down I asked if she still loved me. She said no and that she never said that, that I did. That still echoes. We met a couple more times before I moved but it was never like before. I got lost in my head and became a drunk. I had pushed her away. I regret how it ended but I don’t regret for ending it because I was always gonna wanna be more than her friend. She knew I liked her but she didn’t like me and that’s okay. I would rather her be happy with someone she truly loves than be with someone she didn’t. I know I won’t be around for much longer, it has nothing to do with her but rather what I lost. I can never be upset with her. Not a day goes by that I don’t think about her. I tried talking to someone but now I’m just done talking, there’s nothing left to say. I could use some help.

285,"Most of the year, I live in the same house as her, my step dad, two sisters and older brother (who’s moving out in a month). The other few months I stay with my (same) brother and dad in another state.

I won’t go into details about my mom and dad’s divorce, but my mom met my step dad in the military. They’ve been together ten years, had my first little sister soon after meeting and my second just after their marriage six years ago. The two of them have been through a lot together—homelessness, joblessness, broken down cars and subsequent moving states, fighting and tears, and the occasional tender moment. I think it’s worth noting they are both Christians, but my mom is better at.. acting like it (positively).

I feel like my mom is under pressure to stay with this man, my step dad. Like I said, they have an intense history. She and my siblings are mostly financially dependent on him. She swears up and down that he’s, “not always like this” or “he didn’t use to be like this” or she finds a different way to excuse his behavior.

But his behavior is inexcusable. I wondered for a while whether my dislike of him was simply because I missed my real dad and was biased, but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve only noticed issues popping up more and more and getting worse every time. He is emotionally unstable, narcissistic, manipulative, extremely anxious (thinks everyone is out to get him), a radical conspiracy theorist, and most notably, an emotional abuser of his family.

Tonight after work, I got into my mom’s car and startled her as she had been crying. Not the first time, for sure, and at this point I am no longer phased—but I still feel for her. I already knew. I always know. It’s always their inability to communicate that has her upset. He won’t have a single important conversation with her or a conversation about how she’s feeling without playing victim, throwing a tantrum, and storming off. He’s a child. 

Tonight, however, my mom told me he’d yelled at her while he was angry, telling her to “get out of [his] fucking way” in the kitchen or “lick my ass” after she protested being talked to like that.

My mom’s been trying to stand up to him, since being calm never works (and she’s as sick of dealing with him as I am watching her deal with him), but it never works. As long as my step dad has the last word, he feels like he’s won, and my mom is torn apart. (And don’t get me started on how he is when he /doesn’t/ get the last word.) She’s silenced, and he is silently declared the “right” one.

In the end, I’ve heard it all before. It’s not new. The only reason they’ve lasted so long with so much abuse is my mom’s firm promise to herself that she would never go through another divorce again. And I’ve ignored their fights and my step-dad’s abuse for so long, but today I realized—I cannot handle it anymore. I am hurting so badly for her, myself, my sisters, my brother—every interaction we have with him is negative. Though it would hurt at first, my mother could have so much more out of life if she realized she deserves so much more. And so do her children.

I know I have no control over what she does with her life. I understand that she is an adult and must make her own decisions. I’m just her daughter. But I am done seeing my mother—my strong. Independent. Beautiful. Courageous. Incredibly giving. Empathetic mother being treated like dirt, being constantly abused and manipulated, being unable to feel like the best person in the world because she can’t love herself fully and live in happiness and freedom. She can’t see that that’s still there for her, she’s 40, but she’s young.

I don’t know. I am conflicted. I feel like as a child, I shouldn’t be doing anything. But I’m tired.

Tl;DR - basically the title of the post. My mom feels pressure to be with an emotionally/verbally abusive child-in-a-man’s body because she has children, is financially dependent, and doesn’t want to suffer another divorce. I understand my inability to change the situation, but I am exhausted by it.",24May2020,1

I forgave all the people who took advantage of me. I forgave them even though they treated me like shit and I'm still not scared to do the same thing all over again. There might be something wrong with me. It seems like I'm fine with people hurting me emotionally and I refuse to take into mind what they have done to me. I still continue on letting other people take advantage of me despite the fact that it happened to me a lot of times already and I think that I could never be tired of getting hurt. What could be wrong with me?",24May2020,1
289,"I had a bestfriend I knew her for a long time since 5th grade I'm now a sophomore in highschool, last November we kinda broke off because I made a decision I still regret. I decided to date her bestfriend it wasn't the only thing that killed are friendship we had a lot of other stuff happen in the weeks before it but it was the killing blow. Anyways it ended are friendship we still checked in on each other quite often but besides that we didn't talk. The relationship ended with her bestfriend 2 months later when she cheated on me. Now that it's summer I find myself thinking of her a lot ( I should probably mention I also had feelings for her for a long time probably since 7th grade)  it being summer I remember back to last summer when we would ft everyday and we'd talk constantly there was never a dull moment. But this summer is extremely boring with few friends and her gone I want what we had back. I just don't know how to start it up or if I even should.",24May2020,1
290,Over the past week i have been increasingly more paranoid and im starting to hear things. I have never had this happen to me and im worried. i hear clicking and buzzing on my walls. i think im going mad but i am not sure. can anyone please help,24May2020,1
291,"With everything that has happened to my family, from a very young age, I (F 16)  have learnt to be extremely grateful for what I have. I'm grateful for the roof over my head and the food on the table. I'm grateful that we are in a much better situation than many others.

However, is if selfish of me to want things like my own room and more alone time? I get jealous when I hear about what my classmates have.

Is it also selfish for me to wish I didn't have to grow up so fast? I miss how I didn't have to worry about bills and how the house will be affected if I buy things for myself; I barely buy things for myself because I just feel so bad even though my parents say it's ok (I know it's not because I've seen the letters and the bank statements); I can't remember the last time I bought something without worrying about how it will affect us at the end of the day 

These past few weeks have been tough because I have more time to think; I can't throw myself into any work because school is shut and my exams were all cancelled.",24May2020,1
292,"So I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (22M) for about a year and a half, and we live together.

A few months ago I asked him what was up, because he wasn't reciprocating any of my advances. He apologised and explained that as he's put quite a bit of weight on recently, he isn't feeling good about himself, and isn't feeling sexual at all.

I've been pretty respectful of this, I mean still testing the waters a little, but not asking him for anything or pushing for more. Not only do I not want him to feel forced, but in my last relationship my partner developed a porn addiction and stopped wanting sex altogether. It was a hugely humiliating and self esteem crushing experience that I hope to never happen again. I never want to be rejected physically, or feel like a partner is acting out of obligation. 

I don't know when he will want to be physical with me again. He tells me constantly that he thinks I'm beautiful and I guess I just have to believe it. I know it's selfish, but honestly I have needs too, both physical and emotional, and this sucks. I can't even spend isolation getting laid, and I'm feeling less connected to him over time.

I recently decided to invest in a membership to OMGyes, which is an in depth website about the female orgasm and what not. Really good info btw, I recommend it, even for guys to learn about what a woman likes.
I didn't buy it for any particular reason, just that I'd wondered about it for a while.

Now pre dry streak we had sex quite a bit, and I never ever orgasm. I don't usually with any partner, and I don't blame my current boyfriend for it. It just doesn't happen. One thing he does constantly is rub REALLY hard on my fully exploded clit, which is super uncomfortable and I hate. I've always wriggled away or grabbed his wrists and said ""softer, slower, its too much"" and idk, maybe he thinks ""too much"" means ""too good"", but no, it means too much. Please stop. 

I've always felt a little embarrassed about it, like maybe I should be able to handle it, or it should be feeling good. 

Having read info and watched videos on this website I realise that I'm not at all alone in this feeling, and there are a lot of ways to adjust and experiment to find the ways I like it best.

I finally feel like I can express how I'm feeling about it, and have ways of explaining it, but obviously right now we're not having sex at all...

So it's possibly the worst time for me to have come to this revelation. 

I don't know what to do.

I think it might make him feel pressured and obligated if I brought it up when we weren't doing anything. That said I'm struggling with not being wanted, and it's bringing back some well buried feelings of inadequacy and self hate.  
I also think if I said it during sex that he could take it personally (especially if it was soon after not doing anything for a while), while if I sat him down outside of sex then he would feel ""told off"" and it could feel way more serious than intended. 

What should I do?",24May2020,1
293,"So it would seem that my home is borderline infested with spiders. In the past week alone I’ve seen more than ten of all shapes and sizes (some babies slightly bigger than a pin dot) and I’m convinced that they must have laid eggs in our walls and are now all crawling outing from whence they came to terrorize me. Usually we get a fair share of bugs around this time of year, but we have never had this many spiders.

Anyway after 6 months of friendzoning he passed away, but he did date another girl after i friendzoned him, we were really close and alot of people tell me he treated me differently ( i dont know if its cause he still liked me still (i doubt that) or if it was cause i was bestfriend) anyway, i used to fantasize about him when he was alive, before cause i liked him later cause hormones, i didnt want to date like i said so i was wondering maybe i was in love with him but i persuaded myself i wasnt. Now that hes no longer here, its been 11 months. I think about him alot, in the beginning first 6 months following his death, my mind would randomly fantasize about him, but i would have to tell myself to stop cause its disrespectful to him, but those fantasies always use to start out me telling him how much i missed him, or in a romantic manner. I dont know if i feel that maybe i was and maybe am in love with him because hes no longer here, and im convincing myself we are something more grand just cause he died . I used to think before that ill meet him in paradise and hold him and be in love with him there( yes dumb) but i really dont know if me feeling that im in love with him is cause he died or maybe those surpressed feelings all released after he died.

297,"I’ve been in love with my best friend for years but I didn’t realize it until a couple months ago. He’s away on an LDS mission right now set to come back at the end of this year and the only contact I have with him is his missionary email. I haven’t been able to bring myself to talk to him in a while though, because every time I start to write an email to him, it invariably ends with me confessing my feelings to him. A little backstory... (sorry it’s a longer read)
I (F 20) have known him (M 19- we will call him Thomas) since second grade. We went to the same elementary school, the same middle school, and the same high school. I’ve had a rocky history with guys and them generally befriending me before deciding my friendship wasn’t something they really wanted to continue with. Yet, through it all Thomas has been a constant in my life for over 13 years now. I’d be lying if I said I was never attracted to him, (gorgeous blue eyes, tan skin, perfectly feathered brown hair)but I’ve never really considered him a real romantic option until this past year, and I have some real concerns with potentially professing my love for him.
I believe he is my soulmate, but in the past I’ve felt it’s possible to have your soulmate be nothing more than a friend. But it’s this deep connection I feel to him that’s compelling me to divulge my secret feelings. 
He makes me laugh harder than anyone and we have an identical sense of humor. He’s told me deep secrets and truths about himself that I’m quite sure he’s never shared with anyone else (because he told me no one else knew). We have a “couple” dance we do to the song Footloose, and we became known at our school for doing that song at every school dance. We were numbers one and two (me being his second in command) in our high school’s Marching Band. We’ve teased each other constantly over the years, and for the most part I’ve considered what we have a platonic bond, but there were moments when it felt like more. (I mean we’re basically a bad rom-com stereotypical best friend trope. ) 
I once got super dehydrated and sick on a field trip and something changed in him. The way he looked at me with such love and concern was intense. He wouldn’t let me out of his sight all day, constantly checking on me, buying me lots of water and lemonade (for electrolytes) practically force-feeding me despite me saying I wasn’t hungry, checking my pulse and pupils regularly. 
Another time I was injured but determined to finish a performance ( I was conducting our fall show and my back was to the audience) and when he saw how much anguish I was in(I collapsed from the pain) I saw in his eyes what seemed like a desperation to run over and take care of me. But he knew he couldn’t move because those were the rules. 
I also remember one time we spent like 2 hours together on my front lawn waiting for our other friends to show up and hang out and we started talking about some deep and personal things. It was serious (which is very out of character for us) and for one moment after he shared something we were staring at each other and we were close and for one second I thought we might kiss, but we broke away before anything happened. 
There are some concerns I have in confessing my love. 
Politically we’re pretty different. And while we have some things we agree on there are some things that I’m concerned would ultimately break us apart (if we even did get together.)
He hasn’t ever done much to really tell me he has feelings for me, (We’ve always been super flirty but that’s just kinda how we communicate) I’m worried that this is totally one sided and I’d make myself look like a b**** by confessing my feelings for him because...
He has a girlfriend (who I set him up with) and they’ve been together for 3 years. She has issues with me because once I noticed an unhealthy turn their relationship had taken I confronted him and told him about my concerns for their relationship( also because I once asked him to a dance as a friend because she wasn’t able to go but that bugged her). And it caused a huge falling out between me and Thomas. We only reconnected last year after his girlfriend gave permission for us to communicate. 
Since we’ve reconnected it’s hard to get a feel of where we really are. He has major trust issues and I worry that we’ll never get our friendship back to where it originally was. 
Mostly I’m afraid that I’ll tell him the truth, and I’ll lose him. I’ve lost plenty of people in my life, but I can’t imagine living my life without him. I spent 11 months thinking I’d lost him forever and they were the worst 11 months of my life. 

I’m wondering if I’ll regret telling him the truth only to have it end in me losing him. Or if I’ll mostly regret never taking my shot to be with someone I really think is my soulmate. Do you have any advice?",24May2020,1

We agreed to talk this upcoming Tuesday. 
In my text to him I mentioned taking care of my immune system, a book we’re reading together, and that I was excited to talk on the phone soon. 

This was his response:
“I hope you are too! Well you are smart and know how to take care of your immune system! I guess that’s the only thing you can control I suppose!That’s my number one goal is my immune system! 

Omg I do too! Thats funny!That’s exactly what imagine too! It’s the perfect place hahah I keep talking like Abigail to myself now these days lol 

I feel like I have read references to Flagg in other works I have read but maybe quite didn’t put it together! It would have been like a quick off thing and at the time the name would have held no weight so idk, I can’t remember but I wouldn’t be surprised at all!

Okay Tuesday would work for me:) I am looking forward to it:) 

Be safe at work and take care in the mean time!”

302,I went through a break up but were back together. Still talked about it a few times and think about it here and there. But I'm feeling good and happy. I do still get anxious and puke sometimes but that's school hahaha I went to a doctor but it ain't getting better. But with this whole corona thing I've been feeling better like good good. Thinking about everything less. But when I went to my gf. I got anxious for some reason.(you're allowed to hang out in my country) and then I puked 2 times. I think it's bcs I had 5 hours of sleep. She thinks it because I'm in a foreign environment. Also when she hugs me and pets me I feel like way way better. And yes so it's been a while since we hanged out. I'm feeling good but now I'm scared I'll be sad again and puke again. Also scared to puke when school starts. Any tips to improve mentally. I already started working out and I definitely got more confident but I'm sure I'll start puking almost every day when school starts. I do feel like I'm gonna be good with my gf(like not puke cuz I think it's cuz I slept 5 hours) . Anyways thanks for the advice. Sorry for this mess of a post just scared.

303,"Hey all. I’ve been having some trouble lately with my feelings. To give a bit of context I’m a teenage boy, I’m on the autism spectrum, I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and ADHD. I feel really alone most of time. The truth is my best friend in my grandmas dog. I really want to branch out and make friends and maybe even be in a romantic relationship one day. But I have such a difficult time interacting with people. I’m a very kind and loving person but on the outside I look cold and distant. I then went online to meet people but I usually end up ghosted or no one reaches out at all. And I don’t really get a response when I reach out. I really want people to see the real me. I’m not some cold distant crazy person who wants to hurt people. I’m a happy go lucky sweetheart who’s just looking for companionship and people to talk to and hang with.

304,"Really funny to me but who knows, I was in right lane and saw the first out of 3 signs that said left lane closed ahead, the streets been worked on for the past 4 years so it's expected to have a delay ""there isn't traffic, I mean more of they're telling you hey this lane is ending soon"" lol.  I was the first person in the right lane and the car to my left was moving/accelerating slowly, I had all the time to pass her and once I was at the 2nd sign 1/4th of the way down of course I did no cars on either behind me or to the left.

 A red Honda comes going at least 50mph I was going 35mph, car behind me is at least 10-12 yards back, were at the metal sign in the road you know with a giant flashing they cut in front of them swiftly, cut back over to the right, then speed past me and cut me off right at the arrow. so I honked my horn for about 3 seconds as I slowed down. again going 

I got up to the light I'm turning in the 4th lane to the left to go home, he's back over one lane to the right. He got out of his car, said what the fuck is my problem you couldn't wait? I'm always expecting to wait Im in a only left lane of 2 that merges onto one.  regardless he started yelling ""get out of the fucking car im going to beat your ass"" I smiled and just laughed and it made it worse and he got louder, it wasn't more than a more than 2 minutes but his light was green before, red, then green and people were passing him by then and a cop pulled up lights flashing.

I don't like the pet names, I don't like forcing myself to say ""I love you"", and I'm fed up with the idea of being in a committed relationship. I don't know why.

I was dealing with some shit earlier this month. I couldn't stop thinking about my purpose, and so I started drinking heavily just to numb my mind. One night, completely out of the blue, I had a deafening nightmare that involved most of these overwhelming thoughts; and honestly my entire personality and outlook on life changed.

I don't feel the need for sex anymore, I don't crave physical interaction anymore, and I don't romanticize the idea of lovers anymore. I just want to be alone. I'm mentally unwell, like most people apparently, and I want to be left alone to my vices so I can loathe my life in peace. Yet, every fucking time I go to break up with her I think about how much she'll hurt. She loves me; a lot. 

She's going on and on about how much she wants to get married someday, how she's looking forward to our anniversary, and I just put on a fake smile, feeling like I want to vomit. I hate lying to her. If I hurt her I'm going to end up hating myself. I don't know what to do.

308,"So basically, after college I moved to a new city. The only people I know there are co workers. I’ve always been kind of a loner, but within the past year and a half I’ve been there, I’ve hung out with said co workers outside of work a total of like 5 times. They’ve always been the ones who have invited me places, I’m always too scared to ask people if they want to hang out. I always feel like I’m bothering people or if they say yes, it’s just out of pity. Another roadblock in the whole making friends thing is that I don’t drink. I feel like so many twenty-something friendships are centered around getting drunk all the time. I actually enjoy going to clubs/bars sometimes but I feel like no one wants to go out or to a party with someone who doesn’t drink. I think they’ll assume I’m boring.

309,"Hey guys,
Thanks for being here first of all. A bit about us: he is 39 and I am 28. We met at work and this is my actual first healthy and good relationship everWe have been dating since September 2018, so that makes it a year and a half I guess?  And we have been living together for one year exactly, this week.

I want to make it known that I adore the time I spend with this man, let’s call him Will ( not his real name ). We are always smiling and laughing, the inside jokes have become endless. We love to help each other with things around the house and just general life stuff. He is smart, kind, talented, fun, empathetic, a great listener, pushes me out of my comfort zone for my own good, nonjudgemental, understanding and handsome. I love our relationship! 

About 6 months ago he began struggling with erectile dysfunction and we worked through it together. Since that time it has come up twice more. Again, we have worked through it. But it has really made things in the bedroom very lackluster for me. If we don’t have sex the same exact way every single time, he can’t stay hard which he claims is an anxiety thing and I believe him. 

This is where my guilt comes in. For those past six months I have been thinking about my ex FWB while we are having sex so that I can come. This happens a good 90% to 95% of the times we have sex and I realize this is not good. I am just flat out not sexually attracted to my boyfriend anymore ): It makes me really sad, actually.

Anyway, I want to ask my boyfriend if he would be open to an open relationship tomorrow. I am already pretty sure that he is going to say no, but I don’t see any other way right now. My needs are not being met in this relationship but I really can’t stand to let it go. 

Has anyone ever had this talk with their SO? Can I have some pointers? 



TL;DR - I’ve lost sexual attraction to my boyfriend and am about to ask him for an open relationship. Any advice on how to have this conversation would be appreciated. Thank you",24May2020,1
310,"Had a chance with this really nice girl at school, we talked a lot, and I really felt as if I could start new with someone, and actually have a relationship where I can give her my all. Somewhat before quarantine, I started to notice she was less lively around me, but that’s because (or I assumed) this super annoying guy likes her a lot and was constantly around us even though she didn’t want him around. So I don’t think she was able to be as lively as she would’ve been without him. Anyway, Covid-19 decides that this is the best time to shut down the whole world and now we’re stuck in quarantine. I ended up admitting my feelings, she said she felt the same way, through text, but after that, slowly and surely we started talking less and less. I feel really sad about it because I felt like we had a chance to have something special, and I feel like it’s very one sided now, and she doesn’t like me anymore. I fell in love with this girl and now I feel very mad and heartless about my decisions, (not asking her sooner, talking to her at all, quarantine) and we stopped really talking at all a couple of days ago when she left me on read. I was frustrated at how such a little gesture could get to me, and became very heartless, feeling as if I’d already moved on. Unfortunately, my feelings are catching up to me and I realize how sad I am without this person, and how regardless on whether or not we talked, I knew that she had feelings for me but it’s not like that anymore. I’m at a state where I’m ready to say, “i don’t care, it’s just high school, more fish in the sea” but also “I may have a chance when quarantine is over, and I don’t know what goes on in her life”. I ask for advice among peers and anyone older than me. 

I feel very sophisticated typing my little sad essay this way, and I wanna make sure you know that I do not use this extensive vocabulary nor elegance in real life. I’m 16 years old and 100% a dumbass. So, advice? 


TL:DR

311,"I’m a 16F and I’ve spent my entire life helping other people make friends. It’s not something I did on purpose it’s just sort of happens. I find myself approaching people who either don’t have friends or people who are new and putting them in friend groups I think they’d be happy in. 

It started in elementary school. Then it was pretty innocent, helping the kids who picked their nose make friends or helping special needs kids join more dynamic friend groups. I loved doing this, it felt like I had a part in other happiness. 

I continued this through high school. Helping blend all of my city’s elementary students and introduce students in all grades to each other. I even joined the student council and became the president so I could reach more people. After being in quarantine for so long I realized I don’t really have many close friends of my own.

I am in medical school. I do just about average, which is a “B” student. A pass is a pass though so it’s all the same in that regard. Medical school started out really hard, and I think that’s when I felt the most purposeful, because I felt like I was really conquering something. My classes are mostly the same pattern now. Stressful, but I always end up doing good enough. 

We have a board exam coming up. I’m part of the last cohort that takes this exam for a score. It is becoming pass/fail after my year. I am a little worried about it, but not as much as I should be. I used to take action when I was worried about things, but now I just flat out don’t care all too much. About anything. 

I feel really purposeless. I can’t see myself actually doing well on rotations let alone being a competent doctor. But I also don’t see myself doing anything else in life, and I know this is ultimately what I want to do. It’s just that despite how much I’ve changed, I feel like I can’t change anymore, and that makes me feel really hopeless. 

I know this might sound like gibberish but every day is the same. There are things I know I want to do deep down, like do well on this exam, get in shape, start up my old hobbies...but I can’t seem to ever be able to push myself enough to do it. It’s as if I don’t want it enough. I’ve been so apathetic for so long and I feel so extremely purposeless and hopeless and I know the only way for me to change that is to change myself—to do and accomplish the things I’ve listed—but I also fully believe I can’t do it because I’ve never succeeded in that way before.

I see a therapist weekly and I like my therapist. But i also don’t feel like I am getting anywhere with them. Talking to this therapist is free, since it is through the school. Switching would be too much of a hassle, but my therapist doesn’t really push me. 

So what do I do? Every day I feel more purposeless and without hope than the day before.",24May2020,1
316,"My daughter and I are trying to figure out a Father’s Day gift for a friend who’s been living with us. He’s been a steady male presence in our lives, but not in the step dad sense.

317,"I tried to sum it up best I could in the title. My last lease I had two roommates who would take care of them if they were around but if I'm awake late at night then I can't really wake anyone up at 2am to kill a bug for me. Despite exterminators coming, they were still around so I decided to hit two birds with one stone and rent a place on my own and hopefully escape the bugs. Place seemed perfect and the landlord told me an exterminator came before I moved in- previous tenant also told me she'd never seen any bugs so I figured all was good and dandy. A few days after I moved in I saw one fall from the shower vent ten seconds after I stepped out of the shower. I had a sobbing anxiety attack and my boyfriend came to kill it for me. For context- I have not seen my boyfriend in three months because I work with covid patients and don't want to risk exposing anyone. So for me to cave and allow him to come over was beyond reason. I called the landlord and he came by the next day and replaced the vent filter and cleaned it out. I thought all would be good and well. I just saw another one as I was getting water from the kitchen. I ran back to my room and ducttaped underneath the door that connects them. 

That's where I'm at and I'm at a loss. I know I need to be an adult and face my fears but good God this is paralyzing. Maybe I need to seek therapy lol but the immediate issue at hand is if I should continue living here or not. I will call my landlord tomorrow and tell him the exterminators need to come again if I'm going to continue living here. My gut reaction is to bite the bullet and look for places with roommates so that someone can kill the bugs for me if they show up?? A juvenile way of thinking and I would so much rather live on my own but not if it means I have to fend these things off on my own. I'm in a month to month lease right now so I can essentially leave at any time.

320,I am currently getting my ass kicked in this game. What is the secret?,24May2020,1
321,"Basically, I (25F) am really struggling with my roommate Nancy's (25F) lack of cleaning in our home. I met Nancy through work about five years ago and we got along phenomenally and I consider her one of my best friends on top of my roommate and when she asked me to live with her last year I didn't think twice before agreeing. We moved into our home about three months ago, I have always lived with family until this so this was my first serious 'independence' so I figured something were just how the outside world worked. But i think know I'm just being taken advantage of. 

I can't handle the lack of cleaning from Nancy. She refuses to wash anything that's 'hand wash' because it upsets her, so if she can't shove it in a dishwasher she'll just leave it to the side. This is the extent of her cleaning, she does nothing else. Where as on Saturday mornings (mostly because of my mother who was an extreme clean freak and would call me a disgusting pig if I didn't have my room entirely cleaned, vacuumed and moped by 9am on a Saturday morning and out helping clean other parts of the house) I get up and clean the house from top to bottom. I leave her room (which has started to emit a funk due to her refusing to open her windows) and the spare room that her cat lives in while I allow my cat out that reeks of cat pee because she refuses to buy her cat a litter tray that has high wall so 80% of the litter ends up on our carpet. We both own cats, she refuses to let them meet until 'the time is right' and insists on a day/night schedule between them, meaning on Nancy's days off my cat can be left in my room alone for upwards of 12hrs alone while I'm at work/traveling. My cat has a kitty litter, water and food bowl with a crate of toys but it's not right to leave her locked up like that. Especially when Nancy gets angry if her cat is locked up for more than twenty minutes after we're both home. 

 Keeping on top of the house takes me awhile and it takes up most of my Saturday's meaning I really only get one day off to enjoy myself,  while she has four days where she lounges around and does nothing but continue to make a mess.  I've tried to leave it and refuse to clean to see how long it will take her to finally do something but I hate living in squalor so I crack and clean it before she does. I suggested that maybe we hire a cleaner if cleaning is such an issue for her, but she got aggressive with me and said ""we have to pull our heads out of our asses and clean more then""....what? I AM THE ONLY ONE DOING ANYTHING IN THIS PLACE. We have three bathrooms and she uses two, I have an ensuite that I solely use and I asked her when was the last time she cleaned her bathroom (not the 3rd one, her personal one) and she just laughed at me. She tells me that she sweeps weekly but I know it's not true. I broke the broom the second week of living together and threw it out, we don't own a goddamn broom for her to sweep with! 

She also decides to do her washing on the Saturday and Sunday, depending on when I do mine. We own one air dryer and if my clothes are hanging there, she'll remove them and put them damp into a basket and hang her clothing. She has two whole other days to do this, but chooses the only time I have spare to do it. Her excuse is the air dryer is her's and I'm only borrowing it so she gets priority. 

I'm really trying not to let this affect our friendship but it is, she's an absolute slob and I hate living with her when it comes to her lack of cleaning. She told me that this was the cleanest house she's ever lived in and that I'm just pedantic thanks to my mother (which yes, i am, but when is wanting a clean house such a bad thing and I'm nowhere near as cleanly as my mother considering she calls ME a slob) but Nancy can't seem to see the connection that the only reason this house is as clean as it is, is because I'm the one breaking my back to keep it clean. 

How do I go about this? Sorry this was a bit of a rant as much as it was me seeking advice, it definitely felt good to key smash my frustrations out as I don't want to blow up at her but I'm also sick of mothering her and cleaning this entire house myself. I want to try and salvage our friendship because outside of her lack of cleaning, she is a pretty good friend.",24May2020,1

326,"I'll start off by saying that I am female and that in the past I have liked other females. This is something very difficult for me to talk about for whatever reasons, I even have a difficult time typing it. I think I may have some sort of internalized homophobia over what has happened, even though I am completely supportive of others.

Three years ago I lost a large majority of my friends because they just didn't want to be my friend anymore, whether it was related or not I don't know but I think I was just quite annoying at the time, to be honest, and I don't blame them. This really hurt me since we had all been best friends for more than six years and I still get a little sad about it from time to time.

I told them all at the time, that I thought I might be interested in women and men. They were fully supportive of me, they asked me if I liked anyone we knew, etc and I told them. I wish I had never brought it up.

Recently, (in the last three years), almost everybody I know has found out and many of them are quite homophobic. I don't feel comfortable around a lot of them even though I used to and I think this is a large reason. I have been isolated and I don't know if this is the reason why (I doubt it) and it's probably because I lost my popular friends but it happened around the time.

For a long time, I blamed my old friends, thinking they had spread the rumors about me in spite or something.

Recently I have found out the one who started all of this was my close friend and that she lied to me several times. (I know for certain)

I once came to her crying, saying people had come up to me asking if it was true and that I thought it was one of our old friends and that I couldn't believe they would do this. She told me she agreed and named several of them she thought may have done it and told me she hoped I felt better and that it was ""so awful they would do that to me."" and remind me of all the horrible crap they did to avoid me in the past.

I asked one of the several people who asked me if it was true (all her friends) who had told them about it because I just wanted them to stop. She said she had ""forgotten"" and if my friend who told everyone knew about it because she was there and ""didn't know"" to hide the messages or not. Basically my ""friend"" was there orchestrating the whole thing trying to make me think it wasn't her, even though at the time it never even crossed my mind.  


Sometimes I think it's my fault she thought she could tell everyone because I used to be so confident about it but I begged her time after time not to tell anyone so I don't know.  


I have been acting like nothing has changed but this still hurts me every single day.",24May2020,1
327,"Okay so, this is the first Reddit post I've ever written and it sounds extremely childish. It's going to be a bit rant-y but please read it because I'm getting desperate.

I'm getting pissed off at myself. 

I feel like I'm five years old, I keep needing to touch certain things certain places and say certain things, and even type a good bye to a friend until it feels *just right.* Even if that means asking them to type something specific and letting me respond me with my message and asking them not to respond or interrupt with messages in between. 

My dad came into my room the other night to talk to me. He was about 6 feet away from me, but I needed him to back up. I can't even describe it. I saw this certain space on the floor, near my vent and felt like it needed to have something touching it. I guess my brain decided since he was there, I could ask him to backup until he was filling that space. He asked if he could sit on my bed and I told him no, it just didn't feel right. The space on my bed couldn't be filled until the space on the floor was filled, even if it was only filled a second. My dad kept asking me why and I couldn't tell him. It needed to be, I knew if they space on the floor was filled I'd feel better. I couldn't describe it. I know it sounds silly, but the space not being filled felt like the end of the world.

I feel like such an ass doing stuff like this. I can't control what other people do to make me feel better. But it's so hard to just ignore the urges.

When I try to not touch or do things that my brain tells me to, it- It doesn't work. I could hold off for an hour. But in the end I'm going to do it and if I'm not doing it, I'm thinking about doing it. It's all I'm thinking about. I feel like I have no control. 

I kept picking at the skin on my lip, it started to make my lip bruise and bleed so I decided I needed to stop or I might get an infection. I can't though. If I try to not pick at it, I'll get a weird uncomfortable feeling and if I hold off for too long I might even cry because the feeling I get for not giving into an urge is unbearable. And when I say unbearable, I mean it. It feels like I'm subjecting myself to mental torture.

There are so many weird uncontrollable things that keep happening. Sometimes I'll hear a word and it will stick. It's all I can think about. The word won't leave my mind. So I have to repeat it over and over again in my head or at a whisper, then I have to memorize the definition. Then I have to repeat the definition over and over again until I feel okay. The last time I did this was with the word Limerence and it took up about four hours of my night. I didn't go to bed that night because I was so stressed out **over a word**. It makes me feel crazy. I cried for an hour after because the whole event had me so worked up. Typing it out makes it sound insane, and it is, but it happens so often that it's normal for me to not get a full nights sleep.

I have to lock my bedroom door during the day or my whole room feels off, but if I lock it at night I can't sleep or unlock it and lock it again until it *feels right*. I can't go to bed without peeing first, but if I don't fall asleep within about 5 minutes (which I never do) I need to pee again. I go to the bathroom about 15 times each night or until it  *feels right*. Out of the blue I'll need to count in my head and I can't stop counting until it *feels right*. I'll see an object and need to touch it somewhere until it *feels right*. It's mostly stuff that only affects me but when I do need people to do things like hug me a certain way for a certain amount of time, or text me goodnight/bye in a certain fashion, it feels weird and controlling. But when completed it feels great to have given into the urge.

I think most of it stems from some worry of something happening. Like locking my door in the day because it feels safer and not at night incase there's an emergency. Or going pee a bunch because I'm scared of peeing the bed, which is stupid because I haven't peed the bed in 10 years. Or memorizing words/definitions/facts because I'm scared there will be some situation where the information will be needed. I'm not sure why I need to touch objects and the counting usually happens when I get an urge, but there's no way for it to be fulfilled, like seeing a stranger on the street and needing to touch a part of their hat. So I just count in my head instead. 

The counting is terrible too because it will happen when I'm in public with people, so I can't talk to anyone, or focus on anything but numbers. And I'm not counting out loud so I'm just standing or sitting silently, ignoring everything around me, stressed out of my mind. 

Is this all normal stuff? It feels like it's affecting my private, and sometimes public, life. It takes up so much of my mental energy and drains me. I know everyone gets urges but is it normal to for them to stress me out to the point of breaking down crying? 

These urges are taking up so much of my life and I want it to stop. It's all happening internally so when I do reach out to family/friends about what I'm experiencing they say they haven't noticed anything and I'm probably fine. Am I fine? These feelings and urges are just so indescribable that this post makes them sound childish and stupid. But they're making basic living difficult and stressful. 

I feel like I have to avoid different thoughts and situations. I feel like my mind is constantly having to fight off these unwanted feelings and thoughts. Other people get the same unwanted thoughts and feelings I do, but I feel like they effect me way worse and take all my mental energy and other people can just brush them off. I feel like other people have found a way to deal with this stuff but I'm crying over the word Limerence for four hours. The urges, feelings, and thoughts, the way I deal with them. Only I can witness it. It's in my head and body. The thoughts never leave. The stress follows me, it doesn't matter if I'm alone or with people. I feel like if I don't get help soon, I'll never work up the courage too.

What do I do about this? Will the urges and feelings go away, because they're getting worse? How do I talk to my family about this without sounding controlling? 

I feel so lost on what to do because this is quite literally taking over my entire life and mind.",24May2020,1

329,"Many times in my life, especially when it comes to conversations where I’m trying to convince someone of something, I feel like my brain is 100 paces ahead of where my mouth is. I always subconsciously know what my point is, am Always overthinking the possibilities of what I said, their response to it, what is the most effective way of getting my point, but not a single word has left my mouth and I am left pretty much silent. I never know where to start, and my points always come across as generic and losing purpose while I say them. 

When I talk to someone, its terribly formulaic because i’m always thinking 2 exchanges ahead of where I am. If Im saying something, Im doing it already having assumed my reaction to their reaction, if that makes sense. Holding a conversation is tough, because I find it too hard to focus on them as a person, rather than focusing on their body language, how they are reacting to me, what I should say to psychologically manipulate them into liking me, etc. 

This makes it very tough to interact with others in real life, and its made me a generally quiet and reserved person, and I feel like I always need to lower myself down mentally, for the occasion, to engage in anything. I feel like I’m constantly acting  a persona  that I’m not.

One of my mottos has always been “honesty is the best policy” and I don’t preach it lightly, I always try my best to be honest and expect others to be honest with me as well-even when it’d hurt. Everyone around me knows how serious I am with this. 

I always wonder if sth is wrong me that people never ever approach me irl, I’m 23 and still haven’t been in an actual relationship. I don’t know if it’s because I’m unattractive or just a repugnant person but other than people on Tinder and at bars/clubs, no one ever ever approaches me. Last time I was in a “relationship” was when I was between 13-15 I guess, it was hidden from everyone and was toxic (he would always insult me and expect sexual favors which I repeatedly rejected).

So going back to the issue at hand: I’ve been sorta violating my honesty motto for several years regarding my romantic/sexual past which is pretty much non-existent. It’s not as though I make up stories or people, most of the time I don’t actually say anything and let people assume whatever they want. However, I’ve lied a couple of times so people would continue on assuming the stuff they assume, such as;
1. Tell people that I tend to spill my secrets when I’m drunk when in fact, I know for a fact I make up lies when I’m drunk. 
2. Embellish some stories just a little so it’d seem as though I’ve been sexually active.
3. Act as though I’ve been in an actual romantic relationship before without sharing any details whatsoever. 
4. Act as though I’ve had sexual encounters irl when in fact it has only actually happened once.
5. I’ve made out with many people when I’m drunk, I’ve never had a kiss while sober. I usually never forget anything when I’m drunk but I can safely say that I do not remember who first kiss was, how it was or even my first drink. 

This has been haunting and literally tormenting me for a while. I keep on lying or omitting from telling the truth because I’m terrified, because the thought of people (incl. my closest friends) treating like I’m the lamest person around them and distancing themselves from me scares me deeply.

353,So I’ve worked for my current job since the day I turned 16. I’m almost 22 years old. I’ve never worked for another job so I have no clue how to go about writing a notice of leave for my current employer. My family has been of no help with this. Keep in mind I have already given a verbal 3 week notice over 2 weeks ago now. But today my manager told me he had to have a written notice with accurate dates and times of the day I told him I was leaving and what my final day would be. How should I go about writing out this notice.????,24May2020,1
354,"Prepare for a long one.

About 8 months ago I met this girl, now my girlfriend through Instagram. We talked for a while before we decided to do a long distance relationship. It was something I thought I was ready for and I really liked her. We had a connection unlike any girl I’ve dated in real life, she likes all the same video games as me, movies, we are both pursuing a career in music and everything about her just seemed so perfect to me. And I had just landed my first real job so I figured it wouldn’t be distance for very long regardless, and I could go see her and her me. We are now five months into this relationship and I am realizing this huge mistake I have made.

She is extremely clingy. Clingy on a level I have never seen before. And this was not a trait I was aware of until a couple of months ago when I really started noticing it and being frustrated by it. It is total hell.

To understand why this is so bothersome for me you have to know that I am a very introverted person. Most of my life has been spent in my room alone as I was bullied extremely severely when I was younger and grew up having no friends, so I have come to prefer being alone over the presence of anyone, even my closest friends and family. That is not the problem, however, and if that should concern you know that my social skills have improved ten fold as I have gotten older and I do have a lot of friends at this point in my life. Being alone just became the norm for me and it hasn’t changed because this is just the way I choose to live my life. 

Regardless, dealing with her would be hell for anyone. Let me explain. 

I cannot have a day off with her. Every single day I wake up to dozens of texts, photos of her, memes, anything she thinks I will find interesting, she blows up my phone with it. Sometimes I will wake up to 6-7 missed FaceTime calls and before I started turning off my phone before I went to sleep I would be woken up at 4AM by her trying to call me over something that could’ve waited until I woke up. This only gets worse when I tell you that I have a very very bad sleep schedule, something she is fully aware of yet is completely ignorant to. I have a job that I work morning-afternoon shifts most days, and I had to buy an alarm clock for myself because I didn’t want to keep using my phone and risk being woken up by her. 

This is not the only way that she is clingy. Throughout the day I will get text after text after text and call after call even when she knows I am working and cannot get on my phone. 

And as soon as I get off work, guess what is expected of me? FaceTime calls. Texts. It is exhausting. I do not remember a day in the past 3 months I didn’t talk to her on the phone. 

I have tried on multiple occasions to ask for a break, explaining to her that I just want some time by myself and that it is nothing that she did and that I am not mad at her, but she refuses to let up. Even on the days she tells me I can have to myself, she still ends up calling me with some stupid excuse, usually something she could’ve just texted me or told me the next day. And if I decline the call I get spammed with text after text until I call her back. A text back is never enough. I always end up having to call her.

Something else I also struggle with her is her ridiculous sexual drive. She will talk about how horny she is 4-5 times in a conversation. When I first met her, of course I was attracted to her and wanted to see photos of her but I am completely numb to it now and have no desire to see any pictures or videos of her with any sort of context to that because of how many she has sent me. I have not asked her for a photo and I have not sent her a photo in months, and usually when she tries to “get me in the mood” I am so put off by it that I have to make up an excuse to leave or go along with it and make up some reason that I couldn’t right then so she doesn’t think that I don’t want too. 

She is also a very very sensitive person, and will cry over almost anything. Sometimes over things that were completely her fault, and yours truly has the pleasure of trying to calm her down over a 3-4 hour long shit-show of her claiming that her life sucks and that she is a nobody and no one loves her. When I do eventually calm her down she acts as if I am her hero, her knight in shining armor. And she has told me many times that she couldn’t imagine life without me, despite the fact that she has never even met me in real life.

Before you say it, yes I have discussed this with her. Yes I have tried to tell her she is too much, no she does not listen. I have said it in the nicest way possible, she cries. I have said it with a tone of frustration, she bawls. She has told me so many times that she is so afraid that I’m going to break up with her and she feels like she’s fucking it up yet makes no attempt to fix any of the issues I have addressed in this post and to her face. She knows that she is obsessive, and expects me to accept with the same level of love and compassion, and I just can’t. I don’t reciprocate nearly the same level of love that she has for me. But she is completely blind to that, it seems.

I just have no idea what to do. I don’t want this relationship anymore, but I also cannot endure the guilt of ending it. She is so obsessed with me it would literally destroy her if I broke up with her, and if she hurt herself or worse I would be living with that for the rest of my life, something that seems perfectly within the realm of possibility with her. She has done it before. 

Please, anyone. Tell me how to do this. I have tried everything, I’m just completely at a loss here. I am exhausted and tired. 

Oh, and another giant fuck you to this whole situation is that she befriended my friends through an Instagram chat that she created without asking anybody, and has gotten rather close to them at this point in time. So there’s that.",24May2020,1
355,"I'm 18. They found the condoms and told my entire family and my eight younger siblings. They kicked me out. Locked the doors. I don't play around.

When I brought that up they disregarded it and said it was besides the point and didn't matter. Besides this, things are REALLY bad between my family and I because I am never good enough for them.

356,"I'm not exactly sure if this is the right sub but I needed to get this off my chest and needed some advice and an outside perspective. My family and I live in a ranch and we have 3 goats (two Nigerian Dwarfs and a Boar goat I think is what she is not totally sure) and a sheep. They're amazing animals and are basically like dogs to us now. 

Now I work at a store and they had some broccoli and end pieces of bread to get rid of so I gladly took it for my goats since they love bread and broccoli. I decided to give them 3-5 heads of broccoli (I gave these to them at the same time and made sure they didn't eat too fast) over the course of a couple days and I gave the sheep the bread.

Now I get a text from my aunt saying our youngest goat Poppy is very sick. The bacteria in his rumen is all put of wack and it's causing his rumen to shut down and he's become bloated and other things I don't quite understand all because of what I did. 

She was so condescending and got mad when I told her I'd leave the goats alone and that I felt horrible for this. She called me ""pissy"" and all that which made me feel awful because I'm not. She acts like a know it all and thinks my opinions don't matter and that I'm ""closed minded"" for not hearing her out even though she is the one who doesn't listen to others opinions. Anything that isn't correct to her is worth being passive agressive over. 

Overall I feel like absolute crap right now. I might've killed my goat by accident and I 100% didn't mean to hurt him. He's the sweetest goat and has been with us for a little over a year now. At this point I don't want anything to do with the goats anymore. I feel terrible for what I did to him and there's literally nothing we can do for him. I can't take back what I did so I godda learn from it and move on. I'll be staying away from my goats because I don't want to hurt them anymore, even if I learn from this I'm terrified I'll do something to unintentionally hurt them like I did with Poppy. 

If you have any advice on how I should prepare for my aunt's eventual confrontation please let me know. I'm sure she's going to get snappy and yell at me even though it was an accident. And if anybody has any advice on how to process this please let me know, it's gonna be hard seeing those cuties running around without their brother because of me. Thanks you",24May2020,1

But ever since I met my this girl (now my girlfriend for the past few years), there was someone relying on me to be there for them. I want to be there for her and I've been trying for years. 

She's always under immense stress from work and her family's financial situation (mother and brother), and I honestly think that its causing depression on top of all the stress.

I'm always trying to talk to her about non-work things, watching videos with her (online, as we cannot be in physical contact, and that is making the situation worse), I'm one call away if she ever needs to rant or vent it complain or if she needs someone to talk to you when to distract her, I send her memes and try to make her laugh with very lame dad type jokes, etc. You get the point. I even try to help her with her work whenever it is possible for me to do so.

My question is, how can I be there for her to help her relive all that stress? I'm asking cuz I'm pretty bad at this and she has said that to me once when she was pissed (""you're really bad at talking to people when they're upset"" or something along those lines).

I'm a 22 years old female and I don't understand what's wrong with me. I came to conclusion that I have some sort of mental health problem and since it's quarantine, I can't get checked anytime soon

Basically my problem: I'm a complete loner and the last time I had a real friend was when I was 12 years old. I used to have intense panic attacks, sudden emotion/ sadness/ anger outbursts and because of this, it was hard for me to keep a relationship with somebody else..

Those emotion attacks would just start with overthinking.. sometimes I would get very depressed and cut myself, but other times I would get happy breathless excited.. sometimes I would feel numb and very lazy for some time... After it went away, I just got back to normal life again

I would get those overwhelming emotion attacks 1-5 times a month

I was an outcast in high school because I wasn't as mentally mature as my peers? They were interested in dating and experimenting sexually, while at 15 I had no interest in that and just couldn't wait to get back home to watch my favorite tv show at the time...

Also I never had particular interests, goals in live. Just went with the flow... School, home, home school...

During my summer holidays I just did nothing, watched my favorite shows, helped family and etc. Communicating with others was hard because I had nothing in common with my peers.. even talking was hard...I was constantly called uncultured and etc. I never fit in with anybody...

At 18 I got my first job and fell in love for the first time... It was a painful and learning experience. I was rejected for not being like others...

I can't make a lasting connection with somebody. All of my friendships die after a few months.. I feel lazy and don't have the same desire for life as my peers. I waist my time.. I'm still innocent and never had a serious romantic relationship...

I don't understand what's wrong with me. Why can't I just be like my peers, happy, social, active, full of life and desire to live..

I isolate myself because of my mood and emotions.

I know that there's something wrong with me...What can it possibly be? HELP",24May2020,1

367,"A few years ago, when I was in 7th grade, I had this really old, ornery ELA teacher. Her name was Ms. Jones, and outside of hanging up my drawing on her wall for the entire year, she never really did anything nice when it came to me. She was a very nit-picky woman when it came to our writing assignments. She often would give me an ok to do one thing on said assignments, then mark it wrong or scold me for it later.

That's what happened the day I lost my love for writing. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

For context, our assignment (I think) was to write a narrative. As far as I remember, we were supposed to write a story based on something original, to create a short story full of things we came up with on our own.  I had this idea of writing something for my favorite game at the time, but I didn't want to do anything without consulting Ms. Jones, as I knew well enough by then how unforgiving she could be with mistakes. I remember asking her if I could borrow the characters but put them in an entirely new situation, and to my pleasure, she said yes. So I went to work. I finished up the narrative, and once I was satisfied, I turned it in.

A few days later, I got the notification. Ms. Jones had given the paper a forty percent.

Of course, I was shocked at this. I looked at the grading app for any comments from her, trying to see what mistakes she found or what she didn't like. Turns out, she had run the paper through a plagiarism checking site. The paper came back almost sixty percent plagiarized because the characters I used already existed in a copyrighted video game. 

I was so confused. Ms. Jones gave me the okay to use those characters. I heard her say it!  After stressing over it to the point of tears, I finally bit the bullet and messaged her directly. 

I can't remember exactly what I said, but I know the gist of it. I told her I got the notification and was wondering if I could talk to her about my grade later on, either before or after class. I also said I was appalled (for some reason) at the grade I had been given. Looking back on it now, better words could have been used. 

She replied back a little bit later. She agreed to meet with me to discuss the grade, but also added something I remember clearest all these years later - *""I'm appalled too""*. 

So ""later on"" rolls around. Before or after, I can't remember, but I meet Ms. Jones outside of class to ""discuss my grade"". It turns into her lecturing me on plagiarism, and I'm standing up against the wall, trying to tell her ""But Ms. Dean, you said I could use those characters. I asked you and you gave me permission, don't you remember?"" 

She didn't care. I soon gave up on trying to defend myself. I just wanted to sit down and cry it out for a little bit. I had to keep the forty percent. One of my proudest works squandered, absolutely ruined for me. 

From that day on, there's been a noticeable change in my interest in writing. No longer do I feel the motivation to create stories, with original characters or not. I never finish anything I start to create. I constantly nitpick my writing, acting like Ms. Jones is still looming over my shoulder with her scowl, watching me make mistakes I don't notice. I rely a lot more on the positive reception of my works now, but even with the support of friends, it never helps for long. I feel trapped in my head. 

I used to be considered really gifted in writing. I won awards for it long ago. I could spin a tale so crazy that it'd make your head hurt. I could take the craziest plots and make threequels out of them.

But now I can barely finish a one-thousand-word chapter without breaking down. The spark I had in me has been stomped out, and it feels hopeless to try and get it back. I talk down on my old writing for being ""cringy', when in reality, I miss that part of me. I miss being able to write stupid, cringy stuff. Because at least I was actually writing back then. At least I was actually having fun creating.

I don't know what to do. I'm really scared that if this disinterest continues, I'll lose the will to write forever. I'm still imaginative, I still get plenty of really cool ideas. But they're so obviously watered down, and I never write them to their fullest, anyways.

Does anyone have any last advice? I've lost so much hope.",24May2020,1
368,"My household is fairly casual, usually we walk back and forth to our rooms from our bathroom naked and it’s casual. I went down to the kitchen to give a funny fright to my mum by running up to her naked and see her freak out (which I’ve done before). And this is where my dad comes in.

My dad was angry at me recently over an argument that occurred only moments before. He was also in the kitchen when it occurred. Whilst it was happening, he proceeded to pull out his phone and take photos of me during the event. 

I was really shocked at the time and kept questioning him of why he was doing and telling him to stop. This had never happened before. I ran off to my room to get on clothes and argue to him about it.

My dad has had a history of me accidentally walking into him watching porn, and me finding his old xxx dvds he hides from his wife (my mum) he’s married for around 34 years, he sometimes acted strange around me in naked state, like weird stares, but I never took it to concern

I kept asking him to delete it, my mum was yelling frok behind telling me he did, but my dad kept ignoring the question and refused to show me his camera roll when I asked for him to see it. He kept saying “go away” or “I don’t have to show you anything” (I have these quotes from the first confrontation I got on video). I went back to my room after calling him a creep, which seemed to aggravate him to the point where he cane into my room to argue with me.

 (I also get quotes form video I took of the event)
When I’m my room, he had gone on about my recent behaviour and I was being disrespectful for calling him a “creep” and a “weirdo”. I asked him once again why he wouldn’t show me his phone, and he said “that’s irrelevant, you are being disrespectful”.  I said back to him “why is it irrelevant if it was the main concern”? He began to walk off saying “learn to behave yourself” whilst ignoring my arguments. 

I got grounded for the next week because “I was being disrespectful” and my parents are Threatening to punish me further if I keep questioning him. I’m really angered by their consistent power abuse and the fact they ignore me when there’s and argument they fee they’re wrong in.

My mom, out of the blue, usually on the weekends, goes into a weird and creepy mood that just scares the crap out of me. I do not want to be anywhere near her, stay close to other people, and just not look her in the eye or give her a response of more than 3 words as much as I can, and she. doesn't. stop. She gives me mumbles or weak responses, is really quiet, is writing things in her journal secretively ( my assumption is that she writes in the dark because some family members cannot see in the dark and think she is doing work . I am the only one besides her \*as far as i know\* who can also read in the dark and suspect her sudden withdrawal ), and the worst part is that she gets really touchy and mushy with me, and it may be to everyone, but I feel as if it's directed towards me, because I know shes up to something, and I am very uncomfortable with her doing that, and she most likely knows that because she sees that I do not like that, but she proceeds to act weird anyway. She says weird or random things that really nerve me. Just today my parents were picking up takeout and on my way to tell them goodbye,she just walks by me and says ""thank you"" before i even said goodbye, for absolutely no reason. When I ask her what for, she says ""for being you"" which prompts me to think that shes going through this mood again and that I should stay away. When I was supposed to be asleep she woke me up at ELEVEN PM and just kept staring at me like I did something, when I really have nothing to hide from her. She would just walk up to certain parts of my room and touch, open and close things, then just stand over me. I didn't do anything to make her worried, shes treating everyone like this, and i just want to be somewhere else to escape from this. This is not the first time it's happened, either.

Then she all of the sudden asked me weird questions such as ""what is the perfect circle"" or ""what does perfect mean to you"" I was legitimately trying to make a round symmetrical shape, and then she acts as if me making shapes with putty is some sort of sign of self hate, thinking im not perfect, and that I need help, which i take offence to. she then starts laughing and hugging me and touching me too much and if im being honest, touches me in places i do not want to be touched such as my back or legs, which i am NOT ok with. She then prevents me from going downstairs so she can make more ""perfect circles"" with me and i run downstairs anyway crying because i'm extremely confused as to what is going on. She THEN acts as if nothing happened, starts laughing, continues trying to hug me despite me refusing to, and has even denied some of the things she said or did. Nonetheless I was still able to talk to my siblings once she was gone and I felt safer when they believed me and agreed that they thought her behavior was weird too.What really made everything click was when my suspicions were raised about the diary she was writing in. At FIRST, i believed that the book was a notebook for diets, exercise, work, and groceries. When I snuck into my moms book, it turned out to be a diary with entries about personal matters. I was then mortified to see her talk about her drinking problems, her concerns about discrimination, etc. My mom has been acting like she knows something i did when i didnt do anything yet hides things from us and only makes it worse because then I dont know the cause of her behavior.

What should I do, confront her about it, or talk to someone else about it? I want to ask her at some point but not without someone else, I dont want to be stuck with someone who frightens the living day lights out of me alone, without anyone else knowing about the situation.",24May2020,1

I don't even know where to turn anymore. This guy always says the worst things, he's racist af, and he controls every single thing she does. ""But I love him, I can't help how I feel. Why don't you care how about my feelings?"" This is the reply I always get when I try to make her realize how horrible he is. We've been fighting so bad about it the past few days that it's gotten to the point that I told her that if she wants to continue down this path of voluntary abuse (which she agrees is abuse, btw) then I will no longer watch her go further and further down this hole and I will not talk to her as long as she stays with him. She still chose him. This guy has destroyed countless things that my brother's and I have made for her as children, pawned everything she's ever cared about, he's gotten them evicted from so many places that she has trouble renting from anyone now. He fucked up her credit score, because he always makes her put things in her name so he doesn't get fucked when he tells her to cancel her card and not pay their bills. He threw us both out the other day, and he screamed at her to give her the keys to our storage unit IN HER NAME because he ""didn't trust us."" He is constantly smoking crack behind her back, he just does whatever the hell he wants. This is just the tip of the ice berg. I truly am lost, I just want what's best for my mother and she thinks she can't do any better. I've even considered pissing the guy off just so he beats the hell out of me just so she can finally see how horrible he his. He has already laid hands on me and my 2 brothers in the past, but each time my mom begged us not to get cops involved. Now it's too late to do anything about it. I don't know what to do... I know this is a huge wall of text, sorry I'm ranting. I really need help because I'm so scared for her but I'm so lost... the abuse is only mental but I've been in some really bad mentally abusive relationships and none of them compare to this... I can only imagine the psychological toll this is having on her...

So do I follow through with not talking to her anymore? It doesn't feel right but I don't know how else to realize that she is in a horrible situation and needs to get the hell out of it or it's not going to end well... What should I do??? :'( I'm losing my mind over this...TIA",24May2020,1
371,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend for about 2 and a half years, and I’m really happy in my relationship. Nothing I’m about to say has anything to do with him, it’s more my family. My dad has always been an emotionally abusive asshole, he’s incredibly distant and takes little to no interest in most of my life except for when he can criticise and lecture me. I go to counselling by myself to undo the emotional trauma he put me through as a child, plus the anxiety I suffer as a result. My mum is fine, it’s just my family are honestly shitty and they make me feel uncomfortable. 

I always hang out at my boyfriends house because he has a huge house with two story’s, so we can occupy the lower level while his family has the top level. It just means we get a lot more privacy and we can do our own thing. I get along with his family, I have terrible social anxiety but I always try and have conversations with them whenever I can. I’m never rude and I always make an effort wherever I can.

My dad, however, gets really upset because I try to keep my boyfriend separated from my family. I don’t know why he cares so much. He was the one that restricted me from going to my boyfriends house for dinners with his family up until I was 18. He literally is the reason why only this year I was able to get to know them on a more personal level. Because of how shit my dad has been in the past, of course I don’t want to allow my sweet, gentle boyfriend around him. They have nothing in common. And I don’t want my boyfriend to feel uncomfortable.

I don’t think there’s anything wrong with spending time with my boyfriend away from my family home. I shouldn’t have to bring him around my shithead father but maybe I’m wrong. I am an adult and I can live my life the way I want to, but my dad is starting to make this into a problem. Let me know what you guys think, keep in mind this is a sensitive topic for me and stresses me out quite a bit.",24May2020,1

My father feels that my mother is always complaining and pushing him to the point of being so angry he breaks things from being furious. He does not get violent or destructive I will say and there is no abuse involved, just a very toxic environment for everyone. The worst thing he has done is thrown some plates on the grown and one at a tv which we replaced that same day.

My mother believes that she has no say or no ability to say how she feels about anything without my father getting furious. I don't know how to say this but my dad does get angry but sometimes reasonably and others unreasonably.

I am only 17 years old but I would say I'm quite bright but definitely not specialized in marriage counseling. Playing a medium role in their arguments is very hard for me and I don't always know if I'm saying the right thing. 

What should I do? I plan to find a marriage counselor asap but how do I know that the person is the right one? I understand diplomas and certifications but how do I know I'm not getting an awful deal?

Eventually I hopped in a game with this guy (Maybe 28?) which is normally not a problem for me calling ppl that are older than me unless they start to creep.

Him: OH SHIT LOL i said dad as you typed that

Him: good game :3

Me: yeah, u got any wins?

Him: you mean for br?

Him: yeah

Him: i have 2 or 3 battle royale wins

Me: yeah lmfaoooo

## me: oh lol

him: yeah, but some are weird af so I just like the art and those fursuit things a bit

him: but thats funny you like vodka, i do too. we should drink some night and fucking play some wz, get lit (I made a comment about vodka being the best alcohol)

me: that sounds fun (not knowing what to respond)

him: hell yeah well ill let you play some more matches dude, so you dont get killed or some shit. lmk when ur done, we can just chill

When we first met she knew she did which is why she tried to just keep a distance because she was scared. But she had to move on, she didn't tell my because she didn't want me to feel like it was my fault!?

381,"I just graduated with my Master's degree this week from Cal State LA, but I went home to Houston to help out my mom and avoid the virus at the end of March when everything shut down for quarantine. Now 3 months later, my late-50s landlady/roommate wants to know when I'll return to LA because I've been paying $800 for a room and I left my car with a friend since there was a street sweeping moratorium and even that is starting back again. I don't really want to go back to live with my roommates because she is still working as a caregiver for her 90 something-year-old aunt (not sure how she doing that) and her 26 yr old son has super poor hygiene AND takes up all the wifi speed due to gaming. If I'm going to be quarantined forever, I at least need fast wi-fi ya know. Not to mention how cramped the apartment is with NO AC summer in LA is HORRIFIC omg. So what do I do? 

**Alternatives I've considered have been:** 

* Ship my car home to Texas and just keep paying rent until I do return to LA (what I prefer)
* Take the risk to fly back to LA and just stay put/deal with this (easiest option least prefer)
* Rent a car to drive back to LA, move out, then drive back to TX ( it's a hassle and that 2000 mile drive alone is dangerous but possible)
* End lease PAY SOMEONE to move out my stuff which is just clothes,tv ,and knick-knacks don't have much and then ship that along with my car to me to TX. (mom suggested this, least preferred but possible)

Obviously the biggest thing I have to consider here is how much am I risking exposing my roommates if I go back to LA or them exposing me considering how high the numbers are in LA compared to my county in Houston. I asked my landlady/roommate for insight and she didn't actually offer solutions, just that when I do return I need to quarantine in my room for 2 weeks which is already self-explanatory...  

Because I'm in stasis and the country is in limbo, I'm finding it very difficult to make a quick decision that doesn't result in either sickness or misery, but I also understand that no matter what some level of discomfort or inconvenience will happen...

**TLDR** left my car in LA at the end of March yet still paying $800 for a room but I've been staying with my mom in Houston as I finished my grad degree so should I return to move out or just go back to stay in LA and stop inconveniencing everyone and suffer the heat and crampness and risk exposure to the virus from roommates.

382,"The unit above mine will be available. It's a one bedroom apartment for $100/month more than the studio I have been living in for the past two years.

It's on the top floor so it's more private. I'm assuming it's more quiet, as you don't have to deal with upstair footsteps. The one thing I hate the most about my unit is the constant thumping of footsteps I hear through my ceiling. Although, the upstair unit is adjacent to a neighbor who invites people over almost every night, parties a lot and he's been there for years.

The layout is odd. The upstair apartment's layout is exactly the same as my studio apartment, but with a wall in the middle to make it a one bedroom apartment and so it's oddly cramped. Although, I guess the additional wall helps with noise.

My hugest concern is quality. Maintenance is pretty poor and unreliable in this building. One of the other tenants was complaining to me about the build quality of his unit and the workaround he has to do to deal with it.  My cousin, out of the goodness of his heart, fixed so many things when I moved in. (I know I know. That's the landlord's responsibility, but that's just the reality of housing right now and how competitive it is for tenants) And there was A LOT of broken janky things that we had to redo. Leaks, wires, mold, hinges etc. They didn't finish the repainting walls so we repainted the whole thing ourselves. It was a lot of work and time. If it wasn't for my cousin's labor, his tools and supplies, it would have cost me an arm and a leg.

Not to mention, the tenant that resided in my studio before me was the *building manager.* So the state of the studio before I moved in and fixed everything was actually the best in the building. I can only imagine what the other units are like. 

Also, this is the second time in the last two years that a tenant of the upstair unit decided to not renew their lease and move out. So I'm pretty suspicious.

Some of my friends are telling me to take it while some are saying no. I mean a $100/month might not seem a lot to pay for, but that adds up and IDK if it's worth $100 more for a studio apartment with a wall in the middle.

TL;DR - Should I cough up a $100 more a month for a one bedroom apartment on the top floor, even though it's a studio with a wall in the middle and has janky quality?",24May2020,1

388,"Back story - not gonna be super specific for anonymous purposes:

Growing up, I had a pretty rough childhood, mainly because my mom has a serious mental illness and it deeply affected me and my siblings. My mom experienced psychosis often, which is really scary for a child to see. I saw some very traumatic things because of it. My dad was and still is very verbally abusive (used to be physically abusive) to my entire family, which made things much worse. Additionally, both of my parents were (and still are) alcoholics. I went into CPS for a little while. After, I started getting panic attacks when I was about 9 years old. I was miserably depressed and anxious in high school. The panic attacks stopped happening so often when I was 19, when I finally went to see a psychiatrist at my university (5 hours away from home) and started taking antidepressants. Antidepressants basically saved my life. I didn’t feel constant anxiety, depression, and severe mood swings went away. I finally felt ‘normal’. 


At this time in my life, I started dating the girl of my dreams (yes, girl - I am a lesbian). Things were going great, and I felt amazing with her. I ended up moving in with her at age 19. Things quickly went downhill and eventually she broke up with me. It was because I wasn’t good to her as I was insecure and constantly thought she would leave me, even when it was obvious she wasn’t at the time. 


The breakup was extremely hard on me. I cried every day for three months straight. I had never felt that way about anyone before and felt like I was losing my mind. I started going out and drinking as much as I could. This created a drinking problem for me. I would go out and party every weekend and my grades plummeted. I eventually had to leave my university last year at 21, after being a year behind in my major. 


Fast forward to now: I am living at home with my parents and am enrolled in community college. So, I have been living at home for almost exactly a year now. I am dependent on my parents and take out loans for college - my parents don’t pay a single penny. Their names are on the loans and if I don’t graduate or get a job soon, they will start having to pay for them - which they bring up all the time and makes me feel guilty. Being at home is awful and it feels like my mental health is deteriorating by the day. Both of my parents drink heavily daily and it makes it extremely hard not to drink. They have screaming matches basically every day, which ends up involving everyone around them. Whenever I leave the house for anything, my dad wants to know exactly where I am and will call me over and over telling me to come home. I feel like I can’t get away. Even though I am almost 23, he’s still telling me what to do. 


I’m 22 years old, and after living by myself in college for 3 years, I miss my freedom. After everything my parents put me through, I feel that I deserve my freedom and independence. I hate being controlled by my parents. There are so many things I want to do that they are heavily against - I want to cut my hair off and get tattoos and wear men’s clothing. My mom thinks I want to do these things to “rebel” against her, which isn’t true. It’s irritating because I want to express myself but my parents won’t “let” me. As a future nurse, I am aware of where I can and cannot get tattoos. I know that these days, nurses are allowed to have non-visible tattoos. My parents know this but don’t care, they tell me not to. It’s bullshit how they think they have authority over my body. I have been obsessing over cutting my hair off and getting a men’s haircut. It is something that I *really* want to do, but my parents don’t even know that I’m gay and I am too scared to tell them. 


I’m stuck at home in an abusive environment and I don’t have any money to move out. I am in thousands of dollars in debt and am not even in nursing school yet. I feel like I can’t be myself and feel trapped and controlled by parents who caused trauma to me when I was little. I pushed away good friends and the only friends I have left have been distancing themselves from me. I can’t stop drinking. And I can’t stop thinking about how much I want to die. What should I do? I’m hopeless.",24May2020,1
389,"I’m an 18 year old female who has been working with my company for about a year (I am in the restaurant business). I love the company, most of my co-workers, and my job.

One of my co-workers (21 year old male) has been harassing me for over 6 months. I’ve showed all of my managers texts and every time an incident at work happens, I immediately report it to them. Nothing has at all changed in the past 6 months and there have been a lot of incidents.

It’s gotten worse over the months. It went from consistently asking me on dates after repeated no’s, to blocking me from leaving the restaurant and begging me to talk to him, to spamming me with texts, and now it’s become so bad that he’ll come up to the restaurant and sit in lobby and stare at me when he’s not scheduled.

A couple days ago I was walking to the back of house (kitchen area) to ask my manager about something on the menu that had changed. My co-worker walked past me in the kitchen and slid his hand around my hips and squeezed my ass. I immediately turned around and starting yelling. Told my manager (there are also cameras where the incident happened so she saw it with her own eyes) and all she said was “get back to work.”

This has been happening for months. I love my job and the pay, but I’m genuinely thinking about quitting because of this certain co-worker and all of my manager’s ineffective actions towards stopping him from harassing me.

391,"this kinda hurts to post but i need to stop ignoring the situation, and i honestly need input because i’m driving myself fucking insane.

i’ve been with the same guy for 3 years now. i just turned 18 and graduated, so i spent pretty much all of high school with him.

he cheated on me multiple times in the first 2 years of us dating and i continually forgave him. finally at 2.5 years i dumped his ass for about a month or two. in that time, one of our mutual friends ended up hanging out with me for the first time in a while. we’ve always been super close and had HELLA chemistry, but we both had the maturity to ignore it for the sake of my relationship... but yeah, i was single, and basically we ended up holding hands and cuddling the whole night before he had to leave, and i kissed him. it was probably the best and happiest i’ve ever felt, in a very very long time. (he’s 6 hours away in the military tho).

my ex and i got back together a while later after i had some VERY traumatic things happen to me and i felt like i had nowhere else to go. he turned himself around and the past 6 months have been insane- he’s never rude to me, never insults me, hasn’t cheated and let me check his phone for peace of mind, and just... has all around treated me amazing and showered me with affection.

but the mutual friend and i are still close, just not romantic for obvious reasons. our friend group has gone almost entirely back to normal, my relationship is functional, etc... but i can’t stop thinking about the guy i kissed. he’s insanely far away, he’s in the military... but he obviously still likes me, we still have a lot of chemistry, and i still feel incredibly happy every single time i get to speak to him or see him.

But then, one of them messaged our gc about plans they’d clearly excluded me from and the others were like “omg lol” to which she replied “sorry lol.” Clearly I was annoyed... and that day at work I avoided talking to them other than a casual “good morning, hi”, and one of them came up to me and was like “omg why are you so quiet today” while the others giggled behind her. It felt so... high school mean girl. So I decided to distance myself from them after that, but they still tried to invite me out here and then, which I turned down bc I figured it wasn’t genuine. 

I’ve never dealt with this kind of drama/cliquey-ness from people before... being at work now makes me feel on edge and isolated.
Has anyone dealt with this kind of situation before?",24May2020,1

I first I tried asking her in person but she wouldn’t answer me, she sometimes would seem like she wants me to ask her but when I tried she avoided me.

So I know millions of teens have thought about this before. I've always wanted to go to a boarding school in El Salvador (the country my parents are from), and a bit ago I started watching Rebelde. Now I want nothing more than to go to a boarding school! The boarding schools in America have always seemed cool to me, but I'm not rich enough to go and besides that there's a given amount of snooty, rich white girls, you know? And I'm not sure but I think boarding schools in Latin America are very expensive, and I don't know if academic credits from other countries count in the US when you want to apply to American university scholarships. I really don't plan on living or working in the US when I'm an adult, but American degrees go a long way in other countries. I don't know what I'm gonna do! It's my dream, dream, dream and I know it's ridiculous but I can't help it!

Maybe in Mexico I'd do better but I don't have any family there. All of this just makes me want to be rich, haha!

**Tl;Dr: I'm going into ninth grade and (when the whole Covid thing is over, of course) I dream of going to a boarding school in Latin America. I want to get to know my culture and the curriculum is better than the local. However, I'm not rich and I don't know if I can get scholarships to American colleges if I graduate from a foreign school. What do I do?**

**Spanish**

Ok, ya se que segura ay millones de chavas y chavos que an pensado esto. Siempre e querido ir a la escuela en El Salvador (el país de mis papas), y hace un ratito empecé a ver Rebelde. Ahora quiero nada mas que ir a un internado! Las ""boarding schools"" in America siempre como se miran bien chidos para mi, pero no soy rica y los internados aquí en el EUA son para las fresas blanquitas, sabes? Y no estoy segura pero creo que los internados en Latín América si son bien caros. También no se si los créditos académicos de otros países cuentan en el EUA para cuando quieres conseguir becados para universidades americanas. De verdad no pienso vivir y trabajar en América, pero es muy común que un degree de una universidad americana si vale para mucho en otros países. No se que voy a hacer! Es mi sueño sueño sueño, y se que es ridículo pero ayyy no lo puedo resistir! 

Talvez en México me iría mejor, pero no tengo familia allí. Todo esto solo me hace querer ser rica, jajaja!

401,"I used to care about how i look alot in middle school (i'm in highschool now) that i would spend a long time getting ready, putting makeup, spending half of my money on beauty and style related items which accelerated to me developing an eating disorder, this was mainly because i wanted male attention and also cause i was massively deprived of self love.  I've gone through alot of transformations which made me realize my worth and love myself which is great, i also recovered from my eating disorder.

One problem is that i don't spend any time on taking care of my appearance anymore. Like zero time, i forget to brush my teeth and wash my face to the point where i didn't wash my face for like 3 days and i didn't really care, before quarantine i'd only do these things before i went out with my friends. I know the ""do it for yourself"" thing but even with that, i eat good food, i read good books, i take care of and treat myself well, that being said doing my hair or getting new clothes or wearing makeup doesn't really matter to me, like they aren't necessary...i really don't have any motivation to do anything like that. I feel like that's just wrong cause looks ARE important in society, that being said i used to really care about people's opinions now it doesn't even cross my mind, i feel like i don't even care to be seen or accepted by anyone because i accept myself.

When I'm in a tight situation, I always never lose my composure, however, when he is there my walls tend to break and I tell him everything. Even cry if necessary.

The problem with him is that, even though we bicker alot there are times where he gets a little overboard with the insults. He makes fun about my intelligence and my appearance, which I'm really insecure about. I also would do anything for him if he asks, but he won't do the same for me.

It's kind of difficult to start conversations with him unless I have something to bring up, but because we're quarantined there isn't a lot of conversation starters besides ""How was work"" or ""I finished the show you recommended.""

I had pretty low hopes for a while, and was assuming he didn't like me because he never texts me first, but then we were talking about friends and such. And he asked me how many people I normally talk to or text on a daily basis in quarantine (excluding group-chats). I said like 9-10, which was honest. I asked him how many people he's been talking to, guessing it would be around 4-5 people.

He said 1.

Apparently I'm the only person that he's responded to for all of quarantine (like 2 months) aside from a group chat with his 2-3 really close guy friends. I know for a fact that some of my other friends have reached out to him, but they've been left on read.

I feel like I might be annoying him by messaging too often, but I think he might just close himself off from people entirely if I don't reach out first.

Should I keep texting him first or should I give him space and wait for him to reach out??",24May2020,1
409,"TW: Sexual Assault


When I was 16,I started seeing this guy that I went to school with who was a year older than me. I knew of him well,and was even recommend to date him by a mutual teacher who was close to both of us,whose opinion I trusted. He was your typical high school perv,who told me within a few minutes of us texting that he liked to fool around and wanted a blowjob lol. It flamed out very quickly. I was really inexperienced and naive,and wasn’t interested. He went on to go to college and eventually get engaged to a really nice girl while he was there. 

Flash forward to a few years later, and it became huge news in my small town that he had sexually assaulted two twelve year old girls,who he had solicited online. It really freaked me out. I’m a SA victim myself,and it very much disturbed me that someone who I was around often had the capability of doing that. He hung around a lot of people that I knew and trusted. I feel like an absolute fool for saying that someone I dated back when I was 16(I’m 21 now) has made me paranoid about my relationships now,but it has. I feel really shaken up by it. I’m always afraid that someone I’m dating could have secretly done the same thing, or has the urges to do it. I feel even more ashamed to admit that this incident has made me very wary and almost “triggered” by anyone who shares similar physical characteristics as him. He didn’t violate me,so I feel like I can’t classify this situation as giving me trauma or complex PTSD. (Although I feel like it has most of the time.)

412,"I (19F) am struggling a lot because I eat to make my family happy. I admit, I am definitely a people pleaser, I just want to make people around me happy. My family loves cooking for me because I love delicious food, but I love fruits and vegetables the most. But because my dad and younger brother only eats meat, the family comprises by being more meat based. 

I used to always think I had a weight problem because I overeat. But since I started university, I realized that when I am alone, I don't eat much at all. I lost 5kg in the first semester staying in dorm even when I would regularly eat with friends. I started getting my health on track, exercising, playing sports. But when I moved back home, my sister continued fat shaming me. I know compared to her who is tall and skinny I look fat, but I have a completely different body type, I am way shorter and I guess I am just a curvier girl even though I have a small frame. I do want to lose some weight and I know how I want to do it. The thing is, I don't feel the need to look like the other girls on ig. I am not overweight and I don't hate my body, but hearing her repeat how I would look so much better if I was skinnier, how some acquaintances call me ""the ugly short fat one"" hurts, and I want to make a healthy change. 

I hate working out because I find it boring but I love playing sports with people, it is how I stay active. My sister simply wants a beautiful body she can show off. She puts the stress she gets from seeing girls on social media on me when I dont have a problem with how I look. Not going to lie though, I am starting to feel extremely self conscious and I guess her words are influencing me a lot. I used to look at my body and dance in the mirror or pose for fun but now I can't stand the look of it. She is right that I am young and should keep my body in better shape, but it is so hard to do that when my family guilt trips me to eat. If I say I want to diet and eat cleaner, they tell me ""but I cooked this just for you"" or ""all this food will go to waste"". I know this isn't forcing but I am a people pleaser and I hate to see my family's effort in cooking a good meal for all of us go to waste. In some ways, I feel like I am making up for my siblings. My older sister (22F) barely eats because she is either dieting or is just picky, and she will voice her complaints negatively which affects the whole mood. My younger brother (15) only eats meat so that is like one dish, and he gets mad whenever people force him to stay and eat some more, so that is another bad attitude. Whenever I see my parents upset because of them, I eat some more and chat with then to cheer them up, tell them how delicious the food is. Because of this, they love to cook for me. I do love eating, I mean who doesn't. Even my parent's friends love treating me to delicious food because they say it makes them happy to see me enjoy myself. But now that I want to eat cleaner, eat less, lose some weight, it is impossible because on one hand they feel like no one appreciates their effort but on the other hand I want to look and feel better for my confidence. 

Even though everyone insist that I eat more, they are also the ones calling me fat, telling me to lose weight. I have tried telling my family I want to eat more vegetables because I am trying to go on a calorie deficit but they just cook food for me without me asking and when I tell them no, they look so sad and say the food won't taste as good if I eat it later so I always end up eating it just so they would know I appreciate them caring for me. Because I am not overweight, they don't see that it is actually important to me that I want to lose weight. I may not be obese but I am chubby. I will be 20 soon and I want to look BOMB! I want a glow up!!",24May2020,1
413,"Hi everyone, 

Well, my life has been changing quite a bit recently, I am a man, 19 years old and I would like to know how to get over my past of how to make up for my past, because the life I have today is very different.

So let me explain, I used to be fat and thus lonely, even though I wasn't that fat, I was the fattest of my school, in a country where teenagers are not fat.
It thus led to situation of isolation for years, I still had few friends, that I mostly saw on the internet and in school. But I feel our group of friends was created because we all shared in common to be rejected by the others.
I had never had a relationship, never kissed a girl, never hugged one, barely talked to one before.

About a year ago, I went through a lot of anxiety, because  of school and loneliness I guess. I couldn't eat when I was stressed, this led to loose about 1/4 of my original weight in less than a year. I'm 1.78m and I was 94k at my most and now I weight 70k.

Moreover, before the whole Covid-19 situation, I was doing a semester abroad in Mexico, it was amazing.
There, I felt for the first time that girls were interested in me, I got my first girlfriend, first kiss, first hug, first sex with her, she is 18, almost my age.

I have known her for a month before being rapatriated, and now we are have been 3 months together, thus 2 in long distance. I want to see her again this summer, but I fear this won't be possible if they don't open the borders of Europe, I'm French. Is so, I will only be able to see her again at Christmas for two weeks.

And we'll, there's where I need your advice, she is my first time of everything, but she has started dating guys at 14, she has had 4 boyfriend before me. And I know it shouldn't bother me, but I really wish I had the possibilities she had. 
She tells me I am THE one, that I am way over all the others, that she trusts me way more than all of her ex.
She tells me she loves me, and I love her.
But sometimes all I can think is that she has already loved other guys and that I couldn't love other girls.
Deep inside of me I don't know what is going on, I don't know if I'm jealous, if I'm sad to have had to wait so much time.

I don't know how to get over it.
Thanks for your help",24May2020,1
414,"Over the fall, I(20f) interned at a tech company and became close with a coworker(26m) because of hobbies we shared. He was a mentor and a friend to me. Months later, after some convincing from friends, I'm partially sure he was actually trying to make advances on me. If you don’t believe me, these advances include: offering me special favors such as rides home everyday or helping me with grocery shopping, constantly making crude or sexual jokes or bringing up topics of that nature (I would express disgust, but he kept doing it), constantly glancing over at me, hanging around my desk all day even though he does not sit near me, refusing to go home unless I accepted a ride from him, offering to give me a ride to a store a block away (I told him I would walk, but he wouldn’t have it), having his coworker bail when we went out for a group dinner so we ended up eating alone together, trying to pay for my meal, having the same coworker unexpectedly bringing his girlfriend to a group dinner with the three of us, another male coworker talking to him about me being interested in him because I played video games at his house, hugging me from behind, grabbing my arm, and following me around the workplace despite me telling him these actions were scaring me (I never have seen him initiate intimate contact like that with anyone in the workplace nor have I initiated intimate contact with anyone either, so I don't know why he thought it was okay). During the last week when he started hugging and following me around, I began to feel like my boundaries were being disrespected and created distance. It looked incredibly inappropriate and I was afraid it would damage my professional image. I felt like I had no choice but to be a bit forceful and cold to put professional distance between us (stop joking around with him, avoiding his hugs, telling him to stop hanging around my desk or leave me alone). Again, I'm going to point out that I'm only partially sure because he never said he had feelings for me, but I do not think there's any other explanation for his weird actions. 

Recently, I rejected my return offer because I decided that working there wouldn’t be a good fit. A few days after, at 2 AM in the morning with no other explanation, he sends me a video of the other intern making his goodbye speech and everyone cheering and laughing (this was months after the other intern left too). This is a bit petty on my part, but it made me upset because even though I didn’t want to work there, I missed my old coworkers dearly. He also knows I’m not a big fan of the other intern (the other intern was consistently rude to me for the duration of my internship). I decided to not respond for the time being because I had no idea what to say. A week later, (today) he sends me a response to the email I sent after my internship as if nothing happened, talking about updates at work and apologizing for my manager. It was well-intentioned, but also felt a tad condescending. 

At this point, I don’t know what to do. I don’t understand the video or the email, so if anyone has any ideas, I would really appreciate it. Regardless if he actually liked me or not, the fact that he violated my boundaries and didn't stop even though I expressed discomfort upsets me to the point where I’m considering just ignoring and blocking him. How do I move forward with this situation? Should I just let bygones be bygones and respond amicably so I do not burn a bridge in my professional network, confront him about everything to clear up the air, or just ignore or block him? I'm hesitant about the second option because I'm afraid he'll get angry and there will be professional backlash against me.",24May2020,1

416,"Sometimes I get into discussions with my online friends about a political or a moral topic and it really surprises me when i hear some shitty views/opinions from them about these topics.

Some of them are too childish to even hold a proper discussion.

We agree on other things. We have the same hobbies, we support each other and i liked talking to them. But when they start expressing some ignorant opinions, I don't know how to reply. 

We disagree on a lot of political issues. They're religious while I'm not so much. They're mostly men, so they never understand women's issues no matter how much I explain it to them.

Last night my boyfriend (23) and I (f22) got drunk and had sex, nothing out of the ordinary.

My boyfriend and I laughed it off and tried to stop the body spasms from happening for about a good hour (maybe two?). I eventually fell asleep
Today it has continued to happen at random points of the day. It first started with minimal spasms and then gradually became getting stronger. Either thinking about it triggers it, somebody laughing/gagging triggers it, or sometimes it just randomly happens. At first, I was thinking that the spasms were happening because I was thinking about it and making it happen subconsciously, but right now I don’t really know. When it does happen I've been trying to breathe and distract myself (and it does help for an hour or two). Has anyone else experienced this?

419,"Hello guys, 

So, let me tell you my story. I’m a college student in Europe and I’m 20. I had the chance to get accepted into one of the best uni in the world and My first year there was really cool. I used to be an antisocial back in HS and the fact that I could make so many good friends in this short timespan really helped me mentally.

But now let’s talk about the heart of my issue : women. Growing up I never had an intimate relationship with women, I only started to get affection around the end of high school and the beginning of college so I had to learn a lot in a very tight time frame. My problems began last year : I was in an on and off relationship with a girl from my school and we hadn’t had sex in a few months so one night I hit her up to know if she wanted me to come over. She told me that she was at a party but that I could come when it was over. So I stayed at a friend’s place and I waited. She texted me again around 1am to tell me to come so I borrowed my friend’s bike and I came to the residence where she lived (we lived in the same residence at the time). I knocked on her door she told me to come in, but when I opened the door the room was pitch black. I only saw her figure sitting on her bed. The first thing that I asked was « Are you drunk ? » (I’m black, and I didn’t want no trouble) and she told me no. So we started to have sex. But I noticed an odd smell coming from her and her behaviour was really weird so I stopped bc I noticed that she was really drunk. She asked what I was doing. I said that I was done with her and that I won’t be bothering her anymore. She asked me to stay but I refused. I went back to my friend’s place and I slept there. The next day, she texted me and asked what happened bc she « could not remember anything », so I told her that we had sex, that she lied to me about drinking and that I left bc of that. 

Fast forward to the next semester, some rumours started going around saying that I sexually harassed and attacked multiple girls. Some of my ex-gf confronted me about it but I explained everything and they believed me, I think. But when I came back from winter break, I received a letter from my school saying that the girl from that night said that I raped her. I’m currently in a legal battle with my uni bc they suspended my scolarship.  It is really hard mentally for me bc the school was everything that I dreamt of and I really feel like I’m gonna lose, even though I have tons of evidence to back me up.

The second story came out yesterday. I was talking for about a year to a girl from my home country, and I really liked her. I thought that she liked me too bc she said that she caught feelings for me but we couldn’t see each other again bc the flights are very expensive, I can only go home once a year, during summer. Because of COVID-19, most of my friends went back home but I stayed bc I had an internship. I just finished my internship and I’m going back home in 2 weeks but yesterday one of my best friends called me and told me that he made out with her and that she told him that I made up everything that she told me. 

I’m really starting to lose my mind, I can’t even think straight anymore. Sorry for the long story, I’m looking for you guys advices",24May2020,1
420,"Yesterday I joined our town’s garage sale FB group. Today Dad had joined the group and shared a watch party with a young “Latin beauty” on webcam making kissy faces and saying hi to watchers. He follows people online and posts in groups we join. This is the first time he’s done it to me. Dad’s 60, I’m 40. We are not really close and only talk a few times a year. I made it clear long ago that I did not support this business and I asked him to remove my childhood photos from his website. He shuts down if I try to talk about this now. I hid his posts, but it’s really weird to have him follow you and post this stuff. There’s a lot more creepy stuff, but this one bugs me now. I reported him for rules violation to the one group.

421,"honestly

the last time i was partying and shit...

everything was so fucking amazing

like, literally, everyone starts following me around (and no i wasn't hallucinating or anything). everyone wanted to talk to me, like everyone was flowing perfectly. like, people even were copying me.

i was in control

they were obeying everything i said. like, i dont know, i was literally attracting people, i was the center of everything.

tbh, i dont know if its related to it, but i think my looks help too.

&amp;#x200B;

basically, how can i be like that in everyday life too? like, im suppressing my own potential, to live a better life. 

generally, tbh, i do have a thing with anxiety, tho i could guarantee you that everyone that knows me would say the opposite, only because im loud and obnoxious and bold, but realistically, im sometimes anxious on the inside, like caring what others think, and honestly, i think people can still sense it unconsciously even tho im hiding it well.

basically, i think it literally repulses people. 

basically, how could i just chill out a bit? lmao",24May2020,1

In my text to him I mentioned taking care of my immune system, a book we’re reading together, and that I was excited to talk on the phone soon. 

This was his response:
“I hope you are too! Well you are smart and know how to take care of your immune system! I guess that’s the only thing you can control I suppose!That’s my number one goal is my immune system! 

Omg I do too! Thats funny!That’s exactly what imagine too! It’s the perfect place hahah I keep talking like Abigail to myself now these days lol 

I feel like I have read references to Flagg in other works I have read but maybe quite didn’t put it together! It would have been like a quick off thing and at the time the name would have held no weight so idk, I can’t remember but I wouldn’t be surprised at all!

425,"A little back story. I work at JCPenney and we closed all of our stores down and furloughed all the associates due to the pandemic in March. I have worked for JcP for 10 years as a supervisor since high school and they have screwed me pretty much the whole time. From years of raise freezes to the constant instability. I will be graduating with a degree in a field completely unrelated soon and was planning on only staying until the end of the year anyways. The company has decided to reopen the store that I work at this week. When we were furloughed our CEO stated that we could wait up to 30 days after store reopening to come back if we were uncomfortable. I am making more on unemployment than working my full time supervisor job that I hate. JCPenney has recently filed for bankruptcy and has announced that they will close 30% of their store with no word on which locations. I work in a small store that will probably be on the list for closing. I feel kind of rude, but I kind of want to take advantage of the 30 days and wait to come back. I would hate to have only come back because I felt guilty, and then have the company turn around and either eliminate my position (which happens a lot), close my store, or close the entire company down.

Ive tried talking to my teachers about this but none of them are empathetic at all, and expect me to be ""better"" because im in the extension classes.

429,"I've been with this girl for about 1.5 years now. We met in High school and she's a year below me. Now when I finished school I got a job at a very large corporate company. I worked there for about 6 months and then during the Covid situation I told my girlfriend to join the company too. She was staying at home laying around doing nothing and being depressed. So I thought it was good for her and she always says she needed money but she wasn't allowed to get a job. I encouraged her to join. I gave her the link to where she could apply and everyday I would force her to apply. She was like yesh yeahh il get around to it. And then she did it and got a reply and then a few weeks later she joined the company.

Now it was nice having her work here because I could see her and go home together and stuff. And it also meant she has money for herself so she can pay for anything she needed (the company pay is very good as its corporate). She slowly integrated with the company and has been here for just over a 1 month and 2 weeks. And one day we was just talking and I said do you like the job and stuff and she goes yeahhh she gets to meet people socialise and stuff and its put her in a better place. Then I jokingly said to her ""and you didnt even thank me"". And then she laughed at me saying whatt not you didnt. I did it myself. You didn't really show me how to do it. I said to her ""of course I didnt show u how to do the job because I was working when u was being taught and plus I'm in a different department"". I didnt really think of it that much but then later I thought about what she said and I thought she sounded ungrateful. The next day I said to her you said something that annoyed me yesterday. And I wanted to talk to her about it. 

I told how I felt that you didnt sound appreciative and grateful and then she said but you didn't help me tho. Sure you worked there before me and sure you gave me the link but you didn't give me a tour and stuff. So then I said to her so if you didnt know me your saying you would've joined. And she said ""yeah"". And I was like okay so if I didnt give the link and encouraged you ,you wouldn't not joined. She says ""yeah but I would've done it without u anyway"". I had nothing to say cuz she sounds very deluded. 

I know its petty and but its on my mind how she's just unappreciative and just delusional and its making her off-putting knowing she has a mind set like that. Its just that I want to be appreciated for helping her but she's not acknowledging it.

431,"So I'm seeing this guy(casually sleeping with him but we connect too- I'll call him Jake) who's a traveller and because of quarantine- he's been in lockdown at the same place for a while. He's been really lucky because the guy he's staying with has been so generous and let him stay for free and provides amazing food and wine(he's a food and wine expert) but things are getting weird. He's a naturist which is fine but he always talks about sex and in a way it feels like he's grooming Jake. He's in his 60s and we're in our 20s and he planned a nude body painting night where we all have to wash the paint off each other and every night we all wear sarongs/lava lavas and nothing else after 6pm. He hasn't been pushy but it feels like its a way to pay him back for his generousity. He discussed that he wants to watch porn with Jake and has been encouraging him to come out of his shell sexually and Jake is super innocent and wants to experience more things while hes here which is great but feel like this guy is taking advantage of him. He keeps making comments that I should come join him since the guy Jake is always tired so if I want to be satisfied properly I would which I usually just laugh off. But the other night, we all got drunk and me and Jake had sex on the couch and he was watching us and came and then brought it up with Jake saying that he wants to join us and we both feel like we owe him? I said no but I feel like he's expecting more from us and I'm unsure of what his deal is??

433,"So I've never been much of a fan of alcohol or drugs, but I decided ""fuck it"" and tried drinking for the first time yesterday at a party. But then I kept drinking and drinking until I was (in my opinion) a little tipsy. People were telling me the next day that I was fucked up silly. I don't really agree though because I felt self aware and in control the entire time (And I remember about everything.). I'm pretty confident that I was one of the most sober people there. 

I think I had like 2 Mike's and 6 shots of some different drinks including a Fireball. 2 of them were mixed. I didn't smoke any. I'm skinny, have a little muscle, and am on the shorter side. Somehow, I didn't feel sick or throw up, and I didn't have a hangover the next day. But I am experiencing some things that are bothering me. 

After an entire day of being sober, my hands and toes still have an ever so slight numbness and lack of sensation. Like, I can still feel everything but it just doesn't feel like it normally does. And I have a very faint ache on my middle right back where my kidney is. 

Other than this, I'm usually a very healthy person with no problems whatsoever. I stay active and only drink water. Since the party, I've eaten a bit, drunk a metric tonne of water, and slept a bit. My pee looks the same way that it always does; clear. I know there's a chance that I may be overthinking this like how I overthink everything else in life, but I've just this sense of dread due to the possibility that I made a mistake. 

If I end up having to go to the hospital, this will be pretty bad for me since my parents didn't know that I was drinking. I'll get in trouble, and all of my close friends will get in trouble. All I really know is that I'm not too interested in doing this again with as paranoid as I am about my health.",24May2020,1
435,"So I have met a guy online and we been talking for a month, and every time I bring up the idea for him to text me he would completely avoid that. Until I had bought it up recently again for the third time and I asked him why is it that every time I ask him to communicate with me via my phone rather than on Instagram he avoids my question? He completely lost it. It said that it made him feel uncomfortable for him to give me his phone number and that he would rather stay on Instagram and communicate. But I mean in my head I thought it was no different because you’re already talking to me on Instagram so what difference does it make if you hit me up through my phone number? Like I don’t pay T-Mobile for fun like I would rather have the person to text me/call me instead rather than texting me through Instagram. Like we’re not in high school anymore were adults (we are both 24)....

He told me that it Was a lot and that he was scared. So then I had responded back to him “I don’t know how to take this and I’m sorry that I make you feel uncomfortable enough for you not to give me your number” but he and I will talk on a daily basis and I literally saw nothing wrong for him to completely spazzed out on me and then block me? Has that ever happened to anybody else. Does the idea of giving your number to somebody who you’ve been talking to for a month freak you out or was he just over reacting???

about 2 months ago, we kicked out a roommate who hurt me, and my other roommates and more friends of ours even outside the house. the one she hurt the most was definitely (we're gonna call him Andrew cuz why not.)

I'm gonna shorten so this isn't too long, but she stole underwear from Andrew and our friend outside the house, I don't have all the details but was so creepy to said friend from outside the house they can't even stand being hit on without panicking, gaslit and manipulated Andrew both into having sex with her to make her feel better, and before he was 18 so that when he turned 18 he would send her nudes, did not respect anyone's gender including going on about Andrews ""curves"" even after we told her to knock it off, claimed I was being sexist against her for telling her to calm down when she was throwing a massive tantrum about getting kicked out (like, she literally slammed her fist repeatedly on the ground in the fashion of a gorilla while swinging her hair around and screaming) stole so much of our time and money as well as other things that I just don't want to list out rn. but the issue is that our friend from outside the house just called her out in private, and she went public, saying all the things she did to us, including the rape, and said that we did that all to her. I can deal with it, but I'm worried for Andrew, I can't even say anything and I'm so mad, she took so much from us and I don't want to say she's been able to take my voice to. idk if there is even anything I can do rn, I just, if I can, want some advice, please, and thank you for reading this.",24May2020,1

The previous day my friend had been hospitalized for a suicide attempt and so that day I had been trying not to think about it and have fun because I couldn’t do anything (can’t visit bc corona and hospital policy in general). 

So I don’t know what triggered it but I eventually broke down in the car. I started sobbing and then they started crying too. We didn’t really saying anything, we just hugged while crying. Eventually I got a hold of myself and she did too. They go home that night without saying anything weird.

We were supposed to hangout the next day but she cancels, saying they’re not up for it. I’m fine with that and don’t think much of it.

Then they start ignoring me on social media, and ignoring my text messages (I send them memes and cute animals) so I finally ask them directly “are you ignoring me?” 

Paraphrasing the conversation here but essentially they say that they’re in a lot of emotional pain right now and can’t handle anymore, and me struggling is hurting them so they don’t want to be friends anymore. I’m not sure how to respond so I just say it’s fine bc I don’t want to hurt them anymore by getting mad.

Cut to now, where I’m absolutely miserable. I’m depressed as hell and constantly thinking over our entire friendship. I’m just confused, did I do something wrong? And most importantly, how do I move on? There’s not an option to be friends again so my only choice is to move on, I’m just struggling really hard.

Somehow in the 3 years (Sophomore-Senior) I knew the people at my advanced (and later AP) art table, we became friends. I don't ever know how it happened. We just spent a lot of time together at a table together.

444,"Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to read this and possibly respond. It makes a difference in my life, and I really appreciate it.

Dilemma: I'm almost **twenty-five** years old and still live with my parents. I'm estranged from my father, but close to my mom. My father and I no longer speak to each other. It makes me anxious and on-edge whenever I see him or hear his voice. I want nothing to do with him. I know I would experience so much more freedom, independence, and inner peace if I were to move out, because it would mean that I would never have to interact with him again. (And no, I am not interested in apologizing or repairing the relationship.) I still like (and love) my mom, though. 

The reason I continue to live with my parents is purely financial. Though I am such a shitty, spoiled brat, my parents still cover rent, utilities, and groceries (although, for the record, I do help with chores and treat my mom quite well). I am also saving up to go back to school for a Business degree. Staying with my parents allows me to prioritize saving for my tuition, thereby reducing student loan debt after I graduate.

The thing is, I already have a Bachelor of Science degree and 2+ years of work experience in research and evaluation. The problem is, my earning potential and prospective career advancement is very limited right now. Also, I was recently laid off, suggesting that my qualifications do not provide the job security and stability that I desire.

What do I want? I want to be financially independent, be able to afford my own home, while still being able to afford luxurious items, like travel, good-quality home items, expensive restaurants, clothing, makeup, etc. I want to be able to host dinner parties and entertain groups of friends at my place without having to worry about the cost. If I were to find a job with this degree, I don't see myself living this type of lifestyle 5 or even 10 years from now.

The reality is, I want this financial independence and know that a career in Business (Accounting or IT) will help me to get there. And I know that the financially-savvy move would be to stay with my parents to save up as much as I can to graduate with as little student loan debt as possible.

However, I also wonder how happy I will be studying for another 2 years for this Business degree. Studying is not my forte, and it is not something I enjoy. In fact, when I don't study, I feel guilty and miserable, and when I do study, I have to work through ""the pain"".

As well, I wonder how happy I will be living under my parents' roof, when really, I know that I will be so much happier moving out. 

Considering three options here:

Option A: Move out and still study towards a Business degree.

Pros: Likely happier due to the freedom associated with moving out. Will feel that I am growing in some way because it will force me to be independent. Would feel more confident and sure of myself, and perhaps even receive more respect from my peers and elders, for being more independent as an adult, rather than being a ""child"" and living with my parents. Will remove the emotional stress I currently experience from living with my estranged father.

Cons: Will be broke AF for 2 years because my savings will be diverted towards rent instead of tuition. Would likely feel stressed about finances, as though I am meeting basic needs (major shift from the comfortable lifestyle I live now). Won't be able to afford luxuries like clothing and makeup. Wouldn't be able to invest in developing my hobbies or go out clubbing or to restaurants with friends, depriving myself of activities that add memories, experiences, quality, and joy to my life. Will have tons of student debt afterwards. 

Option B: Move out first and find a job.

Pros: Would be ""getting on with my life"", instead of feeling stuck in the same place. Instead of having to worry about investing in another degree, I would be in a more financially comfortable position to invest in my hobbies and splurge a little. Even if I can't afford to buy my own home in 5 years, at least I could work towards purchasing a condo or apartment that allows me to have friends over. 

Cons: Career options are limited with a BSc. Though my likeliest prospect is a career in research and evaluation, it is not something I want to do for the rest of my life, and I don't see any other suitable careers with a BSc. I also don't see myself earning much in the near future or even 5, 10 years from now, nor do I see much career advancement. As a result, moving out first and finding a job would not allow me to afford the luxurious lifestyle that I want.

Option C: Stay with my parents and pursue the Business degree.

Pros: Minimal financial stress. Less student loan debt. Working towards a degree that will provide a higher earning potential, more career options, and more opportunities for career advancement.

Cons: Won't feel like I'm ""getting on with my life"" - I will feel stuck in the same place because I will still be in university studying and living at my parents' house, while my peers are moving out and moving forward with their careers. I will feel as though I have not grown or changed, and that I am not independent. I will feel emotionally stressed from being around my estranged father, who I don't talk to and resent. I will likely think, more often than not, that I am waiting for my life to start after I graduate (""after I graduate, then I can move out""; ""after I graduate, then I can finally save towards buying a home, achieving X goals such as building up a pottery collection, hosting dinner parties"", ""after I graduate, then I can finally get Invisalign braces or be desirable enough as a long-term partner""). I will therefore feel behind in life, and it will feel as though I am putting the life I want on hold for two years.

I'm not sure how I can be happy. I don't know if my happiness will follow being more independent (""growing"" and moving out), or if happiness precedes it. I try to be grateful every day, and I have also reignited my relationship with God, but somehow I still need help because I feel stuck (and have felt this way for over a year). At this point, I'm not sure whether living with my parents would be more helpful or hurtful.

I rent a room in a shared house with a live in landlord but since Rona hit I've been quarantining with my mum in another part of the UK. I've been lucky enough to be able to work from home this entire time and it looks like I won't be going back to work until August/September at the earliest and even then that would probably only be one day a week and the rest spent working from home. I'm trying to decide if I should give up my room, I'm paying full rent with no reductions despite me not being there, save some money and find somewhere else when everything has calmed down. The company I work for has been very accommodating and told me I can work from home until I find somewhere else to live and my manager advised me to give up my rental as she doesn't think we will be going back to work anytime soon and its a lot of money to spend when im not staying there. My company is also making decisions about cutting its office space; mine won't be cut as its a purpose but building but there could be an option to be a permanent stay at home worker that ive put in a request for.

My dilemma is that if I give my one months notice that would give until July to move out which is fine but my mum has argued that it seems silly to move out for a few months only to have to go back again in September. However if I was only doing one day a week I would just travel into work from my mums for the day and find somewhere to rent when I was in full time. I also hate the live in landlords I have! Mice came in from the attic via the fireplace in my room and they did nothing about it and there's been other issues with the male landlord being a bit creepy.

449,"Mobile format, sorry. 

Because I’m home all time, I’m so damn stressed. My upcoming exams and frustrations from home make it so damn hard to study properly.

Last year, I lived alone and realised just how much of my energy and emotional bandwidth is taken up by my parents and siblings. We have an emotional disconnect and I generally dislike them as well. 

It’s the little stuff; making pancakes for everyone and not even giving them a look, being asked to do groceries when I said I didn’t have the time, the subtle belittlement, the nagging... It adds up. 

Yesterday it came to a head, quite literally. I punched my sister on her head, just because she was feeding into my frustrations. I feel really bad and realise that it were all these pent up frustrations. I’ve tried to tell them how I feel, but they belittle my problems and tell me to just suck it up.  I feel like everything I do is simultaneously too much and too little for them

I was venting to a friend yesterday who offered her studio a couple cities over to study because she lived at home for the time being. I really want to take up her offer, but know my parents will vehemently oppose. 
(I can move freely, ‘rona isn’t as bad anymore where I live)

I need this time off badly, but don’t even know how to approach this conversation. A week will probably clear up my head and is maybe short enough they might allow it. 

I would like some advice on how to to approach the subject, if possible.",24May2020,1
450,Recently got a very disturbing reply to a comment on another thread. If the community contains people this disturbing I'd prefer to just not be here at all. Thoughts?,24May2020,1
451,"I have had a tough upbrining. My first relationship i ever had ended because my parents said one day you will never see this boy ever again, and that was that. My mother is aggressive, angry and when I was younger would verbally, mentally and physically abuse me. Since growing up, the physical abuse has stopped but the mental and verbal stuff is still on going.
As a child I used to lie all the time, compulsively. It got my parents in trouble when one of my lies sounded bad and a parent intervened and called social services. They found nothing was wrong and it was all fine. My mother after that became a recluse and could not trust her friends at my school as one of them had made that call. I blame myself to this day even though i was 7 at the time. 
I have had anxiety and depression because of that incident from year 2 (in the UK). Since then i know i have been craving affection and love from partners and went from relationship to relationship which always ended badly. Some of them were also abusive and those that weren't i seemed to find boring.
I went to university and it seemed to get better for myself after a bad breakup left me single for my final year which was the longest i had been single since i was 16. Anyway long story short, 3 years later i had a great boyfriend but i found ways to make myself unhappy by thinking i wasn't happy with him etc, when i ended things i realised i was manifesting my own insecurities and disgusts of myself onto him. He did nothing wrong, he supported me through everything bad that had happened and yet it still wasn't good enough for me... Or so i thought.
This time when this relationship ended i realised he did not do anything wrong, he was great and yeah sadly i did love him. Instead i just feel more comfortable being a sad and when i am happy i change it. Recently i find it very hard to look in the mirror at myself which i have been working on. Losing weight and dribking more water and exercising to change the way i look in an attempt to feel like i can look at myself. 
I have had therapists before but obviously things have not worked, we would talk a lot about my mother. I am looking to move out soon, when coronavirus moves on in the UK and i can earn money to get a place.
So what i am asking is, what is wrong with me? Why do i find it so hard to be happy and what can i do to stop this damaging behaviour?",24May2020,1
452,"Ok so this is a relative that my mom said I should talk to again. We had previously texted 2 years ago and then I deleted my social media but then we started to text each other again.

When we started talking she was saying that I shouldn’t disappear again and was overall acting very happy because we started texting again. Now this is when things got awkward.

We were talking and she was saying that me and my family should visit her family. But then after that she asked me a question that made me really uncomfortable. 

I don’t have many friends and it has always been an insecurity of mine. She asked me how many friends I have and then I said I have a few but not many, and then she said she has a lot which I guess kind of made me compare my social life. 

I didn’t say the number of my friends but then she insisted on asking exactly how many friends I had to which I said 2, even though I really didn’t want to say much about it. 

After this conversation, we pretty much ended up ghosting each other and there has been an awkward silence. Usually she texts me 5 times just to talk about random things and now it has been 5 days. I don’t know if she is judging me on the number of friends I have because I can’t really tell.

It was just an uncomfortable question for me to answer and I was wondering why someone would even keep asking about this, especially if you say you don’t have many friends in the first place?",24May2020,1

455,"Im a software engineer student. We have 4 projects (lets call them A,B,C, and D to avoid confusion)  to do. 1 due in one week, the other 3 in ~two weeks. The same 2 friends are my group members in all of them. Even though we are close friends, we have been arguing alot and it's ruining out friendship; there has been lacking communication, mostly from my part I admit it.

We were working on 2 projects (A and B) at the moment. I was working on one (A) while they were working on the other one (B). Fast forward a couple of days, the project I'm working on is nearly done and they tell me they want to change something on the project I was working on which would basically mean we would have to do everything over again. I argue that this change would only take us time that we don't have for a benefit that probably wouldn't be that high. Still they didn't care and started doing it anyway. Obviously I wasn't happy about this.

I feel like my opinion on this group is always put away, most of the time they only criticize me and even though they might be right on some aspects I believe that they aren't perfect either. All of this has been giving me extreme anxiety.

Which lead me to think it is the best decision to leave the group for these two projects.

Now let's say I would do that. We still have 2 other projects (C and D) to do and I need their help on those but I don't know what their reaction would be if I tell them I don't want to work with them anymore on projects A and B.

457,"I feel so damn selfish for even typing this right now and I apologise for the dramatic title. I just finished typing all this and it turned out way longer than I expected so...

TL:DR - 28 yr old male, unemployed, suffer from depression and anxiety, overweight, don't feel like doing anything anymore and would rather just go away.

I guess I'll start with a little bit about myself. I'm currently 28 yrs old and live in Texas, a lot of my family along with myself have a bad history with mental health. I'm unemployed and get SSI, I've never officially had a job but have worked in construction before with some family members in the past. I have very bad anxiety and depression. I dropped out of high school in the 11th grade.

Where I'm at right now, I live with a sibling and their family. They treat me well and I help out around the house whenever I can, small things here and there. I've always had this stupid thing where I tend to just zone out and lose all concentration when around people, it's not as bad with my family but it's dreadful around other people. I've always felt this way but it amped up around high school and hasn't really changed for the better since. 

Pretty much for the past decade I've been jumping from house to house from my siblings and even parents. Just this past year in late September I was taken into a psychiatric ward. I just wanted to die and was contemplating suicide but my eldest sibling talked to me and convinced me to go seek help. 

I stayed in the ward for just under a week and honestly when I got out I was really optimistic about my future. I was put on some meds and even though I felt like they weren't doing anything, I had this new found hope that everything was going to work out.

A few weeks after I left the ward my siblings and I got some very bad news from our stepfather about our mom. She was in the hospital and he wanted us to go and see her. Now at this time my mother and stepfather were pretty estranged from my siblings and I. We live in the city and they live way out in a rural area specifically to get away from ""all the drama"". 

At first I downplayed my mother's condition because even though I hate to admit this but she was a pathological liar when it came to her health. I still don't know what she truly suffered from but she would always tell my siblings and I that she had cancer and she wasn't going to live for long. My siblings still insist that she is cancer free. Anyways it turns out that she had a drug overdose from her medication followed by a stroke and my stepfather didn't find her until god knows how long. 

Since they live way out in the countryside help took some time to get there and she had lost a lot of oxygen to her brain. I realize this is already a lot of text so I'm just gonna start cutting it real short, she was hospitalized for about 2 and a half months and I decided to stay with her overnight for about a whole month. Once I realized her health wasn't improving but deteriorating I just lost it. I had a very bad panic attack in the hospital and from then on I didn't stay overnight anymore. 
I felt so bad as if I had abandoned her and my stepfather.

I quickly fell back into depression. I was already overweight, have been for like the past decade. But I started to binge eat like bad. It's honestly gotten a little better but I stayed with the feeling that I just wish I could have a way to be erased from life without hurting anybody in the process. I don't wanna kill myself, I just want to leave and like just fuck off up north to somewhere in the middle of some woods and just live the rest of my days not feeling anything anymore. That's how I truly feel but I know that I don't want to feel like this. I want to better, I want to feel useful, I want to live, but as soon as I even try my fucking brain turns against me. I'm lost, I don't know what to do anymore. 

Sorry for the wall of text, there's a hell of a lot more that I wanted to put but I'm already hating myself for what I typed",24May2020,1
458,"I hate having panty lines when I’m wearing spandex or tights during PE and other sport so my friend bought me no show underwear  (a thong) while we were going shopping and I didn’t tell my mum. She doesn’t know cause my friend paid for them since my mum checks my card history.

Both my parents are pretty conservative and Mormon and my mum especially thinks it’s gross and weird to wear stuff like that cause it’s “in appropriate” and “disgusting” because we should respect our bodies or something like that.

I am f15 turning 16 later this year and I think I’m old enough to wear them but I’ll get super embarrassed and she will make fun of me for wearing something like and will say something along the lines of

 “who are you showing your Butt to ?”
“Why are you showing off your body ? Ew gross”

She has said similar things to me when I bought a  cute bralette and thinks I only buy this stuff to impress a boy or to be a “hoe”

On the other side my dad will just thinks it’s gross and awkward since he can barely talk about women’s stuff if that makes sense

460,"I am 24 years old with a my first child due in September. I have been in the navy a little under 2 years and have been meritoriously advanced twice already. I am currently an E-5 and from what my superiors tell me I am on my way to a good career in the navy. The thing is having a child on the way has changed my perspective. I don’t know if I can spend 20-30 years in a career that demands so much time away from my family. I have been looking into other options for once my contract is up and I feel very strongly that I should get a degree and pursue a career in naval architecture. My dilemma is I know my personality. I will get these huge ambitions and in the moment they are all I can think about 24 hours a day. They consume me. I’m obsessed with the idea of doing more than I currently am. I am obsessed with these new visions I have of my future doing something I believe I would love to do. Eventually however, every time for whatever reason I never pursue these ambitions and they eventually die and life moves on. I want to change that though. I want more, but the safety of the career I am currently in makes me want to stay. There are so many uncertainties outside of the navy. Will I get accepted into a university with the degree I want? Am I smart enough to achieve such a difficult degree? If I manage to attain it will I still even want that or will the fire burn out once again?

464,"One of my closest friends in this world has just gone through some really tough circumstances so I've been spending every day with her helping her through it. The catch? I accidentally fell in love with her. 


She's left town now to work on herself but before she left I wrote her a letter. It was supposed to come across as encouraging and friendly but frankly I've long since lost any ability to tell where that line is with her so I didn't give it to her worrying that it would just come across desperate, cheesy and frankly like I'm trying a little to hard. 


I've been debating posting it to her since. I'm just wondering how it comes across, would you be pleased to receive a letter like this or is it corny as hell and something that should never see the light of day? Yes, im very socially awkward. Its pretty long so thanks to anyone who takes the time to read it. 


The letter starts here:


Life with you comes in phases. We're either way to close, or way to distant there's no in between. Back and forth, back and forth. Closer and closer, further and further. The rubber band protracts, the rubber band retracts.
I hate it.


Selfish isn't it?
But life can be cloudy, there's rain in the forecast and sometimes it's too dark.
We both know how dangerous travelling the dark empty roads can be.
We aren't kids any more, we grew up and started to see what was beyond the walls of adolescence.
There's rain, there's clouds there's darkness and danger. We're deep in this thing.
Sometimes it's easier to stay behind the walls. 
For years I did that. 
Watched the darkness swallow everyone.
For years I've moved at the speed of a glacier.

Paralysed.


But eventually something happened. 
Something crashed through my walls. 

Someone.


Destroyed. Crumbled. Decimated. Nothing left.


You.


And in that moment the sky blackened.
All except one shining piece of light where you stood. 
Like a ray of sunshine on a rainy day you just stood there with a smile.
You took my hand and offered me a raincoat.
I liked that feeling. But I didn't need it.
When next to you, there was no rain. No clouds. No darkness. 
You took me outside the crumbled walls, showed me the demons and proved they can be conquered. Showed me that sunshine isn't something to find but to create.


You made me feel the way I did back when the wall around my world was to high to see beyond.
How do you do that?
How do you do what no one else can do?
You did for me what I thought impossible with but a wave of a wand.


Why couldn't it stay that way? 
You showed me how to fight the demons.
You showed me how to turn the devil on my shoulder to an angel in the ear.
You grabbed my hand showed me how to light a spark and find some calm in the raging storm.
I know you don't know that you did this. I've never told you so many things. 
I have a habit of leaving things unsaid.
So what happened?
Why didn't you light a spark? Why didn't you fight? Why did you welcome the devil on your shoulder? Why did you listen to what he had to say? Why did you walk into that storm? You were the strong one who lit up the darkness I was just along for the ride. How did i miss it? Its not like you were hiding. You crept out the front door slow and I was too self-absorbed to see. 


I wanted to return the favour. 
I wanted to take your hand, bring you back, and show you there's nothing to fear. 
But how could I? You were already in too deep and I'm certainly no ray of sunshine. How could I show you there's nothing to fear when you listening to those voices and diving into the darkness is exactly what I myself fear? 
How could I pull you from the darkness when it's obviously what you craved?
While I searched for that answer you delved deeper into the darkness and by the time I looked up, you were gone. It was over. All I could do is stay focused on myself. Use what you showed me to add a little sunshine to life and hope for your safety. The once extended rubber band had once again retracted. Snap.


I stayed positive. You gave me some light to hang on to and I did my best with it. There were dark days sure. Sometimes the fire went out. Sometimes I thought of throwing caution to the wind and following you into that storm. But I stuck with it. I didn't need the walls anymore. Meanwhile, you were losing pieces of yourself in that whirlwind. And I just sat helplessly as the world stole the last of your innocence. 


Maybe I didn't make it as far as I thought. Maybe I just traded the walls for the stationary warmth you introduced me to. Maybe I'm still a little lost. Every time I saw you, you were deeper in that darkness and I was powerless to pull you out of it. What happened to that ray of sunshine? 


I saw a glimpse of it again one day. It was dim. Almost gone. Completely overshadowed by the weight of the world on your shoulders. But still there. I was up until sunrise that night. Guilt. Anger. Sympathy. Love. Worry. Rage. All I wanted was to find everyone that hurt you and do far worse to them. I did nothing to stop you walking into that darkness and you came back with the most vicious of demons gnawing at your neck.


I wrestled with this all week. Part of me wanted to come to you and help you fight this. Do you know that I'd happily burden this weight instead of you? All I've ever wanted to do is protect you from these things. I've never told you the ways you've helped me but know it's the least I could do. 
But the other part of me? Not sure, frankly I pondered if it would be welcome. See, I've never really understood where I stand with you. You spend a lot of time saying one thing and doing another. There's times where I feel like I know no one better than you, and times where you're a stranger. I could be someone you genuinely care about or someone you just put in the minimum with to be polite. Maybe that's the product of your demons sending you all directions. Or maybe that's my own demons talking in my ear.


I chose to call. I'm glad I did. I could tell you needed someone. You thanked me but it wasn't necessary. I wouldn't have left your side if I had a say in the matter. 


The next few times we saw each other were incredible. Slowly but surely I was seeing that sunshine come back. It even seemed to become brighter than it has in a long time. I got wrapped up in it again. No rain. No clouds. No darkness. Life became better than it had in a long time and I felt invincible. Like i could follow you to the ends of the earth on any adventure. It felt good to try and pull you out of the darkness. I'd like to think I helped but maybe you were still just helping me. I know it was all partly due to the limited options of safe people you were able to be around but I don't care, I had fun. I hope things can be the same when you come back but I know you, capturing your attention in a normal lifestyle is like trying to trap a tornado with a butterfly net. But I hope that won't be the case. 


If you ever have doubts in yourself or the value you add to a situation, know that there's never been a time in my life where I've had anything but excitement to see or talk to you. I think that's the real reason I don't want you to go. Afterall, I know you'll be back. I know we'll always be a part of each other's lives. You're stuck with me sucker. So why is this so hard? This time, we crossed paths in a time where we both had an overabundance of free time.


We've known each other most of our life and despite most of that relationship occurring after we finished school I don't think we've ever actually spent more than a few hours together when not at school until these recent weeks, now we're regularly spending the entire day together. I don't want that to end. But it's inevitable, real life will come back. I just hope you know that this time with you has been more fun for me than you could imagine. I tend to get too wrapped up in the fun to take the time to say the little things and tell you all the things I should tell you.


Maybe it was a little too much fun. It almost felt like we were a couple for a bit there didn't it? I know I certainly got a lot of messages asking. As I sit here feeling nothing but dread at the thought of you leaving I can't help but think maybe I let that line get a little too blurry for someone in your position. I'd like to think I'm better than that considering everything you've been through but it wouldn't be the first time I've been in denial about feelings. Maybe it's a good thing I won't be seeing you anymore afterall.


It's going to get light soon. I'll be seeing you today for the last time in a long time. If I seem okay then my job will be done, because I'm not. I'm going to put on a fake smile, make stupid jokes and try be supportive even though staying up so late making this is going to leave me tired as hell, but fact is I'm really going to miss you. I don't even know if I should give you this letter, I know leaving is already going to be hard there's no reason to make it worse. But I hope you get the chance to read it.


I'd like to end this letter on a positive note. But what can I say? I've already said all the encouraging things I can say. You know how much I believe in you. You know how much I care for you. You know you've got this. You know I'm proud of you. There's nothing left to say that hasn't already been said. I guess I'm just not coping well with the fact you're leaving. Once again that rubber band has been extended further than it ever has before and I know the sting of its retract is coming for me worse than ever. I know I should be okay with this. You may be heading out into the darkness again but there's a light on the other side and I'm beyond proud of you for reaching for it. For the first time in a long time you're moving in the right direction and you'll come back a better person for it. I wouldn't change that. I just wish that I could be there as you reach new heights ready to catch you if you fall, even though I know you'll make it. But I guess really I just don't want to be alone in the darkness again wondering if you're okay. Nothing more than selfishness I guess. 


But you know what? I'm not afraid of the darkness anymore. I know that it can only do as much damage as you let it, I know that thanks to you. So before you go let me make you a promise: this will be the last time I watch you walk into the darkness. There will be hard times, life will always have it's ups and downs. But if those downs ever lead you into the darkness again you can bet your sweet ass I'll follow you in there and rip you back out whether you like it or not.",24May2020,1

466,Little back story. I have been a bright student for most of childhood up until grade 10( sophomore). Then I changed my educational board and moved away from my parents to get a better education so that I would be able to perform better in my college entrance exam( JEE) but life got a bit too hard because of family problems and loneliness and struggles of being on your own( not financially). Now I have very average score of 80% in high school and had to take a one year gap to figure out my life. I still look forward to somehow transfer to a good university ( MIT OR HARVARD) but it looks impossible with my track record.

467,Ok so me n my ex r close friends. She’s been their a lot for me this year and I can’t thank her enough. I was v toxic to her wen I fell in to depression and I regret it a lot. She’s going through a bit of a rut she’s not sad just a bit stressful of a situation. Now it had been a few days we hadn’t messaged since she updated me on her situation. Then she attacked me for not checking up on her like I should of. Wen it had been 3 days. We calmed down she apologized for overreacting and ask if she was ok she said she’s fine. Another 3 days go by and I msg her ask her how she is nice catch up and I explain I’m going on a few dates and she then goes on and tells me “oh is that why u haven’t contacted me😂” so I said it’s only been 3 days so then she guilt trip me how it’s a one sided relationship and how I didn’t prioritize her like she’d prioritize me. Keep in mind I have been supportive all she asks is that I had shot a quick msg but it had only been 3 day gap each time we spoke? Am I being too self centered ab this am I wrong?,24May2020,1
468,"up until October, i (13f) lived an ideal suburban middle-class life of luxury and freedom, and now due to some things my brother did i live in squalor, i can barely afford food, and i use dollar store hair products and makeup and hold onto the things i kept from my old life to try and convince myself that i’m still middle class. i hate my life so much, and i cry every single day. like i’m wondering what i did to deserve this hell but that is besides the point. i don’t have any friends, so i’m looking to reddit for advice on how i can cope with this. i keep telling myself it will get better eventually, but i was so happy before and now thinking of everything i’ve lost hurts so bad. 

does anyone know how i can deal with the pain? it literally feels like i got a taste of heaven, but it was ripped away from me and everytime i feel like i’m doing better i think of what i had before",24May2020,1
469,"Hello! 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently found out that I have incredibly high expectations for myself and possibly others. However, most of the time, I don't even reach these expectations which often leads to me being sad or hopeless. It's a constant cycle and i'm sick of it as it's affecting my relationships, my hobbies and my work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a feeling that my high expectations stem from my mom always talking about how much more smarter my friends were than me back when I was in elementary school.",24May2020,1
470,"There was someone in my life that I loved. We'll call them J. They were not what they said they were or what I thought they were. We had this incredible, intense friendship. I'd never known anyone like them and I adored them, at first as a friend. But I fell for them, hard. I didn't tell them because I thought they were my friend and didn't want to ruin it. When I finally did, they said they didn't feel the same way. Of course I accepted that. I loved them, after all, and would never have wanted them to feel guilty or pressured. 

But it all unraveled then. See, they hadn't been my friend and once things began to unravel, I started to see all their manipulative behavior and it was staggering. They used some classic tricks that I should have seen because they've been used on me before. 

I'm naive and trusting by nature and I was desperately lonely. I thought I had a friend who finally saw me, but I had actually found someone with a sick kink and an agenda who manipulated me from the start. They were 12 years younger than me. I'm 38. Both adults, nothing wrong there. But there was, and I'll come back to that. They told me their history of complicated relationships with older guys and my heart broke for them. Clearly, they'd been the victim. I thought. 

They had flirted with me, hard, for most of the friendship. I didn't realize that, at the time. I didn't register it as flirting, but I clearly was supposed to, based on what became apparent later. My friends had to inform me they were flirting because I am dense. 

However, they denied feelings despite all the flirting, the emotional intensity, which they explained away a different way every time it came up as we were trying to reconcile after things starting to unravel. I didn't expect anything from them and never actually believed my friends that J. was interested in me, so I wanted to believe them. I wanted to believe everything they told me. But, they lied, insulted me, gaslighted me, manipulated me, ran hot and cold emotionally, talked me like a lover and called me a friend. So I had to walk away. It killed me to do it, because I had promised not to and I didn't want to abandon them. But I had to.

I don't know what happened. I suspect I was a game that wasn't working for them, which I'm sure was different than the other older guys in their pattern. It probably worked on them. I think they picked me out for that but I was so oblivious that it didn't work, and then perhaps they got slightly attached or just wanted to keep the game running. The entire relationship lasted 8 months, with the last two being an utter hell of me trying to leave and trying to stay. I finally sent an email saying I was done and laying bare all the manipulative things they'd done that I couldn't ignore anymore. I left the door cracked, though, till a bit later the same day.

I found something, under their username on a writing site that I hadn't known about. I had meant to look at the one I knew about. I had never snooped on them prior, because that's not what friends do. I know, next time, be nosy and find these things early. I'll keep that in mind. I found something disgusting that I can't look past and it all clicked into place. Their troubled history with older guys. The way they acted with me. The kink they mentioned a few times but never explained beyond it ""being bad"". They write adult-themed fic about teens and adults, it turns out. And given the other facts, they must want older guys to play into their fantasies about that. That's appalling, it's disgusting, it's unforgivable. Even if they aren't interested in teens themself, them writing that encourages those who are.

When I saw that, I lost it. I just fell apart. This triggers old trauma for me, in addition to it just being perverse. I blocked them immediately on everything, shredded and threw away the things they'd given me. Purged it all. I do not deal with monsters. I have known monsters before and I have no tolerance for them.

The problem is that even though I do not love them now, I still miss who I thought they were. I thought they were incredible and I loved them. I've been utterly devasted since things unraveled back in March. I felt like my heart had been torn out and it just never stopped hurting. It different now, that I know what they are. But I miss who I thought they were and the friendship I thought was there. It was all a game based on them being a lost, broken, hurt, sick thing. How do I mourn something so tainted? I can't cherish it. I can't keep it alive in my heart like you would a dead loved one. I don't want them anywhere near me, let alone in my heart.",24May2020,1
471,"Sorry guys this one is going to be long but I really could use some help, throwaway for obvious reasons. 

My (34M) cousin (31M) and I were brought up together with my mum and her brother living on the same street so we have more of a brother type deal then cousins. So basically a few years ago like 2 maybe he was asking me for money lots which isn’t unusual because of how close we are we’ve always helped eachother out wear we can, but it started happening like a couple times a week. I started wondering wear his money was going because he was working etc, it wasn’t earning a lot so I figured he was just shit at budgeting and helped him where I could. 

About two months went by and we were heading out dirtbiking and I went to grab his helmet from his room for him and he had left his computer open on his emails and there was just a shit load of them from an online casino thanking him for the deposits he made, sometimes it was $100 a day and other times just $15 to $25 but more than once a day for the smaller ones. I waited until we’d gotten out and had a ride and then confronted him about it, he tried to deny it at first and then fessed up and told me he would stop gambling. 

Fast forward to today, for the past few months he has been asking for money more than usual again, he asks me sometimes more than once a day for money, yesterday I lent him $30 in the morning and by the afternoon he asked me for another $25 and he says it’s for important stuff like food he forgot to pick up or his truck needs something checked and his payment hasn’t gone in (he is getting payments from the government at the moment for an injury he got on the job last year that’s still healing) he now has a 1 year old son who he is an absolutely fantastic father too, his missus is great and she makes bank at the job she’s in, they got pregnant pretty quickly but are really good together. Thing is, today I was over his watching his son while him and the missus went out shopping for his sons birthday (he officially turns one next weekend) and I forgot my computer so asked to borrow his to do an online induction for work, which requires email, he said yes so I went to load the page and his was still logged in and there were dozens and dozens and dozens of emails from another online casino thanking him for his deposits again. 

I am crushed guys, seriously crushed. It looks like it’s gotten worse. Sometimes it’s $200 a day sometimes even more and multiple times a day he’s putting into this stuff and it looks like he’s also withdrawing money too but I don’t think it’s more than he’s putting in, sometimes it’s smaller amounts but the smaller ones are usually deposited 5/6 times a day, but I know there’s always a catch with gambling,  I know that for whatever you win you would have to spend twice that much so I know that some weeks when he’s not winning he’s spending hundreds of dollars which should be put into his family. He’s usually such a great guy, Im really worried about him. Its eating me up inside seriously, I can feel the weight of it. I want to bring it up with him but he got really angry the last time I did and when I brought up going to therapy or an addicts meeting or something he just flat out refused. I don’t think even he realises how bad this is, I don’t think he would see it or admit it as an addiction or that he has a problem. But I know I’ve got to do something before it spirals further. 

I have decided to cut him off from giving him any more money, I don’t want to be helping him go further down the rabbit hole. I have really strong suspicions that his missus doesn’t know he is gambling or if she does doesn’t know he’s spending this much money. She’s not perfect with cash but she’s really practical and generally level headed with that stuff, I can’t see her green lighting all of the money that’s going in. 

My question for you guys is, what do I do with this info? I want to do this the best way possible so he doesn’t shut down on me. Should I sit down with his parents and tell them so we can all talk to him, should I sit down with him by myself and just have a chat man to man about it? Should I sit down with his missus and tell her so we can figure out what’s the best way to get him help? Either way I’m screwed because either way he’s going to hate me for trying to talk to him about it and for looking at his emails. I don’t want to lose my bro but I also can’t just sit on this and do nothing when I’m worried it will tear him and his new family apart. He also loves his little boy so much and is such a great dad so no hate on that guys but I do also think this is money he could be putting into savings for stuff for him. What the hell do I do? If anyone has any similar experiences and something worked please let me know. I just love the dude so much.",24May2020,1

Now she really wants to meet me for a date soon and I want to meet her too, but unfortunately I have pink eye and don’t want to spread that around. Our state’s stay at home order isn’t over just yet either. Last night, she was playing a drinking game with a bunch of her friends and I’m assuming got pretty drunk, because after I told her goodnight, she called me asking if I wanted to meet up. I told her I couldn’t because my parents would beat me if I went out that late, especially on a night that I have to be up very early for work. I also didn’t want to meet up with her for the first time while she was drunk. I think I made the right decision, but I have a feeling she might be embarrassed and not want to talk to me anymore.

475,"My brother in law is getting married. The venue is less than 20 miles from where they live so it's not like its abroad. 

If guests want to attend they are expected to pay their portion of the wedding costs. They've rented an entire place, made for 3 or 4 weddings, just for them. As you can imagine, all in, the wedding isnt a cheap wedding. 

My husbands family are a standard middle class family. Father in law has always paid for everything for them all. They've never had to go without anything. Both brothers and sister in law have a habit of wanting things they cant afford then expecting FIL to bail them out. 

Anyway, I digress. They have become upset at guests questioning why they have to pay and some have even refused the invite, infuriating them further. 

Husband and I refused to pay, so have other family members but of course FIL told us we were rude and they were ""entitled to receive money to pay for the things they want"" to quote. 

Quite frankly, we (hubby and i) dont want to go. There are other family members that dont want to go.

I will often stay up very late, when I do start to fall asleep I begin to feel like my brain is being electrocuted.y body goes completely numb and I often feel like I have to force myself to breathe. This will last for a few seconds and I’ll snap out of it and feel completely fine.

485,"My best friend started gaining weight a few years ago, then she started dieting on her own. I remember that she was kind of insecure and people close to her like her family, told her to lose weight. I personally never see it when someone around me gains weight so throughout the whole gaining weight process she looked the same to me. But she was planning every meal and she would eat very little, she was sticking to her old diet plan that she got from a dietitian years ago and that was concerning to me. She then started losing weight super quickly, I didn’t see her for a couple of months, only video calls and stuff but when we met she looked half the size and that’s when I realized how much she changed. She told me that she wants to hit this goal weight that is super low for her build and I didn’t know what to tell her. Even though I don’t have the perfect body or anything, I never disliked my body to the point where I’d restrict my eating or hit a weight goal. I love my body and everything it does for me so I can never get in the mindset of someone who does these kind of things. Anyway, this kept going for a while and every time she hit a weight goal, she lowered the goal. I talked to her last week and she is now super underweight, obviously not healthy so she is seeing a professional for regular check ups etc. She is not trying to lose weight anymore, thankfully, but I still don’t know how to approach her or what to say when this comes up. I really don’t want to say anything wrong because she’s had her fair share of people talking down to her saying pretty hurtful things. I just want to be supportive and I want her to feel safe when she is talking to me about it because I know how sensitive of a topic it can be for most people even if they don’t show it. I constantly feel like whatever I do or say makes her feel like I’m secretly trying to help or make her feel better or something when I want to be a good friend first. I also don’t love her more or less just because she lost weight and I know that many people get that feedback without even realizing and I certainly don’t want to give that message. But I also don’t want to sound careless because she actually put so much effort in it and it would be rude to completely ignore it.

That's why it bothers me, because now I've become the one who's started flaking on people. I  don't do it all  the time, and most of the times, it's not even intentional. But I do. If a friend calls me to catch  up, and I'm busy I tell them that I'll make time for them later. But then I forget. Sometimes, I'm in the midst of work and a friend will call and I'll pick up just to tell  them I'll call once I'm done, but then I end up not doing that.  I keep forgetting about my commitment to people, and then they think I've flaked on them. Sometimes, it's not so important. But other times, it is.

497,"Ever since we became friends in seventh grade, my life has been in a constant state of “Not today, please,” and I think I deserve a break. 

So, since I’m not the only one affected by her bullshit, we’ve all come to the conclusion that it’s because she’s a lot younger than her extremely successful sister and developed some issues from that.

Now usually, *just* being an attention seeker wouldn’t be that bad, but it’s a new mental illness every six months and she annoys everyone else in our friend group. 

Last time it was Schizophrenia, the time before that she was a fucking pyromaniac, depressed and currently she’s stuck on being trans (mtf, I’m using her preferred pronouns) which I was skeptical at first about, but it’s been a whole year and she seems to think that’s right. 

Something I’ve considered is that before she figured out she’s trans, she was just lost and felt terrible, unable to place this alien feeling, which is 100% valid, but her she’s bringing back her depression phase, which scarred me and almost pushed me to suicide myself. But of course she doesn’t notice any of the chaos that follows her path.

And it’s not only mental illnesses. In the friend group, she has a fantastic relationship with the guy I like (that’s important I promise) and they make discord calls really strange because we can’t talk over them, but they go into another dimension about music theory and forget about everyone on call. We’ve noticed she likes talking about things no one else understands.

But she hangs onto jokes she makes for too long, which is fuelled by my crush laughing at them still, and despite he’s the only one enjoying them, she carries on. She’ll also bring up old things she does and expects it to be as funny as the time she first told it.

Overall, I'd like to help people. How, I don't know. I just took a job quiz and it gave me cosmetologist as the answer, which is just....wrong. Anybody have any ideas on potential careers for me?",24May2020,1
502,"I’m 15F and I’ve been struggling with depression for ages. The situation we’re in where we can’t see anyone outside the family makes me so lonely and sad. My parents think it’s just me being disrespectful when I get upset about every little thing. I know it’s disrespectful but apart from that it’s also very frustrating for me. I don’t want to get angry! I just can’t express myself in any other ways! When I tried telling them I’m upset because I’m lonely, they said I’m overreacting and stuff. They never talk to me about how I’m coping with depression. They literally haven’t asked me specifically ever (at least not since I tried to kill myself when I was 12). 

They expect me to be coping well with everything like online classes and upcoming school pressures. I’m not though! And I can’t tell them openly. I can’t even tell my GP because my dad is my GP! (Before anyone says anything, yes that’s completely legal.) 

My parents want me to study science and I prefer humanities. I decided I would compromise and now they think my dad should teach me physics since he did it. I was listening to music and he started asking my physics questions. I got irritated and tried to say it nicely. Anyway later on my mum said I really hurt his feelings. I hate myself now. I never wanted to do that, but they just don’t see how much everything is hurting me. 

I was about to sleep and my dad asked if I would help him do something. I got annoyed because I was tired and he said that both me and my brother were unhelpful. This was literally 20 minutes ago. My dad is the nicest person I know, but I wish he could understand how I feel. 

I have a few good friends, 2 of whole I would trust with this information. One of them know and has never spoken to me about it. Her relationship with me kind of deteriorated soon after I told her. The other friend is way more judgemental, but honest. I don’t want my relationship with her to go down too so I don’t really want to tell her. 

I just feel so useless and alone. Why am I like this? Why won’t I get better? Even with antidepressants, why can’t I feel better?

So finally, what I need advice on is how can I change myself so that I’m not such a burden on everyone? How can I feel better without telling anyone?",24May2020,1

504,"Hello,

I am a 24 Asian male living/working in the Bay Area after graduating with a business degree in 2018. In a nutshell, I would describe myself as borderline depressed, lonely, unsociable, and suffering from an inferiority complex.

My home life is currently a little complicated. While I am lucky to be living rent free with my family, I would not say my relationship with them is very constructive. The household current consists of my parents, my older sister, her husband, my aunt, and myself. My parents are your typical Asian parents --- loving, but also controlling.  They keep pushing what they think is best for me (MBA; however I don't believe it's worth the cost as I think it's better to accumulate experience at this point of my career). Currently, I can't even have a conversation with them, because all they do is lecture me. They keep comparing me to my sister who ""listens"" and makes $200,000 a year despite being 30+ and living at home. My sister absolutely loves this and takes every chance to suck up to them and say poor things about me. I've tried voicing my feelings, but they have fallen on deaf ears (traditional Asian households don't believe in depression; they tell me to brush it off and/or blame me for my problems). At this point, I stay in my room and avoid talking to them as much as possible (which I know is not healthy but I don't know what to do).

To make things worse, my social life hasn't been going very well either. In college, I focused on my studies and I didn't make any close friends. I still catch up with my friends from high school, but it's been hard relating to them like I used to. As a result, my social skills have fallen behind that of my peers. I've tried meet new people through meetup.com and bumbleBFF, but finding lonely like-minded people my age has proven to be difficult. It doesn't help that I have terrible self esteem and an inferiority complex. I feel like I'm not fun to be around and very basic; most conversations I have  usually revolve around food, travel, and gym but don't get any further than that. 

As a result, I've become borderline depressed and have no passion in life. I really want to move out, but I don't think it's worth paying the additional 1.5k+ a month to be alone. Honestly, I've grown tired of the Bay Area and want to leave but I just started a new job working as a contractor at Google as an Analyst (I think this is a great experience and want to see where this takes me). My current plan is to suck it up for the next year and see where things go. I'm a bit conflicted with the thought of leaving the Bay Area because of the amount of opportunities here, but I feel like there's nothing left for me to explore and that the high cost of living is not worth it. 

Thank you for reading my rant, I'd love any advice on coping strategies, ways to find inspiration, making friends, or places to move (I'm thinking Sacramento).

TL;DR

I'm a depressed baby living with no direction, any advice is appreciated.",24May2020,1

506,"TLDR: Fiance has made me feel unappreciated and unsupported during wedding planning and that has caused me to rethink getting married.

Background: I've been with my fiance for 5 years, engaged for a year. We were separated for about 6 months a few years back but came back strong. We separated because of his lack of support in pursuit of my career. I gave up pursuit of this career until I could be hired locally as opposed to moving. We got back together because of that sacrifice. He has stood up for me to his parents as his mom is very demanding and always has to have her way. This demeanor has carried on into our wedding planning. More on this later. 

Issue: I have been wedding planning by myself, basically, since engagement. When we started wedding planning I made of list of vendors we needed and asked which he'd like to help with. Out of the list of 10 or so vendors, he chose one: officiant. He only chose officiant because he already knew who he wanted. I asked for his help and he said he was ""good"" with the task he chose. This is about November last year.

Flash forward to March of this year and I am buried in wedding planning. I ended up having a mental break down because I couldnt do it alone anymore. He offered to help and I told him what I needed. That ""help"" lasted about 3 days before he dropped it all. 

Flash forward again to 3 weeks ago and I had another break down. This time with was the added stress of coronavirus and possible postponement. I again asked for help because every single thing I did to plan made me mad, resentful, and spiteful. Nothing makes me happy while planning. I told my fiance that I no longer cared about getting married.

I feel hateful about the wedding because of the lack of help when I needed it, the lack of equivalent contributions and sacrifices made as I did, and the fact I am not appreciated for what I've done. Nothing about our wedding has been what I envisioned because it doesnt meet what he and his parents want for the day. His parents are not paying for it, but that does not stop them (his mother specifically) from expressing her disappointments in my planning choices. From not having his sister as a bridesmaid to my dress choice to the cake flavors. 

I am just so done and over this whole idea of a wedding. Nothing I've done to try to enjoy it again has worked. Since he and I talked about everything during my last melt down, he has helped more but I feel like it's too late. I feel like he's only helping because of the threat of breaking our engagement. 

Advice Needed: Am I overreacting to call off the wedding because of what has happened? Is it foolish to keep moving forward with planning and actually getting married despite my feelings towards the wedding itself? I love and care for my fiance, but I can't keep doing this and facing disappointment, feeling unappreciated, and not having a solid support system. What happens when we get married and the behavior continues despite his word it wont?",24May2020,1

509,"First thing you need to know: My father has repeatedly left me, my mother, and my two brothers over the years. He does drugs, and so does my 19yo brother. 
   My mother no longer does drugs, but she is bipolar. It's really just me and my younger brother who are normal. You see, my mom sleeps around a lot, and she current is married. However, she has a protection  order against him. She moved out and lives with a different guy. So in the old house it was me, my grandmother, and my younger brother. My older brother would stop by occasionally, but hes a thief, so we try not to let him. As I said, both my parents live in different houses, including away from me and my brother. 
    Around 2 weeks ago my older brother came into my room and asked me to leave. He only meant for a few days, so that my moms husband could have a bed to sleep on. He thought I would go to our dads/family house, but instead I called my mother. Anyway, I left with intent to stay gone about 24 hours. 
    After 24 hours of being at my mother's boyfriend's house, my brother didnt contact me. My mom asked If i could come back, and my older brother threw a tantrum. So i decided to stay there for a few more days. Well eventually I need to go get more clothes from my house, and my dad happily drove me over. My whole room has been trashed. Old pop cans knocked over, bowls of food on the floor, and my stuff knocked over. What really got me was my parakeets. Someone had covered the cage with heavy blanket and left it like that for 2 days in a hot dark room. Foods had been over added and their water was non existent. I had left my older brother in charge of them. 
    I collected my birds in a carry cage and took them with me, it was all I grabbed. 
   When I got back I texted my brother about it. To which he cussed me out and told me to like with my wh#re of a mother. He tried pulling the ""manipulating women"" card on me, as that's what he and my moms husband say to women when they start to lose a conversation. 
   I yelled at him back, naturally. 
   He lied to my dad and said I had cussed him out over him leaving his clothes on the floor. 
After this my dad started getting suicidal. He guilt trips me a lot with this one, but I cant say no to him. Well, he actually tried it, but failed. To make matters worse, my brother moved a Crack wh#re into my bedroom. 
     So now I'm stuck. I dont want to start a fight, but my dad threatening to kill himself. As I already said, hes a drug addict, so I really dont want to be near him and his sleazy friends. My moms doing way better, and has a house, but I cant stay with her because my dad will commit suicide if I do.

512,"Upon logging into Facebook a few hours ago, I was immediately greeted with an image of someone having a more fun life than me, which made me feel bad due to the negative upward comparison.

He's an English teacher living out in Saigon, Vietnam, and his post was himself and 2 other friends out on a night out. The caption was ""another great night out in Saigon"".

I've met this guy in person twice (I became friends with him due to a mutual hobby), and he's a nice person, but he seemed as introverted as I am when we met up. He didn't seem like the type of outgoing person who hits the town all the time and has a shit-ton of friends. But that's what I see on Facebook when I log in, whether it's this guy or some other acquaintance.

Quite a few articles, some books, and many people online have said that social media is essentially just a highlights reel of peoples' lives. But it's not like this guy is lying about having a fun life with lots of nights out in an exotic country; the evidence is there in the form of the pictures he posts.

I don't really know what to believe. I don't have the subjective experience to know what it feels like to live that constant party lifestyle; I don't know whether it leads to happiness, but it certainly seems more fulfilling than my life.

The truth is that my life has its problems. It is nothing like what I see online on Facebook in terms of how others live their lives. I've struggled through my 20s with social anxiety, loneliness, not finding my people, having only 1 friend. It seems as if I am an outlier in this regard and that the default mode of existence is having lots of friends, going out all the time, and being happy.

I guess I'm just looking for advice and some outside perspectives, because I keep convincing myself that my life is shit when I compare with what I see on faecbook. Thanks.",24May2020,1
513,"Hey everyone I created a whole account simply to ask this question as I don’t know who else to turn to. I have been searching everywhere I can to find a personal loan ($3,000 exactly) for a large purchase but have no luck finding a place that can approve. I am 18 and have no credit score or history with credit whatsoever. I live with my parents and was furloughed due to the pandemic in March with it potentially reopening in July. I have since picked up a part time job working for an app where I earn roughly $800 per month. I have no other expenses and amidst researching loans I am very comfortable paying $300-$400 monthly. I understand the debt aspect of a loan and am absolutely certain I’d rather pay an extra $500 if that means I get the money soon.

515,"I'm 16F I'm pretty sure I have social anxiety, I'm gonna go to therapy as soon as the quarantine ends, if my mom's gonna keep her promise at least. But that's gonna take a long while and I think I need fast advice to handle it a little bit better till then.

But like social interaction freaks me out a lot. It doesn't help that most people I try to talk to or interact with just never talk to me again. It makes me feel so bad. 

Like I'll try to talk to someone and try to make a joke, they'll just look at my disgusted and go. And then I feel terrified of talking to them again. Every time they look at me it just feels like they hate me

Or like once I had this conversation with this girl and everything was alright and we had fun but then I got passionate about this subject, and I kinda infodumped on her and she literally doesn't talk to me anymore, she'll just,,, turn away and talk with someone else. 

Online interaction doesn't go well either. After I realised that the reason I don't have online friends is that I don't interact with people I started slowly reaching out. 

There was this person who I talked to for like 2 weeks and then they just randomly unfollowed me and didn't respond to my dms even tho the only things we ever talked about was a mutual interest, which was sanders sides (a youtube series) 

Another time I interacted with someone and they reacted *extremely* enthusiastic so I didn't know how to respond and I was really anxious every time we talked. Then they told me they wanted to draw something and asked me to send them a pic of my favourite dress with a model.

I really really like space themed dresses so I sent them a pic of a valentino pre spring 2015 dress with starts and suns on them. It was kinda a see through dress, which I wouldn't wear myself but you know I really think it looks pretty, and I felt nervous sending them that bc they are religious and so am I and I didn't know if my ""taste"" in dresses would make them stop talking to me even tho I took the easiest dress I could find for them because I didn't want to be a burden.

Which they did. They just ignore me now?

And like even with people I know it sucks a lot too.

Whenever I try to talk in a group people talk over me, 

I have this class, where I don't have friends at all. I tried making friends for a year straight and at the end I think it made everyone think I'm annoying and hate me. Even the teacher looks annoyed when it's me.
I sit at the front row at the left and everyone else sits at the right side of the class which causes there to be no place for me there. And the teacher sometimes just turns away completely from me and forgets I'm there. When I try to talk they just ignore me. 

There also is the fact that the people in my class are all conservatives and kinda extremely religious. I don't agree with most of the conversations they have bc I believe religion should be about love and tolerance while they just constantly hate on people. I've given up on trying to give them my opinion as they don't even listen. 

 Even when we're doing online classes the teacher always looks upset when addressing me. Whenever she asks me to read something I'll do it but then she'll start conversing with other students and interrupt me. I'll need to wait till they stop and this has happened multiple times. 

Whenever the teacher's sister wanted to show everyone in the class something and she would walk around to show them I would be ignored and the teacher had to remind her that hey I'm here too. And then they would look annoyed and be like ""Ughh, I'll show her later""

There is this girl in class that always seems to laugh at stuff I say even tho I'm completely serious or when I ask questions and stuff. She once lost her shit when I mispronounced stuff when I had to read stuff in a language I didn't know. She just constantly seems to mock me.

I just feel like I'm so unlikeable that no one even bothers and it's been really making me feel depressed.

We hug , he kidd each others cheeks and I never had any red flags up until now . Problem is , today somethig weird happened . We were joking around and , because my mum can slap people really hard we always joked that since I'm her daughter I could probably slap somebody really hard. So my uncle took me aside to another room and jokingly said

"" come on I wanna see how hard you can hit "" 

and I have him a few joking slaps but then he got serious and told he that he actually wanted to see me slap him hard so , I did. I felt a bit uncomfortable and then he hugged me really tightly and told me 

"" I love you.  I wanna hug you so hard but then you'll probably pop and then I wont be able to kiss you again "" 

That London of made me uncomfortable but I never really showed it. I got back into another room and after a bit he came and we talked more and then kissed the lower part of my neck and my cheeks and then left. 

Even worse, when he left he said "" now, no word to anybody okay OP ? "" and that just made me freeze. What ? Why would he say that ??? I smiled and said 

"" pfff of course not ! ""

I dont want to tell anyone because people might think that I'm not telling the truth or that I'm overreacting and that my uncle was just making light hearted jokes. I dont know.

My friend is getting incredibly jealous and even angry towards the new girlfriend for being included like that, but can’t tell me why. She can’t even understand why she’s feeling that way, because the family also make a lot of effort with her so it’s not like she’s left out.

But she said inside she feels like a burning pit of rage, and that she feels like she wants to bad mouth the new girl to get people to dislike her.

Out of curiosity, I walked over to the box, opened the top to take a peak. And saw some green little pieces,(weed), a lighter, and a small glass thing. I closed the box quickly and got out. My heart started beating really fast for some reason. I left everything as it was, 2 minutes later when I was pacing around the room downstairs, I decided to go down and look again just to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating or something. Still there. Found him in the Laundry room all the way upstairs after that. Did some research later and figured out that is a “hand pipe” and my initial thought was medical marijuana. But came to conclusion that they look different. I don’t know what feeling I have. Shocked definitely, Ive always hated the idea of drugs and smoking, especially when it is illegal. I also don’t know much about weed keep in mind. If anything doesn’t add up let me know in the replies. Should I stay quiet or do something?",24May2020,1

530,"ANON POST; 
So basically I am a straight woman and have never had any feelings of being otherwise.
A new woman has started at my work (she is 30 and I am 22) who is a lesbian and has a wife. 

We have become fairly close and if I’m being completely honest I think she may have feelings for me. I honestly can’t get her off my mind lately as well though due to her always texting me, fb messaging me and Instagram messaging me all at the same time - we message everyday from morning to night. She sends me selfies and we pretty much talk about anything and everything. 

She doesn’t talk about her wife much and I know it’s wrong how I feel as she is taken. If she does talk about her wife it is usually a complaint or saying if they have had a fight. I would never do anything to break a relationship up 
as that’s really not what I’m about. It’s hard to not reply to her though as she texts me quite abit. I know no one can really tell me how I am feeling in regards to my sexuality -  but just really needing anything at this point. I haven’t felt this way about a woman before and she is honestly all i think about and I can’t stop. I genuinely think I have feelings for her. 

Please could I have some advice on what to do ?",24May2020,1

 I haven't told anyone the specific amount i have but last weekend i was in a car shop with a friend and the car seller treated me like i was poor based on my age and appearance i guess, he instantly started talking about down-payments, loans and pointing at the cheapest cars and it made my confidence decrease in a way that i thought do i look poor or is it my way in talking, age etc..

When me and my friend decided to leave the car shop i impulsive said ""if he only knew i could cash every single car in there"", my friend instantly asked if i had that much so i basically switched the subject, pointing at another car trying to avoid those questions.

I'm afraid this will effect our friendship because i'd be jealous, i don't believe i would become angry or that it would impact our relationship negatively but what if it does, what should i do?",24May2020,1

535,"I (22 F) have been very unhappy with my job the entire time I have had it. I am a new graduate nurse who got a job at a hospital in order to get a year of hospital experience before moving on. I am now a grad student pursuing a masters degree in nursing. However, I have completed my year of hospital experience and now would like to go back to my old job working in home health. 

Benefits of working at my current job in the hospital
- the more hospital experience the more marketable you are for future jobs 
- gain experience you can’t really get in home health
- become a more well rounded nurse
- benefits !! (I have a 401k but am on my parents health insurance) 
- decent amounts of PTO accrued 
- can buy a house 

Cons of working at my current job 
- overworked 
- under paid
- lacking support from management 
- working nights 
- experiencing burn out

Pros of working in home health
- flexible schedules 
- can do shift work if I choose to
- one patient at a time 
- autonomy 
- good pay 
- able to move out of state when I finish my masters degree next year which is my dream

Cons of working for home health
- I have to stay in my apartment
- dry seasons (no guarantees for number of hours especially if a patient passes away)
- no real benefits 
- has PTO but not nearly as much as I am currently able to accrue 
- more instability 

TLDR; I need advice over what the smarter move is whether I prioritize my mental health and go for a job that I know I enjoy or go for the financial stability and endure another year of hell at my current job",24May2020,1
536,"I am a 19M living in ghetto South Florida. The worst year of my life so far was when I went to a school called Parkway Middle in 2013. I don't really want to go to in to it, but I essentially have repressed most of the memories during that time period. I never really recovered from the depression and antisocial behaviors that I developed from attending that hellhole. It caused me to go through highschool never interacting with anyone unless I had to. I was always alone and anxious for 4 years straight. I never realized that the cause of me hating other people was just the experience that I went through in 2013. I never tried to learn anything from it and I basically gave into despair and depression. Attending that school made me wish we could just nuke South Florida off of the map. But as a more mature person I understand that the reason those ""kids"" are they way they are, is because of the system and culture they were brought up in. I just want to move past this very shameful and embarrassing time period during my life. Despite being muscular and knowing how to fight, I still have low self esteem and insomnia from time to time. My social skills were heavily deteriorated throughout highschool. Any advice(besides therapy since I cannot afford it) is welcome in how to deal with this.",24May2020,1

539,"So, I am best friends with my Ex-Girlfriend. Well... was, as of yesterday.
We have always been close and being best friends was never a problem. In fact, we’ve been closer than ever before since becoming best friends over a year ago.

Yesterday, she blocked me on pretty much everything and doesn’t want to be involved anymore. 

Let me explain why. I was talking to some girl... flirty in some ways but I wasn’t interested. She saw that I was messaging this girl and she explained that seeing it hurts her and she doesn’t want to be in a position where she’d be in the middle of it. That’s absolutely fine and I have always told her, do not hide your feelings... you can’t help what you feel. 

I have explained that I am not interested in other people, but she doesn’t see it that way.

I can’t lose her as a friend, she means the world to me and has helped through some imaginable mental struggles. Quite frankly, if it wasn’t for her being in my life I wouldn’t be here today. She saved me from myself.

I understand that being friends with your Ex is very very risky in terms of trying not to fall for each other again.

How do I get her back? I can’t live without her being my best friend.
Or, do I let her go? I want her to be happy no matter what and if that means letting her go then so be it... but I worry about her and she is such an important person in my life.

541,"I really need advice because I feel so hung up on this person it's killing me. So here is the whole story:

Last year, around January, I decided to start talking to a young woman from college, we'll call her SG.

It started mostly with just texting while I was at another college doing extra courses, but it quickly evolved into a physical relationship, and then we realized that we wanted to try dating. So then it was an open relationship with a set standard of rules. She had slept with 9 other people in the course of 4 months, while I had slept with no one else. On two occasions she had lied about the pretenses of sleeping with them, so I gave her an ultimatum because I could not handle her being physical with someone else, my fault. Then we started dating ""officially"" monogamously, but I was always hyper-critical because our relationship was no longer built on trust, meaning lack of privacy. It went well for about 6 months but we found ourselves arguing more and more. She broke up with me stating that she has to work through her diagnosis of Bipolar disorder, in which I believed we could work through together since I have depression and anxiety and know what it's like, but she didn't feel this way. This was in November. She also kept trying to change aspects about me, like insensitivity (this I have worked on a lot since then). We continued being friends and very physical with each other but we both felt pressure from this. Then we started arguing more and she decided she wanted to stop being friends and ghosted me for 2 weeks until we decided to try again. This didn't work and in March she decided to cut me out of her life, saying that she would like to try to be friends in the future, but she just can't do it right now. When we stopped being friends, I lost her friends too. So I also have very few friends now and with the pandemic, it's harder to make friends. It's like someone died when we are no longer friends. We used to talk every day and share so much with each other

Which brings us to now. 

I still message her sometimes and occasionally get responses back but I know she's not good for me, even though I love her unconditionally. I have tried to hate her, I resent how she's treated me but somehow I'm addicted to this person and can't get her out of my head. 

A few questions.

1. Should I stop talking to her and see if things just play out later on being friends?
2. If so, what type of personal development should I do to be better?
3. Should I just move on? How would I go about that? How do I not be hung up on this person?
4. How do I stay occupied so I don't have to think about this person? She took up a significant portion of my time before and now my time is spent doing meaningless stuff, just trying to maintain what little happiness I have with my mental illness.

Any help I could get would be helpful. Thank you for your time.",24May2020,1

543,"Hi
For reference, I'm a teenage girl and my friend and I are like most stereotypical teenage girls (caring about boys etc). Let's call her N. Back in October, I was crushing on this guy, V. It was nothing serious but I had a crush on him earlier too and it was like an old fling coming back, but there was definitely something there. In the beginning of November, V texted me asking to hookup and as we had exams coming up, I said maybe after exams. V had also asked N for the same and N knew that he asked me too (and that I liked him). Despite exams, him asking me too and my crush on him, they hooked up and even dated for a short while.

Due to more than just this conflict of ours, a lot of people in our friend group kind of shunned her out for a few days because no one liked what she had done, unsurprisingly. Anyhow, N and V's relationship ended and she ended up becoming friends with the group again.

Long story short to now, I'm talking to another guy who neither of us know personally (know through mutual friends and all). Previously, N talked to me about how she doesn't think guys like her anymore and that no one thinks she's really attractive etc. This guy I was talking to, B, is older than us and I'm legally not an adult whereas N is. For B and N to do something, it wouldn't be illegal although it would right now be illegal for B and I do to something.

Anyhow, before knowing my age, B reached out to me after seeing one of my viral tiktok videos and although we flirted around for a bit, we stopped flirting when we found out each others age. B jokingly comments on how he thinks N is hot and when consulting N about this (generally talking to her about this guy etc), she says he's playing with me and just doing it to make me jealous and I should play along. It gets to B genuinely asking me to set them up and for the sole reason of the conversation N and I had when she expressed she doesn't think guys like her, I ask her if she wants to go for him because he is interested in her.

She said yes despite knowing all my feelings for him. I totally understand and take the blame in being the one to have asked her, but something really hurt me that she's willing to go for a guy she knows I have feelings for. Apart from guys, she also has a slight tendency to copy what I'm doing, possibly due to jealousy of my social life - she frequently talks about me being popular but has not said she's jealous of it, so this is total speculation and may be completely narsacisstic of me to say!

Finally, I just want to ask: is it wrong/normal for me to feel this way considering I genuinely do want her to have a guy as amazing as B, yet I feel sad that she would go for him? Is this normal to have in 'best friends' of 3 years? I feel like I might invertedly be jealous that B wants to go for her even though they have never even talked, so what can I do about that, if you do think that's the case?

I'm so sorry it's so long! Any help would be appreciated",24May2020,1
544,"Hello, not sure if it is the correct subreddit, if not, sorry about that.

I have a serious problem with my parents, my father was a violent authority during my childhood, he used violence to educate me and force me to do stuff i did not want to do with violence. My mother was always overprotective and not really the brightest lightbulb. They totally lack empathy. They use guilt to make me do stuff, my opinion and needs are always ignored. They do love me, but are incapable of giving me emotional support and cannot comprehend my needs, they are only capable of giving me material stuff (for which i'm thankful for), but that's not what i needed. 

This caused me BIG issues, i have low self esteem, emotional dependency, and most of all, violent tendencies in relationships. Several psychologists told me and my father these issues (especially the violent tendencies) are most certainly caused by their actions in my childhood. Violence is a model that i (unfortunately) acquired.

To this day, they still do not understand, they minimize saying ""we did not hit you that much"", ""what you are saying is not true"" and so on. This minimization of the damage and my feelings makes me so angry i wanna smash everything.

Now i have to fight all these scars and wrong behaviors they caused me, and i'm trying my best reading books and going to therapy. I do not care about whose fault is it, i just want to fix myself and finally have a healthy relationship and possibly create a family.

The issue is, for some time i'll have to live with them, and just staying close to them for 4-5 minutes can cause me to get angry or snap. I just get triggered at the first guilt tripping, minimization of my feelings or whatever.

I really do not know what to do because at the moment i cannot get away from here (i will not explaing the reason, but just know it is not possible).

Any advice on how to handle this situation?

Hello, i need help and tips on avoiding someone with possible schizophrenia. 

This post might be all over the place, I didn’t know how to put things together. I’m sorry 

I just recently befriended someone who seemed like he was okay at first. 
Throughout the 2 weeks I have known this person he started showing signs like bipolar moods, dreams, superpowers, and so on. 
I thought he was just a narcissist or something but he gets really skiddish. 
It started normally I thought he was just only having depression or something so I tried to be there. I started to get to know this person and he tells me he has sorts of superpowers or his dreams are true and so on. 
He would visit me at work before I would get off and he would wait about maybe 2 hours or so. Not sure if this is sorta a stalking trait or something but he was accused of stalking before. 

We got boba drinks together. He said he liked it, another moment he said he hated it and as I left to go home. I believe I saw him throwing the drink onto the parking lot ground. And as I left the parking lot I saw him crutching down around a corner staring into no where. 

I’m not sure what I should do. 

And another big problem was that it seemed that he had to be right about everything. I tried arguing that relationships are based on both parties being in an agreement on everything NOT FAITH AND DESTINY. He got super agitated. 

A couple time during a conversation he grabbed my wrist which made me confused. So I’m not sure what I should’ve done. 

I told him that I wanted to go home (home home not school home) and he kept asking “why” and that I should stay here and continue to go to school here longer. I told him I missed my mom and that I was gonna transfer schools and he got really angsty. 
— 
I’m very scared of going to work though I don’t work a lot. I don’t know how to tell my boss about this situation. I don’t want to get the police involved. 

I know being there for someone who has a mental illness is the right thing to do but this is my safety. If he was able to grab my wrist, I don’t think I’m safe. Especially for someone I don’t know that well. 

I know I might said argued but it was more as a counter argument towards some topics I’ve talked about with him. He probably took it the wrong way.

Then one day she got with some douche that she always talked shit about and told me she could make him change. (She knew I hated him) 

Although I was pissed I wouldn’t let this ruin the friendship we’ve built up for 7 or so months. 

But then she was the one to end our friendship, not outright but very slowly. (I found out later this was because her BF told her to stop talking to me)

After a couple weeks of me flat out ignoring her because I knew she wasn’t ‘supposed to talk to her’ based of what her BF said she finally came back to me. Basically blowing up my phone until I answered, she told me she didn’t care what he said anymore and that we could still be friends. I stupidly believed that this would last when obviously it wouldn’t. 

I allowed her to repeat this vicious cycle on me multiple times, and now i’ve completely cut her off. 

Now she acts like I never existed and pretty much puts all of her focus on her douche of a BF. 

At this point my anger towards him doesn’t even have to do with my feelings for her, but because he took a friend away from me.

I also had a few people following that account from my real one and I didn’t know them that well. I don’t know if that spam account will catch up to me sooner or later. Especially because of the people that followed me on there, I’m not sure if they were saving my posts. 

With what’s going on now and this cancel culture it actually made me scared to become relevant online at all. Ever since quarantine I keep seeing celebrities being exposed or taken down completely for certain posts they made years ago. I understand why and some of them do need to be de-platformed because there’s definitely a lot of toxic people but some have made mistakes when they were 16 years old on twitter and they were still canceled. 

I also feel like people don’t want to see other people change anymore. And people online are very ruthless nowadays. 

I’m not sure how to feel about this situation or what to do?",24May2020,1
561,"First time poster on here, but I feel like I need a genera consensus on this, so here I go (TL;DR at the bottom):

Bit of background: the children’s father and I have been friends for over 25 years (we’re both 30 now) and I can say with absolutely no bias that he is the nicest guy in the world, sometimes to his own detriment. Hardly has a bad word to say about anyone, will do anything for anyone, good dad, good friend, all that. I’ve always suspected he’s on the autistic spectrum but very minorly as he comes across a little ‘weird’ to some purple, but completely benign. Not really the issue; but just to give you an idea of how good a guy he is.

I never thought he would be one of my first friends to get married, have kids, etc, but he met the mother of his children through some mutual friends at a pub in 2008 and got pregnant within a year (not planned). The first year with the new baby (born in 2010) was tough but they eventually got things straight, had another (unplanned) child in 2012 and settled down in a nice house close to both their families (his is a large extended family, but her mother and sister live in Australia, and father not in contact, so mostly just her grandparents and cousins).

I actually got on really well with her, to the point where we pretty much had a friendship apart from my friend (nothing untoward, I’m gay) - I was best man at their wedding (roughly 4-5 years into the relationship when the kids were toddlers), godfather to both their children, and was almost the third wheel in the relationship.

Cut to around 2017, and he calls me one day to say they’ve separated - I find out that she stopped feeling for him and moved out; no bad behavior on either part. He stays in the house, she moves elsewhere, and they come to a (mostly) arrangement with the kids - two points to mention are 1) he paid her support even when they shared custody (in the UK alimony isn’t really a thing, so this was above-and-beyond), and b) his family are a little ‘brash’ and made things a little difficult, but they also calmed down and are mostly amicable.

A few weeks later the mother was seen in a shop holding hands with an ex-boyfriend by his mother and sister (not yet divorced at this point).There was a confrontation as it was suspected they were together before she left the home, but it was denied. Anyway, as of today, she’s living with the ex-boyfriend and still sharing the parenting with my friend.I’ve not had much contact with her since her and my friend broke up, but am friendly if I see them (and with the boyfriend).

Recently I’ve seen her, the boyfriend and the kids on quarantine walks, and a couple of times the youngest child has referred to the boyfriend as “Dad”. First time, I brushed it off as a mistake, but the second time started me thinking - no one corrected the naming, no one flinched (except me), and it’s made me really uneasy. My friend is an equal, if not greater, parent than the mother (I say ‘greater than’ for reasons I won’t go into) and I feel doesn’t deserve this. He’s still single (not been in a relationship since) and, honestly, I’m not sure how he would feel if I told him about the “Dad” incidents (he may already know) but what I do know is that he won’t confront her, no matter how he fells. Th boyfriend seems like a good guy but I don’t feel it’s right that he’s seen as a second father, especially when the relationship has been (relatively) short and not legalised yet.

My question is: as godparent to both children, and wanting an equally respectful relationship with all parties, should I speak to the mother to ask her to consider stopping the children calling the boyfriend “Dad”? I’m not usually confrontational like this, but I feel it’s my responsibility as godparent, friend and the most neutral party in their lives to challenge it.

TL;DR: two good friends with kids split up (both good parents); new boyfriend of mother is being called “Dad” by kids - should I speak to the mother to stop this in the most respectful way possible?

Thanks for any input.",24May2020,1

565,"So there has been this pigeon living in my garden for about 2 days. We have had water laid out for it along with bird seeds so it doesn’t starve. A bird protection unit had told us that it is just a lazy pigeon and hasn’t bothered to learn how to fly, and that we should just leave it and it should be gone within 2 days. Problem is. I have two dogs so it was inevitable that the dogs would not attack it. 1 day later my dad tells me that it has been attack and we could drive somewhere that is 1 hour there and back and deliver it to a bird protection unit. I went out to assess the harm done to it and it’s back is exposed which is being covered by its wings a lot with its right side of the head being tattered and what looks like to show it’s bare skin if not skull bone. No blood though. However, I don’t know if I should leave it and see if it learns how to do something or to take it. If I leave it to try and learn how to get out the garden am I a bad person?

568,"I'm a 34 year old man in a long relationship (multiple years) with a girl who I have become convinced due to both intuition and evidence is a compulsive liar and a cheater. Over the course of the relationship she's changed a lot and there were some rocky patches as well that said one thing that I can't seem to discount is the fact she lies about most anything. For the longest time I thought it was just innocuous stuff or to make things seem more serious. I've started to realize though she's lied about many, many things and I think was still seeing her old boyfriend when we first started dating and is now trying to replace me in the same manner. I found out recently from mutual friends that her old boyfriend wanted to contact me when I had first started dating her to warn me but didn't think I'd listen. Her emotions lately swing from wild outbursts about things that seem innocuous to love bombing. She also tells me often how she wants to get married. This was something up until I've started realizing this stuff mentioned above I was completely on board with. Now I don't know why I am still invested the way I am or why I care, my close circle all thinks she needs help and want nothing to do with her. Several have said that our relationship was flat out abusive towards me and even some of her own friends and family have said similar to me in private. Would it be worthwhile confronting her with the evidence I have and trying to call her out or should I simply just walk away and chalk it up to a learning experience quietly. I've had my share of relationships but nothing quite like this or how damaged it has left me emotionally.

570,"Yes, this is a gross topic, but I need help, so please excuse the TMI. 

My boyfriend of 4 years has always been gassy/farted a lot, but as of recently they have started stinking so bad to the point that I almost throw up. I’m talking putrid- like there’s GOT to be something dying in his stomach. Over the course of us hanging out watching TV for 4 hours he regularly farts 10-15 times, every day, plus even more when he’s at work and when i’m out doing errands and such, so it’s definitely way more than I fart. I have tried to talk to him about it but he takes it as a joke every time. I don’t think it’s that funny, obviously- i’m a bit concerned. 

He’s definitely not overweight whatsoever- he’s 5’11’’, 150 lbs. He eats 3 meals a day, probably like half whole/health foods, half junk food, but I feel like he’s always done that. I make him his lunches to take to work and nothing has changed there for about 3 years, so I think it’s something he’s eating at work with his coworkers if it is food that’s causing it. For background, he’s an electrician in a union and he works in buildings all day, so when they order food in, it’s typically fast food, but he always says he doesn’t eat it. I’m definitely not one to control his eating habits, I just want him to be healthy. His family had a strong history of Diabetes and heart attacks and I don’t want him to end up with the severe health problems that his dad has. 

I had casually asked him a few weeks ago if he’s eating anything different at work because his farts smell a lot worse lately and he said no, just the lunches you made me. 

Although he jokes about it a lot, I know he can’t help farting like that. I just need advice on what to do. Does he maybe have a food intolerance he doesn’t know about? Is there anything I can do to kindly suggest trying to eat healthier foods besides the lunches I make him if that is the problem? We don’t live together but I see him 5-6 times per week. I don’t think he would be open to seeing a gastroenterologist or another Dr., I just want to see if I can help him without sounding rude. No one likes their eating habits picked on, I know I wouldn’t, but the farts are seriously getting to me.",24May2020,1
571,"On May 10th, my best friend told me that she had broken up with her manipulative, toxic boyfriend for good. I was happy for her because she was getting hands put on her anymore. She told me that she had also hooked up with some random guy from her continuation high school like 3 days after they broke up. 

On May 22nd, she told me that she has a new boyfriend from my high school and I was *not* happy. She was sending smile emojis and laughing emojis, I didn't send anything back. I told her that she just got out of a serious, toxic relationship not even 2 weeks ago. 

She said something along the lines of ""I understand. I was just so sad and I literally wanted to jump off of a bridge, but he's (new boyfriend) 19, has an apartment, he treats me good. 

Now what pisses me off is that she struggles with mental health issues and she didn't give herself time to heal from her bad breakup. If you were getting beat up on by your ex, wouldn't you be more cautious about jumping straight into a relationship 10 days later?? I don't understand it. 

I vented to my mom and she said ""Girls who've usually been in toxic relationships, will get with another toxic guy but not realize until it's too late"". So I'm just waiting for *that* text tbh. 

I wanna tell her that I don't think it's a good idea to jump into a serious relationship after getting out an abusive one without sounding like an unsupportive asshole. I feel like her reason why is bullshit...if you feel like you're going to jump off a bridge, you help yourself mentally and seek therapy, NOT COPE THROUGH ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP. I feel like she's super rebounding. 2018: controlling ex, 2019: controlling ex who choked her, 2020: what's instore?

My bff has struggled with depression for many years. A few days ago they told me it’s getting worse, having suicidal thoughts returning.

574,"TL;DR at bottom. 

My SO has a job where they are around a lot of people and thus, I consider them high risk for COVID. I didnt really think that they were around all those many people previously, but recent events have proven that I was very wrong in thinking this. 

I was so wrong that they have started going to various friends’ houses, thus creating a new avenue for possible infection. My SO had no intentions on telling me about this new added risk because, “I work around a lot of people every day and this is no different”. I instead had to find out via reading a chat that we have with our friends that this has been happening for a while without my knowledge. 

I feel lied to. 

As if my SO doesnt respect me at all. Just like an ex of mine would purposely not tell me things like how he used me as the other woman in the start of that relationship. This just immediately makes me feel that same level of betrayal. 

To think that I am purposely missing out on things I want to do with our health in mind and to now be shown that they just don’t fucking care at all. 

I feel like no one really understands my stance in this at all and just says that I’m overreacting and being selfish. 

Am I even right to be so angry and hurt? Am I being too sensitive? What can I do about this?

TL;DR: My SO is exposing the both of us to COVID because of their job but more importantly because they want to hang out with friends. They had no intentions of letting me know this.

About three years ago I was huge into yoga and my MIL then started taking classes (she was NEVER interested before) and literally made sure everyone thought of her as a yogi. As soon as I stopped she stopped. Every chance they get they act like they had already thought of an idea we presented or are also planning on doing the same thing we are doing. We just redid our floors today so that they match the floor in the kitchen. My in laws respond that they match their floors. There’s been so many instances with them specifically feeling like their copying us. While all this can be true and be consequences the point is I get upset when people don’t let me have my own style and things that are true to me.

My parents intentions are to help their children at their stage in their lives, but it makes me feel like I suck. Furthermore paying off a house was something to look forward to which I could work towards, and keep me motivated in my career and life. Without the house I feel without direction or purpose. We have everything we could ever need at this point and it makes me feel like the rest of my life will have nothing else purposeful to work toward.

579,"I'm going to be honest, I had a whole thing typed up and my phone freaked out and deleted it so here's the short version. Maybe that'll make this easier, maybe not. 

I (20F) and my fiance (22M) moved to a new state 2 years ago so we could live what I thought would be a ideal life. The plan was to move in with my Grandmother for a while, get stable jobs, I would re-enroll in school so I could finish and hopefully look into buying our own property in the next 5 years or so. My Grandma bought her farm that she always wanted and I always wanted to live on a farm and help out. My Grandma and I got into Dairy Goats together, my Fiance got into pigs, and we also have horses and chickens.

Problem is, we're miserable. It isn't going to plan at all, and while I realize most of life never does, this REALLY isn't going where I expected it to go.

Neighbors? Drama. Work? Miserable. Fiance work? Hasn't been able to get a job since we got here. (Note, this wasn't a issue when we lived in the city and at points he carried 2 jobs) School? Still haven't been stable enough to enroll. My Grandfather, while I love him, also likes to make things as difficult as possible and it's very hard to be around him this often. I am growing frustrated with my Grandma as all she seems to do Is work and bring work home and even applies this somewhat workaholic behavior to me. We work in the same building doing similar things, and sometimes work with the same clients. I personally wanna be done with work the moment I step out the door.
We've also been living in my Grandmas old RV... I haven't had water in here for months. The toilet never worked. It is impossible to live in here with 2 people and I swear everytime we turn around something is breaking. Our door handle has broken on either side, our door window fell out, we've had major leaks that caused the water to be shut off, all with promised its be fixed and it never actually gets fixed. 
My mental health has been all over the place, I don't feel like I'm getting the guidance a young adult should and that everyone's just kinda letting me do my own things. Which on one hand, pretty nice. On the other hand, I have NO IDEA what I'm doing in the SLIGHTEST and I desperately wish someone would just kinda... give me the ""omg dont do that"" reel like my mom would. I regret moving out so early.

Now, I also have the option to move back home. I would be free of my crappy job, and would be able to not only get help from my parents getting my health back on track (both mental and physical) but also.be able to go right back to school and not worry too much about big Bill's such as rent. My parents always said I could live rent free so long as I was going to school or working. (Theyd rather I put ""rent"" in a savings account and have it for when I'm ready to move. They also offered to charge said ""rent"" but do the same thing, put it in savings and then give it to me when I am ready to move again. I'm responsible with money so I get the option.)
I would be living in that sketchy city again, and I hate that freaking town. But I miss my friends, my family, having a place that makes sense to me etc.
My fiance even said that after we moved and I became so miserable, I have become to be... well, a bitch. I dont much care for that, I never wanted to be that person.

Here's the thing though.

If I move back home I have to give up my livestock. So does my fiance. My parents dont have room for it. They have room for our pets but that's it. I dont really want to give up my animals, I love them dearly. I also dont want to just leave them here even if I did pay monthly board to keep them here because I dont want to push that responsibility onto my grandparents. I want to be able to keep doing this too, it's what I always wanted.

580,"I (M19) have been talking with 2 girls (20 &amp; 19) lately and both are sexually interested in me and one has even eluded to the 3way possibility. I’m not sure if I should even try to go through with it. 

Some background:

We’ll call the first girl A. She is 20, bisexual and my most recent ex. We split because she wanted to be single again which upset me, and then a month later she came back saying she missed me. We’re good friends and I still like her so I told her we’re going to wait and maybe we’ll get back together if we feel like it. We chat and flirt still so I know she wants to have sex still.

Girl B is a high school friend who I crushed on and only recently reconnected with. We’ve been talking quite a bit and one day we got to the topic of relationship stuff. We both confessed our feelings and agree we’d both love to roll in the hay together. At one point she dropped the info that she had a dream back when A and I were dating that we invited her to a 3way. Of course I asked if she accepted and she said yes, although she doesn’t remember the actual act of it in the dream. That’s what really gave me the idea. Because if B is interested then it would only need to convince A to do it.

The worry is that if I push it than it might backfire where the both want nothing to do with me and I lose 2 of my 3 close friends. But the payout is I get to dom 2 girls at the same time which is most men’s dream scenario.

585,"My girlfriend and I started a new lease on a rental house on Tuesday. While on the walkthrough, we discovered the backyard had a blackberry bush growing along the fence with the nextdoor neighbors, which was one of the only redeeming features of an otherwise crappy yard. We haven't yet moved in so we weren't around for the next few days. Yesterday we went over to the house again to find that the bush had been completely removed but still laying in the yard. We were a little shocked and assumed that the rental company had removed it, since they had still been doing some work around the house after we took the keys.  Later, I was out mowing the front yard when the neighbors came over to introduce themselves. They casually mentioned that they hired someone to remove the blackberry bush from OUR yard, due to the plant's invasive nature (a fact I'm fully aware of). They mentioned that the landlord had been ""uncooperative"" in addressing their concerns with it. 

This was a genial meet-the-neighbors conversation and they very casually mentioned the bush removal. I'm also very non-confrontational person (i.e., socially anxious) and didn't realize the audacity of their actions in the moment so all I said was ""we were really looking forward to eating the berries."" While continuing my work in the yard, their shittiness dawned on me: they saw an opportunity while the house was unoccupied by the new renters (us) and sneakily hired someone to trespass on the property and remove the plant.

586,"Hello.
I am 16 and in highschool. I had some problems with finding friends at the start of the year, I changed my class and finally found people that I really like. It was all going well but I started doing some things, that were not exactly good for my relationship with the group - not being honest with them,  doing stuff behind their back,  not meeting with them and meeting someone else without telling them about what I was going to do and things like that. About a month before quarantine began in my country we had an argument about it and it honestly didnt go so bad,  they told me that I should just rebuild my trust with them, and dont do stuff like that again, which was really nice of them and I couldnt think of a better end to the argument. I got shy around them and tried to be less attention seeking. And then quarantine started and I completely lost any connection with them

587,"I (27F) am the youngest of four. I’ve two older brothers and an older sister. My eldest brother is 8 years older than me, he went to boarding school and then to uni at 17 so wasn’t around much when I was growing up. My sister was extremely abusive to me and my other brother growing up, like not in a typical way that brothers and sisters are mean. I mean she was properly abusive. She had clear anger issues that never were addressed by my parents (who separated when i was very young but they are still friends and my dad has always been in my life.) And my other brother, just over 2 years older than me, wasnt super nice to me growing up, and since we’re all adults now, it seems NONE of them want to get to know me. I constantly feel like I’m left out of stuff. Despite the fact my sister was - maybe still is - actually psychopathic, she’s always been the kind of person to have LOTS of friends, and even though she caused hell for my brother when we were younger, they are really close now. They’d organised to go away together for christmas (with my sisters fiancé and my brothers boyfriend too), it ended up being a bigger affair than they wanted, my mum and some extended family went along as well, but I was so hurt I was never even asked. Last summer I was so sick of always being left out of stuff I outright ignored all my family members for months. My parents and sister all tried to get in contact with me for ages - neither brothers did, shock! - and even would contact my boyfriend asking him what was wrong etc. And despite all that, I’m still treated the same way. 
Since lockdown, we’ve been doing weekly family quizzes on zoom (I live abroad, one brother does too, eldest lives in the capital and my sister, fiancé and their son lives close enough to my parents). Yesterday we had the quiz again, my brothers boyfriend ran it. One round was on disney / cartoons. I LOVE disney and cartoons, as much if not more so than my sister, yet everyone was saying it was made just for her, and when we were going through the answers people were asking did she get it etc. I know it’s not a competition, but it just makes me feel invisible, and as if nobody knows what my interests are! 

Sorry for the rant, and thanks for reading. Basically i just don’t know what to do. Is there anything i CAN do?",24May2020,1
588,"I grew up with a single mother with absolutely 0 male presence. I have no uncles, brothers, cousins, etc. I was raised purely by my mother and grandmother.

Growing up, I always attached myself to men that I shouldn’t have. Any time I had a male teacher that showed a little care for me, I would treat them as a dad and try to have personal relationships with them. It never worked out and left me empty. My mom’s boyfriends would come and go, and each time it would hurt me detrimentally. 

I have extreme jealousy issues when I see men my age get to do things with their fathers. I wish my dad would call me to go fishing on a Sunday. I wish I could talk to my father for guidance for things women might not be able to understand. I wish I just had someone to show me how to be a man and take the time to show care for me.

I’m 24 now with the same problems. I’m a young Black guy, and I’ve pretty much adopted my boss as a father figure. I love learning the industry under him and I’m always on call when he needs me because I want to make him as proud as I can. I can be defined as a bootlicker. I always ask him to do miscellaneous things with me that I can’t do with the women in my family and always ask if I can tag along to events that he’s going to because I love the idea of having a more mature male presence. This doesn’t go well since he has sons close to my age. I understand this, but I become extremely hurt over it.

My boss was telling us over our video call about how he was teaching his son to fix cars over the extended weekend, and I became extremely jealous, wishing he was showing me instead. At the end of the day, I have to realize he is my supervisor, not family. 

I’m just not sure how to stop latching on to any man that I see as a role model. I continuously watch Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson, etc. just to get some clue as to what I need to be in life. I feel empty and lost.

I am not and have not done any of the things he has found “proof” of. I have no knowledge even of how to accomplish any of these things.

604,"Tried to make it short, but oh well. TLDR at the bottom.

I was told initially that due to current events, a big family birthday was being moved from last Saturday to sometime in the Fall. A week before the birthday, my parent tells me that there is a small birthday event taking place last Sunday, and I'm invited despite not receiving an invitation. Sure enough, a few hours later, my relative texts me to ask if I'm coming.

I am diagnosed with a mental illness, which means I (among other things) have some autistic traits, and also makes me prone to stress. Having seen first hand how my family deals with mental illness, I've decided not to involve them in that. Generally I try to lead life as neurotypically as possible, and otherwise protect myself when necessary.

I have a full-time job, which takes up a lot of my energy.  
I have the opening shift every Monday and Wednesday. I have to get up at 4AM to be there at 6. I don't mind that, but obviously that makes it difficult to have plans Sunday night and still be fresh for work in the morning. Given the start time of the event, and how long it would take to get back and forth, I estimated to be home between 8 - 9PM, which wouldn't be enough time to recuperate before going to work in the morning.  
So I tell them that I can't go because of a conflicting work schedule.

Well, they refused to accept that, and told me I should change my mind. When I didn't, I was told by my sibling that they had been badmouthing me heavily at the event.   
I'm hurt and sad, because I was just trying to be as honest as possible. It's the first time I skip out of an event with this part of the family, and there will still be the event in October + several times before then that I'll be seeing them. I would have liked to go, but I don't regret not going.

How should I react if/when they try to push me on it? My best idea right now is to just tell them ""sorry for being honest, I'll just tell you a big fat lie next time"", but I feel like that's not the mature nor correct way to go?   
And what about next time this issue presents itself?

**TL;DR** \- Didn't go to a family event, family didn't approve of that, and now I'm a jerk apparently.",24May2020,1

606,"So recently I’ve been having issues with my little sister. She seems like she wants to do everything that I do. For example, when I was 6 I started competitive dance. A few years later she started begging my mom to let her start dancing to. Sure enough she was at my competitions that next month. I started taking piano lessons along with dance and she also started begging to take piano lessons. I went shopping the other day and she insisted on coming with me and buying something EXTREMELY similar to what I was getting. Usually I wouldn’t have a problem with this, but she’s gotten to be better than me at everything she tries to follow me into. I know I just sound like a jealous sister but it’s really taken a toll on my mental health. I can’t seem to get to do anything on my own or have an activity for myself. She’s always there, she’s always better than me, she always gets recognized more than me. When she moved up a level in dance my mom had this huge post on Facebook about how proud she is of her. But if you scrolled through her posts there isn’t a single one of me or any of my achievements. I can hear her playing the piano downstairs while I’m typing this and it feels like a reminder that she’s better than me. Am I taking this too far? Or is there something I can do about my situation.

It was for a movie based website and I was supposed to act in the capacity of a campus ambassador. She asked me how many registrations I could bring her.

She was not sure about that and said both so I questioned furthers as to how she could do both simultaneously. She got seriously pissed and told me that I cannot tell her to do her own job.

My father works in an airport, my mother works in a goddamn hospital and one of my brother in laws is active duty Navy.....they are all still working and that’s a lot of exposure for someone like me who has worked from home since late March. My siblings are no help, they are all going anyway and share the basic viewpoints of my conservative parents. We are in Southern CA for reference.",24May2020,1
623,"So my little sister is having a maths contest online and my mom asked me to help her. While i think it's stupid to even hold competitions online, i can't exactly say no to my mother.

624,"Ok so this is gonna he kinda long but whatever. So I guess I’ll do backstory first. 
I was pretty much living in my car last year couch hopping and barely getting by. I kept all my stuff at my moms house because my uncle kicked me out cause my brother and I don’t get along. I didn’t live with my mom like that cause we also don’t get along well. I haven’t actually lived with her since I was 14. I am 21 now.  My mom realized how bad I was getting with the car situation and agreed to sign a lead on a 1 bed 1 bath. It’s only 825 a month plus utilities and whatever else. Last nights we got into a heated argument about how she doesn’t thank me for doing anything for her. She can’t walk that well and has me clean her house every weekend and help with her pets. We have an agreement going that she will help me with half of the $825 if I cover everything else and help her around the house and do all her shopping for her. Sounds like a great idea right? Yeah no. My mother doesn’t like being held accountable for anything. You can tell her no and she freaks out and won’t talk to you. She acts like a child. We got into an argument about how she is very unappreciative towards me. All I have asked her to do is thank me for going out and getting her groceries. And a thank you for helping her around the house. I have addressed this and how I feel about it multiple times and actions have not changed much. My mom is one of those people where you could tell her I love you everyday and you will be lucky to hear a “me too” once in a blue moon. I understand she loves me cause she is helping me but when I communicate to her that I feel unappreciated and unloved she just tossed it to the side and brushed it off. This mornin I woke up to my mom texting me about how her therapist told her to cut me off. Her therapist doesn’t like me. Hasn’t seen me in 7 years if not more and has made my life a living hell. I have serious abandonment issues and this lady is aware of it and specializes in kids with abandonment issues and has done nothing but continued to tell my mom to abandon me when shit gets too hard for her. She has followed through cause she’s an idiot. So now I cannot afford my rent. I literally just quit my job last week cause of this bs virus going around. I am not on unemployment cause I’m not a leech. Don’t tell me to go ask the government for help cause I won’t. I don’t respect our government enough to ask for help. Idc if you’re call it pride. It isn’t. I have no idea what to do. I just lost my mom who was my best friend and really only friend due to a petty bs argument. And now I am going to lose my apartment cause I am fucking poor and was stupid to have ever agreed to this. Wtf do I do? The only person I would even consider to let live w me is my human I’m with now. I like him and enjoy his company but I don’t think it’d work out cause we both have issues but I cannot afford to lose this place. I don’t want to go back to living in my car and couch hopping. I only have until I think January until the lease is up and I can move away. But I am terrified I’m going to lose this place. Also yes I have a job interview for a place that pays more than my last job so that is covered. I just don’t know if I’m going to make it and I’m terrified. I wasn’t granted the 1200 from the government so I’m really screwed rn. What do I do? I don’t want some rando living in my apartment with me.",24May2020,1

631,"So I’m 16 turning 17, I go to college and study computing and cyber security when I’m not working as a labourer. This is a story about the time I was cock-blocked during a drug trip and lost my best friend.

(Background Info)My girlfriend has a friend called Dayna that we had filled around with as a couple before, she was nice and all but I wasn’t too into her. We would all meet up and get high as anything whether we just smoking weed or dropping pills. My friend, Harry started trying to get close to her knowing that we had done things with her before.

So everyone wanted to party this weekend (I didn’t want to go because I knew Harry would try and have sex with Dayna and it would ruin the group.) I finally got convinced to come so after a 10 hour shift at work I left for the apartment with my pills and weed, everything was fine to begin with. Everyone took their MDMA and I took an old pill I had which turned out to be 2-CB which mixed with ketamine produces some serious visuals and effects.

Dayna begins to get horny and starts making out with my girlfriend, I wasn’t too sure what to do with the fractals coming at me so I sparked up a blunt and went with it. Moments before it’s about to go down Harry bursts in and starts crying, I then spoke to him for an hour or two and agreed we would both not doing anything with her as it would fuck up everyones friendship.

That night me, my girlfriend and dayna shared a bed together and nothing happened as I was so ruined from all the drugs and the long work shift. I woke up the next day to them having sex in the living room after Dayna said she was scared that Harry would sexually assault her...

I got my things and me and my girlfriend left at 6 am. I then received a call from Harry saying he was gonna F**K me up when he sees me(not sure why but he never did.)I haven’t spoke to Dayna since and Harry still cries his eyes out down the phone to me about how sorry he is.

633,"I’ve had a lot of weight and eating-disorder issues in the past. It gets particularly bad around the summer when I’m a) not around my friends as often and feeling extremely isolated and b) wearing less sweaters, jeans, and baggy clothes. I recovered (kinda) from my eating disorder last summer but I still relapse every month or two. 

The problem is that I can get ‘triggered’, not in the meme-y sense but in the I’m-going-to-relapse-for-a-week-and-destroy-my-self-confidence-for-the-next-month sense. 

I stay away from Instagram and Snapchat for the most part because of this. 

Most of the people around me don’t know but my friend in question, let’s call her ‘G’, does. G has high functioning autism and she has her little quirks, one of them being she doesn’t take criticism well. Things like asking, ‘Hey, can you not talk around me about your weight because it usually starts me on a downward spiral’ can make her shut down internally for a few hours or a day. 

I feel really badly asking her not to talk about weight around me because our other close friend is super skinny and G probably doesn’t feel as comfortable talking about weight to her. Which leaves G with me. I really don’t want to cut off her support but she’s nearing the point of unhealthily skinny (she’s about 6 inches taller than me and 15 pounds lighter which does wonders for ED fuel) and I’m sitting here trying not to fall into the cold grips of another summer vacation lost to an eating disorder. 

We talk to each other about an hour or two every other day over the phone so it’s not like I’m going to be able to avoid the topic much. 

I’m starting university in the fall and while G and our friend stays in my home town, I’m moving about 4 hours away, so I won’t be as close with them, even though we still have plans for winter break and reading week (wether we’ll keep those is another issue entirely). 

I don’t know if it’s worth telling her about this now or letting it go and enduring whatever consequences come to my mental health over the summer.",24May2020,1

637,"I have this huge fear and anxiety when it comes girls. I’ve talked to girls before on message and in person but when it comes to advancing things I literally can’t get myself to do it. Like I notice that some girls do actually like me and are flirting back sometimes, but when that happens I just get way too scared and anxious that I just completely ignore them for the rest of the night or even forever. I’ve had girls backing it up on me (dance with me), but again, I get stupidly anxious and scared that I just turn around and go away from them, although I do actually want to dance with them. It sounds really stupid, I know, but anytime I sense that a girl likes me and I can advance things, for example a kiss, dance, sex etc. I just shut down. I’ve never kissed a girl before and I really want to, but because I’ve never done it before I keep thinking to myself “what if I’m really sloppy, what if she doesn’t like it, what if I look like a retard when I’m doing it and people look at me and laugh etc.” And because of these thoughts I just never go for it, it really takes control over me. I’ve been to magaluf with my friends 2 years in a row (a bit boring, I know) and nothing happened. Every time a girl makes I contact with me and I can tell they like me, I just pretend they don’t exist and move away. In the second year it got to the point where I was trying to talk to girls, didn’t work, got really annoyed and paid for a prostitute. The reason to why I could have sex with a prozzie is because, in my head, I’m thinking she can’t reject me, even if I’m shit at it cause I’m paying you, as in she won’t care if I’m trash so it made it easier for me to go for it, but if I wanted to have sex with a normal girl on a night out I literally feel like it’s impossible to do. I just get way too scared and anxious and idk how to deal with it. Can anyone please help me and give me some advice? And yeah, I have lost my virginity to a prostitute which I regret so much because I’m 20 years old and I’ve only ever had sex with one girl and she was a prozzie, please help me!!!",24May2020,1
639,"So, I (22F) have a pretty big family. I have a lot of siblings. They’re all much older than I am as my mom had me pretty late.
My mom died a few months ago and I’ve had trouble coping with it ever since. My siblings grouped up and became closer, but I feel more alone than ever because I don’t feel like I’m included in their bonding.
We talk about doing things to honor her memory, and my ideas get thrown out completely like nothing I say matters. They had a whole different life with her before I was born so they tend to say “she used to do this” or “used to do that” but those aren’t the memories my closest-in-age sister and I have. I’ve tried to respect that they have different memories with her, but I always feel like I’m stuck in the shadow of it all. We grew up too differently to relate to each other on this front so it tends to spark arguments.

It seems like my friends (with the exception of, like, 2 that I miss dearly and don’t see often enough since our work is shut down) don’t want to be around me. I get invited as an afterthought, like “oh you can come too if you want to.”
I was with some friends a couple weeks ago and it’s like they literally forgot I was there. I sat in silence the whole time feeling like I was going to burst into tears. 
I have severe clinical depression and anxiety, so it could very well be my brain telling me this, or my judgement was clouded before my mom died and now I just see it differently. I’m trying so hard to be better for everyone and I still feel so alone, like there’s no room in their lives for me.

TL;DR: my family and friends seem to have changed since my mom’s death, like I’m a burden to them. 

How can I get through to the people in my life to let them know that I’m suffering without making it seem like I’m begging for attention/making my mom’s death about me/being paranoid?",24May2020,1
640,"I am a 18 year old guy and I feel like I have been coasting for the past 2 years. Two years ago I started Sixth form and began a new chapter of my life, I made new friends, studied new things, and became more sociable. However, I found myself not having many interests at all, I liked playing video games and watching anime but those were already things I had been doing for all my life, I also like skateboarding but never really go into it; apart from those 3 things I didn't have any interests. Skipping forward to a couple of months into the second year I rediscovered my liking for volleyball ( I used to play back in Italy when I was around 8-10 years old), however I realised too late and I wasn't able to join the team as the trials had already ended, this really brought me down as my best friend was on the team and seeing him become good and having fun was really sad because we could have done it together.   


From then to now it has been around 6/7 months and nothing much has really changed, I still really want to play volleyball but I fear it's too late and I have nothing I am passionate about. The main problem is that I have to choose something to study at university within the next month because my previous choice is no longer something I want to do, I am being pressured by deadlines and my parents to make a decision and I just can't seem to find anything to do. With no exaggeration, there is not really a single moment where I'm not thinking about what to do with my life with an impending feeling of discontent.

How can I find something I want to do? I hate feeling like I'm wasting my time and its what I've been feeling for the past 2 years which has built up a lot of regret for things I didn't do. Many people say ""just try things and see what you like"" but I don't know where or how to start, and even if I did I'm not sure I could within the time frame I have and with a pandemic going on.

First 6 months all was well until she got a bf. She started to decrease her interaction for obvious reasons but I felt it was a bit much compared to my other friends in relationship. Anyways, one thing I felt kinda shady was, when things were good she would disappear and as soon as they fought she would be that amazing best friend with me again till things settled. 
This happened multiple times and we talked about it and she just apologized and said she would try harder in the future. Well at one point she started making a new group of friends and completely ignored me. She said she was only available to see me when I was busy and when I was free she preferred to hang with her other friends or study. This obviously started a big argument and we didn't really talk for 3 months until... Her friendship with those people went sour she can back to me and I accepted. Things were good again. I felt I had my best friend back and everything was ok 
 I think what really hurt me was the fact when I broke my leg she visited me twice over a period of 3 months and we lived in the same apartment complex and we both were living alone.
Anyways moving on she met her new bf. Her initial treatment was the same, great with me when fight with bf and when they were good she kinda disappeared.
Anyways last year we both left the place and went to her home country (coincidence not planned or something) anyways, this country was new to me. I know the language cause the language is spoken in my country also but I knew noone here. We met once a month or once every two months till the lockdown. It wasn't ideal but I guess not that bad. 
Thing is she has been really depressed recently. Again she is going into the habit of disappearing (in terms of even texting) and has disappeared for a month and then texted me today. The conversation was great like nothing happened. I try to ask her what's wrong, she said she would fill me in in the morning then at night she said everything was fine which really confused me.
She is an amazing person but is depressed. When she is friends she is the most amazing person and she genuinely cares about me I can tell. But again, her constantly disappearing impacts our friendship cause I feel the gap kills it Everytime. 
It really hurts me when she ghosts cause I feel like just a back up sometimes but I feel she doesn't know she doesnt realise this even though I have talked to her multiple times about it.
I don't know what to do. I really like her as a friend and more but yea. I'm Soo confused please help.",24May2020,1
647,"Me (24F) and my boyfriend (23M) have been together for a couple of years now, and his brother (20M) and his girlfriend (20F) have been together for 3. My boyfriend's brother's girlfriend, let's call her Karen, is all round lovely but occasionally she can be a little 'weird' around my boyfriend. This can span from walking around the house in just a sweater and her underwear during winter, sitting/leaning on my boyfriend on a 3 person couch (to the point were her boyfriend called her out), repeatedly telling the story of how she and her friend used to have a crush on my boyfriend in high school, asking my boyfriend who would win in a fight me or her, and ""if he (my boyfriend) had to kill me how would he do it"" (we were watching a film where someone had to kill their S/O so this wasn't completely out of context). Just random things like this.

Yesterday we went to the park and it was the last time I'd see my boyfriend for a long time, we were walking along holding hands and then Karen comes to join our conversation, cool no problem. She then states that she feels like a third wheel and demands that my boyfriend hold her hand, he does so after she insists for the third time and I just called her out on it. After giving me a dirty look Karen/my boyfriend let go of each others hand and the day continues.

It's been bothering me, but it's also quite discreet behaviour and doesn't seem to be bothering my boyfriend's brother. So I'm not too sure if I'm being overly jealous or if this is just the way she acts, she doesn't seem to do it with other people's S/O, but again I may just be reading into things too much.

648,"I’ve known Hanna since grade 2. We met on the bus where she sat with another girl, Sara. Sara and I hit it off and she started sitting with me instead. Hanna then became jealous and held a grudge against me for years, even though we were sorta friends. We lost contact then ended up at the same youth group in grade 9, and became good friends. 

I’m 18 now, and she’s 17. We both play piano and are very good at it. I started in senior kindergarten and she started in grade 1. For some reason she’s incredibly competitive against me about this. There’s a piano at the church where our youth group is held, and we usually took turns playing it after. I would play a song and she would complain about how long it was, and if anyone complimented my playing she would play a song to try and one-up me. Piano is just a stress relief hobby for me, and I quit lessons a few years ago and now teach myself. She’s going into university for piano and tells every person that she meets that she’s a level 9 pianist. I stopped after level 5 because it was stressing me out, and she brings this up every time I play. I continued teaching myself after quitting however so I can play level 10 pieces. 

I wouldn’t say I was originally competitive against her. I would try to talk to her how I talk to my other friends, and tell her about what I was doing day to day because we went to different schools. She’s a straight-A student who is a strict Christian. I’m definitely just average in school, although I got my shit together in my last year and got on the honour roll. I’m also a Christian but I’m not very strict about it. When I told her I regularly drink alcohol and have had experiences with smoking/drugs, she started trying to one-up me about being “bad” because she knew a kid who was in a gang. Making bad decisions isn’t a competition but I think she felt insecure about not having the same experiences.

She’s gotten worse the closer we get to graduating. She told me about a scholarship she was applying to, and when I asked what the requirements were she told me I wouldn’t have what it takes to even apply for it. I also made the mistake of telling her I was diagnosed with ADD and she’s been saying things like “oh your grades aren’t that good... but we all know why” and then smirking. She picks up any little thing and uses it to try to make me feel bad about myself. My best friend since 4th grade (Brynn) and I have been planning on getting matching heart tattoos behind our ears for years, and we’re going to do it once the tattoo shops open up again. I told Hanna about this and she kept saying how trashy tattoos look. I talked to her more about it and I think it’s because her parents told her they wouldn’t pay for her university if she ever got a tattoo, and because she doesn’t like that I’m a lot closer to Brynn than I am to her. I told her it was my decision because I’m paying for everything myself, and now she’s holding that over me too.

It’s starting to get to me, and I don’t like how it’s making me act. She and I were both slightly chubby throughout high school, but I’ve been working my ass off eating healthy and working out since quarantine started. I’m finally noticing results but I don’t want to tell her because I know she’ll have something bad to say. I hate this but deep down the thing keeping me motivated is that she’s still chubby and this will finally be the one thing I’ll have over her. I don’t want to be like that but I can’t help it. 

How to I make this relationship better? I don’t want to be the competitive type but it’s my only defence against her.",24May2020,1

651,"A friends of ours got a betta fish 3 months ago. I only saw the fish and tank yesterday. Their tank is an awful half gallon tank that has a built in filter but it not plugged the cord wasn’t even attached so it’s not doing anything. There is no flooring and the only thing in it besides the betta is one moss balls. The tank has no cover and is pushed up next to the kitchen sink, who knows what splash. Bettas need a 5 gallon tank at minimum, a working filter, heater, and deco to interact with. 

Worst of all the poor betta boy has ich. He looked so sad laying on the floor of an empty tank. 

When I saw the tank and the sick fish, I pointed out the tiny white spot (ich) on him. And she said yeah he has a weird pattern. Which so they know nothing about their betta they don’t even know that it’s sick. 

I can’t think a nice way to tell them that they are doing everything wrong. Also I’m not really the a friend to the fish owner. My bf is friends/coworkers with her bf and we all live in the same apartment building. I don’t know if I could talk to her or her bf again without feeling horrible because I’m letting them hurt their fish like this. 

Worst of all I feel guilty because they said they got the betta because of me. I talk about how great they are and so they got one. I don’t know how they saw my 10 gallon tank and then bought their size a tank that is less than a gallon. I also just lost betta so this is all stinging extra deep. 

How do I tell them that they are killing their betta and advise them on how to take better care of fish in the future. While not making them hate because my bf still works with her bf?",24May2020,1
652,"I have been accepted to live in a group home for various reasons. Mental health issues, self mutilation (even though I haven’t done that in over a year.), impulse issues, etc. I was accepted over a year ago and they thought at the time the group home would be ready in a few months from then. Nothing has been done since then. The group wants to buy the house and it’s five bedroom but the group wants the price negotiated significantly even though the price is already decent with how much bedrooms, baths, square feet, etc there is. I know the group home just wants it cheap as possible, but because of that the man doesn’t want to sell the house to them because while they’re blaming the issues on him, it’s really the group home that won’t negotiate. I know they want this five bedroom instead of four for the extra bedroom for profit, but it’s getting us literally no where. I currently live in my deceased Grandparents house with my sister and we don’t get along at all and it’s miserable to live here. I can handle living on my own now and I feel like no one has faith in me that I can.

The first year they only saw each other every other week, the second year they saw a lot more of each other and he moved her to another state. After moving there, she just started to meet people and they moved again, and again, and again. She can’t really work each place because they move so much and she’s alone all the time.

Fast forward to now and she has a baby with him due to the fact they wanted kids and were worried about waiting. He is NEVER home. He was gone the first two months of the baby’s life and her mom had a stroke. She was taking care of her mom AND the baby. She was going crazy with stress. Now he’s deployed and it’s been 4 months.

658,"Hey guys!

Sorry if this doesn’t belong here. But here’s a bit of back story.

I was in a serious relationship from 2015 to 2017. It wasn’t great. Actually, it was pretty toxic. I wasn’t great for her. She wasn’t great for me. But I still think she was the closest and the only person who truly understood me.


Every day I would wake up and think I’m going to change this relationship and we’ll be happy and every day things will get worse. 

Then, in 2017 she broke up with me. I didn’t know what happened and I just felt weird and broken. 

I got really depressed after that and my life really went down a spiral. I lost/broke contact with any friends I had (there were other reasons for this) so I didn’t have anyone to really talk to this about 

I tried to go to therapy but gave up after 3 months because I was just too tired of my life being struck.

I decided to focus on my career and a sense of normalcy returned. I’d be focusing on my career so much that I didn’t have time to do anything else. I started making friends who had similar interests or were just my colleagues. 

I started pretending that I have never been in a relationship to just try to forget that part of life so I’ll never feel that miserable again. 


However, since the lockdown started my whole life has been put on hold. I have started feeling so similar to how I felt in 2017 and I don’t know what to do anymore.  

I can’t randomly bring this to my friends because no one knows about this.

Everyday I think about her more and have to physically stop myself from trying to contact her. 


So, I guess I need advice on what to do to feel normal?",24May2020,1
659,"hello! 
so, for context, i'm a 17 y/o girl &amp; the guy in question is ~22 y/o male (we'll call him X) 

when i was 14, i joined my school's drama club while X was a senior. everyone was kind of mean to him, so i treated him with basic kindness. ever since then, he's been a bit creepy with me- weird hugs, uncomfortable compliments, etc. (KEEP IN MIND I WAS 14 WHEN THIS STARTED) 


X graduated and went off to college, but he still contacts me semi-frequently via social media. nothing outwardly predatory, just unwarranted compliments, inviting me to his school's productions, or asking about my life. 


i guess he's not hurting anyone, but it just makes me a bit uncomfortable, as we aren't exactly friends, and especially since he's so much older and i'm still a minor. PLUS, the image of me that he has is A 14 YEAR OLD, and i'm STILL A TEEN, so i just find it a bit creepy. plus, he's known for being a bit creepy towards women in general. 


additionally, i have the feeling he social-media stalks me a lot. like, one time my friend got fed up and deleted him from my insta for me. i felt guilty and unblocked him, and he immediately re-requested me, which shows how he must have been checking up on me. 


i'm uncomfortable with X, but i feel guilty blocking him from my social media. everyone has told me to just block him, but i feel guilty, and maybe like i should just put up with it.. i think he has some form of autism, and might not have many friends. i'm afraid that i'm one of the only people that treats him with kindness, and i don't want to hurt him by taking that away.",24May2020,1
660,"I dropped out of school for about two years before I finished what I needed to get into university. And I did. 

But in the process, I had a really tough time with alcoholism and cringey party experiences when I was feeling lost, self-hating, and self-sabotaging in 2 years of serious anxiety and depression while I was schooling. I still graduated though, lol.

I'm sober now, 4 months. I vow to never drink again for all the trauma, shame and regret alcohol has coincided with. But I have low self-esteem and want to make friends, and belong, without participating in a party culture that glorifies all the things that caused me so much pain. I want to have fun without alcohol and mindless sex. I want to be socially engaged, not lonely, but I don't have the confidence to assert boundaries. I'm afraid I won't be able to make the kind of friends I want to have. 

As someone with social anxiety, it is also a concern where I tend to try to impress due to a subconscious inferiority complex. I don't want to fall victim to the same toxic social pressures that wrecked me in the past few years. I also don't want to become a shut-in and burn out from studying all the time. 

I feel so awkward and indifferent to the shit that makes up party culture, though. I love the energy of a party, but I don't enjoy the irresponsible aspects of it.

She's one of those people who are really self-centered and have a habit of going like ""What have I done to deserve such bad treatment"" after basically ignoring their friends' existence for a long time. But every time I see her, it makes me forget about her flaws. But after she's gone, I remember all the bad things again. 

I've talked to her about it a million times, but it's usually the ""I'm sorry"" line and then the same show goes on. I'm sick of it, but I really can't lose more people. Especially if losing those people would make things really awkward in the friend group which means the world to me.

663,"No, this isn't something out of hatred. I'm on the younger end (15M) and my brother (20/almost 21M in a few weeks) has another family. By other family I mean another brother (18) and a sister (21) that I didn't know about until last week. 

So the story starts as my brother came and visited for a months until he goes back to his fiance. My mom and dad let him stay for the time being. Now he's has been gone from my life since I turned 11 as he found out about his sister and his brother. Those are his real siblings and I'm more his step sibling because of my dad, me and him have never really been on good terms ever since the start but that's expected. But I thought as he got older he matured acted respectful toward me but he acts the same, and I really don't have time to waste as I want to workout more because it's summer, do more sketches (I got into it at 13), practice football as I'm starting next semester, and help my mom tidy up around the house. He mainly sits around all day trying to get angry at me or he would do work on people's cars at our house instead of his workplace, visit his fiance at times and take me places out of irritation of my mom trying to make me his brother but I really don't see the need for it. He has his stuff to worry about and I got mine. He has more of a bond with my dad than I do because they both drink and smoke and they both have another family. I don't want to make up for lost times and neither does he, I don't even know why he visited. He also has to constantly lie to my mom that we spend time together so she can be satisfied with his stay. I want to stop it, because I can tell he's getting more mad and irritated by doing this and I feel bad that he does, I feel this the right choice. So should I cut him off or let this blow over because it's another 2months before he goes.",24May2020,1
664,"I will start this off by saying, I am 28 did not lose my v-card until 27, I've only had one real girlfriend, and the emotional turmoil that that relationship put me through is a big factor in my decision to give up on dating. Another reason I'm Giving Up on dating is online dating. I only seem to be able to match with women I don't find attractive, and I'm at least a six out of ten for whatever that's worth. But more to the point, these women that I am talking to and sometimes meeting from dating apps are people I would not want to spend time with. A lot of baggage, a large body count, or just physically unappealing in person. I guess my question is, if I were to give up on dating, how would I fight off the urges to get laid, and the occasional bouts of loneliness?

665,"This girl and I met a little over a month ago and hit it off. I will admit that I was a little surprised that someone so outgoing and positive wanted to be friends with me. I’m not exactly a social butterfly like her. I’m actually quite the opposite. 

Because of all the wrongdoings people have done to me in my lifetime (20 year old female), it’s very hard for me to trust people and open up. Most of the time, me being afraid to open up has lost me countless friends over the years. 

I haven’t had a friend since I was 13 years old and I’m afraid I’ll mess up this friendship. Yes, I’m insecure about it, and I try not to be as I’m afraid literally no matter what I do or say, I’ll end up freaking her out and scaring her away. 

She has been to my house quite a few times and I feel as if I need to go and show her that she means a lot to me. I don’t want my social anxiety and other mental health issues and insecurities get in my way from possible having fun for the first time in awhile. 

Don’t get me wrong, she’s a good friend to me and I try to be for her. She reminds me of myself when I was her age (she turns 17 today.) and I think that’s another reason I’ve taken a liking to her. I didn’t have a filter, was insecure, obnoxious, loud, etc like her, but because I can relate to her, I feel like I should show her that she can do and be better no matter what she’s going through. 

I want to go to her party but feel as if my own personal feelings about it (and myself) and possibly not going would be very selfish to her. She’s been there for me a lot this past month and so I want to be for her, especially for this special day. 

Should I suck it up and go, and be there for her? Or not go because of my own selfish reasons and lose the only friend I have because I’m scared?",24May2020,1

She's married, latina, quite figured with a big chest but she's very outgoing and active i have no doubt she attracts attention from other students and teachers. Well damn i was right, i was headed to meet up with her after school and once I'm there - i see my gym teacher grabbing my mom's ass and begins to lean on her. They begin to laugh, my mom grabs his penis from inside his shorts and my coach jumps up - he playfully pushes her off and they stay put laughing. ""What the fuck!?"" Was all i can think off, thinking my mom was a slut - she MARRIED, i couldn't move and kept my head down away from her when we rode back home that evening. 

My coach is married as well and to keep it short - i ended up following my mom for a few days after work and learned she'll meet my coach at a gas station some days which led back to a motel near by. I saw them having sex, which angered me but i didn't have the courage to step in cause it'll just be an awkward situation. I can hear them, every detail and the anger flowed much higher. I felt like crap thinking ""my mom's getting fucked by another guy and i did nothing! I betrayed my dad's trust!"" I didn't feel right. 
What made me even more angry was my coach after a few weeks, ended up ignoring her at school and treating me like shit, like he just wanted to fuck my mom a few times and never speak to her again. I even saw them arguing privately in his office and he called my mom a bitch - i wanted to step in but i didn't want to make it worse. All i heard clearly was:

My mom: ""don't act like i haven't met your wife asshole they all do here - what if she found out and we both get screwed cause of your mom!"" Just stop and we're fine, we did and that's that - let it go""

Coach: get the fuck out of here bitch! Before i bust your mouth! I already forgot, it was nothing! Nothing to me or you so leave me alone before i show you how fucking angry i can get, slut! Balloon tits! Fucking pointless bitch!"" 

My mom ran out angry and i just stood there undetected pissed the fuck off that this idiot threatened to hurt my mom and even called her a bitch. He fucked my mom and now he's like this? It pissed me off to levels i can't explain. I had to do something but couldn't think of anything. I didn't want to tell my dad even though i should've but i felt like something was holding me back. 
I did hear once or twice my coach gossiping about how my mom begged him to get her pregnant with the other coaches and that if he did he'll quit and move away as a joke. 
I ended up getting a fake number and texted my coach and straight forward said ""i know about you and (my mom's name) and saw what you told her, it you ever talk to her or touch her It'll go very wrong for you! Don't ever go up to her again!""

My coaches reply: i knew that whore would run off for help! Bitch! Tell her to not even show up at my court you prick! I know her husband so don't even push my buttons! I fucked her so what? Fuck her, i don't care - every guy has had her, why not me? Just be lucky she hasn't had her ass beat after getting pinned. Leave me alone! Don't text back!""

Days passed and my mom returned to the gym and saw her returning a diamond necklace my coach gave her. My coach said nothing, just checked out my mom and even smirked when he saw her chest cleavage. My mom says ""just leave me the fuck alone, okay!"" And the coach replies: ""fuck off, balloon tits. Just forget it""

My mom walked out and i followed her. She returned back to her classroom and acted like if nothing happened. Her room was empty so i decided to go in. I asked her if she was okay and she smiled and said everything's fine and to enjoy the rest of my day with classes. I didn't think what i said next and said - ""if you ever need anything or help, i have your back mom you know that."" Her response shocked me. She said ""oh i know you do babe, you're a good boy. you're always helping people out, whether in person......or a text.""
She smiled, winked and kissed me on the cheek.

I was shocked as i walked out of her class! Did she know i texted my coach? Did she know that i knew about the both of them? I still can't wrap my head around it and we both moved on and my coach doesn't talk to her anymore - he just stares from a distance and puts on a douchey smirks.

Now here's where i ask, do i tell my dad about all this?! Everything is back to normal and she's even happier than before! My dad knows nothing and my coach has moved on too and is acting normal. Should i keep the peace going and not tell my dad? Or should i step in and give him all the details?

678,"So, as much as I (early 20s F) hate repeating this statement, I need to because it seems to be the central thing in each of my advice posts. I have schizophrenia (diagnosed). It's pretty bad. I experience both hallucinations and delusions, not just one or the other, and a variety of negative + cognitive symptoms as well. Those are not as important to this as the first two that were mentioned, but they're moreso in this description to give you a glimpse of how impacted I am by this illness. So anyway, onto the issue.

I was in a relationship with my ex girlfriend (early 20s F) That was very toxic and borderline abusive. We split up once I discovered she was cheating on me. (Thank you Reddit, would've looked into it that far without you). The relationship went on for multiple years, so over that span of time, my mental health deteriorated more than it already had before then. I was gaslighted countless times with my illness being used against me. Any time I would speculate she was cheating or point out something suspicious, she would reply with something along the lines of, ""You might be having an episode or something,"" or ""Your illness is making you overly paranoid. Nothing is going on,"" or ""What you saw wasn't real"" and shit like that. On top of that, whenever we would argue, she would manipulate me into thinking everything was my fault when she did something terrible. And at the time I believed her. Talk about victim blaming. I was so blinded by passion that I lost myself and any sense self esteem I had left in me.

I'm now in a much healthier relationship. My current girlfriend (late 20s F) is much more caring, supportive, loyal and passionate than my ex. I love her to death. But even still, without fail, I think about what happened every day. It's not because I still have feelings for my ex. I actively hate her. I just think about the awful things that happened and the negative energy of it all haunts me. I thought I would have moved past it by now but I guess now. It's taking a toll on me.

How do I move past what happened? How to I improve my mental health? I don't know any ways to get over what happened.",24May2020,1

680,"Missing indoor cat

Hi there, my cat is 6 months old, no collar or microchip, and hasn’t been neutered (we had plans for microchip and neutering but then lockdown happened) he went missing Thursday 21st May 2020. He had never been outside as we live in the second floor of an apartment building and so we decided to get him a harness and lead to take him on walks as we had seen other owners do. He didn’t like the outside, so as we were about to bring him in, he jumped out of my girlfriends arms, broke out of his harness and ran off. We haven’t seen him since. We’ve looked everywhere we can for him, we’ve put food and water outside our apartment building, we’ve scattered some used litter outside (because our neighbours weren’t okay with the whole tray being there) we’ve also put his bed outside with his blanket so his smell is there. Also, we’ve hung used bedding outside our window to let that put some smell out. We’ve just put up posters, and I’ve told all our neighbours to keep an eye out. I’ve also put his details on as many Facebook pages as possible. I’ve phoned the vets in the area as well as the dogs and cats home. Despite doing all of this, he is still nowhere to be found. He is very shy and we’re worried he’s hiding and is going to starve or dehydrate (especially in the heat we’re having in the uk). His bowls have been empty when we wake up but that may be another cat as we have many in the area. We also have a lot of dogs in the area so scared he’ll stay away. We’ve also been advised he may be finding a female as he’s not neutered, which may take days even weeks. I was wondering if any of you had the same experiences and could offer some advice on how to get him home safely and quickly, and if not quickly, I wondered on if you think he will more than likely find home, and if so how long this will take. We haven’t had him long but he’s helped us significantly emotionally and we love him and miss him so so much, we would give anything to get him home safe. Thanks in advance",24May2020,1
681,"For those who take the time to read this, forgive me. Its a long story and a complicated situation. 

For most of my life (I'm 25) I wanted to be a professional entertainer, a magician to be more specific. And that is what I spent about 20 years doing. Learning, reading, watching all things magic. And not to toot my own horn but I got pretty good. I traveled all over the US, performed in front of huge crowds, made decent money on the side. But throughout all of that, I could never quit my day job. I wasn't famous or anything. And I certainly wasn't making enough money to support myself on performing alone. After my last big run of shows, which was about 3 years ago, I decided to take a bit of a break. Mainly because I couldn't financially keep missing work for shows. Basically I was performing a lot but the money I made just wasn't enough to justify quitting my day job and being able support myself. And now, three years later, I came to the conclusion that maybe that isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life. And especially with this COVID-19 stuff going on, who knows when life will feel normal enough again for people to want to go see live shows and be in close-quarters.

Anyways, back to my main point (I promise this is all going somewhere). 

Also in the past year my entire family has moved into the same house. So there are 8 of us along with all of our pets (5 birds, 2 dogs, and 3 cats) so we have a FULL house. 

So here I am. I'm 25, no real career path, no college degree, and a very minimal resume. And it got me thinking about what I really want to do with my life. And then it hit me. I found something that truly makes me happy. ""Making"", we are talking wood working, metal working, building, creating, designing, the whole 9 yards. So I did what every goofy 25 year old does, I watched a bunch of YouTube videos, bought a bunch of tools, stocked up my garage full of material and built a noob-ish but functional workshop. I did some basic and mediocre shop builds (workbench, shelves, etc.) and I was happy with it. 

As time when on I started to realize that the shop was getting bigger and the garage space was getting smaller. Keep in mind, I still share half of the garage with a motorcycle and typical garage storage like gardening stuff, car junk, that kind of thing. So I have to be super diligent in cleaning up all the dust and debris to protect the bike and all that. So I spend most of my time at the end of the day cleaning up. 

Which brings us to present day. Me, a complete dummy trying to learn an entire new world of a career, with minimal experience, trying to work in a shop I am out-growing very quickly, and most of my attempts to make something end in complete failure. The failure is either due to lack of knowledge/comprehension or trying to make something that is far beyond my skill level and being disappointed. All in all, its just left me feeling defeated and frustrated. The truth is, I need more space and even more knowledge. I just started a job at a lumber yard that also does custom live end tables/ custom furniture. And I really like it so far. I am hoping to learn a little from the guys there. And just when I feel like I have made an accomplishment, I look at other makers and I just get this pit in my stomach. They have these amazing shops with all these beautiful tools and all this space to ""play"" and experiment and I am stuck in a space about half the size of a sea container. 

I know what you're thinking... ""Everyone starts somewhere"" or ""Be happy with what you have dude."" And I get it. This is the definition of a third world problem. I get it. 

I want to expand. I want to learn. I want to build a big shop and create awesome stuff. And of course all these makers I see online are also big YouTube stars. Which makes me feel even worse because I have no desire to do the whole YouTube thing. I just want to build and make money doing something I enjoy. I want to buy a property with a nice big garage and do all these big things. But I just dont see it happening ever. 

Again, forgive me. This is a super complicated situation. And I have done a really bad job at explaining it all. I guess I'm just feeling really discouraged and a little stuck. What would you do?",24May2020,1
683,"My parents are divorced and my brothers parents in law are inviting him to a barbecue. However my mom has been in contact with the mother in law and has probably told bad things about him. One time at an airport the mother in law gave him a funny look and he thought it was a sign she didn't like him.

But that is not the case, and their family have invited him and me and my siblings to a barbeque that he's yet to turn down because he thinks the mother in law is still close to my mom and doesn't like him. His reasoning is that he doesn't want to go to a house where someone doesn't like him.

I really want him to go because if he doesn't, my brother will get very upset and I don't want that relationship to break. Because if it does, I'll hardly get to see him.",24May2020,1

688,"I [20M] feel.. lost right now. Through this time of quarantine with not having class + jobless (for the moment) I’ve begun to think a lot on what I’m doing.

What I do now.. it just doesn’t motivate me. I don’t really CARE about what I’m learning and really it’s just a front for success. I’m doing ministry. And please before I get yelled at - I know us Christians have made a bad wrap for ourselves and I’m nothing like our conservative part. I would even say that I’m more of a liberal Christian than conservative.

Anyways, beside the point. I just don’t think I could sustain myself in ministry. It’s hard. It’s exhausting. And I don’t care to carry those burdens on my shoulders. That’s just who I am and I’m okay with that.

I’m throwing a lot of money at school. I go to a private Bible college and honestly it’s great! Professors care about you, I’ve made some of my best friends for life there, and the school in itself all around is just good. 

I don’t want to throw money at something I’m doing now that I won’t care to do in the future. I feel like at this point I’m still going because it’s the only true community I have and I’m scared to make the wrong decision.

And now I don’t know exactly WHAT I want to do. I’ve done a lot of production stuff. Running cameras, backstage management, setting up lighting rigs for sets on a rather bigger scale. 

I don’t know if I loved it. It’s the only thing I know what to do.

I’ve been looking towards transferring to Northern Arizona University and maybe pursuing photography. I know nothing about photography. I don’t even have a camera. But there’s an itching side of me that’s saying “do it.” 

Here are my concerns.

1.) What if I’m not good at it? What if I hate it? How can I be sure that this IS what I want to do? What if I just waste my time and more importantly - my money?

2.) I’ll be separated from all my friends. I’ll have to jump into a new community and I’m not exactly great at that. I have such a fantastic community back at school. I don’t want to let go.

3.) If I do this then I’m just about on my own. I mean I’ve been self supportive since I left for college. My parents don’t have a lot of money. 

4.) I’m scared to take a risk. No matter what the next step is, I’m afraid to take it.

So strangers of Reddit. I’m just trying to talk it out and see what other people have to say because I don’t know what to do. Thoughts?",24May2020,1
689,"I bought an apartment literally across the street from my family. All my life, since they adopted me at 14, my parents have relied on me to do a lot of the housework and an excessive amount of babysitting because my adoptive mother and two sisters are physically disabled and wheelchair bound. My brothers were never given the same expectations, largely because I am the eldest daughter in a Latino house. 

When COVID hit NYC, my family went on lockdown at the start of March. They are taking all precautions:  nobody but my father is going to work, we are not allowed to leave the house, we cannot go on walks or take our dogs out on walks, either. No running, no biking, no going out unless it's to the supermarket once a week. I haven't seen anyone (including my girlfriend), even at a 6ft distance, in three months. 

I feel the strain has worn me down. My parents are mistreating me and talking down to me. I never go to sleep before 2AM because I'm cleaning. I get up every day to help my four sisters with remote learning from 8AM-2:30AM. I'm exhausted, stressed, and I feel attacked on a daily basis. I want to move across the street, but I feel my family will condemn me for it. They feel they need me now more than ever, but I feel I'm falling apart. I can't go a single day without crying or having an anxiety attack. The only problem is ... I depend on a few hundred I get from working as my mother's home aid (in addition to the significantly more money I make at my actual job) and I'm afraid that if I leave, they will no longer help me financially. What should I do?  


TL;DR My family is overworking me and taking intense measures during lockdown. I want to move into my apartment for my own wellness, but I'm afraid they'll condemn and resent me.",24May2020,1

693,"I just had my yearly evaluation with my boss last week. She gave me a 5/5 as an overall score and told me that I was her best employee, super dependable, that i am getting a raise, and that she will do whatever it takes to make sure I remain on the team because she values me. After this evaluation, I informed her that I had plans to move to a different state in July, but proposed a detailed work-from-home plan, outlining what my job will look like remotely. Mind you, I’ve already been working from home since March due to COVID-19, and the feedback she has given me indicates that she has found no issues with my remote work performance. When we have been in the office, someone comes to my actual office maybe once a day to chat. No one ever comes in for business purposes. Also, I work in digital communication, so 99% of my job can be done remotely. In my plan, I detailed how I would make up for the 1%. 

After proposing this plan, she immediately shut down and got dismissive. I got a tip from one of my coworkers that my boss is going to put up a job opening for my position. I feel like it’s unfair that she said all of those things in my evaluation and then immediately decided to not keep me even though the only difference is my physical location.

694,"My cat has been causing so many problems recently. She is 2 years old and spayed. I've had her since she was 4/6 weeks old, she was abandoned and left outside to die. She gets regular vet visits and there is nothing wrong physically with her. 

A while ago at my parents house she started refusing the litter box, peeing and pooping where ever. The vet put her on an antidepressants. However I cant get her to take them. I have tried every trick in the book. If she swallows it, she waits a minute and throws it back up. 

We thought it might've been territorial as she hates the dogs. So I took her to my boyfriend's house where there are no dogs and no stray cats outside. She also has 4 litter boxes and 3 different types of litter to choose from. It went great for a while. However she has started doing it again even at his house. Her litter boxes can be perfectly clean and she will refuse them. I have done everything in my power to fix this problem. This is it. 

My only options at this point are 1. take her to a family members farm and have her be a barn cat, but she was never raised around other cats or outside and will surely die out there. 2. Surrender her to a shelter where they will probably put her down as she is very aggressive and a shy cat. 3. Rehome her to someone else where the problem will continue and they will do who knows what to her. Or 4. Just put her down. 

I am extremely distraught over this. This cat kept me from killing myself and I dont even know how to save her and my vet is at a loss too. I cant have her peeing and pooping everywhere all the time. I just dont know what to do anymore.

I dreamt about her, the girl I like, who went to another school now, I dremt that I was finally good enough for her and she liked me back. And I woke up, it felt so real, and then, and then I just felt empty.

There was this friend that got me through dark times, and I don't know if I would of made it without him. Then one day, he just started ignore me. I blame myself everyday. I want to change, so it won't happen again. 

He talked to me last night, with the same old friendly tone he would use. He said he was sorry. I tried pretending that I didn't care, but eventually, he got to me and I forgave him and we went on chattering just like we used to. And then I woke up, and I just, I just can't do this anymore. 

I dreamt about my old friends, I dreamt about them cheering for me, welcoming me back to my home. I remain sceptical, because I knew they would never do that. And I had never been so correct, I awoke again.

Besides telling her I was always there to talk to, I pointed her to a social work organization I knew about, so she also has been talking to them.

I had sent an application on may 7th and just recieves a call half an hour back. The interviewer was a young woman, supposedly in her 20s. Now I could sense some kind of anger and rudeness in her voice from the second she started speaking.

She asked me a few questions but wouldn't even let me speak.. trying to mimic my voice and acting all sarcastic. It was for a movie based website and I was supposed to act in the capacity of a campus ambassador. She asked me how many registrations I could bring her. I wanted to he honest and told her that I'm not going to give her a crazy and unrealistic number because this is the first time I'm treading into this and would get her 10, as I thought it was the screening process. She said she didnt care if I was a newcomer or not and asked me to promise that I HAVE to get 10 registrations. I was not confident about that so asked her if I was being screened or selected. Surely each would elicit a different response.

She was not sure about that and said both so I questioned furthers as to how she could do both simultaneously. She got seriously pissed and told me that I cannot tell her to do her own job. Seriously? Even asking questions isn't allowed ? She proceeded to act even more rudely than before , not even letting me speak and commented on how my ""attitude wouldn't set me back in the professional world""  I asked her not to take it personally as I'm simply asking the questions because the job pertains to me and how I perform.

706,"Hello Reddit, I've recently made an oopsie, a big oopsie. I've been talking to this girl for almost a year now and we've gotten pretty close, I like her a lot actually, I thought she liked me too, though, I've been unsure lately. Anyway, a week ago, I got into my own head, I usually consider myself a pretty logical person and on those days when I'm feeling insecure, my logic usually keeps me in check, but on this night, logic was non-existent and my insecurity was in overdrive. You see, it usually takes a while for her to get back to me, I'm talking 2-3 weeks at a time. The reason it takes her so long is because:

&amp;#x200B;

1. She's bad at messaging people back (her words).
2. She's been really busy with college (which I've been completely understanding of, especially during this time).

&amp;#x200B;

With that being said, I was on week 3 of no response from her and my insecurity was going through the roof (it had been for about a week). I kept having thoughts like ""Maybe she just isn't into me"", ""Maybe I'm just wasting my time"", ""I think I misjudged our relationship"", etc. I was already feeling down (for other reasons) and dealing with all of those thoughts didn't help, so in a moment of impulsive, I just thought ""fuck everything"" and proceeded to delete my Instagram. Essentially ghosting her.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a week and I tried justifying my decision, but I just can't. She didn't deserve that and I feel like shit for doing that. I want to apologize and talk to her again, but I feel like I may have already burned that bridge. 😞😞😞

707,"I have a friend who is 1 year younger than me. We’ve been around each other since her birth, (our moms were high school buddies- unfortunately they cut ties) but we became really close around the time I was 11. I’m 22 now and we used to talk all the time, at least a few times a day whether calling, FaceTiming or just texting. We do live in different states, but that has never* caused an issue in our friendship. We always found ways to talk and bond. The issue between our moms didn’t hurt our friendship either. We were always very transparent about it, as this happened around the time I was 14. 

I saw her last year, she flaked on the birthday hotel stay I planned for her. I asked her to take the days off of work, after she agreed to the plan. Then she didn’t respond for weeks when I asked if she was still coming. I even added, each time, how it was okay to say no. I didn’t know until a week before, when I could no longer cancel the reservation, that she forgot to take the days off and couldn’t come. So we made a different, (imo) easier plan. We had dinner. Then she suggested we get together just to hang and watch a movie later in the week and she flaked on that as well. 

I’ve confronted her about this before, and each time she says that she’s going through something. That’s fine. I can’t argue with that, I want the best for her. But it always feels like this “something” that she is going through, is how to make it clear that we are no longer friends. 

Basically, the climate of our relationship is that, whenever she wants to talk about something, I’m there. She only holds conversation with me when it’s something she’s interested in. Ex. Bands, movies she likes. Or if she just needs to vent/talk. I try to make these conversations last because I love and appreciate her. When I text her to talk or vent, or even just to say “hey miss you. Hope you’re good” radio silence. 

This relationship feels very one sided, and I’m having trouble accepting that we are probably no longer friends. I mean, this was a girl who, years ago, we agreed she would be my maid of honor if I ever got married. Now, when I’ve found the guy I want to spend my life with, I don’t know if I even want her at the wedding. 

I’ve considered just being on the back burner. I still have connections with her online, but I don’t go to her to talk- we’d only talk if she approaches me first. But that isn’t beneficial to me, and hurts more than it helps. I don’t want to be her last choice when I would bend over backwards for her. 

So reddit, I need some advice. Should I confront her once more about this? Should I not? If so, what do I say that is constructive and also not accusatory? Am I overthinking and blowing this way out of proportion? I’m just thinking about all the things I’ve done that could have caused this rift... 

If you’ve read all of this, I really appreciate it. I know it was a long post, I just feel there is a lot of context to explain why I am so confused... 

TL;DR I have no clue why my friend and I are no longer friends. How do I talk to her about this?",24May2020,1

Moved around roughly every 7-8 months growing up. Did live in one city for about two years but that was it until the middle of high school when we moved in with a new stepfamily. Could never hold a job long enough for it to matter before moving again, and when I had the chance I wouldn't be qualified enough. Eventually I stopped trying in school, work, and life in general. The things I enjoy are constantly belittled, with comments like ""how does this make anyone happy"" or ""it's YOUR fault you're depressed because of \*insert thing i genuinely enjoy\*"". When I got into TWO top-ten universities worldwide, I was told ""That's not Ivy League."" 

&amp;#x200B;

  
So today I'm typing this while everyone is at the lake. I have $43, one semester of college education (I quit because once again, it wasn't enough), very few friends, and nowhere to go.  


  


If anybody has any words of wisdom to give to a young man trying to look for another way, they're all greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long-ish post. I had a lot more to say and trimmed about 70% of it because it didn't feel relevant to the sub.  


Love you guys.",24May2020,1
711,"There's so much I want to learn at the moment with so much free time. But I always find it a task to pay attention or focus on what's in front of me as I don't find it interesting enough (atleast not immediately). As a result, I leave it and move on to something else and I find myself not really being able to pay attention to the things I actually need to get done. This also applies to when conversing with people, watching movies, reading books or learning any new skill.

I went to college for a year with no idea what I wanted to do, no ambition, and no drive to do well. screwed it up, and got kicked out for academic reasons , came home and spent the summer trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. Decided I wanted to be an Airplane Mechanic (A&amp;P) and get payed a decent amount of money doing something I thought at the time was interesting, and still do somewhat. 

Now I've been going to this trade school for a little over a year, and I'm having second thoughts, part of me really wants to go back to college, I'm worried that I won't enjoy my job and the work life balance that comes along with it, and it won't really be fulfilling for me, the pay will be good, but that's not really what I want out of life. The main issue is I'm pretty massively in debt already, and I'm still living with my parents, I have no idea how they would react to me saying I've had a change of heart, especially with how things went before and how well things are going now. And on top of all of that the reason I wanted trade school is because it guarantees me a job when I'm done which can actually pay off my debt, where as a degree doesn't really mean anything for sure, and the job I want isn't necessarily the best paying.

722,"sorry for any grammar mistakes :( 

about me:
so i’m a chinese girl (17) living in the UK, and racism is a general thing for me tbh. especially during the covid-19 outbreak, i’ve been dealing with a lot of racist comments toward me especially about my eyes. my eyes are quite slanted so majority of the racial slurs are about my eye shape. 
every time i meet someone new (mainly white- sorry no offence but 100% of my racist experiences are from white people) i get quite anxious and nervous whether they’re going to aim some racist comment about me. this makes it kinda hard for me to make new friends with white people, that’s why about 89% of my friends are POC. 
 

back story:
when i started college (i’m not sure what grade that is for international folks) i met Bitchface (not his real name btw). 
side note: he’s white (not sure if that makes any difference)
originally he was a really nice and down to earth person who loved to joke around.
i had my weird suspicions about him like i normally do but they quickly went because his humour was absolute gold; which is what really made me trust him. we had a lot good memories. most of them were when we (us and our group of friends) would go out into the city and eat food and go to each other’s houses ect. this went on for about like 5 months of us being good friends and what not. however, during these 5 months he said some controversial things that are a bit derogatory. for example: he would say some white dominant male shit about women being objects, which i would call him out for,  but he’ll laugh it off like “lmaoooooo, guys chill. i’m joking”. 
so i thought, fair enough, whatever.

BUT THEN...
wait- let me just set the story.

the real story: 
so i was on facetime with him and a bunch of our friends and we were all being weird and messing about like everyone does on ft. 
but then, when i’m pissing myself laughing, bitch face dares to say “i can’t see your eyes. they’re so chin*ky”. the call went silent AND I IMMEDIATELY STARED AT HIM DEAD IN THE EYE. 
this mf had the nerve to say CH*INKY. even i don’t have the guts to say that shit. i felt so disgusted yet so hurt and betrayed by him. like that is just completely out of order. i thought we were good friends. 4am deep convos type of friendship. i was confused, hurt, angry at the same time. i just wanna know why he would even say that. 
i replied with, “um. that’s not cool? that’s racist why would u even say that?” to which my friends backed me up, demanding at him to apologise. 
at the time he was laughing asking “what did i do?????” i was so furious that i ended the call and called my friend (who was also on the call) to talk about wtf just happened. 
we both decided not to talk to him ever again, or at least until he apologises and reflects on what he did.
i really didn’t expect him to be this kind of person and like i’ve been saying, i was really hurt by what he said. 
he didn’t even message me or call me to check if i was ok then.

the next morning: 
i had 4 facetime missed calls from him and a paragraph on imessage. i leave my phone on silent and on my desk to charge when i’m asleep so i didn’t pick up. i can’t really remember much of what the paragraph said, but it was along the lines of “hey, i’m really sorry, what i did was horrible and disgusting and i’m disgusted in my self and i would never ever want to purposely hurt you.” and then something like “please accept my apology, i feel so guilty, you’re one of my best friends and i can’t lose you, i’m so stupid and dumb and an idiot” blah blah blah. 
at that time, since we’ve developed such a strong bond, i didn’t want to lose him. (i know i’m stupid, i regret not telling him to fuck off) 
i forgave him and told him what he said was fucking outrageous. i wanted him to never do that again or i’ll literally ghost him.
(how ironic.) 

things all seemed good right? well WRONG. 
he ghosted ME INSTEAD. he didn’t even reply to my message, didn’t even talk to me. instead, unfollowed me on social media ect. i was just so confused????!!!!!!!!!!???!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?????????!????. 

wtf?

i mean, it’s a bit dramatic. 

i thought everything would be back to normal, so why’d he block me? 

i was determined to speak to him when we go back to college on monday and interrogate him. but when i went he blanked me. and every time i would try to speak to me he’ll ignore and ghost me. wtf? 
it’s been 3 weeks and im not sure what to do. i really hate conflict and unresolved issues. i’m not the type of girl to be involved in drama and i try to avoid it as much as possible. 
i am a worry bot, so any problems i face with, i dwell on it and it really affects me a lot. i don’t know how not to think about it. 

i want to resolve this so i can stop worrying about it.

730,"So i [23f] posted earlier about my problems and noticed a lot of replies regarding my mother.
She has always been different to other mothers i have noticed. She shouts a lot more and argues a hell of a lot more too.
So in a typical day she would also drink what i would regard as a lot, everyday without fail she will consume a gin and tonic at 4pm, a wine with dinner at 5, another glass at the end of dinner, a sherry and possibly a port. When she does drink she gets a little roudy but who doesn't? I am also aware she is from a generation which she uses as an excuse for drinking so much. She does claim she drinks when she is sad and that it is okay and doesn't see a problem. When i want a fag cause i am having a tough time, it is completely different though. 
Since being small she would be fairly erratic. One of my early memories was of her one christmas packing a bag and leaving my dad, unsure why, and we got in the car drove and found her. Picked her up and then went to a family dinner. I found that odd.
She doesn't have friends but that is my fault. So not sure it is too relevant. She has a hard time trusting people. Again partly my fault.
She is a good mother, don't get me wrong she is kind but it always seems to be for herself. When she is with other people she is almost unrecognisable. I find it uncomfortable sometimes. She will often lie about things she is doing or what my sister and i are up to, i think in an attempt to make her life seem better than she thinks it is. 
My father had told me about when she was younger she had anotexia and bits. She claims she used to eat one bowl of cereal a day at one point for years. It kind if makes sense as i am 5 ft 5 and weight about 10stone 6 pounds which is a little large but i am working on that. I have been bullied by her for years, for as long as i can remember about my weight and constantly forcing me to eat less, even now at age 23.
She often doesn't believe me and yes i did used to lie a lot, but she also has to know things which aren't her business. She will sometimes snoop through my room and try and find things to bring up dirt on me. She makes out like she was in my room putting something away and found it on the floor or something. She and i both know that just wasn't the case. It was hidden.
She has beaten me as a child for years and now we just don't talk about it. It was so bad i tried to kill myself a few times. She's made me sleep outside in the cold garden on a bench a few times. 
She gets so angry and screams and shouts and slams doors. She is scary sometimes, she jumps to conclusions and never seems to have a justified reason why she flies off the handle. Its bad. It is really bad. 
I know that her mum wasn't always the nicest and was quite cold. Unsure if she learnt that from her. When i visited her she was warm to me but i guess that could have been in her old age making up for the mistakes she made with her own child.
She won't let anyone do anything, i came home from uni and she won't let me do my own washing, clean my own room or bathroom or anything. She knows how she wants it done and she is the only one who can do it.
I love her and no matter how many times she puts me down or hurts me or whatever else, i will never abandon her. I know if i did she would hurt herself.

735,"My (20f) sister (18f) moved into my flat 3 weeks ago and since then I have noticed she orders food delivery almost every single day, usually just once a day. With delivery and tip, I would estimate each delivery is at the very least $18. She has always been a frivolous spender, ie. owning 20+ pairs of shoes, drawers full of high-end lingerie, and changes outfits 3-4 times a day, having only done laundry once in 3 weeks here. Our father enables the spending because he feels guilty about having been a neglectful parent, but I just don't understand how spending $20 a day on food alone can be sustainable. Our parents are comfortably wealthy but not so much that that amount of money is just a drop in the bucket. I have been trying to encourage her to eat healthier and cheaper, like keeping the pantry stocked with an assortment of foods like fresh baked goods, fruits and veg, eggs, pasta, etc. I ask if she wants whatever I will be cooking for dinner, or if I can get her anything from the store, or if she wants to go for a walk with me. Sometimes I will offer her a multivitamin if I'm taking one and she's in the kitchen with me, but she usually says no. She also eats a lot of chocolates and candies and is overweight. 

&amp;#x200B;

She's under a lot of stress right now, taking a couple online classes that are difficult to begin with- and for the spring semester, the classes are obviously condensed into a much shorter time period. A few times she has expressed wanting to eat healthier and to stop ordering so much food, but I don't know if that warrants me reaching out to her, and if so, how to approach the topic. I absolutely do not want to make her feel uncomfortable or embarrassed. We were both emotional eaters growing up and food was always a touchy subject. However, I feel really strongly that we should be saving money right now because the pandemic will affect the economy and job market for who knows how long, and also that we should be keeping healthy and giving our immune systems the best chance possible to fight off the virus should one of us get infected.

737,"Anxiety Over Being Pregnant Despite Being A Virgin

Despite never having sex I have found myself terrified I was pregnant nearly this entire lockdown. Couple days before lockdown started I was with my boyfriend being teenagers stuff happened, he fingered me and I gave him a hand job. All was good until I got super anxious his cum somehow made contact with my vagina, like he washed his hands but I did touch myself after so had no idea if I had any on my fingers.

I tried not to panic as my period was due to start the day before I had seen him but had not so logically I knew it was highly unlikely I was ovulating and odds are nothing actually made contact but three days later I still hadn’t got my period and was shitting it. So went and got Morning After Pill (The one that can be used within three days) and had the expected spell of bleeding after using it. Felt good after that till started googling and finding out this initial spell if bleeding does not mean your not pregnant so I resume feeling horrible. Within the month I got ill (had eaten out of date food by accident) and had a lot of symptoms of pregnancy nausea, stomach cramps, etc. Also had not been wearing bra due to lockdown do my breast ended up feeling very tender. At this point I was completely convinced I was pregnant and felt terrible for this entire spell. Eventually I got better from this sickness and managed to convince myself I might not be then eventually got my second period afterwards which was the final piece of reassurance I need.

Though now about halfway in between my last period and my next one I started feeling nauseous again (this time I think it is due to only eating junk in lockdown and not having a proper meal for several days). Then the nauseous feeling makes me anxious which makes me more nauseous. Then I keep seeing TikToks of teen moms claiming they got their period whilst pregnant and despite literally all my research saying this is not possible (bleeding whilst pregnant is possible but an actual period, it is not regular and periodic like I had as my second period occurred as expected time for normal length) it is still making me very paranoid. I am too terrified to take a pregnancy test to even reassure myself cause I know I am not pregnant but what if I get a false positive which would terrify me even more of my parents find out which would be a disaster.

The thing is it is making me so anxious that I can’t be logical. I am worried when me and my boyfriend actually start having sex I will not be able to enjoy it due to these fears and anxieties, despite us planning to double protection (him using condoms and I have research extensively deciding the contraceptive patch would be best for me).

I am a 20 yo stucked at my parent's house. I am studying for the competitive exam of my life for med school in twenty three day. Thank To COVID it has been delayed by 2 month. 

I am studying 8 to 10 hours a day with a lot of stress. 
My parents and my dad specially watch the TV very very loud. My bedroom wall is against the tv's speakers... 

My dad is so mad when I tell him to put his headphone or to put the volume low. He is really... just mad. And if I say or my mom a wrong things the dinner is very very hard he will be critizing everything, being mean...
He takes a lot of medicine and he is partially deaf. He doesn't want to recognize it and doesn't want any help on it. He is in sick leave because of chronic disease. So it's not his fault.

 It's even make my mom cries sometimes. 

They say : stop complaining you have your Bose's headphones just put music. But I am tired of wearing it 24/24, and tired of having music full volume, I need to put really noisy music in order to do not hear them. My tinitus is really not getting better also... But it's too late I guess. I can't use Quies because I hear my tinitus if I do. 


""This is my house not yours. This is not yours house! I do what I want in my house! You can just go if you re not okay with it. This is my home you have no right here. "" don't stay here.""

If I say something they would also say I should go to my student's studios they are loaning. But it's 15 m2 and I can't go out without a mask on. My parents live in the countryside...

My final sprint of 2 years of constant studying is coming. My stress is like 110% all the time, I want to cry for nothing all the time.  I have lost all of my friends. 

I am afraid to take free times because my parents would put high sounds on if I do ""you re not even studying dont complain"". 

My parents are arguing for nothing and it's hard for me to support it so I need to watch out what I say. 

I love them. But I left house at 15 yo because I hate them if I stay too long. They're my family and the only people that still love me right now. But it's just hard specially with my exam.

Should I go back in my studio? They are putting a lot of pressure on me with the loan... I couldn't work to pay it last summer because of burn out and my grand father's death. I need 1hours of biking a day on my home trainer in order do not crack under stress. How hard is it to run with a mask on? 

How can I tell my parents I need calm? My dad is always watching extremely violent movies with raping scene, torture and explosion... 
How to make them understand that I have tinitus? That it's dangerous to have full volume all the times in my ear?

746,"Hello! I want some advice regarding writing a letter to an ex I've been togheter for 2 years. We broke up 4 years ago on very bad terms but since the ending of last year we began talking again ( casually, no intention of getting back together).

While messaging last week he told me about a letter I gave him while togheter. I was very surprised that he still keeps it, and he told me that it means a lot to him, it being one of the nicest things he ever received. 

The things is that I care a lot about him. I really love him but I respect the fact that he doesn't feel the same. He is very nice to me and still cares about me but wants to pursue a relationship with another girl in the future. And I respect and understand that.

Getting to know that he appreciated the letter so much made me think to write him another one. We will both leave our hometown in some months, but we're going in different cities, so I thought of giving it to him before leaving. 

The problem is that I don't know what things should I write him. I don't want to write negative things like frustrations from our past relationship, but neither I want to tell him obsessively about my feelings for him. 

I want to tell him some nice positive things that don't have anything to do with my feelings but I'm not really sure what should I more precisely write about.

That being said, for whatever reason I can't bring myself to do anything. I get anxiety about apply anywhere, and I need to take the GRE, but I also need to get a job since I cannot stay home all day everyday not doing anything. But due to the pandemic, not many places are hiring and applying to jobs just makes me feel useless since more often then not I just get rejection emails all the time. It's really disheartening, even though I know getting rejected isn't that big of a deal. I went to therapy while in school because it was free and now that I've graduated I need to find another therapist. I have the resources from that, but because I don't have a job idk how I can pay for it. I talk to a family member about this to and while they give good advice, I can't help but just feel down because I know that they're right but I also feel like because I'm not progressing at the speed they want me to be that they feel like there's no point. They tell me that I need to stop worrying about other people (Im constantly trying to make up for what others do and end up missing out on having fun and just doing things that a normal 21 year old should do) and being the ""mom friend"" for validation from others and essentially choose to focus on myself.

From the time I saw him I was in love.
Now our relationship is boring. He does work a lot and when he comes home he wants to relax which I totally understand but we never ever do anything with each other like ever. When I want to do things with him he always says no and I do it by myself or go with friends.

The apartment has more space and is located in a great neighborhood. Although I am excited for the move, I can’t help but feel regret because up until a few months ago, I was planning to move to Philadelphia at this time. Because of COVID, I decided to postpone due to the fact I wouldn’t be able to really go anywhere and meet new people “normally.” I genuinely feel that was a smart decision.

My new lease runs through the next 15 months, and while I know that isn’t a super long time in the grand scheme of things, I’m feeling a strong sense of sadness I have to wait to make the move. A few friends have mentioned one of the beauties of leasing is you are almost always able to sublet and/or break it, meaning if I find myself in a position where I’m depressed or continue feeling that “pull” towards Philly, I could move if I really want to. This has helped me feel better.

I think what is contributing to the sadness is the fact I assumed many other people would not really move (especially to a new city) for quite some time, but I am increasingly hearing of other people moving elsewhere. In fact, a friend of mine is actually moving to Philly in July! The combination of these two things makes me question whether or not I am making the right choice.

Is this a situation where I force myself to stick out the new lease, and look forward to the move in August of next year? Do I give the new place a chance and if I continue feeling this way, try to break the lease in maybe 3-6 months or so? Any advice is appreciated!",24May2020,1

My reasons are:
1) I don't enjoy the genre that we play anymore, so I feel I am not motivated to play.

2) Despite a history of 5 years and 2 albums, we have never been able to play a gig. One of the key members is too busy with his job and not available to play gig. However this is not even a problem for him. I just don't want to be in ""internet/bedroom"" band. 

So I decided to give all my energy to other band. I have a lot of opportunities with them.

But there's a big problem for me:
We're about to start a new album recording with the band that I intend to quit. On the other hand, I know I can't get my money and time's worth. I also won't enjoy a lot.

They also exposed my Instagram. For context, that video was nearly two years ago and it was a night where I had been drugged at a party, I remember going there with 0 intention of drinking because I was newly put on medication for adhd, I was also 14 so I shouldn’t have been drinking anyways. I was later hospitalised after this night due to being spiked. I have no memory of the night whatsoever, my friends didn’t realise I had been drugged and they said some people were pressuring me into making stupid videos for their entertainment. I also have autism, I can easily be manipulated and taken advantage of, especially if I was drugged. The girl posted the video on her Instagram story over a year ago, it was me next to an African statue saying the n word, I never saw this video so I was shocked when I saw it on Twitter.  I would never have let her keep it up if I knew about it. I haven’t spoken to this girl in over a year now, I’ve had her blocked off everything because of how insensitive and rude she was. She would bully me for my autism whenever she felt like taking her anger out on somebody. I don’t know why she still had posts of us on her Instagram, we were only friends for a few months and I only became friends with her because I felt bad about the fact her old friends were picking on her. My grandfather is also black, however I don’t feel like I’m entitled to having an n word pass which is why I don’t say it, I do look fully white when I straighten my hair and don’t get any sun.

I’ve upset so many people who don’t know what truly happened. I do acknowledge that it is my fault, and I do feel insane amounts of guilt for this, but I have no way of apologising or being able to explain myself.

758,"False accusation of rape and betrayal. I want to end it.

Hello guys, 

So, let me tell you my story. I’m a college student in Europe and I’m 20. I had the chance to get accepted into one of the best uni in the world and My first year there was really cool. I used to be an antisocial back in HS and the fact that I could make so many good friends in this short timespan really helped me mentally.

But now let’s talk about the heart of my issue : women. Growing up I never had an intimate relationship with women, I only started to get affection around the end of high school and the beginning of college so I had to learn a lot in a very tight time frame. My problems began last year : I was in an on and off relationship with a girl from my school and we hadn’t had sex in a few months so one night I hit her up to know if she wanted me to come over. She told me that she was at a party but that I could come when it was over. So I stayed at a friend’s place and I waited. She texted me again around 1am to tell me to come so I borrowed my friend’s bike and I came to the residence where she lived (we lived in the same residence at the time). I knocked on her door she told me to come in, but when I opened the door the room was pitch black. I only saw her figure sitting on her bed. The first thing that I asked was « Are you drunk ? » (I’m black, and I didn’t want no trouble) and she told me no. So we started to have sex. But I noticed an odd smell coming from her and her behaviour was really weird so I stopped bc I noticed that she was really drunk. She asked what I was doing. I said that I was done with her and that I won’t be bothering her anymore. She asked me to stay but I refused. I went back to my friend’s place and I slept there. The next day, she texted me and asked what happened bc she « could not remember anything », so I told her that we had sex, that she lied to me about drinking and that I left bc of that. 

Fast forward to the next semester, some rumours started going around saying that I sexually harassed and attacked multiple girls. Some of my ex-gf confronted me about it but I explained everything and they believed me, I think. But when I came back from winter break, I received a letter from my school saying that the girl from that night said that I raped her. I’m currently in a legal battle with my uni bc they suspended my scolarship.  Because of this, I lost all of my friends in uni and I feel really alone now.!It is really hard mentally for me bc the school was everything that I dreamt of and I really feel like I’m gonna lose, even though I have tons of evidence to back me up.

The second story came out yesterday. I was talking for about a year to a girl from my home country, and I really liked her. I thought that she liked me too bc she said that she caught feelings for me but we couldn’t see each other again bc the flights are very expensive, I can only go home once a year, during summer. Because of COVID-19, most of my friends went back home but I stayed bc I had an internship. I just finished my internship and I’m going back home in 2 weeks but yesterday one of my best friends called me and told me that he made out with her and that she told him that I made up everything that she told me. 

I’m really starting to lose my mind, I can’t even think straight anymore. Sorry for the long story, I’m looking for you guys advices",24May2020,1
759,"So I think that every relation to a man is sexual.
I just came out of an abusive relationship of 5 years and I had one other abusive one before that. They all made me think every time I talked/hung out or even looked at a guy it was sexual. I even dropped my guy friends bc of it.

I got out of that relationship and now I’m single for a couple months now, I’ve been working on self-awareness for years now. I’ve been hanging out with tons of new people and groups of friends, every time one of the girls boyfriends I’m hanging out with talks to me i feel like he likes me or the GF is getting jealous. I not only feel it in my mind but my body has a lot of anxiety as well.  Even though the group of guys and girls I’m hanging out with don’t think like that at all, they even hangout with each other regardless if their SO is there or not. 

Also at a young age I learned one family member sexually assaulted another in my family and I was always warned about it, so I can’t even get “to close” to my own family members without feeling like it’s in that way.

My parents are immigrants and they both have their own deep issues with parental death, trauma, depression, etc. However like most immigrant parents, they don't address, they repress. I am certain my mother never properly coped with the death of her father at a young age and thus has been focusing her life on physical health to the point of insanity. She herself is very conscious on her weight, I remember multiple instances throughout my childhood, her asking me if ""mommy is fat"" or making remarks on her normal protruding stomach. She applied this on the family as well. There is no ""junk food"" in our house, I was never allowed chocolate, soda, fast food, candy. My only salvation was my friend's houses and school. This seems fairly normal and a somewhat healthy way to live but starting middle school, my mom became more obsessed, she would barely consume 1000 calories a day, eating almonds and only having dinner for a full meal. She would berate me, comment on my weight, smack my stomach and call me names. Not only this, but my extended family and other people in my culture started making comments at me. I was 134lbs, and 5'3, not entirely abnormal for a middle schooler. I will cut it short to say that my weight has been a huge issue for my mother. Nowadays, I feel suffocated. I'm underage and living with my parents. Every single day, multiple times a day, my family will tell me to go exercise and if I don't do it for long enough, it doesn't count to them. Everything I eat is watched, I can't put anything on my plate without getting looks from my mom. I feel paranoid and I probably am but I'm being pushed to a point. I've been in the hospital for starving myself and getting horrible gas pains, I was finally diagnosed with depression and anxiety last year because I finally started to talk to people about how I felt. My mother being controlling over what I eat is a small portion of my problems but its pushing me towards an eating disorder. I'm obsessive with food now. I hoard it, I fantasize about it. Whenever I address my feelings to my mother, she shuts me down and says I'm the one who's making it into a big deal, essentially making me believe that I am. Whoever I speak to, my therapist, my doctor and my teachers only believe my mom. I'm stuck.

766,"Hello,

I am a 24 Asian male living/working in the Bay Area after graduating with a business degree in 2018. In a nutshell, I would describe myself as borderline depressed, lonely, unsociable, and suffering from an inferiority complex.


My home life is currently a little complicated. While I am lucky to be living rent free with my family, I would not say my relationship with them is very constructive. The household current consists of my parents, my older sister, her husband, my aunt, and myself. My parents are your typical Asian parents --- loving, but also controlling.  They keep pushing what they think is best for me (MBA; however I don't believe it's worth the cost as I think it's better to accumulate experience at this point of my career). Currently, I can't even have a conversation with them, because all they do is lecture me. They keep comparing me to my sister who ""listens"" and makes $200,000 a year despite being 30+ and living at home. My sister absolutely loves this and takes every chance to suck up to them and say poor things about me. I've tried voicing my feelings, but they have fallen on deaf ears (traditional Asian households don't believe in depression; they tell me to brush it off and/or blame me for my problems). At this point, I stay in my room and avoid talking to them as much as possible (which I know is not healthy but I don't know what to do).


To make things worse, my social life hasn't been going very well either. In college, I focused on my studies and I didn't make any close friends. I still catch up with my friends from high school, but it's been hard relating to them like I used to. As a result, my social skills have fallen behind that of my peers. I've tried meet new people through meetup.com and bumbleBFF, but finding lonely like-minded people my age has proven to be difficult. It doesn't help that I have terrible self esteem and an inferiority complex. I feel like I'm not fun to be around and very basic; most conversations I have  usually revolve around food, travel, and gym but don't get any further than that. 

As a result, I've become borderline depressed and have no passion in life. I really want to move out, but I don't think it's worth paying the additional 1.5k+ a month to be alone. Honestly, I've grown tired of the Bay Area and want to leave but I just started a new job working as a contractor at Google as an Analyst (I think this is a great experience and want to see where this takes me). My current plan is to suck it up for the next year and see where things go. I'm a bit conflicted with the thought of leaving the Bay Area because of the amount of opportunities here, but I feel like there's nothing left for me to explore and that the high cost of living is not worth it. 

Thank you for reading my rant, I'd love any advice on coping strategies, ways to find inspiration, making friends, or places to move (I'm thinking Sacramento).

TL;DR

I'm a depressed baby living with no direction, any advice is appreciated.",24May2020,1

What's more toxic is that she does those things too and when I mention it to her she gets even more pissed and it leads to a break up every time. Eventually, she'd come back and say sorry. That's the time that I would open up about growing up in our relationship because she is a bit immature for her age but at the same time, I understand because i'm her first BF.

And if I open up about her ""change"" she would just ask questions like ""If you truly love me why do I have to change and why couldn't you accept me the way I am?"". This problem has been around for a year more or less.  I want a mature relationship with her because she's the woman I want to marry in the future but, I can't let this attitude of her stay. 

I'm confused. Am I doing things right or am I being selfish? Do I love her enough or do I really need to accept her behavior to prove my love for her?",24May2020,1

Essentially it's a 2014 stick shift with 35k miles or a 2019 automatic with 800 miles.

770,"My SO’s sister has a large dog (german shepherd mix) that she brings with her to every family event. I was not initially afraid of the dog (this is only the 3rd or 4th time meeting it) but one morning last week I was in the living room alone when the dog entered the room. I called it to me and after hesitating a moment it came over. I was going to pet it, but I noticed the behavior seemed off. The dog seemed cautious and tense. I sat back down, the dog followed, bared its teeth at me before someone else called it from a different room. Later that day when I was by myself again the dog ran up to me, hackles raised, and started barking at me. It’s a large dog, so I was pretty shaken. 

SO’s sister says the dog is not aggressive, but it obviously seems to be. I’m no longer comfortable hanging out with them as I feel like I can’t walk off anywhere without an escort without the dog cornering me. I feel very anxious now around the dog. I told this to my SO and this is obviously a problem because he wants me to spend time with his family (and his sister always has her dog with her.)

773,"So a bit of backstory. I (19 m) got transferred from my store that I worked at because of covid. So this new store I started to work at obviously had new people, including this one girl (18 F) we will call A. So after the first day I worked there, it was pretty obvious that A got a crush on me, kinda quick imo since we just met. I am very much so a professional person, I don’t date coworkers and I usually don’t build super close relationships with my coworkers either. 

So she got a bunch of peoples (including mine) snapchats and she started talkin to me that way, no biggy. But then one time she was hanging out with her friend (we will call B). B (19 F) had been on a couple dates with this dude I know (not friends, just know him) and so A sent a bunch of snaps of B explaining how he ghosted her and stuff. And then B asked for my snap on one of the vids, A got jealous but I was like yeah sure I will give you my snap. 

So me and B started talking, and we had a lot in common. A made comments at work about it, like after I would come back from a break she would be like “oh were you texting B?” And acting like thats a problem, which keep in mind I barely know A.

Now, one day B texted me randomly and was like “I want chicken nuggets, can we get chicken nuggets” and we hadnt hung out ever and she caught me on a day off so I was like screw it lets go. So we went and then hung out at her place and we became pretty close cause we connect real well. We hung out a few times after during my time off and just got even closer. A was now really jealous and has since been sending me things that I dont know how to respond to.

A seems like a nice gal, but shes not my type. Shes very impulsive, and she doesn’t think decisions through. She also has some emotional issues that I cant deal with (Ive dated someone like that and its very hard). She thinks she needs someone in her life to be happy, which I dont think is true. If you aint happy by yourself, youre just putting that onto someone else. She sent me stuff like “i used to get a tattoo whenever i was going through a rough patch but now since they are closed I have resorted to other methods”. I know exactly what shes talking about and I dont know think I can help.

Just the other day she was sending stuff like “I dont know how much longer I have” and I told her to get help if shes feeling that way because its too much for me. She then went on about how I will “drop everything” and hang out with B, but I wont for her, and she got really mad saying that she only wanted a friend to help her through her problems. I dont even really know her, Ive worked with her a few times but we barely talked outside of work, and even then I dont know anything about her. I am sure she has other friends cause she sends me snaps of her and her other friends all the time so why is she asking me, a dude she barely knows if I can, in her words “bend backwards the way I would for them”. I work almost everyday, I usually get one day off a week and just happened to get two the one week and hang out with B both days. I don’t have time to provide this amount of support to someone, unless they are my family, or a really close friend.

Shes very jealous that B and I are pretty close now, and she has been very touchy with B on me as a subject. B isnt even very close with A, and Ive talked to her about some of this stuff and she honestly doesnt know what to do either.

Any-who, I dont know what else I can do. A is just not being very good about this whole situation, and I mean I like B, i would totally date her, but Im sure that would make things worse (I honestly dont care about that part cause B is awesome). How do I deal with someone like this? I thought I was doing a good job but every time I said “Im sorry, I think you should talk to a professional, you’re asking too much of me” she just got madder, and more hostile about offing herself.",24May2020,1
774,"This has to do with COVID-19. I’m 18F and my boyfriend is 18 too. My parents didn’t let me see him for a while, despite him insisting and even sending my mom messages and him missing me a lot. I refused to see him because of the coronavirus-except, more than 6 feet away-although he didn’t like that and tried to convince me to be closer to him, but I didn’t feel comfortable with that.

I have been following all the rules and social distancing guidelines, because even though I’m young and it’s unlikely I would be seriously injured, I realize the magnitude of this situation. I would never want to be playing a role in helping this virus spread, nor to spread it to other people who are immunocompromised or older.

However, recently my parents decided that this is going on too long, that it isn’t that big of a risk, and that I could see him. I felt scared about this, but I told him that they would let me see him. I wanted to think it over for longer, but he came over my house yesterday and we were kissing and had a LOT OF contact. So basically if he had it, I would like 99% get it. I’m feeling really nervous and guilty now. I can’t tell him that I don’t want to see him now, because then it would be on me rather than on my parents. He would be devastated.

781,"Examples:

* When I turned 18 I decided I wanted to become a firefighter. However - they both verbally put me down so much that I dropped that dream entirely. They would say that “women can’t be firefighters”, “I would cause people to die in a fire”, “I’ll burn alive in a fire and die”, etc.
* I’ve never traveled anywhere by myself that’s not within a 15 mile radius of my house. My mom is so untrusting I’ve also slept over at a family members house by myself maybe 5 times? And each time it was with one of her parents or my dads cousin. 
* I am not allowed out at night - unless it’s to get fast food and then to come straight home (because there’s ax murderers and rapists and kidnappers everywhere)
* My mom and dad both want me to live with them forever and never move out
* My mom wants to move to Florida when she retires and she expects my sister and I to move with her (to Florida and also stay in the same house with her in Florida)
* I wanted to move to the United Kingdom and I was verbally berated by my mom and now I’m thinking that maybe it really is a stupid idea. “America is the best country on earth - why would you ever leave”, “it will never be financially possible”, “you’ll end up hating it there”, etc. 
* My dad is excited that my sister and I don’t want to get married (because of how horrible a husband he is) because he says that means “we’ll take care of him forever” instead of taking care of our husbands 
* If I ever try to gain independence I’m threatened with physical violence from my dad. Or he threatens to throw me out on the street - which would leave me a homeless female at 22. 
* I finally got them to stop tracking my movements with Find My IPhone at the age of 19/20. My mom and dad freaked out for a while because they said “what if I get kidnapped - then they won’t be able to find me”. Yet all they’d been doing is stalking my movements with find my iPhone. One time I was at a boys house but had lied and said I was at the movies - my dad almost slapped me in the face and threatened to take the car away. I was 19 and not allowed to be alone with a boy they hadn’t met and approved of.
* My dad has security cameras in the house and outside the house that he uses to track our movements. 
* They still control when I wake up in the morning (which isn’t bad it’s just annoying).
* I wanted to be a DoorDash delivery driver and they verbally put me down. They said I was not aloud to because “my car would break down from all the driving” (???) and also that I would be murdered and raped and kidnapped. I’m also not allowed out when it’s dark/ night and that’s when a lot of deliveries happen. 
** there’s so many more examples but these are the first ones to come to my head **


My parents make my sister and I believe that we will never make it on our own. My sister and I don’t know how to live by ourselves or do anything by ourselves. My parents make it seem like attempting to move out on our own would be straight suicide.

I want to move out but I am so afraid because I have no idea how to do anything. And my parents are content with me not knowing how to do anything. I’m not sure what steps to take to try and gain my independence. 

I know people the same age as me who were in my graduating class who have moved to the opposite side of the country and live on their own. My parents holding me back makes me feel like a failure and a child. If I work to gain my future independence it would have to be in secret - as my parents completely crush any attempts to do that and threaten me/ verbally and mentally abuse me if I keep trying. 

My parents claim everything they do is to protect me from all the evil stuff out there. Or to make sure I don’t make the same mistakes they did. But how they’re going about trying to protect me seems more hurtful than helpful. I cannot talk about how their actions hurt me because they close their eyes and ears to anything they don’t want to hear. 


TLDR:  I think my parents are over controlling of my (22F) life - but they justify their actions by saying they’re just helping me. How can I work to gain my independence being a clueless 22 year old - without my parents knowing I’m doing so?",24May2020,1

Anyways, I’ve always liked spending time with her and it just happened naturally.  We met in grad school and I tried to avoid her because I just knew that I would fall for her.  In terms of looks I feel she is out of my league.  But we’ve ended up getting closer and spend a good amount of time together. 

I’ve dated very unsuccessfully since I’ve met her.  I never feel quite as good with anyone else. You know when you can make animal noises, play with each other, just make fun of each other and end up laughing. 

The always ongoing issue has been that she is polyamorous and was openly dating one person and involved romantically with a couple. Now she has a primary and I don’t know if she’s committed to this one partner.  Most of the time she try’s to keep things separate with me, I don’t know why.   I’ve said bring John along.  She’s first my friend and I need to be open to the other people in her life.  She’s even invited me when her other partners show up, and I always feel out of place when I’m the only friend around.  I was even taken aback when one of them hugged me and said I was a really nice guy.  

Since quarantine we’ve been speeding a good amount of time.  At least one day a week we spend 12+ hours doing stuff together.  It never seems to be enough.  When I’m doing things with her I don’t care about all the work, the mess, and the effort.  I just completely enjoy spending time with her. We watch a movie and I just wait for her to giggle or cutely react. We
Go for hikes and sign songs together. She is one of the few people I am completely myself with. She cooks for me, I cook for her.  We even had a trip planned until the world turned upside down. She’s been incredibly open if she’s had to cancel  plans, but then has more than made up for it, even though she didn’t have too. I can’t not like her. Sometimes it’s weird how open she is with me.  

I feel like the universe in conspiring against me. Every time I pull away she ends up
spending more time with me. I don’t ever really push to spend time with her but when I’ve asked her to stay longer, she hasn’t hesitated. 

Are things just more fluid now, this doesn’t seem incredibly normal. I wouldn’t  do most of this with a guy friend or even a non-close female friend.  I just don’t know what I should do. Or just keep doing what I’m doing because she’s a wonderful friend. We even planned a trip together which fell apart because of the pandemic.
 
There are so many emotions flowing through my head when I think about “all this” I can’t get my own feelings straight. I find myself looking for women like her, and that’s not healthy.  I feel I can either take the leap or cut her out of my life, but she’s owed an explanation if I do.

TL;DR: I have feelings for my poly friend.  She is a big part of my life and I don’t know how to reconcile my feelings. I’m only starting to get in a place where I feel capable of maintaining a more intimate relationship.  I have no idea how to go about it.",24May2020,1

796,"I'm wondering if anyone has some ideas that could help my boyfriend. His job has required him to continue going into work full-time despite the coronavirus, and has been having some problems dealing with having to wear a mask all day. 

Firstly, wearing a mask all day causes him to have a really dry throat, which sometimes makes him lose his voice, and in general is just really uncomfortable. He tries to drink a lot of water during the day but it doesn't seem to help. (We know that the dry throat isn't due to illness because it goes away on the weekends when he stays home and doesn't need to wear a mask.) 

Secondly, he has trouble with his glasses fogging up from his breath. He's tried a few different styles of cloth masks and he has the same problem with all of them. He's also tried using the trick I saw posted on reddit somewhere about twisting the ear straps before putting the mask on so the air can come out the sides of the mask when you exhale, but it hasn't really helped. 

I think he's more affected by these particular problems than many others might be because his job mostly requires him to work at a desk doing paperwork and the like, so he has to have his head tilted downward a lot of the time. That's just my guess, though, for whatever it's worth.

If anyone has any ideas for ways to try to alleviate these problems, I'd really appreciate it if you would share them (and so would Tim, obviously).",24May2020,1

1. He has to work on the house some; one of the bathroom has plumbing issues, and one of his light switches don’t work (he has to partially unscrew or screw in the lightbulb, which is fine for a 6’4 guy, but I’m short lol. This is something he is willing to put off until I’m there, but I digress).

2. He has to fully rebuild a truck for his dad. (This HAS to be done ASAP, as his dad needs a vehicle when he is cleared to drive again, after breaking both legs in a wreck, this coming month.)

3. He has to fix his own car, as well as deal with the car that was meant for me being totaled the other day.

4. He still has a job (7-6, with an hour drive each way). 

5. Three of his friends need help with their engines (another thing that can wait until I’m there, but it’s more on the plate). 

All of this has amounted to a LOT of stress on his shoulders, as well as making things very very busy. We were supposed to spend this afternoon together, but now he is sick as a dog and needs rest to feel better. I swear I’m not a monster; I understand how swamped he is. It’s just really hard to go from calls every morning, spending weekends together, and being on the phone for several hours every night, to almost no communication. When he finally calls, it’s like 9 o’clock at night, and he is exhausted. He tries to keep up and talk to me for a minute, but I end up feeling like a bother since he obviously just needs sleep. I know it will get better once his plate is cleared (or at least the meat it off of it), but right now I’m struggling. How do I cope with the lack of time I am getting from him right now? How do I stop feeling like I’m just bothering him when I try to talk to him? I feel like the most annoying pest ever just for asking when he will him to call at night.

TLDR; I feel like a bother when I try to talk to my swamped boyfriend. He tries to reassure me that it’s fine and he misses me, he’s just too tired to talk much, but I still feel terrible. What can I do to stop feeling like such a problem?",24May2020,1

802," Hi there,

I already posted this in other places on Reddit but just want to make sure to find the right one ;) Maybe r/advice is diverce enough to deliver some experienced dog people or good suggestions anyway!

3 weeks ago, we adopted a 6 months old female Lab mix from a shelter. It's not our first dog and neither the first one we adopted at such a young age. Things are pretty fine so far and we slowly but steady get to know each other every day! We keep the ""training lessons"" pretty minimal right now and mainly focus on her having social contacts with other dogs daily and time to play, learn about our daily routines and here and there we insert short sections to teach her the basic commands.

Toilet training is going great. It was only in the very first days that she peed on the floor in the house. By talking her for a walk after every meal (or snacks), after she played inside, after she slept or drank water and with a lot of positive enforcement, she seemed to understand very quick.

Theres only one thing we can't really understand so far. We'd like her to sleep in a comfy basket, e.g. accept it as her place to go to relax, a safe zone. We bought a huge pillow that we put in the basket. Thing is, no matter if we went for a walk MINUTES before, she pees onto the pillow. Every single time. We tried a lot to keep her from doing that but we also aren't sure why she even does it. We wash the pillow all the time after she peed on it.

If we wouldn't keep her from doing so, she'd lay down on the pillow after peeing on it. So maybe she tries to ""make it hers""? She is interested in the pillow. She proceeds to walk into the basket, turn around and realign the pillow but all the time it ends with her peeing on it.

Right now, she sleeps either on a blanket in our (my wifes and mine) bedroom, or in a soft mobile box in the living room. She never peed on one of those. Does anyone have an idea what's going on her and how we should proceed?",24May2020,1

810,"I'm not sure how to start this post, so ill just jump into the facts?

I am a female (17), and last year I started high school I was super excited and happy with the school I went to, but also super nervous. Because it was a completely new place filled with new people. 

&amp;#x200B;

My class was okey, we are close enough, and if it happens that my friends' aren't at school I can hang with some other kids, although it might be a bit awkward. I always somehow knew that my friends that I got might only be more of ""school"" friends at the back of my head, but I ignored since at the time it didn't really matter.  Our school hours were late, and I got this best friend that was the best thing that happened to me in my life. She brought out a new side in me, I wasn't completely shy as I once were, had our small things within our friend group, people even assumed that we were bestfriends since middle school or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, our school hours were late, but we would sometimes stay a bit behind or go to the mall that was close by or something. Nothing huge, but it was fun enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then coronavirus came, and maybe even before that? I've felt things are off? I can't explain.

&amp;#x200B;

In my friend group, we are 5 people. Me, A (my best friend), and then we have the three others. 

&amp;#x200B;

2 of these girls I have a great relationship with, they are my close friends and we still chat in out little group chat about the things we like, (we have the same interest in that the others don't). But the other girl, let's call her F, F and I aren't to close, we barely talk and don't connect? F had a friend group before us, but for various reasons she was left out. I don't really know if i can say why, but it is something that affects people daily and makes it hard for people to stay close to her, physically. We dont talk in school too much, I dont think she talks to the others as well, since she always goes off to her friends in our other classes or just sits there silent. 

&amp;#x200B;

So that is my friend group, and as much as I love them I also feel jealous when I see other's hang out with their friends and doing stuff? Maybe I had too many expectations for high school, but I always hoped that we would do fun stuff after school, I honestly don't know. Then quarantined happened, and we were all shuffled home and stuck there. At first, we talked a lot, and then normally. In our country, we can hang out with people, with a bit of distance between us. Me and A, did do this, since I needed to change my room, and fix my space for personal reasons. We went to the store etc, then we talked a bit on the phone and now she sends me some TikTok once in a while, I do that as well, and sometimes try to keep the conversation going but it doesn't really work? 

&amp;#x200B;

She is also with her boyfriend a lot, they've been with each other most of the quarantine, and I'm fine with that. He is cool and we are friends. As if having little contact was sad, when we went back to school, we talked and was with each other, but I've never felt more awkward? When she talked I felt like I had to laugh and tried my best, cause or else what? What was I supposed to do? It was bad, I for some reason didn't feel like talking and she, her bf and his friend talked while we went and got some food during the break and I was there quietly. Then we got a task about music, podcast, etc,  and I wanted to do it with her but then she wanted to do something else and I was cool with it, but then her bf wanted to do music alone, and she asked if I wanted to do it with her and I agreed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her bf went to the music room, so she wanted to go to the music room. And she complained about that a bit and I was like ""aw.. that sucks though."" 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, I look around me and truly realize I have no friends. It is always something that blocks us. I sit home and look around me and look at others and become sad. My childhood friends? Don't keep in touch, my old bestfirend? I don't even have streaks with her, my other friends that acted as if i was family during the summer when i visited them suddenly stopped talking to me. (this one hurts me, she would call and talk to me at the beginning of high school when i was scared and up until April/may she just stopped. She didnt even read my messages but still sends streak and I want to ask her: what the hell? and cut contact with her but can i do that? What happens when we visit? About my secrets? I dont know), my other friends who i once in a while talk with but dont really talk with and dont really even know since we have our own lives. 

&amp;#x200B;

all of this is so stupid, and it is so hard to make new friends, trust me, i cant just make them and talk about my interests it doesn't really work that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This post is so long, and I am truly sorry about that, and thank you if you read this far.

What can I do? I dont even know what i am asking here.",24May2020,1
811,"Just for a bit of context before I start, I am a 15M with a severe lack of social skills and hobbies. If it weren't for an inferiority complex, I probably wouldn't have felt the need to post this in the first place.

So, I am currently in 10th grade. In our school system, you get put in two different kinds of classes: the mentor-classes where you work on yourself and how you're able to work, and an actual class with which you do stuff like math class and language class.

There's a girl in my mentor-class that I've been interested in for a while. As far as I know she isn't very popular, to the point where I've heard other classmates badmouth her while she wasn't around. The only interaction I've ever had with her was when she sent me a message to send condolences for the passing of my grandparents (since there weren't many people who did this, this is probably where my interest in her began).

On Instagram there's a function that allows you to see if people you follow like any posts that you come by. I noticed that she liked a lot of posts I did as well, and lately I've noticed she liked some posts relating to a game I play. At first this made me want to talk to her to see if she had the game as well, but now for some reason I just really want to talk to her at all.

As someone who doesn't have many friends, starting a new connection with someone is extremely difficult. The fear of being rejected and then badmouthed by her and her friends really makes me feel like it'd be better not to talk to her at all.

What would be the wisest thing to do in this situation? It's not like I want to talk to her more than anything, so maybe just ignoring it really would be the best option here.",24May2020,1

I mentioned a game we could play together but he has no interest in it. 

It got better to the point where he makes room for watching Netflix with me.

816,"so I was stupid and thought I could fit in a parking spot.  There were cars on either side and as I turned in, I scratched the front right of my car and his car.

I didn’t actually verbally speak to him. He got back into his car and just gave me a dirty look but didn’t say anything.

818,"I've always had problems socializing. idk why I just have a hard time making anything beyond good acquaintances since forever, and im an introvert, so 90% of my weekends I spend alone. I was lonely in my middle school because I basically had no real friends, but I became close with her freshman year. This girl is the longest I've had a friend for, and the most comfortable I've been with someone.

She's a really sweet girl. I swear she's never done anything to hurt me or another person, she's just a good hearted person. We have never had a fight or anything like that. She is an extrovert though, she has two other close friends and a lottt of casual ones, and is always hanging out with new people. It doesn't bother me, but I kinda wish I could be like that. 

In the beginning of quarantine, so early March, her mom found weed in her room. I am her smoke bud or whatever but she told me it wasn't even weed that I gave to her. She said her mom was really mad and didn't want us hanging out. I asked if she told her mom about me and she said no she kinda just figured it out. ( I promise you I don't look like a stoner, i just like fashion that is a bit weird. I don't act like one either, maybe her mom thought my awkwardness = me being high? I doubt it.)

The first thing that doesn't make sense is that she has been caught drinking twice (or 3? idk) with her two other best friends I mentioned earlier. She had to have her dad pull over so she could throw up. I brought this up, asking how that could happen multiple times and her mom has no problem with it, but she never actually caught me in the act and doesn't have any actual evidence that I buy her weed. (I don't, I just smoke with her.) She said maybe because she knows them better and because she got the alcohol from someone else. 1. one of those girls is about 6 months new. 2. I wasn't her weed supplier. I never let her KEEP weed.

I actually stopped smoking weed. entirely. it's just not fun anymore, and I want to take care of my health and live life sober. I suggested maybe we could have her mom over because she never met my mother, so she can see the type of person my mom is. (she's not a careless mom who just let me smoke weed, she cares and has good morals.) I even said ""so what? does she want a pee test?"" 

she kinda just was like ""yeah maybe we can do that."" and ""I'm not sure if my mom would want to do that."" she just didn't really seem super concerned. She didn't suggest how to fix the problem like I did at all. 

I've been couped up in my room for 3 months now. No one else is really trying to reach out or talk to me (because I don't have any friends who are that close.) I blamed a lot of the situation on the whole social distancing thing, assuming that maybe things will calm down once the social distancing calms down too.

I went onto social media one day to find that she had been hanging out with the other two girls near her house. It took 0.5 seconds for me to start sobbing. Every few days they'll hang out together, and post it on Instagram and snapchat, and I cry every single time because it seems like I now have ZERO friends. I'm alone, and I have nobody. Fuck it bruh, I'm crying right now just writing about it.

I don't know what it is. I've hung out with her and the two other girls before, I felt like a fucking kill joy. a burden. like I was no fun. she and the two girls seem to have more fun together than when I'm around.

She's a good person. She's nice, and she's down to earth. Never entitled or self centered. I could never see her doing anything mean spirited like abandoning me, but that's how I feel. I feel like it's because she has so many other friends, she has no problem losing one. But she's my only friend. 

Sorry this was so long. Idk what the question I'm asking is, what should I do? Do you think she's lying?",24May2020,1

My problem is that I will soon be without a place to live, I don't have a car, I don't have a job and I am short on money. I spent the last year travelling and volunteering in South America which is where most of the little money I had saved working during high school went(I'm 19yo). I came back in Canada in the beginning of february and found a job in Portugal, I finished passing all the employement tests and interviews for the post in beginning of march but it's at the same moment that the situation with the coronavirus got more critical so as you can understand travelling wasn't possible anymore.  So no others options than to stay here at my parents' house who initially agreed to host me for only a month. Since the beginning of my stay, I have done chores and work around the house in a way to re-pay them, but we have now reach a point where there's nothing more to do, the house is completely clean, all the windows have been washed, the garage is in order, the outside/garden looks neat, etc so since my presence is now of no utility they asked me on the 15th of May to leave before June. So I quickly looked for others options and found a small farm where I can work and who was fine with letting me bring my hammock to sleep on their property, but they just contacted me today to tell me they changed their mind and didn't want a new employee in these times of social distancing. Which is what lead me to write this post, I feel helpless and don't know what to do anymore, I usually always find a way but with the pandemic going on everything is so much more complicated. 
Other important thing to mention is that my parents' house is in the middle of nowhere in the countryside, I applied as soon as I understood Portugal wasn't going to happen for all the jobs reachable by feet or bike, as there is no public transportation and I don't have a car, without any success because they already had all the employees needed. 
Also I am not qualified for the PCU or any other financial help as I did not work in 2019. 
Also I don't really have any family or friends around here, I lost contact with almost everyone after high school when I went travelling, it feels like I have friends almost all around the world except in Canada or at least in Quebec(the province I currently live in)
I'm more than willing to work but I just don't know what to do.

830,"I’ve been in a relationship for over a year but because of my living situation over that span she has met my family once to which it was only my parents briefly. I’ve had girlfriends in the past but my current gf is the first I have introduced to my family formally. My family isn’t very involved so gatherings are considered kind of a big deal because they happen only so frequently (it’s something I’ve discussed at length with my gf about).

Today my family had one such get together planned and last night I extended an invitation to my gf. She accepted enthusiastically and said she would be there but her friends birthday would be the next day. This morning upon texting her she asked what time the lunch was and I responded with what I understand to be the normal lunch time: noon. To my surprise she said she definitely couldn’t make it at that time because she was planning to be with her friend at 1. She followed up by saying she could come over at 2, stating that missing the food wasn’t important to her. I agreed that 2 works and subsequently informed my family that she’d arrive then.

While I understand lunchtime isn’t set in stone, I thought noon give or take an hour would be widely accepted as when lunch is so I was kind of upset at the fact that this wasn’t planned out well enough. However, I tried my best to be understanding but my gf could sense that it upset me at least a little and apologized. I said it was okay and tried to move on but she acted like I was wildly upset. She said “It’s fine I’m sorry, I’ll leave you be to let you cool down until I’m going to leave [her friend]’s house”. Her reaction to my texts seemingly over blown and my family constantly asking what the plan was only made the irritation worse.

Noon rolls around, my family and I have lunch, we chat and wait for my gf to arrive. By 2 I’m expecting some communication saying she’s arrived, on the way, planning to leave soon, etc. By 2:30, my family has packed up leftovers, done the dishes, and sat waiting for an additional 10 minutes before calling it quits. By 2:30, I verbally express my frustration and leave the house to calm myself only to receive a text from my gf saying she’s back home. Regardless of whether she’d leave directly from her house or had to get ready before going back out again, she would have kept my family waiting for at least 45 minutes.

I tell her that I’m upset and to let me be for some time so I can recollect myself. The cherry on top for me is that my gf has OCD tendencies towards time and punctuality so for her to be tardy with no sense of being apologetic.

To me, I see this as disrespectful towards my time, my family’s time, and the resources we all put in to make the food we offered. It’s embarrassing for me but the main issue it causes is that my family now looks upon her unfavorably as they ask if we’re okay in our relationship to which I can’t answer: if we do it would explain the absence yet not excuse it but if we didn’t previously we do now. I don’t blame her for her prior engagements but at least letting me know she’d be late once again could’ve resolved this. Telling me she couldn’t go if she could’ve make the commitment would’ve avoided all this.

Do I have a right to be upset? Am I overreacting?",24May2020,1
831,"Sorry for how unorganized this is
I'm so worried I'm going to overthink myself into a panic attack and mess up an amazing relationship. So any advice would really be appreciated

So, I (20'S F) was a part of an affair with a co-worker. He (let's call him D) is twice my age and has kids. I had a crush on D but never thought anything would happen. One day a conversation gets a bit interesting and ends up going past the point of no return. Seemingly out of nowhere, we started cautiously/secretly flirting at work and having phone sex a few times. I was very unsure about everything and ended it once (I had to reevaluate myself and had a breakdown) but D started it back up, and I REALLY liked it. I really liked him. As a person. He's hot as hell, but he is also a really cool guy. And I know it's fucked, but I've come to just understand I'm a bit of a monster/asshole. It had been on and off, both of us knowing it was morally wrong but being horny bastards with no self control. And idiots. But D and I finally stopped flirting after I went to his house once (family was away) and we made out and tried oral. That's the only physical thing that ever took place. It was so much, actually being in his house, that we decided to stop again. 

Fast forward to now. I have not flirted with D in about 3 months. I also now have a boyfriend (V, also co-worker) that I have been dating for almost 1 month. He's AMAZING. He's romantic without being cringy, he's huggable and flirty, in a silly way usually. He's fun to watch stuff and play games with, and he's NOT MARRIED. He cares about me and shows it and I really am falling for him. And yes, he knows I was a part of an affair. But he does not know it was his co-worker. I offered to say who it was, but he said he would rather not know.

The problem is, I keep thinking about D sexually. He's so sexy it hurts. I don't see him very often anymore but when I do...ugh. V is very cute and handsome, but he doesn't have that sexyness D has. Sex with V is great, and he really gets me going sometimes, but just seeing D at work or seeing a message from him sends my mind back to when I was in his house, or when we would flirt at work. I even had to shut D down, as he attempted to flirt with me a week into my relationship. (He didn't know I was dating someone) but I did shut it down immediately and felt proud as HELL, and he has not tried flirting since. But I keep finding myself fantasizing about D and feeling so guilty about it. And trying not to think about it makes it worse.

I just feel so guilty and don't know what I should do or feel. Is it wrong that I'm sexually fantasizing about D? I don't even think about D when V is around, but when I'm alone, the thought just pops up and idk how bad that is. is it wrong? What would you do in my position?

839,"(Im sorry the the long post and formatting, Im on mobile. Thank you to anyone who actually reads this and tries to understand what Im going through. There is a lot behind this and I tried to keep it relevant. Please ask questions if you need I will try to answer!)

Ive been struggling with this news for a few days now and Im not sure what to do with it.

Its not the first time Ive been turned down, which does suggest theres really no need, but I also have a tendency to downplay what my symptoms are and how badly theyre effecting me. I especially have trouble expressing myself face to face with people. In fact a lot of our sessions involve me shrugging nonchalantly when she suggests a reasonable explination for my behaviors. Sometimes I genuinely dont relate to the explanation she gives but I dont know how else to explain why I felt or did something so I let it go.

Ive been assessed for depression and anxiety and I took prozak for a few months in highschool, dropping it shortly after starting when it seemed to numb me out. (I dont general have good relationships with doctors so Im not the type to talk about medications and how theyre effecting me. If its not working the way I hoped I stop. I know this is not okay and Im working on improving myself but again I have a really hard time telling people something is wrong in the first place so its even harder to burden them with what is likely a 40 minute explanation about Why Im Sad which always just sounds pathetic and First World Problemy to so I fucking hate doing it.)

Im sorry for rambling, Im trying to include relevant information.

Ive been in and out of counseling since highschool. I would say Im a sensitive person who experiences a lot of emotions very strongly and rapidly. Ive been asked a couple times if Im bipolar or something by people who've had to deal with me, but it is the same as someone saying youre OCD just because youre organized, I try not to give these ""diagnosis"" any credit. 

I havnt found counseling very helpful since my first counselor and she moved schools only a short time after treating me. Since then I havnt found any of the coping mechanism achievable or really helpful. I know I have to make consistant effort to change the bad pathways in my brain but I cant seem to muster the motivation to commit to anything. One of the reasons I decided to pay for a therapist was because I thought it would be more helpful and that I could get a professionals opinion on whether or not I need to be diagnosed and seek further treatment or medication to help get me to a place where I cpuld actually apply and strengthen these coping strategies.

The other day she asked me to list reasons I thought I might need diagnosis, I worked all night on it, trying to write out my deepest feelings so that I wouldnt blank at the session.
I dont know if I wasnt convincing enough, I kind of got shy and did leave some things out but I tried to be really honest about my biggest concerns. Or maybe she got distracted by the only points she commented (and explained away as clear signs of attachment issues. Which I dont doubt I have) or maybe I am just being paranoid and I really just need to deal with building my confidence ect.

I dont want to self diagnose, and I know mental illness rarely looks like what we imagine, what is portrayed on TV or even what is described by online resources. I used to think I showed signs of Borderline until I met someone with a severe case of it and witnessed first hand how diluted to reality she could be (it was terrifying) and I would never wish to suffer like that but I cant help but wonder how much Im suffering by not having an understanding of myself.

Ever since our meeting I have falling into a paranoid depression, I struggle to sleep, I keep thinking ""should I have mentioned this? Should I have insisted we look into it?""

What Im wondering is: should I ask for a second opinion? If this is something I have felt so strongly about for so long should I just insist on seeing someone? Or perhaps not enough time has passed (we've met 8 times since Feb) for her to assess me or for me to properly open up and I should wait a bit longer for her to make a proper assessment?

I am reluctant to just be relieved and let it go when I feel I have been struggling so long, and maybe Im reluctant to find out Im completely normal. If that is your take on the situation I understand and maybe someday I can be more accepting of the thought but at the moment Im only looking for if I should pursue a psychiatrist or just continue seeing my therapist and work at expressing myself so that she might come to a clearer conclusion on her own?

Thank you for reading this and being serious with your advice. Please dont just tell me Im being paranoid or too sensitive, its really not something I can handle hearing right now from someone who really doesn't know even a fraction of my lifes story. Thank you to all the serious answers and patient people.",24May2020,1

Hey everyone..
I need help deciding if i should take the leap and switch majors.
Background:
Im 19 and currently go to college and i am get a B.S for nursing but it wasn't my first choice. I applied for a different major but got denied because i didn't meet their requirements, i took a year out and re-applied with the help of my mom and the school's receptionist help discussing my options. Basically where my grades and subjects ( i live in the caribbean so we do something called csec and i had science subjects) could take me was nursing, i never aspired of becoming a nurse but my mom pushed me to apply because it's a good career choice and it's available. Fast forward i got accepted and i'm in my first semester, and i absolutely dislike it. I don't feel like i can stay in something that's not meant for me for 4 years and i'm not even doing that well on top of it. I was hoping that i could switch majors, I saw a few new majors i met the criteria for and would love to switch but i'm kind of scared of what my mom would think, she always reacts negatively when i bring up switching majors or say ""why don't you just stay in nursing and then do what you like? it doesn't hurt anybody..""
I'd like to switch to Creative industries and event management,it  seems like a fun career to go down. But on the other hand i'm still nervous, should i actually do it? Is it a good career to go down and is it worth it especially with covid?.. should i just suck it up and stay in nursing? i need some help.. I have so much doubt and confusion .. i just need advice..

She also attacks my uncle (married to her) who’s physically larger than her. She attacks my uncle (her brother) who is disabled, skinny and a cancer survivor. She literally makes him eat a shit filled rag (the rag we use to clean up after my grandma who was bedridden because of stroke). She literally physically abuses him to the point there is blood on the ground. My brother even told me that she would sometimes attempt to choke my grandma because she would not eat. my brother who is a grown man, hides in his room locked doors to hide from her. 

I want to call the police on her but the problem is that I don’t have any proof, I also don’t live in the same state. My brother sent me pictures of when she attacked him but he deleted the pictures. Another problem is that my family is too afraid/don’t believe in calling the police.  We’re Asian and Asian people don’t believe/like calling the police on family members. She also threatens to kill people/attack people in the language too but it’s hard for me to prove.

She knows what it is. But the last year or so, she’s been using it a lot. I think she picks it up from media and other people on the web, i.e. podcasts, instagram videos. I’ve also noticed that her colleagues use it as well.

Her vocal fry came front and center about 6 months ago when *she* brought it up. She made fun of the way the ladies talk on the reality show The Bachelor, which she watches. So I told her nicely, “but you have vocal fry, too.” Later on that night, she brought it up. She asked me to confirm what vocal fry is, then round-aboutly asked me to correct her when she does it. We had been drinking a bit that night, and I could never bring myself to ask her about it again. 

Now, she has delved deeply into speaking with vocal fry, and I just don’t know what to do. I often think that I’m just being a judgmental jerk, and it shouldn’t matter how she speaks. She’s a great woman! But every time I hear it, I have an adverse reaction to it. And I find myself not engaging in conversation with my wife because I simply don’t want to hear the vocal fry. 

Her type of vocal fry isn’t ditzy like on the bachelor. She seems to use it when she’s complaining or otherwise speaking under her breath. It also comes out at the end of sentences or when she’s coming to a conclusion in her sentence. Sometimes it’s only a few words, but sometimes it’s like an entire thought or idea. She’s early 30th, highly educated, and into pop culture. 

I’m thinking about bringing it up to her again, but I don’t want to put her on the spot like that. I don’t want to criticize the way someone speaks.

He has NO HISTORY of seizures. Before this, my SIL &amp; their 2 oldest children disappeared for 3 days leaving my brother with the 2 youngest children, no money, no transportation, &amp; no food in the house. When they finally returned, my brother up &amp; had a seizure. I asked my SIL how the hell did my brother randomly have a seizure &amp; she blamed alchohol, drugs, said he refuses to eat anything she cooks, &amp; they were just walking &amp; my brother suddenly fell down &amp; started to seize. I then asked her what hospital he's in. She gave me the name. I called the only hospital that popped up on Google with that name in it &amp; I was told my brother wasn't there &amp; never was. I called 4 other hospitals in the area only to be told the same thing. This was at like 2 A.M. where I am, so my mom told me to try the other hospitals in the morning. The next day I found out my SIL had given the same false hospital information to my sister, but my sister called around  only to find out that the hospital our SIL was referring to has been shutdown for 3 years. We finally found out what hospital our brother is in &amp; learned that he couldn't breathe on his own so they had to intubate him &amp; heavily sedate him because he was fighting the tube. My SIL told my aunt today that the hospital wouldn't give her any information about my brother's status because my sister &amp; mom are the 1st 2 people who called to inquire about him &amp; my mom directed them to only give information to them. After I heard this, I decided to see if I could catch my SIL in another lie, which I did. I messaged her asking how my brother is doing &amp; she told me there's no change &amp; she's going to speak to his doctor this afternoon. 1st she says they won't give her any information, then she says they told her there's no change, which is a lie because I was right next to my mother when she was on the phone with my brothers nurse &amp; there has been slight changes. So not only did she lie about what hospital he's in, but she's also telling different family members different stories. I don't know if I should call her out on her lies, let her dig herself a deeper hole, or wait to confront her in person. Because when my brother gets better, we plan on going down there to bring him &amp; the 2 youngest children back  up north with us.

866,"So i (20F) live with an older cousin (25F) for the past two years. We are all working/ studying abroad and our parents are back home in our home country. I can't really feel the change in her but she did and recently she became more emotional, dramatic and sensitive. I think it all started when she started becoming obsessed about her appearance (weight, calling herself fat, going on extreme diets, etc). Whenever she comes home she would always rant about her problems, which her sister and I actually found not a big deal. Basically she's really negative, pessimistic and feels like the whole world is against her. She's prone to making mountains out of molehills. 

Another story about her, few months ago her little sister was diagnosed with appendicitis and required surgery and the little sister lost some weight due to the whole thing and this cousin of mine said ""I wish I have appendicitis too so I can be skinny."" I found it to be a very toxic way of thinking like who would wish oneself to be ill. I honestly think she has anorexia, but I won't believe it until she gets officially diagnosed.

Anyway I recently heard from another housemate of ours, who is her sibling and also my cousin that she was angry at me for using her things when I didn't. 

Few days ago I baked some cookies with almond powder and she went off to the sister and said I used her almond powder but I actually bought it myself and (fortunately) also has the receipt of the purchase as proof. She also said I used her vegetables to make some soup and yes I did, but I immediately went and bought the replacement which was exactly the same. She also said I demanded that she paid for whatever food that I cooked and she ate (which actually made sense cause I used my money to cook for the three of us and I would be the one who lose the money if they don't pay me back). However, I never asked her to pay me for cooking that food. It all started because I cooked some soup and she threw away the meat, which was expensive and I was annoyed cause I spent my allowance on that. I said ""you didn't even pay for it and yet you are throwing away the food?"" 

I just feel so wronged after hearing it from her sister. All I've done for the past two years are cooking and giving her some portions, cleaning up the entire apartment cause they are both slobs and just treating her decently. She has eaten my snacks and food in the fridge many many times but I have not made any ""big"" comments about it and just let it be. Her actions made me not wanna be nice to her anymore and I desperately feel like I want to move out but I can't. Can anyone give me any advice to cope with her? She's very toxic as a person and her way of thinking is extremely narrow and toxic as well. Whenever I see her or hear her voice I get mad inside and went back to my room so I can ""avoid"" her.",24May2020,1

I think intuitively he knows something up with me, he did ask if I was asexual, which I’m still battling with, because quite honestly I’m not too sure. What I am sure of is, I’ve experienced a lot of trauma in the past with men. I was raped twice by two different men I met on dating apps. In general, even the men who didn’t sexually assault me treated me like I was trash and that I didn’t deserve to be treated well. On top of that I was abused by my father. It’s tough.

873,"My parents are livid with me. Last night I was playing basketball at a friends house and someone smashed the front light of his house with the basketball on accident at around 10:50pm. Instead of going home (it was an hour drive) I decided to help stay and clean it up because it was a lot of glass and I didn’t want anyone to get hurt. This resulted in me leaving to go home around 11:30 and I got home at 12:30am. I sent my text to my mom beforehand about the glass incident and how I might be home a little later than twelve. I came home and she was almost in tears about where I was, worried sick, you know the normal emotions. I felt awful because I’m not a bad kid and always mean to make my parents happy and proud of me. This is the worst thing I’ve ever done as a woman, breaking curfew by 30 minutes.

I graduate in 3 days, I’m able to walk (with the social distance procedures, masks, and whatnot) and because I came home 30 minutes late, I’m grounded for a LONG time (about a month) My car keys got taken away, my parents won’t let me go to my graduation and walk, I can’t see any of my friends or anyone, I can’t longboard or bike (couple of my passions) oh and also my computer is getting taken away. Goes hand in hand with the saying “no good deed goes unpunished.”

I do not believe this is a fair punishment. I’m more than willing to accept a fair punishment that comes my way but I think this is a little extensive and unfair.

875,"(Hard for me to share, long and maybe confusing and my grammar skills suck)

Long story but I’ll try to make it brief basically around a year ago I was 16 Turning 17 addicted to Xanax I had been for a year I was in a very bad state and without getting into to much detail this girl I had opened up to indirectly basically saved my life i bought psychedelics to impress her and it changed my perspective and opened my eyes. It was never her intention to help me she actually told people at my school I did drugs and played with my head a lot, but she had her reasons I guess. 
About a year later after we had stopped talking she hit me up and apologized for what she did to me by playing with my head and telling people the personal things I had told her I then told her the story of how if I never meant her I would never of got sober she proceeded to claim she loved me. I said I loved her too even after what she did to me I still cared for her maybe cause I opened up to her? But I lied I cared for her I didn’t love her it just made me feel better knowing that I was good enough that she did end up liking me in the end after what she did to me.


Anyways we argue a lot and talk off and on I get mad at her &amp; I find my self name calling her a lot  I know it’s wrong I do it cause I think deep down I’m still hurt by what she did to me, I call her a hoe when I get mad her and stuff like that it’s only cause she was talking a guy who was older then her like 26 who had kids she’s 17 it made me mad cause how stupid could u be ? I’m mad at the guy mostly but still it hurts me knowing I cared for somebody so much who would do that talk to basically a pedophile, Like I don’t even know what to do I honestly would stop talking to her all to together once I found that out but I’ve very attached to her and her to me.

She also lies a lot she has a serious issue with lying she lied to me about having a boyfriend at first cause she didn’t wanna me know she was talking to a older guy before we started “dating” she even made a fake social media account for him I called her out made her stop talking to the older guy who was most likely just manipulating her like most older guys who talk to younger girls do idk how could I care for her?

But I’m also toxic I view her social media like all the time her Twitter especially like what she likes and stuff I have obsessive compulsive disorder I worry about her and when I see she’s liking positive stuff about improving her self etc  I know what I’m telling her is working the advice and stuff  but I know it’s wrong I told her I do it she knows and gets mad at me about it .

878,"Hi, I don't really use Reddit but I currently don't have a therapist and I really need a different perspective on the matter. This is going to be really long because I need to provide context, and tbh writing this is probably going to be somewhat therapeutic, so feel free to just ignore it lmao. 

So five years ago in my senior year of high school, I became friends with this person I'll refer to as CJ. This friendship was really meaningful to me because they were the first queer person that I met and befriended outside the Internet, and one of the first people I could talk to openly about my sexuality. We ended up texting a lot and becoming close friends even after we graduated. Over the next year or so, I developed strong feelings for CJ that waxed and waned over time. At one point in like March 2016 I thought I had my feelings managed, but then the next month we went to an event together and they put their head on my shoulder and I was like hooo boy. From there my feelings kept getting stronger and I felt like I was in love with them.

I eventually reached a point where I couldn't hold it in anymore and I decided to tell CJ how I felt, in like June or July. I don't remember exactly what I said, but I remember them saying that they had thought about dating me before but they weren't looking for a girlfriend right now. I was like ok, and we figured we could still be friends, and I think I also asked if we could maybe cuddle and stuff and they said sure (tho I remember the last time we hung out I tried to do some of that and it was just very awkward :/).

So for a few weeks our friendship proceeded as normally as it could, but I noticed on their Tumblr they were posting a lot of gay stuff, and also that one of their mutuals that they had visited started following me, and I looked at their page and they were posting the same kind of stuff too. I started getting paranoid, and I don't remember how it happened but CJ told me they had a girlfriend several weeks after the fact and that they didn't want to tell me because they didn't want to hurt my feelings. I put two and two together and figured out that a couple weeks after I told CJ about my feelings, they had gone to visit their Tumblr mutual in another state, and that was who they were dating. (Or they may have actually told me this, I don't remember, my brain has blocked a lot of it out)

So I was really fucking hurt after this. It hurt that like two weeks after they said they didn't want a girlfriend, they went and got a girlfriend instead of just being honest that they didn't want to date me. And it's hard to convey it in a post but I had been so wrapped up in this person for a year, they were my closest friend and just kind of an amazing beautiful presence in my life, and it was really hard for me to manage my emotions. 

So, I made the one-sided decision to end my friendship with CJ. I stopped responding to their texts until eventually blocking them, I blocked them (and their mutual/gf) on Tumblr and changed my URL so they couldn't find my blog (and all the dumb sad posts I was making), and I unfriended them on Facebook. It was so fucking painful and took ages to process in therapy, but eventually it became less painful. I would get really anxious when I came home from college and would go to the mall that I would walk past the store they worked at and they would see me, but that never happened (to my knowledge). I was able to go all this time having moved on and I thought that was the end.

Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I was going through files on my laptop to transfer to a new one, and I came across pictures from my phone from high school, and I saw pictures of CJ. This isn't the first time I've come across pictures of them in the last four years, but for some reason now it caused more than just a passing feeling. I felt the urge to look at their Tumblr, and I fought it off for a couple days but eventually went back to their Tumblr, and from there I found their Twitter. Now I look at it every few days and I hate myself for it. More and more memories from 4-5 years ago keep flooding back and I keep going back and looking for pictures and videos, trying to find old chat logs or journals from back then, and even listening to the music that I was listening to at the height of my feelings for them. I don't know what I'm trying to do or how I'm going to get myself out of this headspace, which is why I started thinking about messaging them.

CJ sent me a Facebook message request about a year after I stopped talking to them asking how I was and I never responded to it, but that would be the way I would write to them. I would want to acknowledge that what I did was shitty and not fair to them and apologize, and that we can process that if they want, but that it would be cool to just catch up if they want to do that too. I would also say they can ignore the message if they want since life is so stressful right now given the pandemic and this may just be a can of worms they don't want to open right now. 

What I'm wondering is if I'm shitty for doing this in the first place? They're just now graduating from art school, so like how shitty would that be for some fucko from the past to drop into their DMs being like hey it's been a minute what's up, and like ruin all the nice feelings they're probably having right now. 

I also don't even know what I'm trying to get out of this. I want to talk to them again obviously, but is that for selfish reasons? Am I just being fueled by pandemic-induced loneliness (and a lowkey pandemic-induced quarter life crisis) and the desire to talk to someone familiar?  Do I want to be friends with them or do I just want to have this one conversation, and then maybe we add each other on Facebook again and like each other's shit occasionally and then never talk to each other again? I know I don't want to date them; I've been with my girlfriend now for a year and nine months (and I've told her about all this, and we're in an open relationship anyway), and being with her kind of showed me that CJ wasn't always giving me the attention or effort that I wanted in our friendship in the first place. Buuut if it does go somewhere that would be cool?? but it likely won't and that's okay too.

I'm also worried I'm going to fall into the same kinds of behaviors and patterns from when I was friends with them and had feelings for them. For instance, whenever I would get a notification from the app we messaged each other on, my heart would light up a little bit, but then I would get annoyed that it was just my mom. After I blocked CJ on that app, I told my mom I wasn't using that app anymore and she had to message me on Facebook Messenger. So now that same shit is going to happen again! And I'm worried I'm going to be caught up being like ""well why aren't they texting me do they hate me they probably are talking shit about me with their friends and don't want to message me back"" that I was stuck in back in 2016. I keep telling myself that I've grown a lot since then - I graduated college, moved to a different city, did a year of grad school, and have completely changed the way that I interact with people and manage my relationships with them. I feel like I'm a very different person than I was in 2016, but I'm worried if I message CJ, I'm going to go back into those problematic thought patterns that I had in 2016, even though the nature of our relationship and my feelings are different now.

My problem: So, me and my siblings have our own styles, but the majority of it is enjoying time with our phones and our father.

I have mentioned to her how her decisions could potentially have consequences (aka having to pay back cerb if she is caught) but she says she won’t be caught because she has been paid under the table (etransfer so she has left a electronic trail that maybe she is unaware of).",24May2020,1
891,"When I (22 F) met my fiance ""Antonio"" (28 M), he lied and said he'd recently gotten out of a relationship. We dated for 6 months, I found out he'd been seeing me and his then-current girl friend ""Maria"" at the same time for the first 2 months we were together. I was hurt, so I left.

""Lala"" is a friend of 7+ years to Antonio and Maria. Lala has 2 kids; she made Antonio and Maria their god parents. I have 0 reason to believe Antonio and Lala ever were a thing, but Antonio dated Maria for 2 years off and on before we met. Lala was happy to have her friends dating, and thought they were going to get married. She even knew about it when Antonio cheated on Maria with me, and kept quiet because she hoped they would work out anyway.

When I left Antonio, Lala was there for him to lean on, and she tried to get him back with Maria. In those 6 months he had fallen in love with me, and when I walked way, he was kicking himself for being selfish and ""double dipping"" between Maria and I. Antonio told Lala that he didn't want to be with Maria anymore, that he had never really loved her. 

After a year, Antonio and I got back together. He paid thousands of dollars for us to go to counseling, was transparent with me, and jumped through every hoop to regain my trust. When he mentioned to Lala that him and I were back together, she was upset. The next time she hung out with Antonio, she said ""I told Maria about this, we think it’s a terrible idea."" Antonio shrugged it off. The next week Lala told him I’d threatened to kill her and her kids. I have never contacted Lala, and I let Antonio know this. When he confronted Lala, she acted like she had gotten me confused with someone else, or some other excuse. Antonio acknowledged to me that she was likely just making things up about me, and that he knew everything he told her about our relationship went straight back to his ex. Antonio had a talk with Lala and told her again that he didn't want to be with Maria. He told Lala I was not just his girlfriend, but his future wife, and she needed to respect that. Lala tried lying about me more times.

Antonio got a big promotion and asked me to move with him. We were also talking about getting engaged. I said yes, on the condition that he gave up Lala. I said no decent person would lie about someone threatening to murder their kids. I also pointed out his words about Lala reporting every detail she got on us back to Antonio's ex, and that she had disrespected us both repeatedly.

Antonio agreed to cut ties with Lala, but it made him angry and resentful. After a year of us living in a new place, with me starting a new job and working hard to help us build a life together, I found out he’d started talking to Lala again. I broke off the engagement and walked away for the last time.

Why would someone give up a fiance, the person who loves and takes care of them every day, for a ""friend"" who has lied to them repeatedly, and lives states away with their own husband and kids?

tl;dr: Told my fiance it would be me or his lying best friend.",24May2020,1

894,"My mom has been using products from Alway, Market America, Isagenix, and the like since I was a kid. No one in my family sells MLM products, but my mother has been brainwashed by these snake oil saleswomen on WeChat. (Side note: these women say that these products can cure cancer when they have no background in science and make the wildest unsubstantiated claims). She shoves supplements from MLMs down my throat because she truly believes that these products can work miracles and all our detergents, air purifiers, and even toothpaste are all from MLMs, specifically Amway and Market America. 

I’ve gotten in countless fights with her over this and I’m angry that we’re using these overpriced products (which I suspect/hope are placebos). Over the years, I’ve tried to show her articles saying that these MLMs are scams, but it’s been so hard to find anything that says anything bad about the products that MLMs are peddling. Posts online mostly centre around MLMs being scams because people lose money and whatnot, but my mom isn’t interested in becoming a distributor and only cares about the supposed efficacy of these products. She doesn’t care about the cost either because she thinks that these products are better than ones that we can buy from anywhere else. 

Are there any studies or articles online that talk about the effectiveness of these products that I can use to try and convince her? Is there anyone writing about whether or not these products are FDA-approved or whatnot? I’m so frustrated by this and I can’t find anything online about what these products are and what their ingredients do.",24May2020,1
895,"I have a pig that's like 3 months old and I can kind of get close to her, but she never lets anyone pet her. I can feed her out of my hand, but every time I reach out to pet her she backs away. She really hates being picked up so I stopped doing that a while back. And I feel like I have done everything to make her come out of her shell. Also she's still really small compared to when we got her, but she's starting to grow now that she's getting enough protein. Another reason she is shy around humans is because we have another pig that she always follows around every where.

898,"So, I met a lady who helped me get my CDL. I met her online, which is already a push for me, but I was desperate. This is just around January. 

So she has 4 kids and is married, and I have one kid and I'm a single mom. I became a school bus driver. The whole world shut down in March, and her nanny quit, and so I became her nanny. Just fiscally for the time being worked out. 

Her husband is looking to take a job that will raise his income by over $50k what she is already making, and within the year would only go up. She is in home loans, so she can remarket herself. With a CDL I *should* be able to get a job fairly easily, but there's always the ""what if"" that I can't. She said If I move with them, then it would be rent free. I do **not** want to be 100% reliant on people. But if they go and I stay, then it is really just me and my daughter in this apartment. I am not the type of person that easily asks for help, let alone knows how to lean on anyone. 

I always make the wrong decision, and I have nowhere to go to get advice. 

Some more details I find important: my daughter is 8, her children are 6yo. 4yo, 3yo, 2yo. The Lady has MS (multiple Sclerosis). Both of our children vary with ASD high functioning, ASD nonverbal, ADHD and sensory disorders. So they're a handful. Plus it is **5** children. I'm born and raised Texas, and she is asking me to move to Colorado, so if anything WERE to happen to the only family that (well, I never see them now) I  do have, then it would be 12 to 14 hours to reach them. 

I texted the 2 family members and one immediately says that's a terrible idea and the other says, check it out that sounds like it could be fantastic. Problem with this is that I personally feel both of these ways, and I did not feel like either one of them was wrong.  

I suffer with issues on making rational decisions as I'm Bipolar so I'm actually very seriously looking for reasonable input. Or to hear things that I may not have considered or details I may have looked over.",24May2020,1

900,"A guy was knocking on the door a few minutes ago. It's raining right now, and he didn't have a raincoat on or anything. The guy was black, I think, although I turned my face away from him when he came in. He was a delivery guy or something, he had a water bottle and a bag of food in his hand, and he knocked on the door for a while before he came in. I guess he thought I was the one who ordered the stuff, and he asked me if it was the right address, and I told him it was but it was probably the people upstairs. Anyway, he mumbles something, goes up the stairs, stays there for maybe 3 minutes, then trods back down, mumbles some profanities under his breath, and asks if he can charge his phone. I'm perplexed by this, as there are no plugs in sight and I'm typing on a wireless device. He searches around, rummages behind some boxes and looks for an outlet. He was being a real nuisance. I tell him there's no outlet, just old wiring, and he gets irritated and leaves. I hope I didn't appear racist to him, as I turned away from him and tried to hold my breath. I hope he understood about the whole virus deal and how he was getting too close, at least three feet apart, as the hallway is pretty narrow. I dunno what delivery service he worked for. I think he was holding a water bottle with the Batman logo on it. Does anybody know what this was? Any advice?",24May2020,1
901,"I'm 33 and never had a girlfriend. I've spent all my life rotting in loneliness, watching other guys get the girl. I soon realized that the system was rigged against guys like me. Men who are disadvantaged by genetics and environment. If you don’t have male-model good looks, money/status or some other material incentive, you will struggle to find a girlfriend.

&gt;1. go to the gym

Yeah, working out is great and all, but ""gymmaxxing"" and other ""looksmaxxing"" techniques (like dressing well and getting a fancy haircut) aren't going to get you a girlfriend unless you're naturally good-looking. A chad will always look better after working out (due to his superior genetics) or he can simply choose to slack off and have a ""dad bod"" (which is basically an out of shape chad).

&gt;2. be a good guy

Many guys are perplexed when they hear women talking about how they want to meet a “good guy” but proceed to date one arrogant douchebag after another who steals, manipulates and cheats on them. Several studies have looked at this behaviour and concluded that women are attracted to men with the dark triad personality traits (narcissism, machiavellianism and psychopathy). Of course, the only men who can get away with this behaviour are those with looks/money/status.

&gt;3. online dating

Quite possibly the worst advice of all. You'd think that in theory online dating would make it easier for all kinds of people to get together but in reality apps like ""Tinder"" and dating sites are just a glorified meat market for women to hook up with the hottest guys. There is almost no point in 80% of men even wasting time on it. They're out of the race before they know it.

&gt;4. just be confident, bro

Scary thing is that people post this meme unironically. If someone has been hit by the ugly stick, bullied all their life, plagued by crippling social anxiety or some other mental health condition that impacts on their social skills, it's downhill from there. It's ludicrous to expect that individual to suddenly find the big dick energy that women find attractive.

&gt;5. b-but women can smell personality

This is one of Reddit’s favorite memes. They talk a lot about ""personality"" and ""attitude"". If you haven’t got a girlfriend, it’s because women use their magical sixth sense to know you’re a bad guy. If women were such great judges of character, there wouldn't be so many of them hiding in refuges, or stuck in abusive, toxic relationships, would there? Women ignore the red flags and fall for these men because they're superficially attractive, that's all.

&gt;6. lower your standards

Another popular catchphrase. ""Just lower your standards, bro!"" First of all, the concept of dating ""leagues"" is completely skewed by female hypergamy. Women are always looking to date/marry ""up"" whether it's physical attractiveness of socioeconomic status. Second of all, if someone finally settles for someone who physically repulses them, that's never going to end well.",24May2020,1

903,"So this may be all over the place but I’ll be as quick and straightforward as possible. I’m 20, and my older sister is 2 years older than me. I have a younger brother who is 15. I have a maltipoo, Scout, that is my own dog who is really attached to my mom and the family dog, a poodle/bichon named Rudy. When they were gone for a week, she hardly slept at all and kept waking me up. It would hurt to leave without her but it would hurt to take her with me.

My mom and dad are average I guess. I’m not close with them because my childhood was spent locked in a bathroom thanks to OCD (I’ll talk more about that in a bit) but I do love them. My dad is so stressful sometimes and I think I have some trauma from when he yelled and screamed at us when we were kids, and he threw things at us. He’s gotten more tame with age. He’s 60-something now. He’s also mean to my mom verbally, I think he just jokes around (but my mom doesn’t seem to know he’s only kidding) about how she “forgot this at the grocery store” or “has been sitting at home all day while he worked” or “has been a lazy mom” and stuff like that when she takes care of the house all day and deals with my brother who is kinda ending up like my dad.... they aren’t the biggest problem though. My parents still love each other.

My sister is a problem. She’s 2 years older than me, as I’ve said, and is almost graduated from college with a bachelors degree. She messed up or something cause she was supposed to graduate this year in May, but needs 6 more credits which she’s doing over the summer. She has no job and hasn’t had one for a few years. The college she goes to is weird, and she’ll spend 4 months at school in Idaho and come home for 2-3 months. My two other older sisters have gotten jobs while at home and then simply took time off to go to college, but she never took a job since high school. She never saved money and spent a lot of my parents’ money on her friends and on herself while in college. Barely paid any tuition. Has her own car my parents bought years ago but she doesn’t pay for gas or repairs (even though she gets to accidents maybe twice a year or more) and she buys herself lots of clothes.

She’s all around lazy, is not trying at all, and is a toxic personality. People see her as a nice person. People that have to live with her know that she’s snappy and spoiled and eats all the food and leaves trash out for the dogs to get into and doesn’t shower more than once or twice a week and is very snappy to my parents when she has her “moods”. She’s recently been diagnosed with bipolar after being treated for ADHD and depression or something since late high school. 

She was prescribed new meds and supposedly they’re “working” but she doesn’t seem any better. Still throws tantrums and yells at people and is super lazy and stresses even my parents out... She was given the car while in college in order to drive herself to a therapist and she never went. She does however proclaim to my parents how they were “neglectful” and were horrible and made her this way. And she shouts about how hard her life is. But she uses it as a crutch and she uses it to gain sympathy from everyone. 

I have OCD. Since 5 years old. It wasn’t too bad until 8th grade or so, but before then it was still disruptive. That older sister was the main trigger for my OCD. SHE had germs that spread to where she sat and the things she touched and I had to rub the germs off, sit weirdly on one leg in the car because I didn’t want to sit where she sat, I had to mimick her noises (coughing, sniffing, etc.) and I’d have to wash all my sheets if she touched my bed. We didn’t share a room. She would touch my bed anyways whenever I screamed at her to stop. She would touch my stuff and touch me. She loved giving me anxiety. I don’t care that we were both children, she knew what she was doing. When 8th grade came, I locked myself in my bathroom attached to my bedroom to avoid the germs and noises and just to have a safe place without her in it. My brother became a trigger as well and would do things to give me anxiety.

I overcame my OCD in high school at age 16, with exposure therapy. It’s been under control for the most part since then. I worked hard. I went through hell doing exposure therapy in order to make myself better. Due to quarantine and the stress of that, I had a bit of a fall back in April or May. Not bad, but I don’t like sitting where she sat before and I don’t like her moving my laundry around. Now, you may ask why I don’t do exposure therapy to it.

Because I don’t like her. I don’t want to have a relationship with her. She thinks we’re best friends, so it’s not harming her at all. I can’t tell my parents because they’ll force exposure therapy and they’ll be disappointed that I relapsed. I mean, I know they won’t blame me, but I still won’t tell them. I just can’t after them praising my strength and work ethic. Without that, they wouldn’t be proud. I mean, I think they would be, but my mind doesn’t see that. Basically I have no reason to go through all that hell again. Before, I wanted out of my bathroom and to be able to drive and to live my life, because I knew that I wasn’t as happy as I could have been. I didn’t do it for my sister or brother or parents. I did it for myself. 

Now. I could move out, true. But the reason my OCD is getting stronger is likely because of her. My brother isn’t stressing me out, and the OCD isn’t revolving around him at all. My sister is. My sister doesn’t want to help herself with her own crap that then spills over and stresses us all out. My sister is a person that I’m not willing to go through hell for just to make her happy. She attempted suicide a few years ago and blamed it on me indirectly. She’d say “because you got all the attention because of your OCD, I got depressed and didn’t feel loved and then I wanted to kill myself.” I did not get more attention. None of my siblings agree with her. She’s never been neglected. In fact, my dad took her on many trips with just her to spend time with her. But she always went on my own trips with him and I never could get away from her. I got yelled at by my mom when I asked her to rewash my things. My parents didn’t know I had issues Till 8th grade. 

Also, she’s abusive to my parents. Verbally abusive. She calls my dad or mom lazy and useless and a horrible parent for no reason other than “my online class is stressing me out! Mom your neglect is the reason I have issues and is the reason I get stressed! Screw you” or “dad your neglect made me so delusional and now I told my friend something crazy. So thanks dad” and other things that don’t even connect or make sense. They told me they were less stressed without her at home and they cry every day when she IS home. They want her to move out and get a job so they don’t need to deal with it anymore. 

So I told them to make her get a job. She is almost graduated and could get a decent job cause of that. It’s not my fault she didn’t save money, it’s not my fault she doesn’t help herself. It’s not my fault that she’s making my life miserable right now. She gets to mooch off my parents and stay with them and make everything about her while I pay car insurance every month and I pay for gas and for my clothing and for anything I may need. I even pay for food sometimes. I’ve worked while going to community college. I’ve not been abusive to my parents. I told my mom that she needs to go because she’s ruining everything. I’m not ready to move out, I don’t want to make my maltipoo move and I don’t want to leave her behind. I’m only 20 and she’s 22 and almost finished her bachelors degree. I went through hell to get mentally healthy as a teenager and now I need to move out before I’m ready because she’s a lazy mooch. My mom told me I don’t need to move out, but I can’t stand her anymore. I have anxiety attacks every day. I cry myself to sleep. I want to leave but I’m not ready.... I hate feeling sorry for myself but I can’t help it. My parents say she’s suffering and because of that she gets to be abusive and unhygienic and leave tissues all over the house and scream at my little brother and hit the family dog for no reason and guilt me.

Why did I work so hard and get a job and a drivers license and save so much money and be a nice person when this is the end result....? Why did I do exposure therapy and help my parents out with payments and become an adult if I’ll feel forced out of my own home before I’m ready? 

This is all over the place and long. I’m sorry. But I had to let it all out. Am I being selfish or ridiculous? Am I an evil person? Am I a terrible daughter? I just don’t know. All I know is that I’m getting super anxious and miserable here but I’m not ready to move out. I don’t know what I’d do with my dog, either way it would be painful. I have money and stuff but I’m not done with college yet, I’ve just started because I’ve been working at my job and working on my mental health. I could pay rent and I would survive, but I feel like if I move out, my sister will have uprooted my life and ruined it once again. I know it sounds stupid. I just am torn and I don’t know why but at the same time I DO know why but I don’t know if my reasoning is good. Any help would be nice. Sorry for the long post. Let me know if anything needs clarification or anything.

904,"I'm 15 years old, so still in school, and Basically, this other girl and I have been friends for a long time but have only gotten close last year, and ever since December 2019 or January 2020 I think, I felt like I've had feelings for her. also, I was just imagining the first time we're going to see each other after this whole pandemic is over and I started tearing up a bit because I miss her so much.

However, I'm almost 100% sure that she doesn't like me back, she's one of the most popular girls in my class and although we're close, I'm pretty sure she doesn't think about me in that way.

I feel like holding it in has been really hard on me but I'm really scared of losing our close friendship if I tell her and she doesn't feel the same way. that's why I've been holding it back all this time but idk lately I've started to get more and more attracted to her.
That and also something she said on our group chat of around 20 people. basically, she said that she thinks that if you think you like someone, you should tell them even if it might ruin your friendship because life is about taking risks and all that.

now from one side, that encouraged me to tell her but on the other side, I felt like I shouldn't because if she had feelings for me, by that logic, she would have told me so. so I've just been really in the middle and have no idea what I should do.

907,I’m 20 years old. I live with my dad and my boyfriend in my dads home. I’m going to school full time but when I graduate with my masters I intend to move out. My dad always likes to play around with hypotheticals and we explored the idea of him moving with us when we move out. He offered to use the equity in his home to make the down payment if we make the mortgage payments and he’s fine with having his own little in law quarters with a kitchenette so we aren’t always on top of each other. This would give us the ability to afford a house we otherwise could not have. As someone with anxiety I think having him around would provide some comfort as well. It would also be great to have him around to look after and be around our future children and I think he would benefit from having family around him instead of living alone.

912,"Hey guys so I have been working reception at a 24 hour emergency animal hospital since the whole COVID thing. I use to work in the boarding department till it shut down and they made me go up front until it reopens. 

I have this coworker receptionist who recently got switched to do reception/another department. We have been CRAZY busy this weekend with Memorial Day and all and it’s been super stressful because about every vet around is closed! So people are lighting up our lines about the whole shift. 

So that girl was a third receptionist today and she was sitting in the back doing more estimate like stuff. So one doctor came up and asked me to send an estimate and the other girl was literally looking at the doctor too and heard everything. So then the girl walks to the back and the phone rings about 4 times so I didn’t get to send the estimate right away and I had written done what I had to do in my notes so I took care of the phone calls and the girl was back by then and didn’t help me with any line. Then another girl from the back walks up and asks about if we got money or anything from the people and if we sent it and the one girl goes ask her she sent it. Then I was like hold on let me think (because I just got over 4 phone calls) and she was like well she gave you stuff so you can answer it” (with attitude!) then I kinda snapped back which I never do! I was like “well she didn’t give me anything” and she’s like “well she did” and I was like “well she didn’t so” pretty sassy.. I’m never like that! I was so stressed from the day and yesterday so I felt defeated and was mad she was giving attitude when I was struggling. (Keep in mind I never got real training for this position they just through me in).

Then I had to ask her something and see her pointing over at me talking to the manager in the hallway and I was livid! This girl constantly will snap at me and I don’t care and don’t say anything to anyone but I snap back once and she tells on me? (At least thats what it seemed like). Also she’s the kind of person to twist a story and make it like I mad mad or something for no reason!

914,"I just wanted to make a post to see if anyone had any advice for how to break up during lockdown.
I can't go see them, we live separately and I have no way of travelling right now. 
I know it is cliche, I really don't want to hurt them any more than necessary. I have been trying to figure out if I should leave it until after lockdown is over but I don't like the idea of lying to them.
 Possibly important context: they haven't done anything 'bad' and we haven't been dating very long. 

Any advice on how to handle breaking up during this crazy time would be appreciated. I don't know if I should call or video call or text or email (last two were a joke) or if I should just hold off on breaking up for a while.",24May2020,1

916,"My sibling has been with their partner for almost 9 years. They were living in England together (with a lil dog). Both they're families (including me) are in Wales. Please note I am trying to keep their genders out of the post.


During lockdown it seems like my siblings partner decided it wasn't working and I think they had a big argument. All I know is my sibling's partner said that my sibling works too much and their partner feels ignored. My sibling has told me very little. 

Prior to COVID I was up their house for a week and I could see clear as day that my siblings partner was not happy. Even though my sibling was looking for houses to buy together and seemed totally oblivious. I remember one incident where my siblings partner got promoted and my sibling did not make a big deal at all, in fact my sibling was going to make a cake for a colleague. After I said what about your partners promotion did he decide to make two cakes. This promotion was almost 5 years hard work, I happened to be there when they found out they were promoted. Even I was was proud and happy. When my sibling got home the first thing my sibling said was ""how much money do you get now?""

From what I witnessed over the years my sibling seemed to control their lives a lot. I warned my sibling so many times he needs to speak to his partner. Because it was clear they were not happy.

Anyway, my sibling told me almost two weeks after his partner moved out that he needed to come home and asked to stay at mine, before breaking down in tears and hanging up. Yes breaching the COVID laws. What was I going to stay? ""No stay in Engalnd on your own in the home you and your partner were living him"". So my sibling has been here about 1 week and they are only now being becoming hysterical and I just found him in my room crying and sending a barrage of texts to their now ex. My sibling is saying they want to be alone. What can I do? My sibling has 0 friends they rely on just me and I have tried for years to make my sibling develop friends.

Which brings me to the point of this post.

This is not the first time something like this has happened. It happened three years ago. My partners sibling ended it, this time for my sibling messenger an ex. After this happened i had 3 months of constant calls from my sibling. It only stopped because they got back together. This destroyed me, it made me servery anxious and it almost destroyed my own relationship with my partner. I do not want to go through this again, having recently gone through quite a bit personally I was beginning to feel happier again even during COVID.

I just want some advice and kind words.

TL;DR - sibling and partner broke up. Siblings has no friends and relies on just me, they are hysterical and I'm struggling as to what to do.",24May2020,1

923,"Since I was a kid, I had trouble with self confidence, especially when I was a teenager, I was bullied at school always being called ugly and repulsive, I struggle with anorexia and bulimia, I really hated myself in and out. Now as a 24 years old, I have changed a lot, I found my style and I'm considered to be attractive to most people ( or so I've been told) I like my face and body so I thought I gained that confidence I wanted so bad. But I realised that it's the only area I'm confident in, and if people would stop complimenting me, my confidence would shattered very easily. I would love to find a stable kind of confidence, about who I am as a being and not just my look, and a confidence that I can feed on my own and not rely on other people to lift me up.

929,"Hi All,

I'm a 25M living in the midwest feeling pretty lost at this point, which is out of sorts to my typical self. Last year I lost my virginity by choice. I've always been a romantic, so I decided to wait for the right one. However, like many relationships it didn't last. While I'm thankful for the relationship and learned allot about myself in the process, there are a few things I could have done without.

For starters, midway through dating her I ended up with GHSV1 (Herpes). This was tough on me and while I never lashed out at her directly for it, I did to a certain extent become codependent out of fear, which eventually resulted in a breakup.

The second difficult thing I came away from the relationship is the realization that I have DE (Delayed Ejaculation), which in my case means I keep it up forever and never have an orgasm. This is especially tough because it's been a dream of mine since I was 7 to be a father. I was the kid drawing pictures of my future family while the other boys would draw pictures as policemen, athletes and firefighters.

Additionally, shortly after the breakup my ex got back with her previous boyfriend of three years. Just like any breakup this sort of stuff hurts. However, when you love someone you want what's best for them, so I haven't reached out to her and I hope she's happy.

To be honest, I've been told I'm a very attractive guy and I know my career is taking off, so I'm not concerned about drumming up interest. However, leaving my first real relationship with genital herpes and the realization I may not be able to have kids has been hard. 

I've tried STD specific dating sites with a little luck, but I'm not sure where to turn from here. Any advice?

930,"I’m going to keep this as short as possible. 

My mom and I don’t have a great relationship when it comes to talking about anything personal. We don’t talk about our feelings, mostly because she refuses to do so with me. I still see her every once in a while and we have small talk but that’s it (I’m 20 years old and female.) 

She married my step dad last year and ended up having my baby brother with him, she’s 40, he’s 30ish. He’s also an alcoholic and pretty rude to me and my sister, but he helps me out more than my mom by letting me do chores around the farm for extra money. 

There was a girl I graduated with who was a year younger than me so she’s 19. Now here’s where I need the advice: another friend told me that she heard about my step dad buying vape products and alcohol for this girl without my knowledge, she probably would’ve told me more but I really didn’t want to know so I cut the convo short. He absolutely wouldn’t even buy me juul pods even though I’ll be 21 sooner than she. 

The guilt is kind of weighing on me about telling my mom or confronting my step dad but Idek what I’d say? Should I try and find more info on the situation or should I leave it be? My mom has no one else in the state we live in now, the rest of our family is hours away and she’d have to move away and take my brother with her.

My little brother is 14 years old and is not neurotypical. He gets hyper focused and does have addictive tendencies. He is very sweet, but does become obsessed with video games and movies. My mom does not care to learn about games, so she defers to me. She'll put general restrictions down, then let me use my judgement to determine what's ok for him. 

Recently, he got a new game (that was approved through the established channels) and put 40 hours on it already (within 2, maybe 2.5 days). He had only stopped to eat and go to the bathroom, he had not slept at all. 

She's worried about how this will impact him - his health, his social interactions, his mental health, etc. I don't have a good grasp on this, because when I game I've always self-regulated and I'm unsure of what kind of time frame to establish. I've tried searching for screen time limits for teenagers, but the sources are either unreliable, biased, or wildly varied.

5 days ago, my girlfriend who's 17 and I decided to go on date with each other and have dinner after that, her family are friends with my family. Everything was great until my stupid friend (who used to be my best friend before I broke up with him because of what I'm going to say).  First I'm going to explain what him and I were doing before he mistakenly because of his stupidity and excessive happiness he had told them a secret which embarrassed both us and the person he was making of popped out of nowhere and made the situation much worse!

We needed some money to buy what we need. My friend knows a prostitute (she's 27 years old), he told me to be her pimp and he'll find some clients for her etc.

I was on date with my girlfriend and everything was great until we were about to have dinner outside. He told me he would come but he didn't come and we were waiting for him, suddenly he came and he looked so happy and mistakenly told me something which is secret and something I didn't know and I never wanted it or helped him or asked him to do it which caused this huge problem!

He came to me and told ""we're rich now my friend! I stole all the money from that crazy prostitute that you're dating!""

I told him ""what the f\*\*\* are you talking about! I don't even hang with prostitutes! If you ever say that again I will beat you up.""

My girlfriend looked at me and told me ""is this true?""

I told her ""no, he's just being stupid.""

My friend said ""yeah I was just messing around!""

Suddenly, that prostitute popped out and she called me and my friend ""thieves, frauds, pimps"" and asked me why I didn't answer her calls and she told my girlfriend that I was cheating on her and I'm (me) her pimp and my friend and I stole her money etc. I didn't know what to say and didn't know what to say, so I've tried to tell the prostitute to stay calm and I will explain everything. My girlfriend got so mad at me and she starts yelling at me and my family got so mad at me too. The prostitute asked us to give her her money back, I was afraid of her and I know she's stronger than both of us so I didn't want to fight her and get beaten up in front of everyone. My friend is weaker than me but he has stronger personality and braver than me. He wanted to beat her up but she beat him up within seconds in front of everyone and took her money from him! Then she approached me and I was so scared, I told her to listen to me and I didn't ask him to do and I don't know. I told her to have mercy on me, she had ruined my dignity and I told her to take all the money and just go but she started to punch me and I tried to block her hit and not to make them feel like I'm afraid of her or getting hurt then she stopped hitting me and grabbed me and threaten me she will beat me up like my friend if I ever tried to contact her then she gave me one punch which floored me, then she left and I got up and I felt so embarrassed. My girlfriend told me she does not want to see me again and my parents started to criticize me after a few minutes of being criticized, my parents told me to find my own home and they don't want to see me again! I don't know how that prostitute found out our  whereabouts.

I left the place and my friend was with me, I told my friend that he is very stupid, and I do not want to be his friend or see him again. Then I went back home and took my stuff, I have some money and it was enough to rent a small apartment, I don't know about my friend.

I want to get back home but my parents and my siblings do not want me anymore after finding out that I was a pimp and they think I wanted to rob my prostitute which is not true! I never wanted to rob her and my girlfriend and my family weren't supposed to find out about that.

Tldr: My family disowned me and do not want me anymore, my friends and my girlfriend cut ties with me and do not want to see me anymore because one of my friend mistakenly told them (he said it loudly) a secret that none of them was supposed to find out about it. I just want to be home with my family (mom, dad and 2 older siblings). What should I do?",24May2020,1
952,"hi, i'm 19 years old and female. i moved away from my abusive parents 3 months ago to live with my fiancé, which was ok for a while until i could feel myself becoming more and more unhappy with him and our living situation (we're in a trailer.) and i could never tell if i was being overdramatic or bitchy or what. 

we ended up finding a kitten two months ago and keeping it, and since then it's been an uphill battle with him. he is constantly antagonizing it, and today i showed him bite marks from the kitten (from hours before) and he just picks the cat up and hits it IN THE FACE. i was raised with animals so this was very upsetting for me and i yelled at him to which he responded with ""why are you so upset over a fucking cat"" and then got pissy and drove away, i don't know where. 

i'm just so stuck and i don't know what to do anymore. do i leave him? do i move back in with my abusive parents which would make me even more unhappy? i don't have any friends anymore that i could stay with. i'm really lost and any help is appreciated.

956,"Hi friends. I'm 22 years old, and I take care of my mentally ill 52 year old father. He was up-until-recently homeless, but I took him into my apartment about two years ago. I wasn't ""excited"" about it, I just felt it to be my implicit obligation to help my kin-folk. It has been a particularly miserable time for me since. 

So anyway, he was recently awarded about $12,000 from the Social Security Administration. This money has been more than a curse than a blessing. He is blowing this money on absolute garbage. A motorcycle, a tv, and clothes. It's important to remember that, except for his regular $522/month, this is all the money he will have for the rest of his life. He's severely mentally-disabled and makes horrendous financial choices. 

He really believes I will take care of him for the rest of his life. He has no drive to re-enter society and get back on track. He just wants to live in my apartment until he dies, on my dime. I see him wasting all this money as a clear statement ""I'm taken care of forever, I can do anything I want"" and it makes me angry. 

So that's the backstory; here's the ""I need advice"" part:
What should I do? If you were me, how would you go about approaching this problem? The thing is that I can feel my charity running out; and I don't want to throw him back into the street, but something MUST change. Remember, he suffers from severe mental illness and is taking 6 mental health medications a day (I can provide a list if that would help you give advice). 

It's just been really hard lately. It feels like I have a physical chain on my leg that was simply given to me by fate. I don't know what to do, and I don't know what would be considered fair to him.",24May2020,1

All the windows are completely shut and we didn't find any cat corpses on the ground. There is no way she could have fallen.  
We have also checked every closed space, she didn't get stuck or hide anywhere.  
We suspect she went into the room outside the apartment while he wasn't looking and god knows what happened after. Maybe she went into the elevator, maybe someone got her, who knows.

970,"I’m in the uk and although lockdown is being eased we are absolutely not free to continue with our lives like we were before. 

Let me explain my situation; I’ve just finished university. I had my next few years all set out but due to coronavirus it means it is no longer an option. The industry I wanted to get into won’t be recruiting any time soon so I have at least a year to kill. 

I keep changing my plans pretty much daily. I’m seriously lacking in something to look forward to an aim towards. I have money saved up and all of my plans are pretty much an option for me but I can only do one. My first one is travelling. I want to see the world. Now I’m not sure when I’ll be able to do that but I don’t mind waiting till the winter or a bit beyond as it allows me to save more money. 

The second is to invest in myself and my career. If I do this then I probably won’t have enough money to travel and there is no saying that my investment would actually pay off. It just allows me to do what I want to do for a job but not get paid. Although he experience itself would be good to have I would maybe not be making any money and gain very little from it. 

The third is to study a masters. Before corona I absolutely did not want to under any circumstances do another year in education. I just want to get out and work. But right now there is nothing to do so I’m thinking maybe I should do a masters. 

Also I find it hard to commit to a relationship at the moment. I’m talking to a girl and it looks really promising but I just don’t know what my life is going to be like and I feel it’s unfair for either of us to catch feelings if we just can’t have a relationship at this time. But this is the only linear thing that I feel  I can have at the moment.

I seriously don’t know what to do with my life for the next few years every time I think I know what I’m going to do I change my mind sometimes even an hour later. I feel I have nothing to look forward to my friends all live in different parts of the Uk so even when lockdown is lifted fully I won’t really be able to go out with them like we use to.

971,"Basically as the title says.

I am so sorry this post is so long. Guys please bear with me! Please! And I'm also absolutely sorry for my English, it's not my native language _/\_

I found out about this when I was in high-school. Told me dad about a text from so and so person that came when I was using his phone. He freaked out, took the phone back and didn't really respond in a normal way. Which made me doubt there was more to it than I saw. Didn't really understand the gravity of it but knew it was something wrong. So I kept looking at my father's phone. Installed a couple of call recording softwares and heard conversations I wish I didn't. It kind of broke all the respect I had for him.

The sad part about it was, all the while he has been very abusive to my mom. And me. I never really liked him but I guess listening to that one conversation shook me into reality of the weight of this situation. I never told my mom because I didn't know how. I didn't know how I could approach her with this and I didn't know if she could take it. She is a high BP patient, thanks to my dad.

Fast forward 4 years, my mom found out. Just his real bad luck that a text popped up and she happened to look at it. Which we usually do. To tell him if an important call or text came from office and he wasn't there. But this time the text arrived at midnight which made my mom suspicious. Sure enough she looked through and found all that he was doing.

All hell broke lose. She found the selfies and the texts and everything I feared she might not be able to handle. She tends to get very angry when she's disappointed rightfully. She is a wonderful woman and the strongest I know. This whole fiasco just made me lose trust in marriage where someone tried as hard as she does to keep the family going and he thanked her this way in return. We are from India and she had an arranged marriage. My mother had a job at the time and my dad didn't. She never questioned him and only said that she was earning enough for both of them. I just don't understand how he still kept mentally torturing her all the while and also do this.

What should I do? What can I do? The fights are absolutely horrible each time she finds something on his phone. I'm pretty sure the entire neighborhood knows. He swore on every God possible that he did nothing wrong and will cut all communication but all he did is just start covering his tracks better. The screaming matches go on for hours and hours disturbing me from doing anything else and it is affecting me very badly too. At times he goes on to project the problem on to my mother saying, she was too close to a lot of men so this is her punishment (I swear this is not true. She is an angel. I know he's trying to rile her up). Her BP is something that concerns me a lot. I tried talking to my dad and he won't talk. He said he wouldn't tell the details even to mine or my mother's dead bodies and the truth will die with him.

I'm unable to focus on work or studies and it is fucking my head to see my mom so depressed. She's acting strong for me but she's no longer my mom. I'm always asked to check on him or see his phone and I just miss her. I have no one to talk to. I worry about her. I worry about myself. Any advice would be appreciated guys. Please. I'm sorry again this is so long.

973,"I’m a 16 year old male who has lived in a duplex apartment complex for the past 8 years. Our next door neighbors (to the left, right, and above us) cause me living hell at this point. The residents to the left housed an old man, his wife, and his early-to-mid twenties son. The old man constantly worked on his car, yelling, using profanity when mechanics wouldn’t function properly. He was a nuisance. 2 years ago, he moved out of town to settle down with his wife, leaving his obnoxious son to inherit the home. Ever since then, the noise has been more frequent and even louder. The son works in mechanics, like his father but has no workspace other than his driveway which happens to be right outside my bedroom window. He constantly turns on his boat and motorcycle which are tricked out so they’re even louder than you would expect. He doesn’t even go anywhere in the motorcycle and probably takes the boat out only a few times a year. He blasts music for only a few minutes at a time but at a volume which shakes our unconnected houses. He has friends over (during the virus) all the time to come drink beer and listen to music and do karaoke. You can hear his entire phone conversations which last 40+ minutes. It’s so loud you can hear the person on the other line. Clearly. When he is on the phone or talking to any of his visiting friends, it’s pretty rare to go more than 5 seconds without hearing the words “fuck” “fucking” fuckin” “fucked” “fucker” “motherfucker” or “motherfucking”. This is all so terribly audible in my house with the windows closed. It’s infuriating. 

On to the neighbors on my right. Asian family. A mother and her toddler make noise in the early wakings of the morning when the toddler realizes that his true calling is to be a rooster and wake everyone up. I swear this kid’s scream is piercing and it definitely doesn’t help that his mother yells at him in an Asian language but that’s all she does. She just yaps at him. Not in an aggressive way but in a way that makes we want to make fun of her in a racist way. I know that sounds terrible but their level of noisy is pretty much just annoying rather than the infuriating people to my left. 

Ohh forgot to mention the father of the toddler smokes hella cigarettes and we disgustingly hear him hawk up loogies all the time.  

Ahh yes, my upstairs neighbors. They’re a retired couple who’s kids are out of college and don’t live at home. So it’s just the old man and woman, right? Should be quiet, right? Nahhh. They are up in the wee hours of dawn walking around in what sounds like boots made of lead or like cinderblocks. Also, I randomly hear noises as if the old man really does have a prosthetic leg and walks up the stairs, goes inside, and tosses his fake leg in the middle of the floor. I never hear them shouting or making noise with anything but their feet. But it could be any time of the day. 

So all in all, my neighbors drive me crazy. My parents, however, don’t seem to want to do anything about it. My mom talks about going over there to talk to them, which we have before, but she doesn’t ever do it anymore. I have stuck my head out my window and asked them to be quiet because I’m trying to sleep and he continues working on his boat of motorcycle. It happened this morning when I lost an hour of sleep because of him. In fact, he just turned it on as I’m typing this. So my dad won’t say anything to them either because I think he’s scared of them hating him or something. I think he doesn’t want them to think he’s lame which is funny. I’ve asked about calling the police and my dad said he didn’t think they could get in trouble for something like that. I think he might also be hesitant because we know the dude on the left has a gun collection and if we tell him to be quiet he might shoot us?? Nice logic dad. Anyway I want to notify the authorities because I’m tired of him and want him out of my life. I’ve asked my parents if I could peacefully just walk over there and talk to him but they won’t let me. I know this will probably he buried so I just wanted to rant/vent but thanks for reading if you did and let me know if you have any advice for me. It would be greatly appreciated. 

Also I’m curious, what level of noise do you find acceptable. Would you be fine living in this situation? Am I overreacting?

tl;dr: I’m fed up with my incredibly noisy neighbors and want to take action but my parents won’t let me.",24May2020,1
974,"My mom is celebrating her only children graduating, me, the oldest, from college and her youngest from high school. My school cancelled all ceremonies (the total number of graduates was about 5-6,000) and my younger sibling’s high school graduation ceremony (much smaller, about 100) was in a parking lot where everybody was in their cars watching students, wearing masks, walk one at a time across a stage. We had originally planned a party for this week but canceled it when most of the US went into lockdown, around early-mid March. Now that businesses are “re-opening,” my mom is dead-set on having a party at the end of June to celebrate our graduations and is inviting around 50 people, of whom she expects “half to actually show up.” My mom, when we have discussed the pandemic, has expressed that businesses need to reopen because the economy just can’t take it. I can’t STAND this opinion but have been scared to raise my objections because my parents are both conservatives and even if they do believe the virus is real and we should take precautions, they seem to me (like a lot of Americans appear) to be all too willing to accept the risk or human cost of saving “the economy.” I also know that even in ordinary circumstances, this party would intimately not be about me but my mom celebrating me (not saying this in a malicious way, but the way anyone whose mom is ever insisted on throwing them a party will understand).
She is planning on sending out invitations in a couple of days and up to this point I have played along with wanting the party but have been doing my best to drop hints like “well we never know, if things aren’t better by then it might not be safe.” The more I think about it, the more it fills me with anxiety and nausea just thinking about being around 25 or so people, especially since I do not believe my parents will force all their guests to wear masks. I do not actually live with my parents so I DO have the option of just staying home and not attending, and I would likely not have to deal with face to face fallout from this conflict for a while.
I’ve tried thinking of ways of telling her I don’t want a party, that it would stress me out far more than I’d enjoy it, but I ultimately don’t know if she’d care, or she may think I’ve been lying about wanting a party to hurt her or something. I’ve even considered saying I feel sick on that day, or just telling her I’m coming then turning my phone off and dealing with the consequences of not showing up later, both of which would make me feel absolutely shitty, as well as just being rude. What I WANT to tell her is that it’s not about her, that OF COURSE I want a party I just don’t think it’s safe, and that it’s abhorrently selfish to think our desire to party is more important than risking the lives of all of our friends and family. Right now the best thing I can think of telling her is that if things don’t get *better* in two weeks, we should cancel the party. Not stay the same, I mean I want our case count to rapidly fall while our testing rate goes up. In the end, I’m worried it won’t matter what I say, that my parents will send out the invites and be absolutely furious with me if I refuse to attend. If this transpires, I’m scared they’ll think I’m hurting and embarrassing them by not coming to my own party, which obviously is not my goal, but a corner I’ve been backed into.

977,"Hello everyone,

English is not my first language so please bear with me.

Due to corona I (21f) and my sister (20f) are currently staying with our mother. My mother and my sister often clash because:
a) my sister can be very hot headed and stubborn and
b) my mother demands respect (1 gen. immigrant) and is also very stubborn and hot headed.
In my mothers culture, elders are to be respected and family is the most important. As the oldest of a lot of siblings she is used to getting respect from her family. Now most of our family lives in a different country so she latched onto my sister and me and tries to keep us as close as possible. She had quite a hard time when emmigrating, especially after the divorce of my parents a few years ago. This is why I am more lenient and help her a lot (mostly with administrative stuff, translation for her etc.)

Our mother loves us both a lot and constantly tells us so but she and my sister fight a lot when they are staying together for too long. I don't really fight with my mother because I am a bit passive and just do stuff when I am told but my sister is more outspoken.
Yesterday they had a fight about a small thing and now my mother isn't really talking to my sister even though my sister tried to bury the hatchet. My sister was very hurt by this and told me that she often doesn't feel like our mother doesn't really like her as a person and that most of our relatives have a bad image of her based on what our mother tells them (she used to be quite bratty when she was younger but she changed a lot since then). She says that she knows that our mother loves her but that she feels like she doesn't really like having her around and that it is difficult to connect to her.
The thing is, I know that my mother doesn't create a bad image with our relatives on purpose but in her culture, siblings/relatives tell each other everything, so she just vents to them and doesn't really think about how that affects my sister.

Now I don't know what to do because I love both of them a lot and I feel somewhat responsible because I feel that by beeing to lenient I enabled my mothers behaviour and caused people to compare my sister and me, but I don't really know what to do. I have tried talking to my mother in the past but nothing really changed.
My mother isn't a bad person and she does care a lot for my sister and me and she tries to treat us as equally as possible and is very affectionate but she is quite stuck in her ways and I just don't know how to get her to realize how her behaviour is hurting my sister.

Do you have any advice? I feel so helpless right now.

981,"I originally planned to post this on r/AmItheAsshole with the title of ""AITA for refusing to attend my childhood friends graduation?"", but the story is way too long. 

Tl;dr: &gt;!One of my childhood friends became a bad influence, so I cut him off. Now, my mom is guilt tripping me for not going to his graduation.!&lt;

Sooo... Where to start with this.

This old friend of mine. We'll call him Peter.

Me and Peter never went to the same school. We met in Boy Scouts when we were about 11.

We were absolute best buds back in the day. We did EVERYTHING together in Scouts- Played sports, walked to certain places where you needed a buddy, slept in the same tent where we stayed up all night talking about random things, and many other things. Ofc, we hung out outside of Scouts several times, doing things together- Parties, sleepovers, you name it.

Now, as for school names, we're just gonna use \[HS #1\], \[HS #2\], \[HS #3\], and \[Private School\]. Feel free to copy and paste them into a text editor and use Find/Replace to replace them with school names in your area or something.

In my freshman and sophomore year, I attended \[HS #1\]. Peter is a year behind me in school, so my sophomore year was his freshman year. Keep in mind, we NEVER attended the same school

I never had that many friends in \[HS #1\]. In fact, on my 16th birthday, Peter was the only one who came to my birthday party. Peter was currently attending \[Private School\].

In my junior year, I was homeschooled, and also switched to a different Scout Troop, so me and Peter didn't see each other in Scouts anymore. However, we still hung out all the time, even when I pretty much had no more friends since I was now homeschooled. Peter even helped me out quite a lot with my Eagle Project.

Now, this all sounds innocent. We were best buds, all until... My senior year (Or his junior year) happened.

For my senior year, I attended \[HS #3\], meanwhile Peter stopped going to \[Private School\] and started attending \[HS #2\]. I actually ended up being pretty popular at \[HS #3\], and on a Friday night in September, my work called me and asked me not to come in because business was slow.

Since this was a Friday night and I didn't have any plans, I made a Snapchat post that basically said, ""Off from work tonight, who wanna hang?""

Peter swiped up on my story literally only about a minute after I posted it, and said that he's going to an amusement park that's about an hour away with his new GF from \[HS #2\] and some of her friends, and asked me if I wanted to join him. I figured why not, and decided to head over there. 

At the amusement park was where I met a girl, we'll call her Greta.

Greta was friends with Peter's GF and attended \[HS #2\] with them. Now, this amusement park has an attraction where they put 2 people together on a harness, and drop them on a bungee cord. Peter and his GF decide to do it together, and then me and Greta did it together too, while another girl with us sat off to the side and held onto our stuff.

When me and Greta started going up on the bungee cord, we started to confess that we liked each other. After that ride was over, she told me how scared she was, how I made her feel safe, and gave me a big hug.

Then, we rode the biggest rollercoaster in the park. Greta sat next to me, and pretty much clinged to me the whole ride. After that ride, we found our picture, and bought it.

Afterwards, Greta became my first ""Official girlfriend"". We absolutely adored each other, and her parents really enjoyed me, too.

However, our relationship ended about a week before Thanksgiving. Here's the reason: She's Jewish and has actual family that's died in the Holocaust. She got in contact with some people at \[HS #1\] and asked them who I was in the past. From what I know, someone sent her a video from my sophomore year of me saying shit about Jews, then doing a Nazi salute. So uhhh yeah, that didn't play out too well.

Now, I should say one thing about Greta: She told me that she has a lot of trust issues because she was raped in her sophomore year. She told me the name of her rapist and that he goes to \[HS #2\], but I didn't know of him at the time. This might not mean much right now, but it will mean something later on in this story.

The day of my town's Thanksgiving parade was when things really started to take a turn with me and Peter.

Peter told me that he's going to be playing with \[HS #2\]'s band in the Thanksgiving parade, and asked if I could look out for him, then pick him up to hang out with some of his other friends from \[HS #2\] after the parade was over.

So, that's what we did. He took me to his friends house, we'll call him Drew. This house of Drew's was in a horrible neighborhood right near downtown. Now, I'm not the type of person to judge someone by the house or neighborhood they live in, but I quickly found out that he fits in there perfectly.

Drew starts drinking and talking a bunch of racist shit, and he even named his black lab the N word. No joke.

When it got dark, we got a knock on the door. When we answered, it was a bunch of other teenage boys, pointing at my truck and saying things like, ""Brooo Drew is that your new truck!? Congrats dude!!!"" And Drew was all like, ""Yeah, that's my truck, thanks""

I eventually had to step in and say, ""No, that's MY truck. See?"" As I pulled the key out of my pocket.

The boys started saying, ""We should go somewhere! Who wants to go to Ihop? I do! Me! Me!""

So, we all get in my truck. There was actually so many people that we had to sit many of them in the bed. Then, we go to Ihop.

When we go to Ihop, they start ordering a bunch of expensive shit, and chomp down on it. When the check comes, one asks, ""Who's got money?"" Everyone else turned down, and I said, ""I do, but I don't think I have enough...""

Then, another says, ""Shit, dine and dash, let's go! Go!"" I said, ""No, You guys sit down. We could get arrested for that."" Then, the guy whispers, ""Not if we're fast enough!"" So I said, ""Calm down, I can pay the bill.""

I ended up paying it. It was nearly $70.

When we got back to Drew's house, one guy asked me if my truck has 4WD, and I said yes. Drew then says, ""Wait, this truck's 4WD? You wanna take it muddin'?"" 

Now, I had never took my truck mudding before, and I didn't know what the consequences could be. Now, for context, my truck was an old beat-up '96 Ford Ranger, with mostly stock stuff. No big tires, lift kits, etc.

Drew takes me to this construction site behind a suburb. He takes me down this really steep hill, and starts saying, ""Yeah don't worry dude, we take trucks down here all the time!"" as my truck starts sliding like hell. Eventually, we hit something big, as my truck did a big ass bounce, and actually caused one of the guys in the bed to get a concussion. 

We get out, and noticed we hit a big ass sewer pothole, and it tore the fuck out of my front bumper.

I started panicking and yelling, ""No! No! Dammit! Shit! Oh God, oh God, no..."" 

Drew yells at me to calm down and that he can ""Fix it"". But, then we had another problem... We were stuck.

We try pushing it and everything, no luck.

And then, ANOTHER problem arises.

One thing I forgot to mention is that all of this took place at around 1 AM. And what happens when you make noise like this at this time of night near a suburb?

You guessed it. Cops.

When the cops came, most of the boys ran away into the woods. They left me, Peter, and Drew to solve it all.

Drew said to chill out and that he's ""Got this"".

He went up to the cops and told them that he knows the property owners, and he gives names to the cops. Then he tells the cops that he didn't have is ID on him, but his name is Clay. I asked him, ""I thought it was Drew?"" and he said that Drew was actually his middle name.

The cops then said that we have about another half hour to try to get it out, then we have to leave it alone until sunrise. We eventually got it out of the spot that it was stuck in, and we got it to the hill we first came down, but couldn't get it up. So we left it alone until morning. 

When morning came, we called one of my friends who has a Jeep with a winch to pull us out, and he did. We went to the carwash and washed all of the mud off. 

The last problem was the bumper. I asked Drew what he could do, and his solution? Duct tape. He just duct taped the 2 broken pieces together and said, ""There. Like it never happened.""

I went home and everything was fine, until a few days later.

My dad called me outside, pointed to the duct tape on my bumper, and asked me to explain. So, I told him the 100% truth. He then called one of his ""Cop friends"" and asked for more details about the incident. He said that Drew lied about the property owner's names, and his own info. Then, my dad asked for the names of the boys that ran away. I didn't know them, so I asked Peter. He told me their names, and I told my dad, who told his cop friend. The cop friend said that many of those boys have SEVERAL warrants out for their arrest.

So, after hearing this, I tried to tell Peter that these are not the type of people we should be hanging out with. He started saying things like, ""They're good kids and all, they're just misunderstood because they live in a bad place"" and a bunch of other bullshit.

Peter continued to force me to hang out with these hooligans all throughout my senior year, and got mad when I hung out with my other friends from \[HS #3\]. The only reason I didn't cut him off here was because he set me up with Greta, and I felt like I owed him for that, even after we broke up.

Peter, along with these hooligans, started to take advantage of me. They would constantly ask me for free rides, because none of them had a driver's license or a job. When I tried to decline, they started calling me ""Fake friend"" and some other shit. Then, whenever we stopped by a store, they would shoplift shit. Then they wanted me to take them to all of these expensive places, and expected me to pay every single time.

I should go into detail about some of the other hooligans, too. I'll start with 2 brothers. We'll call them the Dover boys.

These 2 are absolute fuckboys. They're currently 18 and 16 at the time I'm writing this, and they mainly target younger girls. They get with them just to take their virginity and move on. They make all of these fake ass promises with them- ""We'll go to prom together"", ""I'll marry you"", etc etc, but leave them whenever they take their virginity. And even after they break up with these girls right after popping their cherry, the girls STILL want them. Mainly because ""They're tall and smoke weed"". Everything else about them is just purely pathetic. Like I've mentioned before, they've never had a job, nor have they taken driver's ed. In fact, they dropped out of HS so they could ""Train to be pro athletes"" whenever they can't even make JV at \[HS #2\]. And by the way, \[HS #2\] is one of the worst schools in their conference when it comes to athletics. About 2 months before this post, they were arrested for setting fire to multiple houses around my town. They both have 10 years. The older brother's girlfriend is literally waiting for him to get out, and has said that she won't go with anyone else. I'm just gonna laugh my fucking ass off when they have sex after he gets out, then he leaves her, after she waited all that time.

Now, one day, Peter calls me over to the Dover's house to chill.

When I get to the Dover's house, they ask to go to a local burger joint, because they're meeting a friend there.

When I get there, this friend introduces himself. And when he does, it gives me a flashback.

A flashback to Greta.

Telling me the name of her rapist.

Yes. This guy, who was friends with the Dovers, was Greta's rapist.

I didn't bring up Greta, or try to start any drama at all. But, he started talking about how he's fucked, touched, drugged, and messed up pretty much every girl at \[HS #2\], \[HS#1\], \[Private School\], \[HS #3\], and even the fucking middle schools in the area. And then he talked about how he gets away with it all, because his uncle's a lawyer who bails him out every single time.

I was really tempted to take the knife out of my pocket and stab him straight through the chest with it. But I didn't want to risk going to jail. Or getting my ass killed by all the other hooligans around me.

Now, later on, I ended up getting my Eagle Scout. These boys never showed any interest in coming to my ceremony and hearing my speech, but had no problem whatsoever coming to the afterparty and eating up all of the food.

Later on, when I graduated, I sold my truck, and bought a 2010 Jeep Wrangler. All of these hoodrats who couldn't drive were VERY angry when I did this, because they didn't have a bed to ride in anymore. However, when I graduated, Peter got his license, finally, and started hauling these kids around in his new truck.

However, even after Peter got a job, he still kept bumming off of me. He kept asking me for gas money and saying, ""I'll give it back to you after my next paycheck, I swear!"" and was STILL making me pay for everything when we went out. And also, he never paid me back ""After his next paycheck"". He barely paid me back at all. Even after I had bought this Jeep, which was costing me $250/month (And still is), which is very hard for a high school graduate to pay.

Also, because my dad knew that all of these kids were a bad influence, he started making me use Life360 to make sure I wasn't getting into anymore trouble. Keep in mind, I was 18 and this is after I graduated.

Here was the final straw with him:

After I graduated, A girl I had a few classes with at \[HS #3\] said that she had a crush on me. We'll call her Caroline. I thought she was pretty cute too, and we decided to go out on a couple dates. The first one, we went to the movies and saw the Lion King remake. No problems happened here.

The second one, we went to the bowling alley. Earlier that day, Peter asked me if I wanted to hang out, and I said no, because I was going to be busy. So, Peter looks on Snap Map and sees me at the bowling alley without him. He decides to pull up with a couple of the hooligans.

He comes in and looks for me. When he finds me, he confronts me and says things like, ""You said you were busy tonight! You went to the bowling alley without me! You're such a fake!"" and more bullshit.

Caroline walks out on me.

So, the biggest reason I continued to support Peter was because he got me into my first relationship.

But now, he just ruined the next one.

The next week, I started my classes at community college, and Peter started his senior year. At this point, it was over. I cut him off completely- I blocked him, Drew, the Dover brothers, and all those other low lives that he forced me to keep in contact with- on ALL my social media. 

Now, here comes the part that I need advice on:

I just finished my first year at the community college. Yesterday, we got a letter in the mail, inviting me to Peter's graduation. My mom is trying to force me to go, and guilt tripping me because I don't want to. She's saying things like, ""You know, he was the only person who came to your 16th birthday! What if nobody else shows up to his?"" and she's telling me that I'm a horrible person for not going to his graduation when we grew up together. She's also telling me that it's been almost a year since I cut him off, and he's probably changed since then.

Tbh, I don't even think that Peter sent it out. I think it was his mom, who I'm pretty sure assumes that we're still friends.

So, should I give Peter a chance and attend his grad? Or not?",24May2020,1

985,"(Throwaway just because) I have been hooking up with this guy since August last year, because of our age gap and the fact if we started a relationship we would’ve been long distance we decided to stay friends with benefits.

When we spoke today he explained he had been in a really bad place and had not felt like speaking to anyone.

988,"Hey, I’m really posting this to see if anyone has anything similar from either POV or am I really being too sensitive and is this just normal to do 

So my friend (we’re both 21 and female) and I have been friends for like 2 years now as we work together 
We are moving in together for college in a few months and we for the most part have a great relationship 
But it was my 21st birthday earlier this month and we had big plans but of course lock down changed that.
For her birthday in January I went all out got her lovley personal gifts a tiara ballons flowers and all, we went out and had a great time
On my birthday we were talking in the weeks leading up to it that I can go to hers (as her house is in town and bigger, mines in the country side and small and boring lol) and we can have drinks in her garden while socially distancing
The day of my birthday I herd nothing about meeting up, she did say happy birthday and that my presents will be here soon but there was a delay
We didn’t meet up that day but she later had story’s up of her and her other 2 friends drinking in her garden
I’m not going to lie I was sad because I was spending my 21st alone and my friends were drinking without me 
I have them the benefit of the doubt because I’m not crazy or clingy and I know ppl have their own lives, I was just bummed Cos it was my birthday.
Now over the days after that we didn’t talk much but I was still holding out hope it was just something small and we could hang out and celebrate my birthday 
But tonight (about a week after my birthday) she’s again had her friends in and is drinking and didn’t say anything to me 
I really don’t know if I’m being sensitive or if this would make other ppl upset too?

989,"Background: I’m 27 and I live with my parents. They must always have some form of background noise at any time. They have a large floor fan that runs all night and all day. My dad listens to videos without headphones and my mom does the same. The bathroom fan is always running. My dad works from home and he has a lot of conference calls. He raises his voice to be heard on phones or video calls, and it triggers my PTSD because he used to yell at me and spank me as a child.

Lately I’ve been having increasingly bad sensory overload episodes, and it’s getting to the point where I’m physically affected. I’ve tried turning off fans, but my dad tells me to turn them back on. When I ask my mom or dad to use headphones, they tell me to either go upstairs if it bothers me(their speakers are so loud, I can hear it upstairs),or berate me for being “rude”. 

I’m on the verge of a breakdown. I just need quiet so my brain and eardrums don’t feel like they’re going to explode. I can’t use earplugs because my parents don’t appreciate not being answered when they call for me. What can I do to lessen this sensory overload space?",24May2020,1
990,"i come from a past of some physical, mostly emotional abuse and neglect from my mother. i watched her ex husbands and boyfriends leave her due to the impossibility of raising a child as fucked up as i was and their inability to contain their ugliness in response to her. she just has that effect on people. it’s equal parts amazing and terrifying.
for years and years i felt like/was a helpless little child in a corner with the only person i had in my life cowering over me out of anger rather than protection, and i don’t know how to fucking stop pitying myself. i watched her suicide threats/attempt(singular) as well as threats to drive us both into traffic on highways unfold as a result of her helplessness and anger towards the world. she used to slap herself while screaming and crying just to get a reaction out her helpless child, yours truly. but at the same time i know that she’s given up a lot for me. it’s confusing. at some point in my early childhood i just developed this mechanism of concealing whatever pain i was feeling and acting like a fucking unbreakable psychopath who has no response to the pain of others.
at the same time, i am an empath. i’m about to turn. 22, and my past few years have consisted of substance abuse, suicidal near-attempts (i HAVEA to stay alive for my sibling, no matter how clear and simple of a solution suicide seems to be sometimes. key word here is SOMETIMES, so there’s hope), self-healing, reparenting, fuckibg up, attempts to restart said healing, etc. i’ve grown to care deeply about the earth and about humans. or rather, i rediscovered my care &amp; self, shoved far beneath the surface by a lifetime of trauma, guilt, shame, i’m only just now learning not to hate myself, but all my efforts over the years were seemingly reversed by the BRIEF time i spent at home. it hasn’t even been a month, and i hit. my. own mother. on the face. i’ve never done that before. there was one time when i shoved her off my bed in elementary school causing her to fall, and i tore myself up over it, even in my adulthood. but now i feel nothing. i’ve been deeply irrational in the past month, angry over her refusal to apologize, even though i know that true forgiveness doesn’t require an apology.  angry over every little misstep on her part. angry at her and my stepdads shitty parenting of my sibling. guilty that my anger at them is reflected back onto sib. guilty that sib feels guilty for my anger. guilty that sib had to witness our fight. guilty for putting sib through this traumatic experience, i know how that feels. she had me on the floor with my hair in her fist after the slap, i kicked her really hard. she fell over. i feel awful but for some reason i can’t FEEL it right now. i just left the house with none of my possessions except my phone passport debit card and juul (lol)
i wanted to kill myself but that disappeared as quickly as it came. this was the most sudden onset + vanishing of the impulse that i’ve ever experienced. no sobbing, no hyperventilating, minimal shaking for short period of time. i hit my mother today, and now i’m lying on the ground somewhere feeling heavy but also exceptionally calm. what is wrong with me?
it feels like i have nowhere to go. my phone is broken and my replacement is arriving in the mail, but i can’t back to the house. without returning my phone i don’t have the funds for a flight or even a hotel. i know these are trivial in the grand scale of things, and not at all the true source of my helplessness. the question of “what do i do” can’t even be resolved by these minor details. writing this helped calm me a bit, even if it doesn’t lead to any solutions. thank you, for whatever",24May2020,1
991,"Sorry for that mess of a title. When I was about 9 years old, I asked for a laptop. I really wanted my own device so I could play games if I’m being honest, but I also wanted it so I could learn to code and do my occasional type-it-out homework back then. I thought I gave an amazing list of reasons for why I should be allowed to get a laptop (even willing to pay for it fully), but I was turned down by my parents. My parents are semi-strict, just as a side note.

Looking back, I understand why I was turned down, most likely because they just didn’t feel I was mature enough back then (I was 9, after all). I have since began looking at PCs, since they are cheaper for more performance, but I have never asked my parents if they would be fine with me buying one. I’m 14 right now and I have shown my parents I am mature enough (I think haha) to have a device like that, as well as that I would pay for it. However, though they say they do, sometimes it feels like they don’t trust me. For example, my dad questions everything I purchase on amazon, even if it’s something like a filter sponge for my fish tank or a usb-c hub. Small things like this could be, indeed, a small thing, but it just feels like deep down he doesn’t trust me. 

I know that this post probably sounds really immature and whiny. If you side with my parents, I would appreciate it if you could reply and tell me why cause it would help a lot.

I’m sure it isn’t a big deal and if they are fine with it that’s how it will be. If not, that’s that. But I would really like some advice on how to approach this situation. I am awful at talking and I often freeze up. How do I ask them for permission to buy a PC in a way that respects what they say while also standing my ground?",24May2020,1
992,"My mom wants to have a graduation party with upwards of 20 people; she is celebrating her only children graduating, me, the oldest (24), from college and her youngest (19) from high school. My school cancelled all ceremonies (the total number of graduates was about 5-6,000) and my younger sibling’s high school graduation ceremony (much smaller, about 100) was in a parking lot where everybody was in their cars watching students, wearing masks, walk one at a time across a stage. We had originally planned a party for this week but canceled it when most of the US went into lockdown, around early-mid March. Now that businesses are “re-opening” (even though the full time job offer I got after graduating could still be from home at that point, and all public-facing employees are typically wearing masks by law) my mom is dead-set on having a party at the end of June to celebrate our graduations and is inviting around 50 people, of whom she expects “half to actually show up.” My mom, when we have discussed the pandemic, has expressed that businesses need to reopen because the economy just can’t take it. I can’t STAND this opinion but have been scared to raise my objections because my parents are both conservatives and even if they do believe the virus is real and we should take precautions, they seem to me (like a lot of Americans appear) to be all too willing to accept the risk or human cost of saving “the economy.” I also know that even in ordinary circumstances, this party would intimately not be about me but my mom celebrating me (not saying this in a malicious way, but the way anyone whose mom is ever insisted on throwing them a party will understand).
She is planning on sending out invitations in a couple of days and up to this point I have played along with wanting the party but have been doing my best to drop hints like “well we never know, if things aren’t better by then it might not be safe.” The more I think about it, the more it fills me with anxiety and nausea just thinking about being around 25 or so people, especially since I do not believe my parents will force all their guests to wear masks. I do not actually live with my parents so I DO have the option of just staying home and not attending, and I would likely not have to deal with face to face fallout from this conflict for a while.
I’ve tried thinking of ways of telling her I don’t want a party, that it would stress me out far more than I’d enjoy it, but I ultimately don’t know if she’d care, or that she may think I’ve been lying about wanting a party to hurt her or something. I’ve even considered saying I feel sick on that day, or just telling her I’m coming then turning my phone off and dealing with the consequences of not showing up later, both of which would make me feel absolutely shitty, as well as just being rude. What I WANT to tell her is that it’s not about her, that OF COURSE I want a party I just don’t think it’s safe, and that it’s abhorrently selfish to think our desire to party is more important than risking the lives of all of our friends and family. Right now the best thing I can think of telling her is that if things don’t get *better* in two weeks, we should cancel the party. Not stay the same, I mean I want our case count to rapidly fall while our testing rate goes up (I live in the US and have *zero* faith in this being the case, I’m literally grasping at straws here). In the end, I’m worried it won’t matter what I say, that my parents will send out the invites and be absolutely furious with me if I refuse to attend. If this transpires, I’m scared they’ll think I’m hurting and embarrassing them deliberately by not coming to my own party, which obviously is not my goal, but a corner I’ve been backed into.
I’m also going to try to talk to my younger sibling today to gauge their feelings on the subject. I’m just terrified of this conversation and the rift it could cause, any advice on how to broach this topic would be greatly appreciated :(",24May2020,1
993,"The second you do this you are consenting to having a piece of you on the internet forever and no matter what you do you can never remove it. A while ago some buddies and I made a series of shitty short films just for fun. We decided to add them to IMDb just for the hell of it and after two years we deleted the films and decided to move on. We wanted to remove the pages from IMDb so we just assumed that the person who posted it would be able to delete it. Boy where we wrong. It turns out to have a page deleted we have to contact IMDb. Okay, we did that and asked them to delete the three pages as we don't want them to be viewed publicly anymore. We thought it would be simple and the next morning the pages would be gone.

Nope. I woke up to this surprising email: ""Our aim is to be the most complete and reliable source of movie information on the web. Therefore, in order to keep offering our users an accurate and trustworthy service, it is our policy not to alter or delete any kind of correct/factual information or credit from our records."" They were shitty short films that could 10 views on YouTube, who the hell would actually care about them? We tried responding with this and still we got the same response from them. And then I found out this is a common problem, people want to remove certain things and IMDb are too autocratic to let this happen. It's such a bullshit site and recently my friend missed out on a part-time job opportunity because someone found the IMDb page and didn't like it. (God knows why, they were shitty projects made for a joke).

So my advice to you is to be extremely careful about putting your work on IMDb. It might seem exciting because anyone can do it and have their name up there. But once it's done you can never remove it, and if it's a film you don't want up there, it could affect your reputation. Be extremely careful.",24May2020,1

This doche bag turned out to a drug user I told my parents and he got mad at me. Even a year later I still think about him. I recently learned that this boy only liked me because the way I looked. So that ensues self worth problems with me in my mind. Then at the beginning of this school year I started liking this other guy who thought it was okay to sexually harass/assault me. I’ve had the worst luck with guys. I’ve been harassed by my nephews in my family one calling me fat. And trying to hit me. I don’t know what to do anymore I’m tired of the physical and mental problems, I want it to stop. I have told my parents about the harassment and assault. But not the mental side of this.

18F VT USA

I'm a high school senior who will be graduating with a very low GPA in June. The only reason I'm graduating is because my advisor moved some things around and ""made up"" grades for me so I could meet the requirements for graduation. She didn't really make them up, just used credit for old things. I haven't been engaged or interested or really able to focus on school for the past two years due to extreme mental stress from my home and personal life, as well as working full time outside of school.

I still live with my parents and don't pay rent or electricity/heating, but I pay for essentially everything else of my own (phone, devices, food, clothing, etc). I can't drive which is a pretty big deal around here and I rely on my mom to drive to me and from work which thankfully she's willing to do but she's not willing to teach me to drive or let me drive her car, or even let me use her car to take the license test (it's not inspection standard anyway).

Before COVID-19 I worked full time at a movie theater but lost my job three months ago because of the epidemic. Since then I've started working at a grocery store, and as much as I hate to say it, the job has made me realize how desperately I don't want to live this kind of life. I was just trained to replace someone who was working in the office who left since he graduated college and is going to go pursue a job in his chosen field, and that combined with how terrible the work environment is here compared with my last job has really made me realize I don't want to live this life. The extreme stress from this job has had me crying a lot recently including at work and even today, on a day that was supposed to be my day off. 

The thought of, ""I don't have a graduation to look forward to,"" like the guy who I was trained to replace, and that right now there's nothing in my life other than to work indefinitely at this stupid grocery store has really made me feel terrible. I had no success in high school, in fact I'd even call it the worst four years of life due to the extreme social class isolation. This made me think I'd never be able to go to college and I've believed that since my sophomore year, but I'm starting to realize it's my only choice.

This might sound weird but one of the only things that keeps me going is my love for the Korean language and culture. Yesterday at work a customer had a 태극기 (Korean flag) bandanna that he was using as a mask. I asked him about it and we had a short conversation where he told me that he got it from his brother, who's lived and worked as a teacher in Korea for five years. For me, that's literally the dream. I'm an intermediate speaker of the language and I think I could probably score TOPIK 5 (the highest fluency level on the Korean language test) by the end of the year. It could be some misplaced dream, it could be false idealism, it could be whatever the hell it is but I really just want to go to Korea just once in my life. Whether that's to go there to work or as a tourist I don't know, I just want to go. To work as a teacher in Korea you need at least a college education, so if I want to do that, I know I need to go to college.

Is it worth inevitably having to quit at this job, probably have to get government housing assistance to move out of the countryside and closer to a city, get SNAP benefits, and essentially live off the government just to attend community college and try getting a degree? Or should I just keep at this grocery store job and save up for something? I still do have smaller goals (although they feel impossible), like to learn to drive, and to move out. Mostly I just want to have what I never got to have growing up: a middle-class type life with friends and family who care about me, where I get to do things like go shopping and buy clothing I like, or travel to foreign countries and live that kind of life you seem to see on every single social media account. I've been told by enough people that the whole ""go to Korea"" thing is just misplaced and that it's not that great so I'm starting to believe it.

Well, a lot has gone down since then. She ended up planning her wedding in a different state. I was hesitant to go when I found that out just because I can’t really afford to travel right now. But me and my other friends decided we could carpool/split a cheap motel room. I’d save up a bit and make the 2 day drive. 

Then Corona. 
I work in a facility with patients undergoing cancer treatment/chemo. All of them are immune compromised. 

I had to move when the virus first happened and was out of work for  2 months and I can’t even begin to explain the financial burden it put me under. Luckily, I was able to work for the company I had worked for in the past, just had to redo training and all that. 
Anyway, I’m still trying to make up payments and everything. 
In addition, my friend doesn’t take the whole pandemic very seriously. Her state has opened back up and she is pretty much going about life as usual. 
I’m not living in fear or any of that BS, but I am being smart and cautious. I would HATE myself if I spread anything to my patients. 

One of our friends have already backed out because her and her SO both have severe asthma. The other friend still plans on going. 

The wedding is HUGE. Over 280 people. And apparently more than half have already confirmed. 
It just makes me uncomfortable.

so sorry for bad grammar and format. I’m posting from my phone. 
Yesterday I (18f) was at Walmart. I was alone behind an aisle when someone made a “ooo” sound behind me. I turned around and a guy was riding over on one of those grocery cart scooters watching me. Idk if it matters, but I’m on the chubbier side and I was wearing a face mask, so I know he wasn’t looking at my face (I was also turned away from him). He stopped me and started asking how I was and for my name. 

He gave off really weird vibes, but I didn’t want to be rude so I spoke with him for a moment and tried to be polite. He introduced himself and asked if I had a boyfriend. I don’t, but he just seemed really strange so I told him I did. He asked for my number, but I told him that I can’t give it to him because I have a boyfriend. He kept trying to get it but I kept politely refusing. He got quiet for a moment before asking me if it’s because I don’t date black guys. at that point I felt really bad because that wasn’t the case at all (I’m actually half black if that matters) and said it was just because I was already in a relationship, nothing to do with race. 

He then switched from getting my number to getting my Snapchat, but I told him I’m not comfortable with doing that because of my boyfriend. He said “oh so you don’t play around?” And I told him no, sorry. He tried to get me to take his Snapchat “just incase” but I said no. Eventually he gave up, but he got up out of the scooter thing to give me a hug. I felt bad because I didn’t want him to think I was racist so I didn’t object to it (I know I should have bc social distancing. I wasn’t thinking right). When gave me a hug, he slid his hand down my back and grabbed my butt before he let me go. I told him I had to go, and that was it. I didn’t say anything about it because I was with my younger sister and grandma*. 

It didn’t really hit me until I told a friend about it last night and she sad that what he did was disgusting. I can’t stop thinking about it and I just feel so awful for letting that happen. I‘ve never had anything like this happen before and I think I might just be over thinking it but I don’t know. I feel so dumb. Am I overreacting??

1009,"Hi Everyone, it seems like with COVID 19 car sales have taken a hit and those selling private party newer more expensive cars aren't getting as much interest. I was in the market to purchase a vehicle and before COVID-19 got really bad a few good deals I saw were snatched up pretty quick so I wanted to jump on one when I saw the vehicle I wanted to get listed for a good deal. I found two good private party car sales this past week I wanted to move on plus a couple of other fair deals.  After negotiations I ended up purchasing one pretty quickly worried someone else would get it. I got it for a very good price, a couple thousand below KBB. After the fact the other seller of the other vehicle I was looking at has come back and offered me an even better deal along with the sellers of other vehicles i inquired about also coming back with significant price reductions. 

 I have never seen the used car market like this especially from private parties. I live in the Bay Area so I imagine due to our shelter in place that car dealers are also not buying used vehicles so these sellers probably aren't able to easily just sell to the dealer like before. It also seems right now it is hard to find a committed buyer who readily will pay $25k-$35k upfront. The seller kept contacting me coming back with price reductions and even lowered the price on their ad, which tells me it was very likely I was the only serious committed buyer they had. I am almost certain had I waited a bit longer rather than being worried someone else would have bought it I could have saved a couple more thousand. Instead of being happy I got the vehicle I wanted at a savings below KBB I am now feeling significantly disappointed I didn't hold out longer for a bigger savings due to a crashing market or wait longer and move forward with the other seller.

1014,"I really need help because it's causing me a lot of distress and causing me to fight with my mum a lot. I honestly feel hopeless and lost cause I have no idea what's wrong with me and everyone thinks I'm overreacting and that it's nothing when I know something is wrong. 


This has been happening for a while (around 8-9 years). I am a female aged 15. Considering things to do with my room, my room has never be tidy but everything was, in my mind, an organised mess and put in places I could remember and suitable for the room. 

It started when I was around 7 years old, with things like if I had a friend round and they played with something I didn't tell them they could I would feel sick and cry after they went home because of it. 

Then it progressed to if my mum moved a piece of furniture around in my room I would cry for hours/days until the anxiety went away or until it was put back to where it was before. Or if she moved my things or tidied my room without my knowledge or me being there, I would have the same reaction. As I got older I would also scream and get angry at her for it. 

Then (11 years old) it's moved from outside just my room, so if something felt out of place or wrong in the house I would move it till it stopped my anxiety and it felt 'right'.

Most recently (last couple years) it's moved to my school work, my desk is never tidy but again it's organised mess, but the problem was with assignments. In a group if everyone wasn't doing it how I said and how I planned it'd cause me anxiety and I'd just try to ignore it until the end of the lesson when it would normally go away. Another thing is I get really severe anxiety/panic attacks about work that doesn't have a very explained or simple structure or that I feel isn't PERFECT when I'm writing it.

Something that happened a couple months ago my dad changed some wires around at the back of mums tv and I had a REALLY BAD anxiety attack. I couldn't think and my only words were, it needs to go back, it needs to be right, it needs to be the same. And I'd repeat them crying and rocking my arms up and down, which for some reason was calming to me and involuntary. This caused a massive fight between my parents and me and my mum couldn't help but shout which only made my anxiety worse. I had to be taken out the room which only slightly helped the anxiety but It stopped when the wires were put back. 

As I'm writing this I'm feeling the anxiety for something that hasn't even happened yet. My father and mother don't get along so he sleeps on a sofa downstairs and he wants to get this sofa bed.... It doesn't match the other sofa... It's not the same style as normal sofas we have. All this is causing me anxiety and we haven't even brought the thing let alone have it in my house.

Last time this happened (with a different tv in the kitchen) I wasn't able to go in the room for days without almost crying from anxiety.

Although there are some exceptions, such as if I feel the change feels 'right' then I get no anxiety, like when my dad made the shed into a man cave/games room.

I was thinking it was OCD but my mother doesn't think it is. I honestly don't know what it is. My brother has autism and that was brought up but I've got no other indication of autism and even this doesn't sound like it links to it. My home life also isn't the best my father isn't a nice man and has caused me a lot of trauma but I also don't think he's the reason for this... Or maybe he is. I'm just very lost and I want this all to stop before it gets too bad.

I really need help because it's causing me a lot of pain. Thank you so much for reading aswell xx",24May2020,1
1015,"Hello reddit,

I [27M] am going through some issues that have lasted for about a few years now. I started smoking MJ in my last year of university and have been cycling between stopping and starting up again. I've recently relapsed right before my 1 year sobriety, and I now remember why I did it in the first place.

It makes me extremely calm, all my anxiety and worry disappear, and I feel I can be social and handle awkward situations better. I am happier when I am high, and I can enjoy life at its greatest potential when I am on it. I even meditated while sitting on a park bench and it felt so amazing. I can never meditate before because I always have my anxiety constantly screaming in my head. Unless I do something related to my worry, I can't relax.

But I am trying to get off of the stuff because I am worried about the long term damage it can cause. That's why I tried to get off of it for an entire year and failed. But honestly, the one day I relapsed, i felt happier than the entire year i was off of it. It was really something else, but I wish I could be in this state all the time.

I’m at a point in my life where most of what I’ve done has been to appease my parents. I never been allowed to have sleepovers, hang out with friends too often, really go out experience life socially or independently. As a result I’ve let a lot of my life pass me by, I’ve missed on plenty of childhood experiences I should of had. My parents are both controlling but my mother is especially. 

She has for so long controlled my actions/decisions, criticized my desires and wants, yelled harshly, and insulted me and my intelligence. It has been hard dealing with this—for I’ve had countless crying nights trying to forget it all. I’ve shied away from having friends, going out, or putting up much of a fight when my mom says I can’t do things; it’s been easier for me to not deal with the criticism and interrogation over every move I make.

My main issue is this: How do I once again sit her down and express to her that the way she treats (especially like a child) who in her eyes is influenced by those around and incapable of thinking for myself. 

She’s put parental controls on my phone before, cutting off wifi + blocking my phone after 10pm, taken my phone and looked through very private information (using it against me-like confronting me about being gay forcing me to come out), constantly asking me what I’m doing at all times. Though I do not pay for my phone, I still found it hard to justify the breach of privacy and strict rules when at the time I was 19—I get maybe if I was 12-15 but for Christ sake I’m an adult. Though I don’t currently have a job I do plan on getting one and saving up to move out ASAP. 

I met my girlfriend here on Reddit and we’re long distance (15hrs driving/ 2.5 hrs by plane). We’ve been together 1 year. Though she is a bit older than me, I feel as though I have found someone that I’d truly love to spend my life with. We connect in all ways and hold all the same values. My Mom is the only that knows of my gf as she fears telling my father that I’m gay because he will divorce her and break up the family. (More on that later) 

Though I understand parental concern over your child’s partner, my mom has taken it to another level. The few times a year I’ve gotten to see my girlfriend, my mother has not let me spend time with her for more than 2-4 hours with her. I cannot sleep over with her, travel further than 10 mi from my house, go to a concert or do really anything with my gf. I miss her terribly when she’s not here and it breaks my heart that I can’t spend the quality time making memories and loving her how I need. My gf has truly been amazing &amp; supportive and helping me understand the oppression I’ve lived under for so long. She’s been instrumental in letting me further know that my parents aren’t treating me in healthy way that I need. 

I’ve wanted to do more things with my girlfriend like visit her in her home state, go on vacation with her, sleep over, go sight seeing, spend the summer at her house, etc...normal things any adult couple in their 20s want to do. I hesitate to bring it up because since my gf has been around my mom believes I’m being brainwashed by her, saying yes to her all the time and being manipulated into think she really cares about me when all she could possibly want is sex b/c I’m dumb and easy. It hurt like hell to know she thinks that, because it is the furthest from the truth. 

I need feel as though I need to distance myself and start living for myself for one once in my life. I’ve avoided going to college out of state to not put my parents in 100k debt, I’ve kept quite about my feelings to not “disrupt their marriage” (as if that’s my problem), etc. 

 **I’ve stopped living my life making the decision I need for my hapinesss/sanity, so to not cause my parents pain** How do I stop? 

As a result I have sacrificed myself, my happiness, my mental health, my social life, you name it. I feel as though it’s time I do something for me. I am thinking about writing down my feelings and having the another very difficult conversation with my mom about how she needs to let go and let me live my life/make my own decisions.

I’d appreciate any help or advice on how to better go about this in any way. I am at my wits end and have nothing left in me to keep living in this depressing situation. 

Thank you for sticking around, any and all help or advice is greatly appreciated 🙏🏼 

TL/DR: My parents (mainly mom) is controlling, manipulative, judgmental, and emotionally abusive at times when yelling and speaking to me. It has broken me down and caused me to distance myself from friends and normal childhood/20 year old experiences. Now that I have a supportive and amazing girlfriend, I want to more than ever be happy, spend more time with her, and properly show her all my love without being tied down by my parents. I have sacrificed myself/mental health to appease them and not cause them discomfort/pain. How do I go about telling them I’m done and need to make my own decisions and live for myself? I’m tired of feeling oppressed, how do I break free?",24May2020,1

1020,"I know questioning your morals and beliefs is a good way of getting to know and challenge yourself. But for me it’s different, I’m even questioning whether murder is wrong. That shouldn’t   happen. I strongly believe that murder is horrific, but I’m doubting this belief. Ever since I had that one argument with my old friend about whether murdering an innocent person is ever justified (she thinks it is), I started to doubt myself. Ever since that argument, I had a weird obsession with morals (she has a thing against morals for some reason) It’s weird. It also frustrates me how she takes murder so lightly. I don’t know why I feel this way, or how to stop it. I have a thing of overthinking arguments with her, but I think of this one the most. Does this mean anything?

1021,"CW: Abuse, self harm, ptsd, depression




Ok so I (23m) have moved back to my family home until my university reopens (I only get term time accomodation at my uni in another city) and am not sure how to deal with a really unhealthy homelife.

So context: I have a sister who's 12 years older than me, and from roughly the ages 7-12 she was really abusive (describing in detail how she was going to kill me, forcing me to run a disposable razor across my fingertips etc) and my mom did very little to stop this. I have depression and ptsd stemming from these experiences. 

So because of the current circumstances, Im back in my family home with my mom, Ive told her of my experiences and mental health and she says the right things in response, but she'll do things like take calls from that sister with speaker phone on, when Ive told her that hearing my sisters voice really affects my mood. She says her phone only works on speaker, but she doent even give me time to get out of ear shot (note: i dont ask her not to talk to the sister, but ask her to do it in a way I wont hear her voice)

So Ill try to talk about stuff like this with my mom but she just acts really upset and apologetic, then goes back to doing the exact same thing. My relationship with my mom is kinda weird as she kind of facilitated the abuse and disregarded me the few times I had tried to confide in her when younger, but she also raised us by herself and has been through alot of horrific stuff which might be why she tends to just ignore problems.

So what I want to ask is how can I address this with my mom when she has acted upset and apologetic then go back to doing the same thing? I havent discussed my feelings about her complicity with the abuse and her neglect, and am worried that laying everything out will really mess with my head and upset her and just have the same result.
At the moment Ive just been emotionally distancing myself from my mom so stuff she does doesnt affect my mood so much 

(Note sure if its ok to add a second question but me and the abusive sister will both be at my brothers wedding next year, I havent told my grandparents any of the above but I cant be around the sister, should I explain the above to them as to why we cant have family pics, all be together etc or should I just find excuses to step out on the day to avoid that whole mess)

Apologies for the vent and I really appreciate any advice people have",24May2020,1
1022,"I'm 20 with no real direction of where I'm going in life and it scares me.

I moved to another country by myself  for school 2 years ago. I was in college for Finance but I ended up having to drop out because my parents stopped funding it and I wasn't able to afford both my living expenses and tuition at the same time. Also, at the time I picked Finance because I had no clue what I wanted to study so I picked what I thought was the safest option at the time. While I was in school, I knew I hated what I was studying and couldn't really see myself being in that field. Also, I was in college not university so the diploma I would recieve after wasn't really as useful as a university degree would have been.

Beyond this, I don't have any future goals or idea of what to do for a career. All I know is that I want to be making a decent amount of money and I don't want to be working odd jobs forever but I feel like my habits and lack of passion and discipline is going to keep me back forever. I literally have no idea what I see myself doing in the future and it stresses me out.

1028,"i had a best friend when i was 4 and we were great friends up until we were 15. except, our friendship was mostly painful (to me). i'm now 17f btw. 

we both grew up experiencing terrible stuff and confided in each other through the highs and lows. as we got older though (11-12), we went to separate schools and made other friends. we distanced for a few months and then got super close after the distance. except, she used to pretend to be 18 and chat with older teens on websites and convinced me to do the same with her. she would blatantly ignore me for her irl friends and those internet friends. i constantly tried to be there for her and show her i would always be there despite everything. she would only turn to me when no one else was there.

when we were 13, she tried to kill herself. that same day, my dad was literally kicking my mom, sister and i out when my best friend's aunt called and told me she (best friend) tried to kill herself, and asked me if i knew why she would do something like that. it was the worst day of my life and the worst month or so after (homeless and heartbroken lol). when she got better, she never reached out to me, but when i checked the website we used to chat to the older teens on (i deactivated my acc when i found out she did what she did), she was communicating with them like nothing happened.

i was devastated. i cried and prayed everyday for her and she reached out to them first. over time, we started chatting again but i was even more of a 2nd choice.. maybe even 16th choice. 

i went through some really rough stuff when i was 15 and during that time, i told her, we had one conversation about it and she ghosted me for months.. after those months, she messaged me on YT since i blocked her on everything else. that convo was just her wanting updates on my life and then she stopped responding.. again. to make an already long story short, this on and off thing happened for a while until july 2019 which was our last convo (she texted me on ig saying ""hey"" in march 2020 but i left her on read) til today. its almost been a year and she msgs me today saying ""hey happy eid"". idek what to do and i feel conflicted about it. 

i get so anxious seeing her text me. it reminds me of my previous days when i knew her message was the beginning of a painful period of texting before she ignores me.

1035,"Today was my first day back to work after quarantine. I work in a retail store that is the furthest thing from essential, but corporations have to make money, and I live in a red state so I'm back at work. I had a number of grievances today with how my building is handling the covid pandemic, but none of them tipped me over the edge as much as a comment from the store's General Manager. 

There were 8 of us in the building today. 3 from the management team, including myself (relevant later), and 5 associate level employees. During our meeting we had near the end of the day about policies and our ""new normal"" my store's General Manager went off of her script. She took it upon herself to tell all of us at the meeting that we (I'm assuming we=management team) would be asking homeless customers to leave the store. She went on to explain that a lot of homeless people camp out in tents behind the Walmart near our store. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is wildly concerning to me.  I have an extremely hard time believing this is a corporate policy, as it seems like a PR nightmare having store level associates determining peoples housing status and asking them to leave the store if they... look poor I guess? What she said seems wildly inappropriate, and discriminatory to me, and I would feel extremely uncomfortable asking someone to leave the store for these reasons. I wouldn't even know how to. I didn't ask for further information because I didn't want to seem bothered by it incase I call HR, I just poker faced my way through it. 

I'm concerned if I do call HR then my boss could easily track the complaint back to me, as I'm the most left-leaning person in my store and probably the most likely person to take issue with the comment she made. I'm aware I couldn't be fired for that reason, but I know how things work, and I know how easy it is to find an ""unrelated"" reason to fire someone. I can't afford to lose my job. 

&amp;#x200B;

What would you guys do? Am I overreacting? Am I being selfish for not calling because what she said is unacceptable? Am I selfish if I do call because she said something misguided and the odds of her actually enforcing that policy are slim? I mean how would she? I'm at a loss here.

1040,"Hello,

I am currently doing a Bachlor of Arts degree in 'Security Management' in The Netherlands. It is an odd and very specific degree and I picked it when I was very young, I have had my doubts about the credability of the entire course since the beginning but for a long time I just did not want to start over. Recently some of the staff were fired and the new teachers actually have trouble speaking English... The time neared for me to enter the job market I realized tht I am very unqulified as the only things we study are very abstract academic articles, often written by the people who lead the course. I figured I would need to find some marketable skills so I found an interest in coding, I was originally meaning to get into it on my own, however I figured as I would need certifications anyways it would be best to do one of these bootcamps, I would rather go to the military than start another Bachlor as I found uni is not for me. 

I understand that it will be extremely difficult and probably hard to balance my  coding course with my actual university (busy)work as well as working part time in a bar. I'm not sure if It would be a good idea to ditch the university degree altogether, as at this point I am literally just doing it so I can find work later on when employers check if I went into higher education. If I suceed in the coding bootcamp on the other hand I am hoping to be able to find work without having a degree, but with actual marketable skills, hopefully in the gaming industry which genuinely interests me.  

Anyone else with experience in quitting uni to pursue another type of education? People often say that employers look at your skills not your degree but I am not sure if I want to bank my future on it. I have already picked an accredited bootcamp in my area and have saved up money for it and I will start next month but I need to decide if I want to sign up for next year of university at all.

i texted her this morning since I haven’t spoken in a couple of weeks. She asked me how everything was going with my new boyfriend. I told her I had spent the weekend at my boyfriend‘s hotel room (he is in the national guard and is on a mission). She asked,”Oh my god! don’t tell me you guys did it!” I then responded, “I don’t want to lie to you girl so....yeah.” She then responded with, “WHAT!!!“ “CALL ME NOW!!!” “I AM SO ANGRY WITH YOU AND HIM!!!!” “I THOUGHT WE PROMISED EACH OTHER THAT WE WOULD WAIT UNTIL MARRIAGE OR AT LEAST DATED SOMEONE FOR MORE THAN SIX MONTHS (side note: me and this dude have only been dating seriously for a little over a month)!!!!” She then went on to say that I was not the girl she knew in high school. I then kindly and respectfully told her i am the same anime-obessesed goofball that stood by her and laughed with her in high school. I also told her that people’s view points tend to change as they get older. I also asked her to not be mad at my boyfriend since

1. I initiated it
2. She never met him and I am pretty sure he’s not in it to simply get laid
3. The only thing that happened was two consenting adults simply fell in love and became drunk on that love, which in turn led to them to make love. And last I checked, that’s not a crime in the US

I told her that if she no longer wished to be my friend than I would have no right to force even though it would pain me to lose a decade long friends. Not only that, I told her I respect if she didn’t agree with my choices. She then told me that she was still mad but she will be upset for a while. I told her her I would call her when I got home. I tried when I did......no answer. I tried calling her two more times throughout the day just to make sure. Still no answer. I can’t say with 100% guarantee but I will take that as a sign that she is avoiding me.

GYAH! I love this girl like a sister but I don’t think it’s fair for her to judge me for falling in love and wanting to express that love physically",24May2020,1
1048,"We're long distance (US-Germany) and he had said he wasn't sexually attracted to me cause of my weight. Which wasn't actually what he meant. Long story short he's a little obsessive over his weight after being bullied as a kid because he was a lil chunky. Quarantine made him like super obsessed though. He says he still thinks I'm attractive and I do believe him. We still have some intimate times and I know he's into it. But now I'm getting a little insecure. 

I tried on my Dirndl (just Google images it) that I bought last year and my boobs are way to big for it. Last year I was in a suuuuper bad place so I was very very thin and now I'm chunkier. While I enjoy having big boobs and a big butt now I feel weird in my skin and I'm not sure if I should loseweight because I feel insecure or just deal with my body now?",24May2020,1
1050,"Last night, I hooked up with my roommate. Next morning I noticed a tiny small blister on my lip, and I'm thinking it's a coldsore. I've been feeling sick to my stomach since. I don't know if I had it yesterday. I hardly ever get outbreaks and haven't gotten one a very long time so for casual partners, I don't usually say anything unless I have an active outbreak. My gut feeling is to talk to him but my friend said it's quite common/not a big deal and he might not have gotten it or already has it but is asymptomatic and to just wait and see. What should I do? If I have the talk, how should I bring it up? I've been feeling extremely stressed about the whole situation",24May2020,1
1051,"This is a weird situation and definitely an emotionally charged one so I want to tread lightly, but I want to get my friend’s facebook account deactivated. He passed away 5 years ago and his mom still uses his account. She often uses his account to comment, like, share things etc and it’s just so unnerving. I know this may be seen as a comfort of sorts but after 5 years I just really want facebook to make his account of those “Remembering X” pages as opposed to having to see X commented on your post. The way she uses it is not healthy, it’s obsessive. Her and I are decently close, I spoke her about it a while ago and that conversation kind of just went no where. What can I do?",24May2020,1
1052,So today in the afternoon my brother found out that his account got hacked (PSN account in Playstation 4) and he has no way of getting back in. Is there any way to get the account back besides customer service (since I was told it pretty useless)?,24May2020,1
1055,"While doing some yard work today I noticed that a bird had laid eggs in the rocks underneath my trampoline. After doing some googling, I found out that this bird is a Killdeer bird that always lays its eggs in rocks. I’ve noticed the bird around for the last week, but I don’t know when the eggs were laid. I’m a college cheerleader and count on this trampoline to stay in shape and get tumbling and workouts in during quarantine due to a lack of gym access. Will jumping on the trampoline scare the mother bird away? Do you think my “scent” will get on them and she’ll let the babies die? I don’t want to do anything that would kill them :(",24May2020,1
1056,"First off I would like to say that this is my first post on reddit. Please be nice if I mess something up :)
Anyway

My friends and I are very friendly, which results in each friend having fun group where is sometimes some friend groups are connected to each other and some are less.
The problem starts when we try to plan a camping trip for example. When I tried to start planning this I invited a couple of people who in turn asked me to invite some of their friends who are also acquaintances of mine. We're all in high school and therefore know each other more or less.

these people separate usually into three groups:
1. People unfriendly and do all are friends with each other
2. People who are invited by the people for the first group and are acquaintances of most of the people who are invited from the first group and second group.
3. People who are acquaintances of some people in the group but mostly I invited in order for them not to feel left out

The thing is when we invite more people that atmosphere becomes less intimate however if we don't invite some people then we'll feel bad because we're leaving some people out.

When do I stop allowing people to invite more people and how do I say no to many more people without being an a**hole.",24May2020,1

1059,"I bought a sketchbook because I like the idea of doodling and drawing. I have never drawn, painted, sketched, or really done any art other than some spray painting in high school/college. I am lost. I don't know what supplies I need or what to draw. 

I don't want to doodle/draw anything too realistic because I know that I will get discouraged when it isn't perfect the first time.",24May2020,1
1061,"I'm 17M and nothing makes any sense. 
I know I shouldn't have my whole life figured out yet at this age but it would be nice to have somewhere to start. I have the highest grades in my year doing more subjects than normal, a good chance of getting into Cambridge University and all my life I've been told ""how much potential"" I have and how I'm apparently so clever- so promising. I don't see it.
See my problem is that I have no life goals, no talents, no hobbies, nothing I'm exceptionally good at, really nothing that I enjoy doing. It's not like I haven't tried either; I've tried music, art, sports, charity work, debating, photography, drugs, parties, trying to enjoy my subjects (not that I have much free time to do all that). Nothing sticks, nothing feels like it's what I should be doing. 
I'm a jack of all trades and very much a master of none. 

So I can see how my life is going to play out. I'll spend 3 years doing a law degree and I'll spend my university days rotating between working on some essay on 18th century jurisprudence or something and getting blackout drunk. I'll get a job as a solicitor and I'll work my way up until I earn way more than anyone reasonably should. And at 40 I'll stare out from the window of my massive, empty house and I'll look back on my life thinking that I've wasted every chance I had to be happy. 

Law is fine. All of my subjects are just fine. I do them because I have to and I do them well because I force myself to. My parents tell me I have other choices besides law and medicine but whenever I mention any other choices I get told that I'll be wasting my life and I'll end up poor (immigrant family, the usual). I'm in too deep with law already anyway, no point in switching. I'd get bored of anything else just as much.

I've tried to explain this feeling as just caused by my pretty toxic relationship with an overbearing mother (I miss out on a lot of normal teenage things because of a lack of funds or her strictness). Or lockdown fatigue. Or imposter syndrome. But deep down I know it's not any of that.

I've missed out on so much life already. I don't want the rest of it to go to waste. Is there any way out? 

TL;DR: No life goals or interests despite great academic achievement so far. Life is looking bleak.",24May2020,1
1062,"My girlfriend works in a hospital and has worked on COVID-19 floors but not in the rooms of the infected. Her three roommates at college have been gone since quarantine started and are going to be coming back soon. My girlfriend has a lease signed for a different apartment for next year, however the lease does not begin until July. Her three roommates are trying to get her to leave and move in early to the other apartment due to her closeness to COVID-19 before they come back. They are shaming her for not doing so and claiming that she is being unbelievably selfish. The thing is, my girlfriend has no furniture for her new apartment, no bed, nothing. Not to mention the lease doesn’t begin until July. She has nowhere else to go. What should she do in this situation?",24May2020,1
