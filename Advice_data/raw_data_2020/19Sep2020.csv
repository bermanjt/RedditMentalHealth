0,"There will be 3 bedrooms after our basement is done getting renovated. My parents wants to give the biggest room my youngest brother (9). Reason? Because it‚Äôs the closest room to the stairs....(All rooms have windows)

I‚Äôm almost 18, and planning to moving out of the house in 2 years. I have a hamster cage that I‚Äôm currently building (30 x 30 inches) so having space to the biggest room would be nice. I‚Äôm also taking online classes for my final year of high-school so having a study table inside a room be nice. I‚Äôve always shared rooms with my 2 younger brother because we didn‚Äôt had the money before to renovate the basement, but not once I‚Äôve complained about it. 
Y‚Äôall got any advice on how to persuade my parents? Any ideas would be much appreciated",19Sep2020,1

3,I started vaping around a year ago and I never thought of myself as addicted cuz I always was able to put it away for a long amount of time before taking it back. My friends always told me that it was a bad idea and that I should stop but I haven‚Äôt technically found a reason to. I literally jus feel like my normal self I haven‚Äôt had any instances where I feel short of breath and my stamina hasn‚Äôt decreased whatsoever in my opinion( I know cuz I‚Äôve been on my highschools basketball team for as long as I can remember and I haven‚Äôt notice any changes in my performance) I had stopped vaping back in December of 2019 but I picked it back up around a month or two ago. My friends constantly say I‚Äôm addicted but I feel like if I am able to put it down easily I can‚Äôt be. Although I have noticed that recently I‚Äôve been relying on it cuz of quarantine and having nothing to do. I take around 11 hits a day which is not much considering how much others do it and I‚Äôve been considering leaving it for good.  I would really appreciate yalls views on this thank youü•∞,19Sep2020,1
4,"Hello Reddit, this is the first time I'm ever posting here. I'm a long-time lurker of this subreddit, but I never thought I would post here.

For some context, me (15m), my mom (45f), and my dad (51m) have been having a lot of issues for the past few months. Back in March, my dad got infected with COVID and was really shitty to me and my mom. I brought this up with her, and said that I wanted to move out of the house. We all had a discussion where my dad told me he didn't want me to feel like I should need to move out and he would try to work on things.

So far, I've brought up other issues such as poor communication, his temper, rudeness, and things that really irk me. While I'm not always open to change, I will admit he's managed to get better. It hasn't been great yet, but I think things are starting to slowly change.

This month, another incident occurred during a power outage where my dad was again, pretty mean to me and my mom due to his poor temper. Again, I brought up with my mom wanting to move out, and so she said she would talk to my dad. He once more said that this made him very sad and that he would try. I brought up trying family therapy, but recently I've been a bit more cynical. I told my parents that I didn't know if I really wanted to wait around for things to change.

This week, my sister (19f) was visiting, and to be clear, my mom doesn't seem to like her. She's pretty annoyed by my sister, and tends to be very rude to her. To clarify, she's my half-sister, and my mom used to live with her before my parents divorced in 2010. My sister was very hard to live with due to a horrible bio mother, but she got better and is nothing like she was a child, but I don't think my mom understands her changes, and still views her as a child. Me, my dad, and my sister had a discussion so me and my sister could bring up these issues to make him understand. While I didn't think he would listen since it is his wife, he did, and talked to her. We also brought up other issues with my mom, such as her pushiness and guilting, and emotionality. I also brought up how she tends to use her lupus as an excuse for things, and how my dad tends to favor her over me when doing things for both of us.

My dad brought up these issues with mom, and apparently her and my sister discussed these things for about an hour over the phone. An hour or so ago, something happened which led me to want to make this post. Me and my parents were talking, and my dad mentioned how the directions were hard since they were doing construction and it was hard to get around. To clarify, about an hour ago he went to a sleep study place, and so he mentioned it was going to be hard to navigate. My mom said that ''It isn't that hard, it's just directions'' Me and my dad thought she was being a bit rude, especially since she made a somewhat sneer face, so we said this, and she started getting emotional. She started crying about how she's tired of being told how she feels, and how judgmental we always are.

When my dad left to go, my mom called me in and we talked. She explained how tired she is with my dad, and how mean he can be, and how we'll always judge everything she says and stuff. She had abusive parents growing up so she has a lot of issues ,and I feel bad for her, but I felt like she was guilting me. Me and him were just trying to explain that she was coming off a bit rude, but she went on a ''rant'' with me about how tired she was with my dad. I don't really judge her that much, or point out things she does wrong, like with her words or anything, and she can get like this when I bring things up. I didn't want to say anything, because I thought it might make her more upset. She also mentioned how my she isn't happy with my dad right now, and how pissed off she is dealing with all of this shit and how people are always mad at her, and telling her what to do and how she is doing things. I told her I didn't think she should talk to this about me, since right now the issue is with him, but she said she just wanted to talk to me. She was also crying and was really emotional the whole time.

Right now, I'm really conflicted. While I feel she is guilting me, like she has done in the past, I also feel like I might be the asshole, and was in the wrong with taking my dad's side and judging her. I'm not really sure what to do, because I don't know who to talk to. Right now she's on the phone with my dad, mad at him about what happened before, so I'm just sitting in my room, listening and writing this. She's getting super angry, and yelling.

So reddit, what should I do? Am I being an asshole here?",19Sep2020,1
5,"So, on Fridays, my job has half days. Most of the staff is gone by noon - 1pm, but because I am a medical assistant, there is usually more work to do that keeps the medical assistant staff until 2 - 3pm sometimes but as far is I know, this is not mandatory.

On Sept 11th, I left at 12:52pm, because I had a telemedicine counseling appointment at 2p. I rushed out and the only person I said something to was the physician that I work for, who happens to be my mom.

Another medical assistant complained because I didn't ""Ask if anyone needed help with anything before I left.""

And let me be clear. There is, technically, NO obligation to stay late or work overtime.

So, I basically received a complaint from another employee for not doing a COURTESY.

Should I set things straight, and how? 

Or should I just eat it?",19Sep2020,1
6,"I play videogames with my friends every week or so but ever since I started realized I tend to get kinda stress out when playing, and always fear letting my friends down to the point where one time during a 1v4 situation and everyone was shouting at me what do I just loss it and started shouting ""wtf do you want me to do now,how am I supposed to win this?"" Over and over until the other team killed me , recently we where playing among us and whenever I get imposter i always lose, and wherever I do I feel kinda stressed out,and sometimes just shout ""I'm fking sorry ok"" at my friends who ask me why I did a dumb move at a certain point of the game,im not extremely stress out or anything and my most friends  don't talk shit about my bad gaming skills expect for one but I know that this isn't really healthy as I keep feeling stressed and frustrated and it's starting to build up a bit,do you know if I can do anything to reduce this stress?",19Sep2020,1

My heart just feels like an empty jar, like how Sato described in ‚ÄúHappy Sugar Life‚Äù. I just want to find a man who loves me as much as Aladdin loves Jasmine.

9,"I know to some of you 26 might seem young but that‚Äôs kind of the problem here. 

I finished my first degree at 24. In my final year I had my first series of panic attacks right before my final exam. I had another panic attack the second I got to my room for my Master‚Äôs degree so I packed my case immediately and ran for the first train back to where I did my Bachelor‚Äôs. I guess it felt familiar and safe.

I did a Master‚Äôs there. Learned a lot and made friends but also battled depression and anxiety constantly. I had weeks of quality work and weeks of wanting to end it all so I stop being such a burden on the world. All this time I‚Äôm in a relationship that‚Äôs breaking apart and I can‚Äôt stop it so that just breaks my heart. For the whole year and a half I felt like an outsider watching my life fall apart. 

I finish my Master‚Äôs and get a job. I break up with the person that‚Äôs causing me all the stress and pain. I find someone new. She is sweet and caring and kind. I‚Äôm thankful for that. Perhaps that was my break. However 3 months into the new job and 5 into the new relationship , I get stomach pains. Bad pains. Can‚Äôt sleep, can‚Äôt eat almost anything. Medical systems makes it just plain impossible for me to get an answer. 3 trips to the ER later and about 12 GP appointments , I fly back home-home. Medical system there is bit better so I manage to find out the cause of my pain. 3 months of medication should put me back on my feet. 

New Years 2020 is here and I feel better in the first month. Still flare ups and pains but I can sleep now so yay for me. Corona comes. We go into lockdown. More anxiety and stress and depression. 

Forward to August 2020, I kind of got my pain under control. Depression is mostly gone. Anxiety stayed. Call it PTSD or whatever. Now I start coughing and my tongue looks funny. 3 GP appointments later, I find out I might have to wait a month for a specialist appointment. I went private and will go on Monday (21st) to find out what I have. 

I‚Äôm scared sometimes this will never stop. It‚Äôs not even that things happen because I understand life happens and this peace I dream of can‚Äôt last long. But most of my problems don‚Äôt even depend on me. I did everything right and followed all steps and it still almost destroyed me. 

I don‚Äôt like that my go-to thought when I get an episode of pain or discomfort from something has become ‚Äú if nothing else , I can always kill myself‚Äù. It breaks my heart when I realise that‚Äôs my way of not despairing. I want to become stronger for my family. I don‚Äôt want them to suffer because of me. 

Any advice ?",19Sep2020,1

11,Yesterday my friend brought to my attention that someone made a fake Instagram account using my full name. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I saw they were following a lot of my friends and family. They posted a picture on their story promoting an onlyfans account. The weird part about this is that I actually do have an onlyfans account however I would NEVER promote it on a personal Instagram and I do not have my full name associated with it. I can‚Äôt even report the account because the person has me blocked. I was asking my friends to report it for me but it hasn‚Äôt been taken down yet. I was just wondering if there was any kind of legal action I could take for this? Someone told me to call the police but I don‚Äôt think this is something they could deal with. The main problem I have with everything is that they‚Äôre using my full name and it makes me feel unsafe. I wouldn‚Äôt want something like this to follow me especially because I took steps to protect my own privacy and this person is diminishing that completely. Literally any sort of advice or opinions on this would help me out.,19Sep2020,1

Just to preface I have no issue with drugs or alcohol whatsoever. This life can be pretty rough so it‚Äôs good to relax and let loose every once in a while. Whenever I hop on to play with these friends however they take it a bit too far. They usually smoke weed and get pretty damn drunk and they become extremely loud and obnoxious.

Everytime I go out at night or travel somewhere I'm always comforted by the notion of home, the idea of that not being a thing anymore is frightening.

I was walking home and one guy came up to me, absolutely hammered and did the entire ""what are *you* doing out here"" (it was half 11 at night). Then within 5 minutes another guy, who seemed really lovely bless him, literally had to assure me that he was gay and jokingly went ""see I'm walking the other direction!

We assume that the ring fell out of his pocket whilst sleeping, but we aren‚Äôt sure, I see it as the first friend losing it since he gave it to our friend who was half conscious at the time but he thinks the situation was out of his hands.

story:

no one listens to me earlier my mom told me to meet my dad for mc Donalds. He was drunk and he handed me coke I HATE coke and they both knew I hate coke. I said ""ma bought me sprite"" but then he started yelling at me mad because I said the sprite is mine and mom bought it for me I never got A attitude with him first but he was just tripping. I told him I forgot my keys and he knew that but told me I have to walk all the way back down to mc Donalds to get to my mom to open the doors for me. the mc Donalds was far and the opposite way of my house and it was a dark and shady corner. So I had to walk there since you need to pay for the bus and turns out my mom wasn't there so I had to all the way back while I was walking I saw my dad halfway on the block. I rolled my eyes I was pissed he made me walk all the way there when he could've just open the door but he wanted to be a baby and he knew my mom was at the supermarket. So we argued again then called my mom who turned out to be at the supermarket which is far away from my house and mc Donalds. she told me she couldn't control what the lady made and it wasn't her fault I tried to talk to her she said she doesn't want to hear it and hung up. I wasn't even mad at the soda thing just annoyed but mad had my dad yelled at me for no reason and how petty he was even though he knew my mom was not at Mc Donalds. Then I tried to talk to my dad but he did was cuss me out and said he also did not want to hear it.

23,"     this is going to be very jumbled because i‚Äôm still shaken up about it. my boyfriend, who i will call M, is 17 years old and in his senior year of high school. i am the same age, but a grade lower. starting last december, he began experiencing extreme nausea. the nausea really comes and goes as it pleases and there‚Äôs not much of a set pattern to it. at first he was optimistic, but after almost 9 months of being nauseous every other waking hour, he has become a shell of his former self.

     he is a very conscientious student. he always has been. he is easily in the running for the valedictorian in his class, but the race is very close. when he gets nauseous, he can‚Äôt focus. he completely pulls away from everyone and everything and he almost always feels like puking. as he has begun to realize that he will most likely not be able to keep up with his school work and maintain his GPA with all of this going on, he has become even more depressed. i know it‚Äôs easy to just say that it‚Äôs high school and that this stuff doesn‚Äôt matter in the grand scheme of things, but imagine losing everything that you‚Äôve worked so hard for after years of dedication, while simultaneously no longer being able to hang out with your friends or engage in the same activities you once did.

     he has seen many different specialists that deal with digestive problems and no one has been able to come up with anything. all of his reports show that he is in perfect health. one specialist suggested that it could be stress related, but i‚Äôm not entirely sure that‚Äôs the case because he often wakes up in the morning already feeling nauseous.

     recently, he has been talking about how he no longer sees a point to life if he‚Äôs always going to feel this way with no end in sight. he can‚Äôt even imagine going off to college and making it all the way through. hell, at this point sitting through the SATs is out of the realm of possibilities for him because he couldn‚Äôt possibility take it to the best of his abilities with extreme nausea. today, i asked him point blank if he was considering suicide, and he didn‚Äôt answer. then, i asked him if he could promise me that he wouldn‚Äôt attempt to harm or kill himself, and he told me that he couldn‚Äôt promise something like that anymore. 

     i reached out to his older sister 30 minutes ago (who is away at college) immediately after he told me that, and explained the entirety of the situation to her. i asked that she reach out to their parents and tell them everything that i‚Äôve just told you guys. she has yet to respond, but i know she will follow through with it. he will probably hate me for it, but i think i‚Äôd hate myself even more if he were to kill himself and i just sat there, knowing all that i know, and watched it happen. 

     i feel sick. this whole thing has taken a massive toll on my mental health as well and i feel as though it is constantly on my mind. i don‚Äôt know what to do. how can i be there for him? my soothing words are getting repetitive, and sometimes he lashes out at me for looking at the situation and trying to think optimistically. i need to know that others have gone through similar experiences and that everything turned out ok.",19Sep2020,1

I don't want to say I'm depressed but , sometimes I feel like that , I know you'll probably think I have a problem and I need to deal with it on my own but I just needed to get this off my chest please give me your thoughts, the nice guy and incels , they were just examples of me feeling sympathy for bad people they aren't the only ones and I fucking hated it üòûüòû",19Sep2020,1

We are the same age (18) and I‚Äôm in college and working as a mechanic, and she is a senior taking mechanics classes at school. Due to our common interests, we tend to talk more than I think is usual. I have no idea if she is into me, but I‚Äôm falling for her. Eventually I want to ask her out, but I‚Äôve never been in a serious relationship, and I‚Äôm really don‚Äôt want to put her on the spot or make her uncomfortable.

31,"Hey everyone.

I purchased a pair of pants from someone I am in a Facebook group with. I met them in a group that is specific to fans of the brand, and the seller is pretty well known in the group from what I‚Äôve seen. I paid $110 for them on Friday, September 4. On Sunday, September 13, I reached out to ask if they knew when it would ship because I will be out of town for 3 days and will need to have a friend pick it up if it‚Äôll arrive during that time. They responded and said this:

‚ÄúThank you for checking in! I live in Washington and with the fires everything‚Äôs a HOT HOT MESS UP HERE. Thx for the poke, I will ship tomorrow, and get tracking, and you can let your friend know if they need to pick it up? Does that work?‚Äù

I had no idea they lived in an area being affected by such terrible fires, so I apologized for their situation and stressed that it‚Äôs no rush but I just wanted to know because of the timing, not to pressure them to ship it out immediately. I asked them multiple times in my response if they were okay because I genuinely worried about them? but they read it and never responded. They‚Äôve been active every time I get on FB Messenger. I feel like I may have pissed them off? I didn‚Äôt mean to be pushy or rude at all, $110 is just a lot of money to me (this is the number one thing I want rn and my bday present to myself) and I have been scammed three times during this pandemic, so I just get nervous easily now.

I also REALLY don‚Äôt want to be insensitive to their situation, but the fact that they read my 3 messages and didn‚Äôt respond just has me feeling a little uneasy. Am I just being paranoid? Should I wait until it‚Äôs been a month before reaching back out?",19Sep2020,1
32,"\^ I truly don't think anything will really get the point across quicker than that title \^

I'll try to keep it simple and not say to much. 

I was wondering what anyone has to offer about a question of mine;

How can one feel less bad?

Specifically about their body, and luck, being what's bad.  (Can't say for certain, but I think mine's not too great)

Usually there's things to make up for shortcomings, and I remember there being something about patience paying off, eventually. (Taking it's sweet ass time)

But, so far, nothing's really shone as a fixing light yet.

I was wondering if this was because there just isn't really anything for Orphans that don't have much of a dick, or if I was doing something wrong, and have been since I was born. (Late 20's, now)

(I'll finish this off with a question plain; 4.5 Inches is as I call it, yeah? Not much of a dick? I know it's under average)",19Sep2020,1

 It has come down to it, ive got only till thursday next week to get her digits.  I have had so much time to get close but the nerves always kicked in and I missed my chances. We were starting to get close before march break I was going to ask her for her number then, but... you've guessed it, the nerves got me and I chickend out. Then Covid-19 hit and 4 long months have went by leading to this point. We are back in class and its clear there is deffently some distance. The second week back the chef told us about our final project being two teams  battling it out. Chef made me a captian and let the people choose which team they wanted to join and thats what fucked me over because I got the one guy that she absolutely hates ( he's a 60yr man that harrased her for months ) and he chose my team -_-. Honestly I think the way he buzzez around me like a ""fly to dung"" is maybe the reason for her acting towards me in class the way she does a little stand off ish or it's because I'm just a lil bitch with no nerves. But yeah we are on different teams and it's last week so there are no longer any demos just a lot of planning and prepping, even though we both show up we never have the chance to talk we are in different rooms up untill the bell rings to leave.

35,"I haven't been in a relationship yet and one thing that worries me is that I could get cheated on. But for some strange reason; thinking about a guy and his mistress having sex is a real turn on for me.

When I was younger, I would look up movie scenes with this context. I don't do it anymore because I'm trying to move on from thinking like this. But it's really hard to forget them. If I'm horny, my mind often go straight to that.

I know that some people will say there is nothing wrong with getting turned on by that; or that it's just a fantasy. But I really don't want this to continue. I don't like cheating and I feel horrible to have it on my mind for so long.

39,I (24f) recieved a car from my father as a gift a few years ago. We don't live together and hes always done everything he could to make sure I was happy and comfortable in life. He shipped a white integra to me thats been in the family since it rolled off the lot in 97. He spent a lot of time and money trying to keep it running well and he knew I really wanted the car. It is very old and has over 280k miles on it but he had the engine refreshed before sending it to me. I have upgraded multiple parts while fixing things as problems came up and slapped a cute set of rpf1s on. I've grown attached to it because of sentimental reasons and when it was running it was just so much fun and I am incredibly sad because I feel like I've failed to make his investment worth it. My goal was to fix what I needed to fix and keep it for a very long time because it is one of if not the cleanest champion white integra gsr coupes around today.

40,"It's truly just been awful. 

This month, almost everything about it, has made me  feel so, so awful. 

I feel like I've been replaced by my best friends.
On top of that, it's with someone I don't know if I should avoid or not.

Two of my best friends started to hangout with this old friend of mine (K) more, who I had heard from other very close friends of mine that they did or used to talk badly of me and others. I assumed best scenario would be to avoid that but now two of my other current best friends have started to hang out eith them more and I feel so left in the dust.

I've told them about it too. I explained that I wasn't sure and I heard of it from close friends of mine who wouldn't lie, and I also left one of my clubs because I wasn't sure what to do (they were in that club).

Just yesterday I was talking to K and thise two friends of mine and my friends told us that we would be good friends. That felt so awkward. I didn't know what to say. It wasn't fair of them to do that. Is it fair of me to avoid? I don't know.

Then my rabbit is sick, and I'm so stressed about that. I have to apply ear ointment 3x a day, give oral medication 1x a day, and eyedrops 3-4x a day. On top of school + clubs + homework, this is so much.

My younger brother is stressing me out too, every little thing I do he'll be there annoying me or causing fights.

One of my favourite teachers has announced that she's leaving soon due to surgery for cancer, and I think she mentioned she may or may not pass away. I'm not 100% sure but she said stuff alongside that..

My very best friend (closest) lives a province or two away from me and has started a family already. Which is fine for me but we don't talk as much. I don't want to tell my mom or she'll hit me with the ""see this always happens in highschool"" stuff. Her words have put me through an immense amount of pain I can't even begin to explain.

I've cried for the first time in months, so I guess I've been bottling it up. I want to talk to someone but I don't know who. I do have friends who would listen but I just don't know how it would help me by talking to them. They have their own worries and mine just seem petty.

I don't know how to relax right now. I can't catch a break, I'm so irritatable, especially during this pandemic and I'm insecure about my body more than ever because I graduate this year. 

I usually would have a bath or something here + there, but I don't think it would really help now, plus our bath is broken.

It's really been a horrible month. I'm making the wrong decisions, and I can't relax. I need ideas on how to calm down before I break completely, please.",19Sep2020,1
41,"Hello I don‚Äôt really do this but right now I don‚Äôt have anyone to lean on really. Also sorry if my punctuation is horrible typing this just out of my mind. So I‚Äôm 17 have anxiety and adhd, I was born early premature 7 months old from then I gave my mom heart problems because of my birth her heart became weak. I‚Äôve lived parts of my life with my grandfather, uncle, and mother most recently since I think I was 13 anyways starting when I was 14/15 my family split due to my uncle cheating on my aunt with another one of my aunts in my family yes I know fucked up. Anyways that split my grandfather and uncle from my mom and I and lead to countless pressures on me to decide who is right even though I love them both. Now recently I‚Äôve gotten myself in a lot of things that yes I know a 17 year old shouldn‚Äôt get himself into I‚Äôve smoked pot and slowed down since I was 15, Iet a girl when I was 16 decided she was the one and proposed we live together and it‚Äôs great for the most part I do get jealous when my friends come over but hey she‚Äôs someone I love and it‚Äôs just teen things I guess. Anyways I‚Äôve also tried starting college a bit early and such this September 22 I start for early college credits still haven‚Äôt graduated high school. Now here is where I need advice I just wanted to provide back story. Recently my girl and me went this summer for her graduation back to the state she‚Äôs from I was away like 2 weeks for the first time from home when I got back my mom just got on my ass for things which I don‚Äôt mind she does it a lot but after that she seemed jealous of her family in a way. This was during Father‚Äôs Day this year she always rubs it in my face oh you left with the you took a ride with them since we had taken her dad out to eat for Father‚Äôs Day keep in mind this was the first time I met her parents. And recently she has gotten news that she needs to go into surgery in another city from ours due to her heart conditions. I do take care of her as much as I can and despite everything she gets on me for this years holidays such as thanksgiving and Christmas and how my girl wants to see her parents, she‚Äôs says how I prefer my ‚Äúnew family‚Äù over her. Today she stole back a watch from our room that she had given my girl, her excuse was ‚ÄúI have her some pants and I saw them in a pile of clothes she was gonna give her mom so I took the watch back since she‚Äôs ungrateful, if you want to be shady I can be shady back!‚Äù And said this if she was being serious. ‚ÄúYou married shady you ask me?‚Äù. What I‚Äôm wondering is what‚Äôs her problem and why does she change out of the blue like that what can I do or say? (Sorry if this is a long read or if it‚Äôs all over the place I get it a 17 year old is still a kid even I think I‚Äôm not mature enough to be making these decisions but it seems like she‚Äôs a child also or acts like it and I take care of her a lot clean, cook, and even though she lives upstairs literally since she never gets out of bed she calls me to look for her remote even tho she just used it same goes for her phone and easy things like that I don‚Äôt mind just wish she could mature so I can focus on me and not her I get it her surgery is coming she might be doing this cause she‚Äôs scared or is my mom and such but instead of making me care for her more she‚Äôs pushing me away and I don‚Äôt want to leave her alone either she‚Äôs tried committing suicide if I recall 2 times I don‚Äôt remember the first time but the second was 2 years ago on my grandfathers birthday her dad) I just want advice any just something or someone to talk to I‚Äôm sorry..",19Sep2020,1

49,"Hi,

Throwaway because reasons. 

I broke with my ex about 2 years ago. 
I now have a new boyfriend, it's been one year. He's the most loving man and the perfect one. We have no issues whatsoever. 
However, I still check my ex (Brian)'s reddit. I probably do it out of habit but I still do it. We are no contact. 
He posted that he had problems with his new gf a month ago and now he posted he broke up with her. 

For some reason, I'm so happy. 
I feel like he deserves it. Brian has always been whiny and he's claiming she cheated on him like all the others. He says that about me and about his other ex (I didn't cheat and I'm pretty sure his other ex didn't either) so maybe his gf didn't either. He also blamed her for stuff, that looked like the stuff he'd say about me. Because he's unable to take the blame. 

He was a terrible dude, totally toxic, insulting me/my family, 100% toxic and using his bipolar disorder to manipulate me. One of my best friend said ""Brian only lives through his own tragedy"" and she's so right.  He manipulated a couple friends to get through me (one of my good friend just lost his dad, Brian offered support to him to get leverage on me later, etc...) 

He's like ""I'll never be happy"" ""that's 2 breakup in one year"" (lie) and make up all sort of stuff for people to support him on Reddit, it's actually pathetic. Somebody comments on the pattern of his relationship like he's always attracting the wrong people so Sometimes I just want to comment ""Brian you're just terrible and abusive and you're compulsively lying so ppl feel sorry for you but these women are just getting away from your toxicity - the only pattern is you being so bad"" 

However, I'm concerned for myself. I'm weirdly content that he feels like shit. The dude is terrible and he deserves it so much but I'm kind of mean to think it. I hate him and I wish I just didn't care. 
Help ? 

TL;Dr : I hate my ex so much I check on him on Reddit and I'm happy when he's feeling miserable. I don't know what to do as I know it's not healthy. 

Thanks for reading",19Sep2020,1

We have had to go to court many times before and he had been doing drugs on top of it all we aren't sure if he is still doing it but all of his stuff smells terrible and seems like it probably is drugs. There are too many bad situations to recall about him. My parents are divorced and he goes between my mom and dad's house whenever he gets violent every 2-3 months. He acts like the boss of both houses and we have to be very quiet and subtle around the house because he is sensitive. I stay at my mom's house 4-5 days a week with my two older sister's and he is mainly at my mom's too. Every day feels like a living hell but my parent's don't want to kick him out onto the street. I have anxiety attacks and sometimes nightmares because of him. He turned 18 last December and didn't graduate high-school. I am just starting my freshman year of highschool and I have been dealing with this since the 5th grade. I want him out of our lives and far away for good. He has had two cars and been in mutiple accidents and has no car currently rn but he said he is gonna leave when he gets a car because he ""can't stand living with us either"". Even a few days ago he was asking my dad to pay for his car after having another tantrum and soon got kicked out he just got to my mom's place yesterday and is gonna move his stuff back here. I doubt he can get any more jobs because he has been fired mutiple times and have a record from what I know. I don't have to much information because I don't get told much but my parents. What can or should I do? I can't stand to live even another 3 months with him. My sister has also saved up enough to buy a puppy and it should be here in another 2-5 months. I don't want the puppy to be near him or in this environment either. I wish my sister actually told too though because I don't want the puppy know and have it be traumatized or hurt.

Asking ‚Äúwho took a dump today and being answered who did and how large - all while they are sitting down for dinner. A lady was told she stinks and needs feminine wash after lunch and I could FEEL her embarrassment. I feel so bad for them, and nothing I do or say changes anything at all. So I‚Äôm basically fed up.

Tonight, the wife to a husband of 67 years was promised (by me) that she could see her husband (who is in the dementia unit and my patient, they live on different floors) after dinner and I would make him look as much like himself as I could. She hasn‚Äôt seen him since March and the 2 visits she was finally allowed to have starting this week went poorly, they brought her up while he was asleep, dressed like a bum and didn‚Äôt have his teeth, standard ball cap as he always wears or a collared shirt. She is now allowed 1, 20 minute visit a day. I got them both excited and when it was time to bring her up, staff refused very rudely stating she already had her visit and she knows the rules. Thing is, she didn‚Äôt have her visit and I made sure. Hearing the news made her so upset that she again couldn‚Äôt see her husband and doesn‚Äôt want to live anymore, it‚Äôs just too much they‚Äôve put her through. She wanted to end her life tonight.

Hearing this, i first broke down and I then went to my supervisor and explained the situation (sobbing) and she said she‚Äôd take care of it right then. Husband was all ready to go and was actually wandering around when he‚Äôs on a chair alarm and at risk for falls, so I got him safely back to his seat while she did nothing. 

I wait a few minutes, still upset, to go find said ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù and she‚Äôs outside smoking, and hadn‚Äôt done a thing. So, I just had enough and walked out because I feel like nobody gives a damn about these amazing people! It breaks my heart. I‚Äôm sick of the employees treating everyone like crap unless you are in their ‚Äúclique‚Äù. Bullying is rampant and no matter how many meetings they have addressing the issue, no one is reprimanded or fired because they need bodies in the building.

I left in a fit of anger and depression. From being bullied myself because I have to wear a wig or I‚Äôm too kind to the residents, making them look bad. To the residents themselves being mistreated and certainly not getting their money‚Äôs worth and all the corona bullshit, I had enough. 

I‚Äôm realizing now by the time I made the 30 min drive home I may have made a mistake. I love my job, I love what I do and especially the residents. I love them so much it hurts. It physically affects me some days. And I know they need me, everyone there knows it, too. I don‚Äôt want to abandon them, sometimes I‚Äôm their only voice or smile they got that day. We have fun. We laugh and joke and have a grand old time but the aids and nurses are some of the most cold-hearted people I‚Äôve met. I don‚Äôt want to quit or lose my job, but at the time I did. It‚Äôs too late to go back now, my shift is over and all of management is off until Monday. I can‚Äôt call and apologize to my coworkers because the people who will answer or I would have to talk to all hate me. Will straight up ignore me when I ask a question or snap at me if I bother them. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Any advice on how to handle this professionally and try to keep my job? I had planned on emailing the HR manager and explains the situation, and calling Monday morning to talk to the boss. I‚Äôm not sure what to say or how I could avoid getting fired. I was just REALLY upset and felt like that was the last straw. Thanks in advance for any suggestions and for reading my very long explanation. üôÇ 

TLDR: I walked out of work because a resident wasn‚Äôt allowed to see her husband as promised and within the rules of the facility. Had enough after months of bullying, disrespect, drama and neglect. I now realize it was a mistake and want advice on how to keep my job because I love the patients on my dementia unit.",19Sep2020,1
58,"I recently did an interview for a summer internship. It‚Äôs kind of a big deal to me because it‚Äôs my first legit job prospect in the corporate world. 

I got an email an hour ago, that basically read:

‚ÄúDear Student,

We are so excited to connect with you in the [blank] recruitment process!

Please contact me if you receive an offer before accepting so our hiring team can adjust our next steps as needed.‚Äù

So after reading and rereading this, I was pretty shocked and surprised because it sounded like I was moving on to the next round of interviews. 

I immediately told my parents, who were happy for me and I was feeling pretty good. Then, I sat down and read the email over again and i started having doubts because it was so general. So I emailed the recruiter and she told me that it was actually an email sent to all applicants and we will find out if we get second round interviews after Monday :/

Now I‚Äôm struggling to decide whether I should tell my parents now or wait till i find out on Monday. It‚Äôs kind of embarrassing to say that it was actually a misunderstanding after all that hype. 

How should I go about this? Should I tell them or not, and if so, what do I say?",19Sep2020,1

I love seeing people happy and if I got it so do they. I know I'm taken advantage of. I never receive as much as I give, but I don't give and say yes expecting anything in return. I do it because I love to. My constant generosity is hurting me in the process. Financially and emotionally.

64,"Hey! I‚Äôve always wanted to be a writer and filmmaker, and have started making some headway in editorial work. This has caused me to seriously consider shortening my name for the sake of my career.

My name is Cassia. However, it is pronounced Cuh-SEE-uh, which you can imagine people have butchered my whole life (I can only recall a handful of times that people pronounced it correctly from the jump). I understand the confusion, but it is nonetheless something that has always always bothered me. It‚Äôs annoying having to correct people all the time, and I imagine it‚Äôll only get worse if I make any kind of name for myself in the industry (which I REALLY want to). It‚Äôs not that I dislike my name at all, I just hate when people mispronounce it.

My relatives almost exclusively call me Cass (and sometimes Cassie) and many of my friends call me that as well. I was thinking of going by this name for my career (publications, movie credits) just because it‚Äôs a name I‚Äôm relatively used to and there‚Äôs no way of messing that up. 

This seems like a close-and-shut case, but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs I‚Äôve been grappling with for sometime. I really like my actual name (when pronounced correctly) and it works well with my last name. It is also unique and memorable, which helps for clout and distinctiveness and whatnot. And while people do call me Cass, it‚Äôs always as more of a pet name; people overwhelmingly call me Cassia.

Any insight would be great!",19Sep2020,1
65,"Assume two individuals are of a similar age, social economic status, and relatively well educated. They both are set up for successful careers in their lives, and have a positive direction for their future. These individuals occasionally engage in casual sexual relations with others when they are not in a relationship, otherwise let us assume they are people with sufficient character to be called a good person.

Now, one individual tests positive for HIV. They do the proper thing, and inform their sexual partner of their results. This prompts a discussion about the next course of action. What should two people do in this instance? Should they seek to solidify the relationship in marriage, and not abandon the responsibility they have to one another as a result of this change in sexual health. Do they even have an obligation to take responsibility for each other? They both consented to intercourse being sound in body and mind. Could you not say they are equally at fault for this event? Would a relationship with this foundation be good for either party?

I present this scenario because me and a individual are worried about test results coming back positive. I want an objective perspective on the situation. I don't want to abandon them, as they seem extremely afraid of being left alone, and I feel that, if either of us do test positive, I have a responsibility to take charge in some way. I told them that whatever the case, I am going to own up to it because that is how I was raised. Assigning blame won't fix anything, and neither will ignoring each other in my opinion.

We still kept in contact and now I'm on a 10 day snap streak with her, and it's not like we just sent 1 snap the whole day, we would be talking throughout all of those 10 days about random stuff. I even became her ""bestie"" on Snapchat, if that means anything in this scenario.

I still care for her and tomorrow I'm even planning on giving her a big compliment that I have been wanting to give her since I met her. Should I tell her I still have feelings for her or should i just let it be?",19Sep2020,1

106,"So I recently moved in with a friend of mine and her dad, I sleep on the couch, due to a bad home environment. Just until my friend and I are financially stable enough to move out. Hopefully around April. But here's the problem, she's lazy. And I don't mean the kind of lazy where she sits all day and never does anything.

She has this habit of saying there's no point cleaning when the house is old and will never be clean. She does dishes every couple of days and she'll occasionally mop, but there's two dogs and three cats.

Now this is the big problem, we found out the house and pets have fleas a few months ago but besides buying flea killer for the pets and combing through them a handful of times, she refuses to do anything else. We just found out her dog is allergic to fleas and they're causing him to shed BAD. All he does is lick and scratch himself to the point he's balding. When we sweep there's hardly any dirt, just tons of his hair. We could sweep in the morning and by the afternoon the hair is so bad it looks like we didn't.

I've tried helping clean but she just tells me to stop, that there's no point.

We have a cream couch that shows the pet hair and everytime I go to vacuum it she says there's no point, it'll be covered again.

She's also given up with the fleas, they're so bad that they're starting to bite humans now. Everytime we ""clean"" she tells me how much better it'll be when we move out but it won't. Isn't it common sense to clean up after you've made a meal and not leave the dishes out for days? And not to leave things like the butter and ketchup and milk out for days? Also when you have leftovers aren't you supposed to put them in a container in the fridge and not to leave it on the stove for days and then throwing it out? She also leaves food and wrappers in her room and wonders why her room smells bad. She likes to leave her clothes in the bathroom for days and leaves junk on the floor. She leaves bags of trash on the floor because she doesn't feel like taking it outside, knowing her dog will dig into it and make a bigger mess, and then doesn't discipline him. He's chewed up over $500 of her shoes, he's chewed her clothes, MY clothes, he's almost chewed my shoes, he chews on the chairs, anything he can reach. He eats anything and everything. Yet she never disciplines him, besides maybe a slap on the ass which causes him to piss of the floor and then she coddles him. It's not like he's a puppy either, he's one. He is the worst behaved dog I have ever met yet her excuse is he'll get better when he's 3.

She also says there's no point dealing with the fleas till we move but if we let it continue it'll become so bad we won't even be able to deal with them. And I refuse to move into a new place and bring the fleas along, which is what will happen at this rate.

I feel so bad seeing my cat dig at himself because of these bugs and her pets included. I feel gross leaving there but moving out isn't an option since I have no where else to go and can't afford to live by myself.

I have done so much research about how to deal with fleas and I have even told her and given her different ideas. But she still won't do anything. There's no point in me treating my pet and attempting to clean if she won't do anything.

What am I supposed to do? I can't get another job, I've already applied everywhere that will hire an 18 year old with no highschool diploma. I'm trying to save up for my ged but it's becoming near impossible.

Any advice would be very much appreciated.",19Sep2020,1

112,"Need advice on the best decision to make for my career/life.

Hello good afternoon everyone Im 21 years old and Im in a bit of a dilemma between two paths. I decided not to go to college and pursue a blue collar job (trade school). Im in between two options both life changing.  Im located in Socal btw which is getting really crowded and expensive.  So I ive also been going off on what pays better and how much in demand is the trade. First off I love cars and I can see myself somewhat being an auto tech. Id be attending a local trade school and the tuition isnt so bad around 18k plus the program is only 10 months long. After school I plan on applying to work at tesla I have a cousin who works there and have a really good shot at getting in. Because i‚Äôve heard working at normal dealerships is almost like slave work (could be wrong but every review and testimony I‚Äôve heard aims towards that). They make decent money but Im not sure if its a good idea to stay local with los angeles getting super expensive every year. Not to mention all of my family is here so it would be nice to stay local. My other option is becoming a lineman and that school is located in idaho, but the good news is I have family that live about 15 minutes from the school not to mention I have a really good relationship with my family there. Lineman school is only about 3 months long and around the same in tuition which is 18k. And there is a big demand for them with very good pay and benefits. The downside is  most of the demand for lineman is in that area outside of socal since theres so much competition there. Therefore I‚Äôd have to relocate and leave my all my family here which could be hard since I have honestly never left home for a long time. But honestly Idaho life is so much more beautiful and free not to mention so much cheaper and I could easily afford a house within some time. But I could see myself feeling homesick sometimes. Btw sorry for the long essay I tried to be descriptive as possible and appreciate your time reading this. I know this is my decision and it comes down to me. But I would like to hear some advice if any of you have been in a similar situation or dilemma. Or if any of you would like to share your wisdom please do.

114,"Long story short a Crack addict lives in my family and my enabling parents will be out of town for a few weeks, lately he's been stealing more money from them from their wallet, atm/bank, cars, rooms etc. So with them gone I'm sure in 2 days he's gonna go crazy and start selling Tvs and anything of resell value (he's an unemployed lazy grown adult). Now here's the thing I'm a young adult that has worked very hard for the last few years in the luxury retail business so I have a pretty good collection of shoes, clothes, fragrances, jewelry etc and growing up I never had tech so now that I can afford stuff I have a lot of apple tech and electronics. Obviously these are things you can pawn or sell on the streets easily and when I'm working I'm out for 10+ hours so I'm worried he'll  break into my room and take my stuff for crack money.

123,"
I‚Äôm a 17 year old bisexual male. I‚Äôm attracted to men, and while my attraction for women is much less intense sexually, I‚Äôm still attracted to them sexually. 

For a while now, I‚Äôve been watching gay porn exclusively. At first it was because I was actually horny, sometimes that still is the case, but now it‚Äôs just an escape....

I‚Äôm not even in the mood 90% of the time I start watching it, I‚Äôm just stressed out or bored. My erection is hardly an erection and when I put my mind on anything else other than the porn, It goes soft. I also try to make it last as long as possible before ejaculating because it‚Äôs the excitement I crave, not the orgasm 

Now I can‚Äôt get turned on by straight porn anymore. It‚Äôs only gay porn that my brain seems to want. I‚Äôll start watching porn and then my brain thinks ‚Äúwhy watch straight porn when you could watch gay porn‚Äù. 
It was not like this before, and now this just feels unhealthy and it‚Äôs also confusing me about my sexuality. 

I feel gross every time I finish, and that might also be the anxiety and stigma that comes with watching gay porn. The porn I watch has also become less and less normal (nothing illegal or anything like that) it‚Äôs just less conventional domination type porn. Usually when I watch the weirder stuff, it‚Äôs when I‚Äôm not actually horny and just want excitement, that‚Äôs also when I feel the most guilty after ejaculating. 

I have other hobbies and interests, I don‚Äôt know why this is taking over my life. How can I get back to normal? What does this say about me? Am I fully gay and not bisexual? I‚Äôm so stressed out right now.",19Sep2020,1

I have tried to lose my virginity harder than I have tried to do anything else, but I have failed. To give you a sense of how pathetic I am, I payed for Tinder Gold. I think that on my 21st birthday I will pay for an escort. 

On the surface my life is okay. Actually on the surface my life is great: I am good at many things, I have decent grades, I'm intelligent and even good looking (albeit in an unconventional sense). None of that seems to matter. The harder I try, the more monolithic the failure becomes, the more I hate the person I am. Im so much of an incel that it feels too late to care about anything besides sex. 

I wish I could be okay with being a virgin. But being a virgin is the biggest failure of my life: it makes me feel sub human. If I could learn to be okay with being a virgin I would define myself as intelligent, and hard- working, and infinitely empathetic. But it feels too late to be that person. If I do this now then all along I could've been happy and all that suffering was pointless. I don't even feel like a human. I hate what I am.

all ow ant to do is SH, mainly because of this right now. i don‚Äôt want any if this, i wish no one found out. i would be so much happier.

but i can‚Äôt go back, and i don‚Äôt know what to do. I only want to SH and d*e more because of this.

i know people want to help me, but i only feel worse. i don‚Äôt want to sound ungrateful, but i don‚Äôt want any of this. i feel worse then before, this ‚Äúhelp‚Äù is making me feel so much worse. 

what do i do? has  anyone else gone through  something similar? (i didn‚Äôt proof read this, there may be many typos i‚Äôm on mobile)",19Sep2020,1

Hi there, Im from non speaking countries.
So there might be some grammer mistakes.
Please bear with me.

Im a femal who got a job from company that is located in Mexicali,Mexico.

But friends of mine are not super thrilled with the fact that this area is close to the US border.

Ive been the phillippines which could also be a bit dangerous. But I was fine.

This company offers me a fight ticket,residence that has a security guard and some good benefits.

I was wondering If you guys know what Its like in Maxicali,Mexico, It would be big big help for me.

Thanks",19Sep2020,1

For example, I did an AITA and there were so many overwhelming responses that I've started to wonder about myself. Just about my character.

140,"TL;DR at the bottom with the questions i need desperately need advice on. sorry for the big ass wall of text, like i shit you not this is literally college essay length at this point and i feel so bad and like no one will read it, but i might as well get it out there. I just needed to put as many of my frustrations into words because it's hard for me to explain these things verbally/put them into coherent sentences in verbal conversation, plus the fact i feel like i don't have anyone i can tell this to in general. if anyone has any questions about something that isn't clear or something that doesn't have enough context, let me know and i'd be happy to explain

To start this off, I'm a 17 year old girl, i live in florida, and am a senior in high school hoping to go to college to study microbiology. My grades are pretty decent (mostly A's and B's and the occasional C in math, but i have a pretty good GPA), I don't have a very large friend group so I don't go out much and have no interest in drugs and that stuff, I have a job that I bike to almost 60% of the time, but for some reason my parents (dad and step mother) find every reason they can to make me feel like shit, berate me for dumb things, invalidate every single problem I have and make things all about the, and constantly take things away from me that I need in order to do school (namely my phone, that *I* pay for) especially now that everything from assignments to tests are now online and I have multiple online classes that have assignments that are basically quizzes over the phone. (I'd also like to note that I literally only use my phone for maybe browsing twitter, sometimes reddit, but almost entirely school and occasionally texting my BF. I'm not attached to it at all and unlike a lot of teens it seems, i don't hardly use it for entertainment value)

I have suspicions that I have ADHD, I haven't been diagnosed but I've tried to educate myself as much as possible in order to rule it out but have come to the conclusion that not only I have it, but my dad does as well (I'm no psychologist though, and could always be wrong but I feel like the symptoms I've shown have only gotten worse over time and have just begun making me worry and think I have to do something about it because it is affecting my mental health and performance in school). Either way though, I show a lot of the symptoms ADHD characterized (in women) and I have explained as much to my dad and step mom over and over again how my brain seems to work and how they can help me or just have a basic understand me for what feels like forever but they still insist on being awful to me and refuse to try and understand me or give me any sort of help or peace of mind about it.

I've always been a very odd mix of introvert and extrovert (i think it's called being an ambivert) so very often I get easily irritated, but it usually shows in me through silence and short answered responses. I never intend to be disrespectful or rude, but my parents believe I do those things on purpose just to be an ass. They never come and talk to me about why I'm acting a certain way or why I did something, they jump straight to yelling at me and sending me walls of text over messaging while we're in the same damn house or while I'm at school where I'm already stressed as it is. They never come to me with any issues they have with my behavior, and best of all, I can't get more than 5 words in on any conversation I have with either of them because they seem to always want to be in the right. I think they have power trips when they do these things to be honest, it just always feels like I'm just some piss ant kid to them and not someone who is nearly an adult and in need of guidance.

They've been nasty towards me like this for almost a year now but since summer started and eventually school, where it has gotten the worst, things have just escalated more and more every single day. They've begun to lecture me more and more for stupid shit, namely the whole thing that has contributed the most to my current state of mental instability: I am supposed to sweep and mop the floors of the house daily, but between work, school, and school club activities, I'm not always able to do it, and I admit I have completely blown it off because there are literally 4 other children that are more than capable of doing this (three 15 year old's and one 10 year old). However, I don't feel like passionately angry lectures and confiscating my phone (which again, I have been paying for ever since I got it) are the way to going about my slacking in my one house chore. But I feel like since I have a job (I throw all of my money into a savings account to save for a car and for college, and occasionally food) and am handling so much at once in an attempt to do well in life, I feel I shouldn't have to do something like that in the first place. But that's off topic and not really the main issue i think.

The reason I'm writing this post today is because I'm so royally done with this shit I can't even make jokes about it like I used to in school. I think friday of last week is when it happened, but I was mopping and sweeping and the 10 year old (which i admit, i despise her with every fiber of my being) was running around and preventing me from doing what i was doing, so i vented to my biological sister. We've been through a lot of shit together and I truly thought she had my back but betrayed my trust and told my step mom how i was ""hating on her daughter for just living in the house"". So, she lectured me and said nothing more to me the entire day. Then the next day she sent me a wall of text, i cant remember when, but it was basically saying I was being a complete jackass, which by no means I deny but her reaction, in my opinion, was over the top and immature. She didn't speak to me and i haven't spoken to her much, if at all, if it didn't include her lecturing me.

Fast forward to Thursday. My step mom, who, granted gave me the opportunity to have my phone in the first place, took my phone from me Thursday morning just before I was supposed to leave for school at 6:30am and stated that she was taking it and nothing more. I only was given a reason after I followed her and asked her wtf she was doing that for and she informed me ""She is sick of the disrespect towards her and my dad and everyone in the house plus not doing the floors."" I was pissed but I wasn't able to get more than a ""I-"" in before she interrupted me and said more nasty things like ""you arguing with me is disrespectful"". 

This also reminds me of how my father told me the same thing while i he was lecturing me for wanting to cut school for a day to work on work in my online classes since I was behind (they took my phone from me and i couldn't do the phone call quizzes i had scheduled) and he got pissed at me for even asking and then started violent raging because I tend to just stand/sit through those lectures with a calm or completely neutral expression on my face, however, I cry whenever I'm yelled at and am frustrated/pissed of by the lecture or emotionally overloaded so I was crying during that as well. He then told me I had to quit my job because ""my house chore and school is more important than a fucking job"". That happened on wednesday, the day before my phone was confiscated from me. I had mental break downs the entire day and my parents didn't say a single word to me. not one. and actually I had to work at 6pm, but when i went in they told me they needed me to come in at 4 but because I didn't have my phone I had no idea. i felt awful and was pissed as hell again about my whole  no phone situation. I have taken when they say I am disrespectful to them as that ""literally existing, breathing or doing anything is disrespectful to them"". 

One last thing in regards to that, but the only thing my parents do for me outside of providing a house for me to live in is occasionally giving me a ride to work; i bike during the week when they work and only get a ride if a co-worker can take me then drive me home. they make me buy my own food if we go by some fast food place, which is rare because i don't get invited to go anywhere with the family, they never buy food for anyone but themselves, and more often than not I have to buy my own anyways because of that. i literally don't get invited to be part of family activities, like going to our uncles house or going to dinner, either. they always say its because my work schedule, but i find that to be utter bull shit since it's not that hard to just walk into my room, ask me when i work that week and see if whatever they want to do will land on my day off. I feel that's really selfish of me to say but i feel so sad and frustrated when i'm completely left out like that.

Fast forward again to today, all was well, it's my BF's birthday and we had plans to go to IHOP to celebrate, we communicated this all during school and I was pretty hyped. We have lunch at the end of the day now, so we grabbed some food and sat down, talked about about my issues recently and I remembered I still have to apply for a bunch of shit for college. So, fast forward one more time, I get home and since I still have my computer for some reason, which can do all the things i do on my phone minus text my co-workers, I started on trying to apply for FAFSA, only to find out I need to have my phone number and verify it along with my email. I, assuming this was at least an acceptable thing to let me see my phone for ONE second, asked my step mom to either let me check it for the code FAFSA sent to my phone, or she could do it herself and tell me it. She tells me that she completely deactivated my phone and that it was no longer on her account and that she wasn't going to allow me to have it back because I am disrespectful. 

This all means that I literally cannot do my online classes, or even my traditional classes right now since i have to take pictures of physical assignments and submit them to our online platform, I'm unable to communicate with my co-workers at all, AND I can't even apply for fucking student aid for college funds. 

It feels like this has put my whole future at a complete stand still while all of my peers are thriving and applying to colleges of their choice and succeeding in school and at their jobs. I don't know what to do at all, I feel i need to leave this environment as soon as possible but i don't have a car or license since (surprise, surprise!) i did my level-e test online and my parents waited almost a full year after i had completed it to take me to the DMV and get my permit a month before i turned 17. I don't even know HOW to drive a car because they've only let me drive all of like 8 times in my whole life. my parents haven't taught me shit about certain things adults have to do in america, shit, i didn't even know how to apply to colleges until some friends started helping me out with college researching, and even still i don't know much of anything about that.

To wrap this all up since this has gotten literally miles long, I just need some advice of how I should move forward in this situation. I've been having breakdowns about what the hell I'm going to do with myself almost every day now for the past week as things have escalated, and i really just need some help. 

TL;DR: My parents are compromising my mental stability by stating that basically anything is do, be it breathe or just exist in general, i'm disrespecting them. they, after a bunch of shit thats been happening over the course of the last week where they claim i'm being disrespectful towards them, they have taken my phone, that *I* pay for, and have completely removed it from their service providers account. I wouldn't care if i didn't need in order to do my online classes, communicate with my co-workers, and apply to FAFSA so I'm here asking for help because i have no idea how to be an adult despite being 17, almost 18.

Where should I start with looking for a place to live since I feel like there's no making this situation better by talking things out (trust me i've tried, it just goes in circles and i'm the piece of shit disrespectful child in the end), I have about $1600 at my disposal right now in savings? I think this process would obviously take longer, so fyi, i turn 18 in may and can get my drivers license in april (if i can learn to drive by then lmfao).

What can I do, if anything, to get a new service provider and phone in my name if my parents most likely won't sign off on an account for me since i'm 17 right now and have to ask for permission to do so (i think i have a friend willing to help me out by adding me to their account, but i'd rather not inconvenience them if i can)? How the FUCK do i buy a used car and what are the steps to doing the plates and stuff i hear people talk about? I'm still very in the dark about how college admissions works, so if anyone knows anything about that i'd be super grateful for that too! 

my brain is at full capacity at this point and i can't really think straight since it's been a wild ride of a day now, but anything at all, even just advice of how to diffuse this situation would be amazing! thank you if you read all of this, and i'm sorry for the length and how it probably doesn't make a lick of sense at some points.",19Sep2020,1

No TLDR because I want answers based off the details I give, if you‚Äôd like more info check out my account, past 4 or 5 posts have been about her. 

I‚Äôm 16, she‚Äôs 15. We have wierd school weeks where we go to school Monday and Tuesday, then the rest of the week was virtual learning. Today is Wednesday, I had liked her for about a week now. We talked in person twice, about 1 minute total talking time. I asked her Tuesday if she wanted to meet up and talk before school started. She was studying for a test and couldn‚Äôt. Tonight, I was tired of holding it all in. I even made some notes on my phone about her just to try to ease my feelings. I decided to send her a pretty long message. It basically outlined that I‚Äôm really shy around girls and she is the first girl I‚Äôve actually wanted to talk to, then I told her I liked her and I explained how I felt when we first talked. Then I told her I‚Äôm not expecting a relationship for awhile because we hardly know each other. 

Idk how long after I sent the message she opened it, but 20 minutes went by with no answer. My friend‚Äôs ex is her best friend, so I text my friend. He said that the group will discuss things for a few and then she will respond. After 30 minutes went by since I saw she opened it, I sent a ‚Äú?‚Äù. 

About 5 minutes later she responds with this: ‚Äúaww {my name} I wanna start off by saying that you are incredibly sweet and I really enjoy talking to you. I think you‚Äôre a really great guy! that takes a lot of courage to tell me that and i appreciate it so much. right now, i‚Äôm not in a good place to be in a relationship with school and everything but i think you‚Äôre a really great friend and I definitely wanna continue being that way.‚Äù

I responded with a question asking her if this was the nice way of saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna talk to you anymore.‚Äù 

The reason why I asked that is because with almost every girl I‚Äôve liked, I‚Äôve always gotten that response, and then never talked to them again. 

She said 2 times that she wants to be friends with me, she just does not want a relationship.


I am completely lost now. Do I still be friends with her and talk to her more and maybe in 2 or 3 months ask her out somewhere? Or do I leave her? 

Do I not send her any texts and see if she sends me one first? Do I keep talking to her? 

My goal would be to eventually ask her out around Christmas maybe.",19Sep2020,1
146,"Im sick of my family. Im living under constant stress and i have to listen to my dad and mom lose their temper and ranting about every little shit every damn weekend. Im tired of this. I was abused by them when i was younger which made my relationship with them really distant. They do not beat me anymore but the damage is done, i have no connection to them and i do not feel anything about them. And theyre confused as to why im so cold and dont talk to them much. I dont have a sense of family intimacy anymore, the only thing connection i have with them is biologically. 

They do care for me sometimes and i do realise it but i can tell that they arent emotionally healthy, my dad has temper issues and gets impatient and fed up with everything, it could be his stress, i dont know and i dont care. My mom is really toxic, when shes angry and disappointed she would shove negative comments up my arse continuously telling me how much of a piece of shit i am and then go on about how wonderful other kids are when im just an unfilial useless piece of junk.


 I agree with her im a cold asshole at times who doesnt care about family, but i know damn well that its not just my fault that im like this. Im emotionally unstable because of this family. When i broke down today my mom said i needed a doctor and degraded me by saying stuff like 'Do you think youre normal?! Youre not normal, youre a man, and youre crying like this, you seriously need help, why are you crying like this just because of some small matter?' as if its only my fault that im like this and she did nothing wrong.

They get nothing. Im not crying just because they disallowed me to lock my door, im sick and tired of them because they do not know how i feel, they dont want me to lock the door because they find it troublesome to wait for me to unlock the door everytime they need to come in. I cried because the fact that they value their convenience more than my privacy is telling me something is wrong. 

There was once i went crazy because I was sick of it all and my mind couldnt take it, we had a talk and they changed, but not for long. They went back to their old ways of treating me again, unreasonable, toxic, impatient and talking shit that destroys my self esteem completely. They do support me in terms of financially, they buy stuff for me and all, sometimes my mom comes home with drinks for me, but i dont need that, i need a normal family just like my friends. 

I know my parents try to be nice, but ive learnt that they cant because they arent emotionally healthy themselves. I will never trust my dad again when he says 'i can make a change,just tell me what youre unhappy about' because he has proven to me time over time he is unable to be a good parent. He gets fed up and curses at every little shit like when my table is messy/ my 9 year old brother isnt cooperative. 

My parents would argue with each other a lot too, especially when one of them loses their temper and the other one also loses their temper because of how the first one lost their temper, they would argue and say 'why are you so impatient, cant you just be more patient, dont shout, stop talking so aggressively etc' im honestly fucking sick and tired of these shit.

Basically they can be really nice because they try to, but i suspect that their mental health is making it impossible for them to be good parents. Even if they ever change, its not the same anymore, i still cannot open up to them. I need parents who are emotionally healthy themselves.

148,"     I understand this is a thing that you cannot get solid advice on but I would love to see some sort of feedback. (Skip to the bottom if you want to skip the story.)

     As of the past couple of months I have been feeling more and more down because of me coming to the conclusion of me being lonely. Do not get me wrong I do have two friends, both of them unable to show up to my high school either from them moving away or not being able to come due to their medical condition being more susceptible to COVID.
     
     To clear things up, I have no problem whatsoever being heard, or being understood when I speak. The problem is that I feel like I don‚Äôt belong anywhere. I tried to pick up on conversations and trying to join in on them or try to start a conversation but only to the end result of it being shallow. Like ‚Äúthe weather is pretty nice today.‚Äù It never goes anywhere.

     You may start to tell me that being an introvert (I think that‚Äôs the term) isn‚Äôt so bad, but I have decided that I do indeed want to have some sort of ‚Äúactive‚Äù social life. Since my school‚Äôs football team is a complete bust and all the years I have put into it and still feel like an outsider, I have decided to slip into a different sport: cross country. Just like the last sport I am still seeing the theme continue. 

    I do not need to fit into a clique for me to be happy, I just need someone new to deliver that feeling. My question is would be that how do you start a decent conversation and keep it rolling?

151,"So, I have this friend who I care for. Somehow he managed to be special for me. I really feel that there is a connection.

The problem is that it's very notorious that he doesn't have the same interest in me. Meaning, he responds when I talk to him, but never initiates conversation ( for example).  
We connect good sometimes (like talking relatively often) but then it can be weeks or months when I don't know anything about him.

I am a pretty affectionate person and I enjoy sharing on a daily basis with the people I care about. (I mean... that would be the ""ideal"" for me, but I can be ok with just talking often).

So, down to the issue: I've recently decided that I wanna have an equal relationship with my loved ones. And that starts with settling your standard, know your value, and distancing yourself from every place you don't feel valued. I understand that (actually, I cut loose a lot of them -internaly- but I don't know what happens with this particular one).  
In fact, a few months ago I decided to stop interacting with his person (although I couldn't cut him off completely) and I was very sad for a few weeks... I even felt like I really lost him, and I thought that it would be a long shot that we could connect again in the future.  
Because I wasn't gonna settle for less than equal interest.

But despite how strongly I decided to not contact him. I still think about stuff that I wanna show him. (And I can't think of a good reason not to, is like... well, it's hard to fight with my mind because when I don't do it, it keeps bugging me until I do, so I tend to do it just to get it off my mind).

I feeling lost now... I'm on my path of building my own self-esteem and I know that if and when I manage to be whole I wouldn't (or shouldn't) feel the need to be around someone that doesn't show interest in me.   
And despite I'm not there yet, I do feel like I'm making and advance. 

As I write this I think that you might say ""talk to him"" (and it sounds very logical) but I don't know if I can do that yet... maybe one of the things that is happening is that I might not feel that we are on the same level. (If I must confess, I think that I idolized him in the past). And for the friendship to be equal, I guess that we should be at the same level.

So, to sum up... I feel that what I should do is cut him off and make new friends, but somehow that doesn't feel like the right desition... And even if I wanted to, I don't think that I can do it.

I don't know if you can help me solve itthis, but maybe you can help me look at it from a different perspective.

152,"We only talk on text messages and it seems like she does not want to talk to me. You know, she responds with one worded answers and seems to forget previous conversations we had earlier. While yes I would conclude that this means she is not interested her other messages she send says other wise.

156,"I first met that person (lets call her Maria) when I was 18. We met at an almost blind date, we had a pretty good time and I think after that I fell for her. 
We went on a second and third date but we had to stop dating for a month because we had to focus on our final exams in order to apply to a university.

After that month I immedietly tried to ask her out again, she was giving me a lot of attention but her signs showed that she wanted me as a friend.
Long story short that was the case, we started hanging out, we met each other friends, mixed our cycles and together we created very nice memories. 
I thought I had convinced myself that I view her as a friend too, but I was obviously in love with Maria and she was obviously not.

Nine months had passed from our first date and my feelings hadn't changed for her, I figured out that I had to move on so I met another girl lets call her Nicole. She was a wonderful person and we dated for 7-8 months, there was chemistry and I had some feelings for her. During the time I was with Nicole, I quite oftenly was thinking about Maria, how I wished I could be with her.
After some time I had to brake up with Nicole because it wasn't fair for her, I was in love with another person... I didn't tell anyone the real reason I broke up with her...

After some time Maria and I created a special bond. 
She used to sleep in my house after clubbing (I live near the club area), she made me breakfast, she used to call ne for no specific reason, during an emergency I was the first person she called. Generally we used to spend more time together than with any other person from our common friends. I thought that I might had a chance to be with her. So once I tried to open that converstation by reminding her that we once dated (it was almost 2 years before) and asked her out of curiosity why we didnt date after the exams.
I dont remember exactly her answer but it was crystal clear that I was deep in the friend zone.

I was in denial for weeks after that, completely heart broken because I really thought I had a chance. I thought that it was healthier for me to stop spending so much time with her. She still called me and wanted to spend more time with me but I was a bit distant.

During the same period I had another friend Nick who liked Maria. So I thought if she is gonna be with somebody, it would be better to be with a nice guy like Nick. So I fixed them up and they dated for a couple of months. During those months I found out that my idea was really stupid as it really hurt more to see her with a good friend of mine. (I have to say at this point that I hide my feelings really well so nobody suspected anything and I was coping with it alone).

After they broke up I was so relieved I could again spend time with her, and I stopped being distant and reinstated our previous relationship. I again tried to convince myself that I stopped having feelings for Maria. I dated some girls, I had a lot of fun, but my feelings for Maria always held me back from having a serious relationship with another girl.

Now I am 22 and nothing really changed. Maria and I are still very close friends and we have an awesome time together. We have created together some very beautiful memories and she is in almost every great story I have from my college years. 
Apart from Nick she also has not found another person to have a meaningful relationship during those 4 years.
I date now and then girls but I feel nothing emotionally for them, all of them look inferior to Maria so nothing lasts more than 3-5 weeks.
I enjoy my life and the time I spend with Maria but it pains me really bad that I cant be with her.
I do not like the situation I am in, I really want to find a person to love and love me back, but my deep love for Maria holds me back from creating anything meaningful with another person. 
I am afraid that I wont be able to find somebody to trully love, I am afraid that I will have to find another ""Nicole"" and lie to myself that i love he.
I really need to stop have feelings for Maria. I need a fresh start. Can you please give a sincere advice?",19Sep2020,1

165,"Hi everyone,

I am so frustrated as Canada treats criminals too nice and rarely do justice, especially for sexual crimes. I am a 20+ college girl, I got sexually assaulted (touched and digital penetrated) under the laser gun during a laser hair removal session on the Brazilian area. Before that day, I had been his client for more than half a year.  It was all nice and normal at first but in the last few sessions, it all started to be weird (he tried to ask me out (but I never went out with him), texted me privately and touched me more than usual during sessions) and I end up suffering the sexual assault. That was my last appointment at that clinic, and the last time I saw him. I went to my school the next day and asked for help from the sexual assault office. They accompanied me to the hospital and reported the crime to the police. 

After all that, I had lost many things in life and almost put my relationship at risk. I am no stranger from sexual assaults, and I know I did everything right and tried to be strong, but I am suffering a lot from knowing how unfair it is to be a sexual crime victim. I am the only one bearing the consequences of his disgusting behaviour. I reported to the police because I want to protect other girls and prevent the same thing from happening again. It had been a year, there is no update, no court date, no nothing. I tried to reach the police multiple times but still no development in this case. 

I am not sure if I have such a bad luck to be the first victim? 

How can I find other sexual assault victims who have been assaulted by the same Doctor from a Vancouver clinic?

Should I just accept it there is no justice and let it go?

Is there anything else I can do to stop this pervert still working as a professional?

These thoughts pop up in my mind with anger as I know the clinic is still doing business as usual and with high ratings and stuff. It is furious to see how he still living his life comfortably this whole year while I am still dealing with the consequences of doing the right things.",19Sep2020,1

I bought my phone and pay the bill myself, but this made them angry not having control. My dad threatened to kill me, choked me and punched me in the face. I didn't fight back, but I did nudge him off of me. He threw me down stairs and literally put me in a full hold and my mom just stood there and threatened me too. He told me to get out with no shoes then blocked the fucking door and put his hands on me again. I wanted to swing on him but I didn't the entire time. I told my sister \[13\] to call the cops (pussy move on my part) when he was choking me and throwing me around. She didn't call the cops and just sat there crying, I feel shitty.

She won't return my text for hours and then I start going into a rabbit hole of thoughts on what she could be doing instead of texting me back.

She assures me that she's faithful and I have nothing to worry about.

She's a very attractive girl with a great personality. She's probably out of my league, which may contribute to me feeling this way.

Tl;dr I had sex with a married man and 8 months later he stands outside my work staring at me and tonight he actually showed up at my work with his wife

So, 8 months ago I had drunken sex with a married man. I knew he was married and given the chance, it‚Äôs not a mistake I would make again and it isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm proud of. It should never have happened. 
The day after it happened, the mans wife appeared at my work and punched me in the face. Whether or not you believe it‚Äôs justified, it‚Äôs still assault. 
Later I received a threatening message from the wife which I ignored and decided it was best to keep as much of a distance from this couple as possible. 

During lockdown, this man waited outside my house once and watched me go in. This made me uncomfortable but it was a one time occurrence - or so I thought. 
With my country coming out of lockdown, my work reopened and on our opening weekend (and every weekend since) this man has stood outside my work having cigarette after cigarette and it has been noted by my colleagues that he seems to be looking for me. 

This unsettled me a lot as I took his wife‚Äôs warnings pretty seriously, and I‚Äôm not looking to get assaulted again. I spoke to my manager about the situation and she messaged the man (as they know each other) asking why he was showing up and offered to talk to him about it. The man ignored my managers messages. 

Tonight, he came in with his wife. I was so scared of what might happen if I stayed that I had to leave work early. 

Basically, I just don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I‚Äôm doing my best to stay out of their way and it feels like they‚Äôre doing the complete opposite.

My parents are together, I have attended private school my whole life. I never had to worry about anything financial wise. Im not rich but my family is getting by good enough. For that, I‚Äôm extremely grateful. Since preschool (now I‚Äôm a junior in high school), I‚Äôve been attending private Catholic school. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have loved being apart of the church and leading a better life (and I truly believe other people have other ways to find a better life even if it isn‚Äôt through Catholicism). I‚Äôve been raised Catholic since a baby. I‚Äôve never had a problem with it. However, since I was about 11, i had started noticing my feelings get stronger and stronger for men through the years. I looked back and realized these feelings had always been there, i just didn‚Äôt know what they meant. When I started noticing them, I would stay up tirelessly trying to pray them away.I would ask God for me to be normal. This was when before I even thought of the possibility of me being gay. I just didn‚Äôt want to be so I would pray for God to not let me be. Now I see, I probably knew in the back of my head that I was gay. 

As I grown into being exposed to social media, I see the lives of other people who I never had been exposed to, Muslims, immigrants, and more. But I also saw the lives of LGBT people. I would secretly use my iPod to watch gay couples on YouTube. I would delete my search and watch history so my parents didn‚Äôt see it. A few years later, I somehow stumbled onto gay porn and began to watch it regularly. At first I watched it and still tricked myself into believing that I was straight, but I soon realized that I was sexually attracted to men and wanted to have sex with a man (I was a teenager at this point and by the way, I still haven‚Äôt lost my virginity, even though losing it isn‚Äôt a big deal to me at the moment.) I tried to watch straight porn to see if that would flip a switch in my head, but it didn‚Äôt. I was still watching the man the whole time. In the back of my head, I felt like a horrible person and overall, disobeying God and my parents. 

No one had and still doesn‚Äôt have any idea that I watched gay porn or even am gay. I began to be, and still am, at war with myself. The religious side of me is telling me that I shouldn‚Äôt be like this, that God is calling me to something greater and not live in sin. On the flip side, the gay side of me is saying that I‚Äôm normal and valid the way I am, that It‚Äôs been proven normal to feel like this. I tell myself that God will still love me. I have gone to both, the Catholicism and LGBT subreddits for advice and opinions. Catholics say that they love me, want to accept me, that I‚Äôm valid, and be open to God and live a celibate life. The LGBT subreddit was also telling me I was valid, just in a different way. They told me that it‚Äôs normal to act on your same sex attractions. They say that I was made like this. 

Honestly, I already knew what both were going to say, I just wanted validation. It‚Äôs been tugging at me forever, two huge aspects of my life tearing me apart. I can‚Äôt decide what to do. This is my life, but it just seems like I‚Äôm living it to make others happy. Though, I just want to be happy. I want whatever makes me happiest. If I choose to act on my gay attractions I will be happy with a man, but the church will say my happiness isn‚Äôt real til I‚Äôm with god but I can‚Äôt be with god til I repent. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Why can‚Äôt I just be both? Why is it so wrong? I came here to ask because I wanted an unbiased opinion by not going to only Catholics and not only going to only the lgbt community. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you &lt;3.",19Sep2020,1

I knew we weren‚Äôt ready to get married after what just happened. Fast forward about another two years, and he is determined to have a more adventurous sex life. We agree to go to this sex club [like a regular night club, but they have an attached building that is like all for just sex. It was the craziest thing I have ever seen.] On our way there, we talked a lot about what was going to happen, and we were just supposed to be going to see what it was like. Well, he ended up fucking some girl sitting on the sofa next to me. As you can imagine, it was soul-crushing and heartbreaking. I tried to get over it, but I couldn‚Äôt. I ended the engagement. I went out of state for a few months and cleared my head. I was really happy on my own. I was focusing on getting ready for the next year of school and being on my own. I had not talked to him for a month or two, and slowly we began just civil conversation about our shared dog. Then I moved back to the same state as him to keep going to graduate school. When I got back to town and right before classes started, I got raped.  I had a really hard time dealing with it. It was a friend I had known for years, and I just didn‚Äôt know how to process it all. My ex and I got closer again, and he began visiting me a lot. After about 6 months, we got back together. That was this past January we patched things up. Now he keeps saying that sex is too vanilla and he wants more. It is breaking my heart that after what the last time did to me [aside from breaking up, I went into a really bad depression, and my weight was an issue. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô9‚Äù and hardly weighed 120.] Anyway, I don't know what to do now. He is saying he wants more and I just don't know I can't so that. I don‚Äôt know what to do. If I don‚Äôt do it, I‚Äôm convinced he will just do it behind my back. 

ALSO, 
1. he cheated when we were in college. It was only an emotion relationship because the other girl kept demanding he end things with me. 
2. I found a BUNCH of porn on his phone that was transexual porn. Not an issue, but when I confronted him about it he lied for 4 days and got confrentation and made it my fault. [after he cheated the last time he told me I could look at his phone whenever I wanted to to make myself feel better to prove he wasnt doing anything. I normally don‚Äôt but I just gont a feeling like he was hiding something] The lying is really an issue for me. Trust has always been an area we struggled in. 
3. I also found a BUNCH of messages from him to other people durring the few months we were technically broken up but when I thought we were back together. They were from after he asked me to get back together but I said Iwasnt ready to trust him or forgive him for what happened and I didnt want to say yes holding on to all that. I‚Äôm conflicted on if I‚Äôm wrong for being hurt that he was messaging people and attempting to see them when he was making me think it was jsut us and he was 100% committed to me. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong. I mean he wasnt technically in a relationship. Althought he was statying at my parents house with me over the holidays durring a loarge portion of the time in question. 
4. I am still with him because outside of thes VERY LARGE issues he is great. My family life is extremely complicated, and he is fantastic when it comes to my parents. He is going to be a wonderful father and I love his family. 
5. I really love him and I want to make it work. I want to be the person he wants me to be. He knew when we first started dating I had only ever slept with one other person. I wasnt slutty or wild. Nothing wrong with that at all, it‚Äôs just not my preference. I dont know how he could know all of that when we got together 8 years ago and then somehow wany me to change so much now. 


What do I do? Do I just give him what he wants and figuer out a way to deal so I dont loose him? He told me the options are either we break up or we do nothing and he is miserable and he just deals with himself. He has said he knows I won't do what he wants, but it feels like he is attempting reverse psychology or trying to guilt-trip me. How can I want to be in a relationship with him when he keeps telling me he will just carry on being miserable and unfulfilled? Just before he brought this it felt like things were getting better. 

I dont know what to do. Should I stay with him and just make myself do what he wants? Should I stay with him and tell him I just cant and deal with him telling me that he just will be unhappy to make me happy? (it feels very manipulative when he says this) Do I leave him?",19Sep2020,1

I (20 F) have an estranged relationship from my mother. Something that is and also isnt a recent occurance. For more details pls check my only other post on reddit in AITA. 

Always In my life I have craved affection from my mother that i never recieved but this feeling has only increased recently since Ive (nonvoluntarily) left my childhood home. Everyday It seems like I am craving for a hug or motherly reassurance idk I'm feeling hollow like that part is missing. But because of my experience with my mother in that aspect, i am scared of being cared for or vulnerable. I find it hard to ask for that type of stuff from other family like my aunts or cousins because I feel too old to do so, I can't possibly ask someone to simulate as my mother, and some part of me is scared it will be fake (?). Ikr? Crazy lol

Here are my questions...

How does one ask  for this type of affection and avoid coming off as needy?

Am I too old to be needing this stuff? Should i just grow up and get over it?

Would it be disrespectful to my actual mother to be searching for her replacement?


The last thing I wanna do is be anyone's burden or cause anyone issues..

They agreed, but the second I was in my room I could hear them whispering and to kinda catch them, I left my room to get water and they immediately stopped and pretended nothing had happened.

203,"Tldr. My boss took a picture of me and sent it to corporate without my knowledge or consent.

First a bit of context. Im 17 and I work at a local movie theater, I've been with the company for almost 2 years now, im always to work on time, i do what is expected of me, and im just a general chill and quiet guy. I love working there in general and everyone has been very nice until recently.

So tonight I had a long night shift, it was a Friday night and we weren't extremely busy. Everyone always has their phones on them and we will usually pass time looking at social media once we've complete all our tasks and as long as there are no customers around. That is until about last week. When we reopened for covid we also got new policies, these included that we we're not allowed phones when on the clock, it specified that phones are to be LEFT AT HOME OR IN THE CAR, i find this strange because what if there's a family emergency or something? But this policy did not start being inforced until this week, despite the fact that it was updated months ago. Anyways I was cleaning theaters by myself tonight and I stopped for literally 30 seconds to respond to a text, there was nobody around(so I thought) and i was making good time, so I figured I would type a quick response and go back to work, 30 seconds or less. My boss happened to be upstairs at the time checking projectors and took a picture of me. Later right before I clock out I get called into the office for a wright up. I read the reasoning and saw that he mentioned an ""attached image"", this write up would be going to corporate and include a picture that was taken of me without my knowledge or consent.

He called me and ask for immediate help on the deck because there might be a possibility of a merge or the other company acquiring us.

So far I've been pretty successful and haven't had any issues. I like where I'm at right now and am happy that covid-19 hasn't gotten in the way of achieving this.  

Where my issue arises is noticing how people will sometimes talk to me differently. To preface, I do have a southern accent. Not as thick as something you'd hear from a character on King of the Hill or other southern archetypes. Having this as apart of my character though I'm noticing some people lump steryotypes and stigmas that are usually associated with the south when talking to me. To counter this I've had plenty of pleasant conversations with people that are curious about where I'm from that have lead to some freindships and professional relationships. However, Im really unsure how to handle the few encounters when people begin mocking a southern accent, referring to everyone in the south as ""hicks"", asking questions about incestuous relationships, etc. 

I know some poeple are intending these as one off playful remakrs which Is fine and understanble.

I asked him why can‚Äôt you sometimes come over like ask to come or something. It just makes me feel good when someone comes over and stuff. 

And then he was like OH so u want me to beg you, beg you for me to come over, what if I don‚Äôt wanna be there etc etc. I got shocked because I didn‚Äôt say anything like that, it freaked out a lot (I suffer a lot from GAD) But I calmed down and I told him it‚Äôs not like that and it‚Äôs more like when I asked to come over or see him, I would want him to ask me.

But he got really mad and starting saying things and said he‚Äôs going to hang up and leave before I start crying over something stupid, which I did started crying over.

I‚Äôve seen her three times total since she left the hospital, all of which have been around her family, all one week apart. Last week I asked Alice‚Äôs mom if she was okay with Alice coming to my house where we would be monitored by my mom, a question she shut down immediately.

Alice tells me things will get easier and I will be able to see her more and more, but I have around a year and I half before I ship off to the Navy. I don‚Äôt know if I want to wait around on her mom to decide we can go and get coffee together alone in two, three, four months from now - but I feel horrible. I feel like I owe it to Alice to stick through this, considering how she has basically nothing to do but sit around doing online school and watching TV because of a decision we made.

I just feel terrible because I know I could be seeing someone else right now more than Sundays of each week, with more physical intimacy than holding hands in church. But I also know if I cut this girl out, even if I tried to explain all of this, I will break her. I‚Äôm in over my head and I‚Äôm going to try to work up the courage to be honest with Alice‚Äôs mom this Sunday. I have a strong feeling that conversation will change nothing. I‚Äôm not after sex, but I haven‚Äôt been able to kiss Alice since that night and even hugging feels eerily monitored around Alice‚Äôs mom and stepdad. I want to hold out for her, but it‚Äôs sacrificing my happiness for hers in doing so, which I know she so desperately needs right now after an attempt.

What the fuck do I do? I just want to hear any solutions at this point, my family knows I‚Äôm going through this but keeps telling me as sticky as the situation is I don‚Äôt owe her anything, but I disagree.",19Sep2020,1
216,"I just moved into a new living situation with a friend who I know fairly well, Ive known them for about a year. Something has been bugging me lately. i guess Im just venting. But she does this thing where she will come and go from the house or in and out of rooms that I'm  in without saying anything. For example. She comes home from working all day, Im sitting on the couch and she walks right by without saying anything or even looking at me, within 5 feet of me, like im not even there. Another example, Im in the kitchen doing dishes and she walks right by me leaving for the day without saying anything. I wouldn't expect her to say anything if I was in my room but she's walking RIGHT by me, it feels weird to not say anything. I guess people just have different little quirks about roomates and living space. For me its normal to be like ""Hey how's it going?"" Or Good morning! or Hey Im going to work, Ill probably be back around 6. Have a good day! Just stuff like that, if your in the same space, rather than just walking around each other silently. But I guess not everyone is like this. I nearly always said Hi to her, would ask her how work was if we were in the same room but then one time I didn't and she didn't say anything, didn't ask me any questions about my day, or even say hello. So then I wondered if this was just how she was, so I waited for her to say Hi a few times and she never did lol. So now I just feel kind of weird about it.. I guess what I need to do is just say hi to her to make myself feel more comfortable, regardless of how she responds. If you read this whole thing, thanks haha.",19Sep2020,1

218,"I'm not really sure where to turn. My 7 year marriage has mostly been rocky and it's over.

Our marriage started off great and I even did the custody papers to get his kid. Long story there, but basically his mother was not a fit parent. Over the last 7 years I have done everything for my husband and my stepson. 

During this time I had my own daughter, but ended up feeling like I was doing all of the work. My husband ended up not being a partner at all but more of another kid. At some point during this time I found out he was flirting with another girl and blaming me for being ""crazy"" when I questioned him about why he was so weird with his phone. 

Shortly after this time I asked him to move out because I just couldn't handle all of the stress of being a new mother, a mother to my stepson, and my husband. Shortly after moving out his number one priority was getting a girlfriend, which I found out after we ""worked things out"". I asked him specifically if he had been with anyone else and he lied.

A few years later, he then made out with a friend of mine while drunk. Afterwards, I worked hard to move out of this toxic neighborhood and bought a home and he said he wouldn't drink again. 

We moved into our home and life was perfect. He had grown so much and it seemed like we were going to make it. Our family was so happy. A year and a half I was over the moon.

Until. . . January of this year. I walked in on him drunk  having sex with my sister in law. I told him it's time for a divorce, but I was torn because my stepson needed a mom. 

July, I find out stepson, my little angel of a stepson who I loved dearly was molesting my daughter. Stepson was immediately removed and now lives with his mother.

I now have no reason to stay. There's no more guilt or feeling like I need to be around for my stepson. 

Currently, I am in a another bedroom and I don't plan on losing the home I worked so hard for because my husband and his stepson are the way they are. I also don't want my daughter to deal with anymore traumatic events at the moment. Shes been abused and lost her cousins as well as her brother. 

I'm not really sure what I am asking for. I've already grieved the loss of my marriage and in the back of my head I knew he would cheat again. No surprise there, but I'm angry. I'm angry with my husband, my stepson and with myself. 

 I do everything as it should be done. I work, take care of my family, make a good living, and love / loved my kids and gave them the life and mother / stepmother I always wanted. I'm a good woman, a great wife and mother. These are things I know.

My husband thinks he can fix this, but I have nothing left to give him. 

I'm just not really sure what to do right now other then keep myself and my daughter busy. I am not really sure what I am asking advice for, except some guidance. I don't get have anyone to talk to.

tdlr: My husband is a cheater. My stepson molested my daughter. My marriage and family has been ruined and I am not really sure where to go from here.",19Sep2020,1
219,"So, I met this guy on discord just a few days ago. He was super cool. We talked about homework at first because my status was about homework and then we started talking about our problems.

I agree with him and he said something about wanting to be a girl. Then, he says ""I can be your gf."" And since it was online, I just went ""yeah, sure.""

Another thing is that we found out that we actually lived really near each other so yeah. It's not that I don't like him, I just don't know if I would be comfortable meeting in real life or going out in real life, also because my mom would absolutely hate me if she found out.

220,"I'm 26 now (and male) and have spent the majority of my life dealing with mental health problems. 8 months or so ago I basically had an epiphany and have been healing from my problems in leaps and bounds but now I'm picking up the pieces of spending over a decade in the equivalent of a mental fetal position. I live at home, still have some residual social anxiety (and also since I haven't socialized nearly as much as most people I'm not really polished on social skills), I have a huge fear of driving and still don't have my license, I don't have a job, I'm about 80 pounds overweight, I never dealt with my speech impediment, (lisp), I have no friends, etc.

In about a week  I'm scheduled to start a year-long class to get a diploma in something that has a stable job market and doesn't pay great but opens doors and is something I think I'll like etcetcetc. I'm planning on doing a few classes and seeing how things go and since the course is only 2 and a half days a week I'm planning on learning how to drive and getting a job as  I go to school and in the mean time working on my speech impediment and also maybe taking up learning an instrument? I'm trying to develop hobbies and skills which will not only support me financially but will assist in me meeting people and trying to create meaningful relationships.

I have a plan and I know ""how"" to make friends and ""how"" to get a job and ""how"" to cope with anxiety but it's just sort of DOING it and living it that I would like some advice or maybe encouragement on or stories if you've experienced something similar and how you dealt with it",19Sep2020,1

I have a bachelor's degree in hospitality management. I've spent the last 10 years working in stadiums and arenas, working my way from bottom rung to senior manager at one of the busiest properties in the country. 

I have worked the Stanley Cup Finals, MLB Playoffs, NFL Playoffs, College Gameday, March Madness, and some of the biggest concerts of the decade. 

I have extensive experience in food and beverage, event management, catering sales, vendor management, procurement, inventory, HR, P&amp;L, sanitation and safety, and so much more. 

I've been in this industry since I was 19. It's all I've ever know and I've excelled at it. I freaking loved my job. And now it's gone. Who knows when it is ever coming back. Almost everyone I have ever worked with has been laid off.

I've applied for 300+ jobs during this pandemic (not an exaggeration) and haven't had any luck. I hired a professional to do my resume, but I think I'm a hard sell coming from such a niche industry. I might have to go back to school and make a complete career shift at this point.

226,"Hello all! Below is a bit of backstory why I‚Äôm posting, I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs long...

I just finished my manager training and tonight was my first night back at my store/cafe/restart. My General Manager (GM aka head boss of your store) was there to watch me and advise me what to do (I told him I‚Äôm a hands on learner and I don‚Äôt learn much by verbal directions or shadowing a person). The shift went relatively smooth, my GM and an associate said it went better than they expected (they admitted it was a backhanded compliment). When my GM asked my associates for feedback about me and how they think the shift went, everyone said it went really good. The common critique they said was I need to guide them better on what to do in down time (they are all young, 16-18, first jobs). It‚Äôs fair and I know what I‚Äôll work on for tomorrow‚Äôs shift, but I feel like it wasn‚Äôt enough. I know I need to work on a lot more but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre trying to spare my feelings? My boss could tell I felt defeated and asked me why, that I didn‚Äôt do bad... but I don‚Äôt know, I simply felt like I didn‚Äôt do enough and that I‚Äôll be a crappy manager. I just didn‚Äôt feel good about myself. It‚Äôs hard to describe. 

A side note: everyone generally speaking I got a long with all but 2 people before I went to manager training so maybe they‚Äôre being nicer because if that? 

I just wanted to ask if you guys could tell me what are some things that you/your managers do that you like? (Also dislike)",19Sep2020,1

She told me on the first date that she had recently gotten out of an engagement and was still dealing with that, which I was willing to take on with her.

243,"Sorry if I make any grammar/spelling mistakes, english is not my first language.

I (16F) have been struggling with my sexuality for some time now.  I have not really spoken to anybody about this in real life, only my friend (18F) who I met online.  She is bisexual.  I recently told her that I think I am bisexual too but I prefer boys more than girls.  I thought this was okay because I read about being bisexual and having a preference in a lot of blogs and stuff, but when I told her she started freaking out.  She told me that I am not actually bisexual, I only want to date boys and only want to hook up with girls because I do not even like them I am just trying to seem attractive to straight boys.  

I do admit that so far most of the attractions I have had to girls have been physical, but I think that is because I only recently realized that I am attracted to girls but I have known that I am attracted to boys my whole life.  I do sort of want to have an actual relationship with girls, I just have not thought about it that much yet I guess.  I am definitely attracted to girls, and this has nothing to do with anyone else or trying to please people.  I just want to be really clear that my feelings toward girls have nothing to do with trying to seem attractive or anything, they are all genuine.  However, I think I do like boys better.

So can I identify as bisexual even if I like boys better? Or is my friend right and I should identify as something else? I am trying to read more LGBTQ blogs and stuff like that but I am really confused and they all say so many different things so it would be really helpful to get a direct response.",19Sep2020,1
244,"So me and gf have been living in our about for about 2 years now. We keep a fairly clean apartment with the exception of a few clothes on the floor here and there.

About 4 months ago, we had new neighbors move in upstairs.  About a few weeks after they moved in, we noticed roaches in our kitchen and bathroom. I contacted the property manager and they sent out an exterminator to our unit. They said that they dont believe we're the source of the roaches and they may be coming from upstairs.

During this whole fiasco, we've been noticing our upstairs neighbors have been excessively stomping and vacuuming at all times of the day and night. Not only are we fed up the roaches, but also with being woke up at 4am to loud stomping.

I talked to the manager about see if they would send the exterminator upstairs but they said they can't send them up there unless they call in. The neighbors claim they dont have roaches but I know that can't be the case.

So now we are killing roaches almost everyday and we are at our breaking point. Im gonna contact the office to see what they are going to do to kill the roaches at the source bc spraying our apt will just keep them away for about a week or 2. My gf recommends not paying rent until they fix the problem but I know they'll evict if we do that.

What should we do???",19Sep2020,1
245,"So met this boy at work, same age as I. I was head over heels over him, super shy and bashful whenever he was around. Sure I've had my fair share of doubts but I'm pretty sure he liked me too. I never ever liked someone like this before. He seemed like a perfect match. He'd tell me of his ambitions of becoming a paramedic and eventually a firefighter. He was constantly fatigued from balancing work and school all at once. I found this dedication to be admirable. It was all well until ""Spring break"" hit. Lasted for only about 6 months...

So after that dreadful span of waiting, I came back and noticed that he didn't work there anymore. It was expected, still made me sad. I'm not sure if he forgot about me or maybe he moved on. I kept on questioning that maybe I was being delusional and he didn't actually like me after all. I don't have any way to contact him except for a fellow co worker who keeps in touch with him from time to time. She's a very generous, trustworthy person. I can merely tell her that I like him and she can relay the message. Sounds easy on paper but there is so many different ways this could go south.

On Monday, I asked her if she knew where he went, hoping that she'd get the gist that I like him. She told me that someone told her that he had quit working to focus on school full-time. I wondered if this meant he was gone forever. Is there risks I must take to see him again or should I give up?

Yesterday, she said she has a week left before she goes on maternity leave cause she's pregnant now... So my time is very limited. I need a strategy that involves a minimal amount of humiliation.

Strategy A. I tell her that I have a secret crush on our friend. I would like to imply that she needs to tell him my feelings and hopefully I can see if my feelings are requited (I have a deathly fear of rejection so this is where the humiliation and sadness would occur). Or perhaps I should say directly to her that she needs to tell him how I feel incase she doesn't get the hint?

Strategy B. I ask for her number and tell her my secret through text after she leaves work. I'm not sure if this would be as effective though, unless there is any ideas that would work better.

Thanks in advance for any feedback",19Sep2020,1
246,For some background I picked up a job at a fast food chain over the summer for some money and work experience (in 17 in senior year of high school) and it was all fine until school started. It's been two weeks and we are doing in person and I haven't gotten a good sleep in two weeks or really had like any downtime. My weekend is just gone besides Sunday which I don't work but then is when I'm doing all my school work. Work itself is so stressful it's so fast paced and I get so anxious my heart hurts and I have trouble breathing not to mention the manager is a pain in the ass to deal with. The reason I'm thinking of quitting before my shift tomorrow is that they randomly scheduled me for like an extra 4 hours and with today having an anxiety breakdown I'm honestly not sure what will happen to me health wise. This whole thing is so unorganized and random but I'm just such a mess right now and I don't want to quit because it seems rude to quit the same day without notice but I genuinely fear for my health that I have to work the whole extra shift randomly.,19Sep2020,1

My best friend doesn't always eat lunch........

Hey guys, I knew this is the place to go for some advice, so here I am. I also posted this on r/raisedbynarcissist. My parents are very much not narcissistic, but my best friend's mom and stepdad very much are. For anyone wondering, I'm a 13 and 1/2 year old female and he is an 11 year old male.

So I knew his mom was terrible before, but I didn‚Äôt know she would sometimes refuse him lunch. His stepdad verbally abuses him all the time, so he has figured out ways of fighting back without anyone knowing. She pretty much finds fault in everything he does, but then asks him to do everything for her. Somehow even if he had no relation to an event going wrong, he gets blamed, and he's starting to blame himself. He says he actively cry‚Äôs himself to sleep. His stepdad is a whole other horror show, I write about him some other time because he wasn‚Äôt even around for my friend's lunch.

We both are empaths, and if you don't know what that is I'll just sum it up right quick; we can feel your feelings, your life force, your being, and even hear the flow of your thoughts. Around 2% of the population are empaths, except some empaths are much, much stronger than most empaths (as in we can feel emotions stronger and can use mental energy better). Me and him have known we were empaths since we were around 2 or 3 years old, we just didn‚Äôt know the word for it until this year. We are sort of soul best friends if that makes sense.

We met this year, and due to COVID we didn‚Äôt talk for several months. My mom prefers we stay outside so we don't have to wear masks around each other, so that's why in the story we are outside. I'm hesitant to say anything about his situation without asking first, but I feel like the sooner he and I get advice on this, the better.

Earlier this afternoon he knocked on my front door, my mom answered and I came downstairs and out the door once my shoes were on. The moment I step onto the porch, I know something is wrong. He just felt.... sick. Not virus sick, but the kind of sick when you don‚Äôt eat right. I immediately ask him
Me: Um, are you ok? You feel sick.... (I understand that sounds very weird in context, but it's pretty normal for an empath to outright say ‚Äúyou don't feel right‚Äù) 
Him: I'm fine
Me thinking: Does he reeeeeeally think that convinced me? 
I was also realizing he look skinnier. We both are very skinny, but he seemed abnormally skinny. He was also taller, so maybe he had just gotten skinnier because of that? No. Something was off. He told me after this conversation that he weighs 79 pounds. He's almost 5 feet tall, he should be much heavier than that, though I will say I had trouble gaining weight at his age (still do, I am wayyy underweight) and he say he just has a high metabolism. This is a summed up version of our conversation-

Me: You've gotten skinnier. Have you eaten much?

Him: Well, I skipped lunch today.

Me thinking: Oh hell, what is he thinking!?

Me: That isn't good for you, why didn't you eat lunch!?

Him: Well, I came down late for lunch, and my mom had already fed everyone and put them in their bed for nap time, so she pretty much said tough luck.

Me thinking: This is wrong on so many levels! Wait, there‚Äôs no way this is the first time this has happened. 

Me: Does this happen often?

Him: It's happened a lot lately 

Me: You shouldn‚Äôt skip lunch

Him: I know

Me: Skipping lunch a lot can make you sick, you need to eat something, especially if this happens a lot.

Him: it doesn‚Äôt happen thaaat much

Me thinking: You don't have to go back on your word. I can feed you boi. 

Me: I can get you a couple dinner rolls I made last night, there are still two left. (We were just talking about the dinner rolls before this conversation, and he knows they are my favorite :( )

Him: Uh one's alright, you can have the other

Me thinking: I can make more, just eat them! I really like them..... but he didn‚Äôt eat lunch so he needs to eat dinner rolls, or something.

Me: You need to eat, I'm ok with you eating the last two, I can make more some other time (I like cooking, so it's not too inconvenient for me to just make more).

Him: No, I'll just have one.

Me thinking: NOOOO I DON'T WANT YOU TO STARRRRRRVE! 

He wouldn‚Äôt except the second dinner roll. I brought him one of the dinner rolls (made sure to get the biggest of the two) and heated it up before I brought it to him. He said it was good. The dinner rolls are very filling and he didn‚Äôt feel sick after that. I told him that if his mom ever made him skip lunch again, he could come down to my house and I'd make him spaghetti. If anyone can give advice as to what exactly I can do for him to get him out of this situation, I would love the help.
I may post more on here about him, or my other friend who also has a terrible mother. He also has 4 sisters.",19Sep2020,1

250,"Very long post, if you are going to give a very detailed response I recommend you read through it all, but I have included a TL;DR if you aren't interested in reading through this all. 

TL;DR: I'm different from everyone else in social situations and personality wise. I fear these differences will evolve into bigger issues in life and I have no clue what to get help for. 

I literally feel like an alien on my own planet, I've always kind of felt this way but now that I've grown up a bit and matured, I'm much more aware of it and the feelings of being an alien have only grown since I was a kid.

A little while ago I was looking at some social media's I had as a kid, the more private and anonymous ones where I felt more comfortable to share my sense of humour and opinions. I always had the more common social medias like Instagram and Snapchat but I always stayed away from posting a lot.

Anyways I was looking back at these posts and I kind of realized my sense of humour was very bizarre. I don't know how to describe it. Now that I'm older looking back on it made me think to myself ""ok this kid is really fucking weird""

I started thinking about that time of my life and realized nobody at school ever really wanted to be my friend. I had people I talked to but never got close with anyone. Now that I'm older Ive made attempts to reach out and socialize with others at work and other areas in my life. Some people enjoy my presence, but I feel like more than not the people I socialize with think I'm a little different. Definitely not as strange as I used to be as a young teenager though.

I was never seen as a dangerous or creepy kid in my younger years (at least I don't think I was) but I could definitely tell that almost nobody wanted to be my friend or attempt to socialize with me after they meet me.

Because of this I've learned to be very independent, but this feeling of loneliness from my independent lifestyle is a feeling I've been struggling to ignore and work around. I have improved my social skills over the past few years to the point where I can fit in but as the people around me grow older I start to realize I'm the only one going in this direction, where nobody can ever relate to me or connect with my personality.

This is something that's been on my mind for a very long time and I just want to feel like someone actually gets me, someone who understands why I'm so different and accepting of it. But at this point it just seems like more and more of an impossibility as time goes by like I'm really losing hope that I can fix this issue one day.

A couple more things about me, I have ADHD and OCD, and a mood disorder, this social bubble issue I have could be a result from the combination of these mental disorders, but that feels unlikely to me. I am also extremely intelligent, professional IQ tests have put me at IQ tests above 140. I have been gifted in technical classes like science and maths, and would get 95% in those classes without trying. And in other classes like English, I would make a decent effort to try and barely pass. I also obsess on my hobbies and interests, for example I like to write music. So throughout my day all I will think about is different ideas, even when I'm at work or doing anything besides that hobby. Or if there is a person I'm extremely attracted to or romantically interested in I will think about them all day everyday, which is giving me the fear that one day this might evolve into a stalker, which is another reason I'm asking for advice. I have extremely high energy in conversation, I usually am the one who controls conversation and I use way too much enthusiasm and I've been told I tend to ramble on a lot by fellow peers. I've noticed recently that in people I am attracted to, I tend to have very little enthusiasm and I'm too direct with them and don't really read between the lines so well.

I seriously want to crack down what is different, because I'm certain I can't be the only one who has these same differences, but I have no clue how to actually talk about these issues to a psychologist or professional. It's so hard to describe something you don't understand to someone who is an expert on this kind of stuff. I've booked an appointment with a psychologist and I hope to talk about these issues and my mood of recent but like I said I have no clue how to bring up this issue, the best way to describe it is it's like building my own working car without knowing a thing about cars, and teaching a mechanic how they can build my car, it just seems impossible. I've touched on this before with other psychologists and psychiatrists but it seems like every time I leave those conversations I always described it incorrectly and I missed out on a lot of the points I wanted to make.

How can I figure this out this issue and how can I get rid of this alienated feel I have everyday?",19Sep2020,1

254,"Hi all,

Sorry if this is long but I felt like I needed to just talk it out. (lol)

I (16M) have been struggling with depression for a while. Mental health is kind of a topic I kind of avoid but I'll just give a ""short"" backstory on my struggles. When I was 13 I finally started dating a girl that I had like for around 8 years, and I thought we would have an amazing summer together. I tried really really hard (she was way out of my league so I had too), and it seemed that we were infatuated with each other, so it kind of gave me high expectations of romance. But she dumped me and I started doing the whole cringey breakup thing (mainly emo music), and not talking to anyone. However this really turned into severe loneliness, and my ""friends"" started ditching me too, just when I needed them. Because of this I was really feeling suicidal because I felt like I was stranded. 

Fast forward I'm still hella lonely, and depressed, but I've learned to deal with it. I know it sounds like the typical teenage boy with broken heart type shit but I've really struggled with crippling loneliness, and I haven't been able to form romantic relationships for a while. To make matters worse, most of the girls in my area differ from me morally, politically, and are all extroverted, going for the super popular, hot guys. I on the other hand am introverted and a little above average (or so I think lol), and even though I can strike up a conversation, I don't have the confidence that turns these girls on.

So I find my romance elsewhere. Through Webtoon.

Now I know this isn't the best thing, and its kind of a guilty pleasure for me cause most people think I'm a little girly if they see me reading them. But I really do love them, they make me cringe but I love them nonetheless. (Orange Marmalade is my favorite for those who know some webtoons)

 But every time I read one of them, and I read a lot, I keep feeling emptier and emptier. While I'm reading it makes me feel happy and wholesome, but once I'm done it feels like these are impossible realities. They are, and I know that; but it's starting to make me feel like I'll never find happiness through love, and that I'll be lonely for most of my life. I know this is immature and illogical thinking, but it's really making my depression worse. I'm not suicidal anymore, though I may have the occasional thought (I think I just do it to wallow in self pity), but I just don't want to go back to how I was. And overall, I want to be happy, to have someone to lean on. I'm really f\*cking tired of being lonely.

 Any help/advice that'll help me feel happy would be greatly appreciated, and thanks for listening; it just feels good to get it out.",19Sep2020,1

257,"Background, late 30's white guy (American), average in almost every way. I have a job that I truly enjoy, married to a wonderful woman, own a home, etc. I genuinely enjoy my life. However, the world seems to be falling apart. 

The American political climate is supremely depressing. I have great respect for most classically conservative values but I can't see any of that in the current Republican party. The Democrats are being praised for somehow being the lesser of two evils. Cool, but I have no misconception that they're not majoritively scummy in their own ways. If you think of politics as your job as opposed to service then you'll find yourself fighting unemployment rather than driving progress. 

The social climate is just as fucked. Politics seems to have turned some people into monsters. How is this a society? How can people be so small-minded and selfish? The family who I once disagreed with now truly upsets me, they're unrecognizable to the people I grew up with. 

Flat earth theory? Anti Vaccine? Climate change deniers? What on earth is going on with people... Are they just so afraid of being irrelevant in a fast-paced world that they're willing to build a soapbox on top of nonsense? 

There just seems to be a web of systems preventing what seems to me to be obvious changes. It should be hard to get a gun (I'm a gun owner, it was INSANELY easy. I fucking picked it up in some dudes garage who didn't even look me in the eye). Cops shouldn't be fucking killing and beating people in the streets. I don't know what argument can be made against that statement. I'm a pro-union person, but if your union is enabling this kind of shit, then it should be dismantled. Why is America so proud of their unwillingness to think of a whole rather than the individual. 

I want to have a child but am truly scared to bring a kid into this world. I feel like there's no meaning to this life anymore and every day is just this exercise in masochism as things sink further down.

258,"I've been working at my current job for almost a year and have had a crush on a colleague for the majority of the time I've spent there. We have absolutely loads in common and have some really good conversations. We walk in the same direction to go home most days too, so we've spent a lot of time together. After months of thinking about it, I decided to ask her out the other day. She was really surprised and kinda panicked at first, she seemed really nervous and embarrassed. But she said yes. Later on in the evening she text me apologising for freaking out a bit but said she'd love to go out some time.
The next day we went on a walk for a few hours and had a really nice time but in the morning before we met up she text me saying she just wanted to stay friends. Which was disappointing but she is really cool so I was happy to still go and hang out as friends.

I have a suspicion that she might have some intimacy issues or is generally kinda freaked out by getting close with people. I know from conversations we've had in the past that she's never been in a relationship and has never even been on a date as she thinks they're terrifying.
I think based on the fact that she got really flustered when I asked her out, and that initially she said yes, she might like me but is nervous about it. 

There's also lots of other things that I noticed before asking her out that led me to believe she might feel the same about me, which is why I asked. (Always looking at me, getting shy around me sometimes, etc.)

Of course, my first instict is just to leave it and abide by her wishes. And I've already said to her that she doesn't have to worry about me being persistent or asking her again, I'm totally cool with being friends and carrying on like we were.

I really like her though. I honestly haven't liked someone as much as I like her since I was like 16 and this theory of mine is kinda eating away at me. 

Do you guys think I should just let it be like I plan to? Or is there a way of tactfully and respectfully approaching the fact that I think she might just be too nervous to get involved with me.

(Now that I've written that out I'm thinking more and more that it'd be a terrible idea to project my suspicion that she may have intimacy issues onto her) 
But opinions are still welcome.

259,"I‚Äôll try to keep it short. For reference, he‚Äôs caucasian and i‚Äôm chinese. He came from a family with marriage problems (parents never wedded, siblings divorced a few times) while I grew up with a relatively stable relationship. 

We were randomly talking about weddings in general because his sister invited us to hers at the end of the year. He expressed his views on having traditional western weddings (i.e solemn, vow exchange part then afterparty) and I discussed how chinese weddings often go (i.e chinese door games, then tea ceremony). I said weddings should be a celebration of two families coming together and to have fun, though I see the value of it being a serious ceremony, to which he got quite annoyed because he felt that it should be solemn and serious. I said that‚Äôs alright, bit of both is good as long as we won‚Äôt start my new life together in debt from the ceremony. He then got upset and said ‚Äúoh well, I don‚Äôt even know if we will get married.‚Äù. It kinda stung but I didn‚Äôt read too much into it because he was right, who knows what the future holds. 

Later on, he was talking excitedly about the realisation of how heart shapes are made from two beating hearts and found the symbolism rather meaningful, to which I replied ‚ÄúWow, do you run a tumblr blog haha that was pretty basic‚Äù and followed up with ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs pretty cute and wholesome, though it‚Äôs a bit cringe‚Äù. 

Then, I said ‚Äúimagine the first caveman who thought about the concept of wedding rings, oogabooga shiny rock means i love you‚Äù in reference to my views on wedding bands ‚Äî i think (and have communicated to him before) that while diamond/ wedding rings in general are a nice gesture to symbolise eternal love, it is ultimately our own actions that will symbolise and uphold the vows. The bands are merely a shiny symbol of representing a bond between two people, and that it‚Äôs the reason why gold bands are preferred over diamonds in my culture, because it also has better practicality ( eg resell value). 

He got very upset and said that I was brainwashed by my own culture, and that I think my culture is greater than his own. I‚Äôm not sure how to react to that honestly, because I thought I have properly acknowledged his views and offered my perspective on weddings/marriage in general. 

So, TLDR: boyfriend got upset because of our difference in views of marriage: i like it fun and practical, he prefers it serious and solemn. He also called me brainwashed and thinks i regard my culture higher than his. 

He‚Äôs still rather upset and I‚Äôm not sure what to say or do because I feel like I should stand my ground and call him out for being culturally insensitive to my opinions, but at the same time maybe I‚Äôm the one being insensitive to his views... 

Would love to have a 3rd person POV on this and how to better handle this in the future. Thanks in advance.",19Sep2020,1
260,"i will start off by saying, i know she was here before me so i am not trying to make her feel neglected. 
me and my boyfriend live with his family, there are other dogs in the house. 
when i first moved in, he had a little dog already. 
she used to sleep with him in his bed, which is understandable because my dogs used to lay with me also, but she had horrible fleas, long ass shedding fur, dirty ass paws, dingleberries ewww and he would be weird and let her lick him (like his toes and ears and shit, i find it very fucking weird, no offense) well we compromised and she started sleeping on the floor (with a dog bed of course). i brought my own bed so i do have a say on not wanting the dog on the bed. 
another thing is, i know dogs chew on like everything and anything, but i literally cant even leave shit on the bed for a minute which is really annoying because she shouldnt even be jumping on the damn bed. i cant even leave my shoes or slippers on the floor. if i drop something and dont notice well im shit out of luck cus that little thing shreds it. my dogs chewed on things of course but not literally everything they see and even when they did chew on something i would teach them not to. 
another thing i hate is when she stares at me while im eating, im one of those people yea, my dogs knew not to stare or beg while people are eating and would even go to their room if told. 
he used to give her the food WE were eating, without even asking me, i would go in for a bite and he would be already throwing her a piece, it just ruins my appetite. 
maybe my dogs were just really damn smart, ive had alot of different breeds ranging from small to large, or his dog hasnt been trained or attended to whatsoever. 
she definitely is NOT house trained, everytime i wake up i have to watch where i step in the room because i could be stepping into shit or piss, and he cleans it up every damn day like he likes it ???? i dont know. in my opinion dogs are smart enough to learn, i dont think he made an effort to try to teach this one. even spoiled dogs have the common sense to behave and listen to their owners. 
we cant even go outside for one minute, she immediately starts crying, maybe she has anxiety issues?. she barks at anyone in the household (even when she already knows them). now i wouldnt mind as much and would understand if she was an actual puppy, but this little dog is 3 years old and i think she should know better. that‚Äôs just the tip of the iceberg. he knows i dont like her, and makes jokes about it to his family which i dont care because it‚Äôs true i dont like her, but it‚Äôs weird to throw me under the bus when most people in the house dont like her either. he talks about bringing her along with us when we move into a new place, but i have told him my opinion on that, i dont want her to come with us but i cant control what he does with his own dog and it‚Äôs not in me to tell him to give her away because as much as i dont like her i would feel bad if she went to the pound.

I worked for the first time in My life as a Waiter, had to quit because the managers at The Hotel I worked at didn't care shit about their employees ( Had us working overtime, doing Things that we don't sign for) because they were so cheap to hire more people. Add the fact that I had  problems with a Guy in the Front Desk (I had been asking for a promotion I deserved since I'm one of the few team members that actually can Talk and understand English) and I wasn't feeling comfortable working at that place anymore, I was literally a couple of days away from a Mental Breakdown.

I didn't finish the high school ( My dad went sick and I had to quit school to work and help with the expenses on the bills of the House and the medicine for My Old man) I'm a really hard working Man, been working since I had 15.
I'm 23 now, My dad passed away this year.
I'm taking care of My mom with the help of My brothers, but I'm feeling so empty, Like if all these years working My ass of were for nothing...
I'm having a Bad time finding a new job...
I'm almost out of cash.
The Only way out I can see is Joining the Police Force of My Hometown.
The problem is... My Hometown is one of the most dangerous in M√©xico to work as a Police Officer.
The Pay is really Good and they do help to keep You studying as You work.
But I'm SO scared that something Bad could happen in the process. ( the thing is, My Hometown is now the Center of a War Between cartels fighting over this territory.)
My Plan B is to work delivering food for Uber Eats while I keep studying, but I need to ask for a Loan to take care of a few expanses that I need to cover first, and I have a Bad Experience when it comes to asking for a Loan. ( I asked for one for My brother back in the 2016 and I had to pay it by myself, I gotta Say I Only finish paying that Loan a couple of months ago)

265,"Hello, 

I‚Äôm a 24 year old male and I‚Äôve been working in the construction and service industries since I graduated high school. I finished about 30 credits out of 60 towards my AA and then gave up. Since then I‚Äôve been working more specifically in woodworking and carpentry. I realized that I‚Äôm really unhappy with what I‚Äôm doing with my life. For a long time people have been telling me that I‚Äôm smart and that I should to go to school while I have the opportunity. I‚Äôve decided that I want to pursue becoming a chiropractor, which is actually something I‚Äôve been thinking about for a while. The problem is that I live in California which is way beyond my means in terms of providing for myself. I have a family that is disappointed in me for leaving carpentry but I know that I would always regret not trying. I have a living situation which will allow me to be stable while I go to school but I feel like a failure for not really having my footing at this age. I had hoped I would be so much further by 25 but I can‚Äôt really provide for myself. I can scrape a living in construction but long term it doesn‚Äôt pay as well and I don‚Äôt have a passion for it. I‚Äôm trying to plan out how this whole situation will look. I‚Äôm interested in the medical industry because I like people and I‚Äôm pretty good with my hands. But in the meantime I feel ashamed to tell people I gave up a career path to go back to school at almost 25 years old. It‚Äôs a really hard world out there right now, and most people aren‚Äôt making it. I know that I wasn‚Äôt in the right mindset when I began school (I had undiagnosed ADHD and major depressive disorder with a family history) but I really feel like I can do it now. Am I being a fool for starting this late and becoming a burden? Thank you",19Sep2020,1

267,"Found my mother journals dating back to (the earliest I saw) 1997. I'm contemplating reading them to better understand her. Or burn them.

My mother passed away in 2013. Cancer. A lot of cancer. She worked at a processing plant that made sugar in the Midwest (fuck them). And after they went on strike for their benefits; a shit load of people got cancer and died. I've had a hard time letting go. I have a tote of her clothes I've kept with me everywhere I move. Sometimes I look at her shirts and it being back memories I have with her wearing them. Like, she had this Tasmanian Devil sweater she wore when she would wake up at 5am blasting CCR cleaning our house. Or the raggedy red Gap shirt she wore once when she yelled at me for skipping school to play Call of Duty with a buddy in Germany. She has a grey Gap sweater too that we tried to dye after she watched some morning show about dying clothes to make them more ""modern"". And we butchered it. It was SO fucking ugly. But she wore it proudly. I remember I'd be so embarrassed when she would wear it in public.

Back on topic. I found her journals. I want to read them. But, I also know that there are some things best left private. I want to understand and know what she felt. But, at the same time, I don't want to invade. Would it be wrong if I read them? Should I give them to my aunt (her sister, obviously) who has taken this harder than me? Or just burn them and let what she wanted private remain that way?",19Sep2020,1

276,"So I'm very seriously considering getting my first tattoo, and after a little thinking I figured out I wanted an armband tattoo, cause I just like the aesthetic. Not going to lie, I am an unabashed Twenty √òne Pil√∏ts fan, and their songs mean a lot to me. I went through a pretty difficult time diagnosed depression and self worth, was close to suicide, and their music legit helped me stay in there. I'm thinking about getting an armband filled in with the pattern that represents the song Goner. The pattern consists of what looks like many bird silhouettes in flight. They would be the negative space while the rest of the band is filled in.

I chose Goner just because of how much it connects emotionally with me, and the fact that a big part of my view on life is that we are all goners, so we have to appreciate the beauty in life while we're here.

Honest opinion, is this a good tattoo idea? I definetly like it, which seems the most important, but i definetly want to get some second opinions as well.

277,"Right before the pandemic started, I entered into a roommate agreement in an apartment with the girl I lived with the year before. We‚Äôre both college juniors. 
I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for two years now. We are best friends, and plan on getting married when we graduate. He stayed with us most of last year when he was in a dorm, and now, due to quarantine, has been visiting me frequently from his parents house, staying most days a week. 
Our rent is 1450 a month. I enjoyed having her as a roommate so much, that I told her I‚Äôd have her pay no more than 500 a month (her budget). After all, I‚Äôd have my boyfriend over frequently, and my parents help out a lot, so I thought it was fair. 
She initially thought he would only be over no more than two days a week. So, right before we moved in, he agreed to give her 200 dollars extra a month out of his own pocket, just to stay up to 5 days a week. 
Honestly, as we‚Äôve been working through this quarantine, we‚Äôve just loved spending time together. His parents live 30 minutes away, so he would stay with them for two days a week, just to give her space. Honestly, I‚Äôm starting to find the whole commuting thing silly, I mean, why stop the fun if we don‚Äôt have to? 
My roommate recently told me that we either need to document the date and times he‚Äôs gone, or he needs to be added on as a 3rd roommate. 
His parents pay for his school, and don‚Äôt want to give extra money if it‚Äôs not for a dorm. He works, but the majority of the paycheck goes to her. 
I feel like this is a situation headed for a bad road. I know I came into an agreement with her. but I also feel like it‚Äôs pointless for him to keep driving back and forth. If things were normal, he and I would be gone more frequently, him likely being in a dorm. I don‚Äôt like feeling like I‚Äôm put in the middle of them. I get where she‚Äôs coming from, but I don‚Äôt want to kick him out if I don‚Äôt have to. 
I feel like my options are to either find a sublease, though I doubt I could find one that would agree to pay more, or continue to kick my boyfriend out and deal with a shitty situation. Ideally, I would just like my own apartment where he can come and go as he pleases. 
Any advice? I want to be fair to all parties involved.",19Sep2020,1

So I need some advice regarding my sibling. I (17F) have a sister (15F), who we will call Alicia for the sake of this post. Throughout our childhood, I have always done pretty well in school, and I‚Äôve had a lot of academic accomplishments. Alicia has also done well academically, but not as much as I have. She gets really good grades for the most part, and takes some hard classes. However, she does online school (long story) and I go to a Magnet school (but not rn cause of COVID), and my school is geared towards advanced classes and programs.  In the past few months, Alicia has mentioned how she thinks that I‚Äôm the favorite, that I make her look like a devil child, or that I‚Äôm better than she is. She is in no way a devil child (although she can have a bit of an attitude) and she is in no way less than me. My parents always tell her that they are proud of her, so I don‚Äôt know why she thinks this. It makes me sad cause I don‚Äôt want her to think that she‚Äôs less compared to me, because she‚Äôs not. She‚Äôs super smart, funny, and a really generous person. Everytime i try and tell her that shes not a devil child or less than me, she just goes ‚Äúno it‚Äôs true.‚Äù I don‚Äôt really know what to say to make her change her mind, because I feel like she won‚Äôt believe me. I‚Äôve seen cases of siblings where one of them always felt in the shadow of the other, and I really don‚Äôt want that to become us.

283,"Final exams are coming in a little more than a week and I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about her, even if she became my motivation to study to get into a good class with her. She‚Äôs just too perfect, really short, cute voice and looks. She‚Äôs also really kind and smart, acing every exams. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs way out of my league,‚Äù I told myself, but I‚Äôm still falling for her even when I knew I have no chance. She kept glancing back in class to my direction, although I know she‚Äôs only staring at her friends behind me. She kept helping me, although I knew she always help everyone near her. Those little actions kept making me like her even more, despite my constant reminders to myself that she doesn‚Äôt like me and that we‚Äôve talked like only 10 short conversations during this 2 years (Yes, this is completely one-sided)                                                    
                                                                                 
Since 2 years ago, I‚Äôve always liked her internally, only lying to myself I don‚Äôt and kept ignoring her, killing every conversation she started with me. I‚Äôve even tried falling in love with another female classmate to feed myself with even more lies, but that didn‚Äôt last long. I‚Äôve tried tricking myself into genuinely hating her, but that didn‚Äôt last long too. Her presence in during class always prevented me from falling out of love with her. I just can‚Äôt stop liking her. Even fate stops me from doing so. Every time I was about to stop liking her, there‚Äôs always a randomly assigned group work that brought us together into the same group (eg. camp, group project, some showcasing) It‚Äôs like a convergence, no matter what happens, she ends up in my group most of the time. I can‚Äôt distance myself from her, I can‚Äôt ignore her, I just distract myself from her, I just can‚Äôt. I hate falling in love, it only brings you pain and wastes your time.

284,"This is my first post on reddit, I really don't know how to start this off. I've been basically becoming more isolated as the days go by. I went through a rocky childhood and never really made any friends. After something happened I ended up coming to my grandma's place. I started 10th grade with them and met a couple of friends along the way. In that group I've met a girl who I was interested in, long story short I really liked this girl and at first things were okay but she really just never reciprocated any affection i was throwing at her and just decided to dump me when I went on a bit of a shutdown cause I felt like no one loved me.

After the break up I was devastated, I really felt worthless and easily disposable. I really hated myself. Now things get a bit complicated and maybe in the realm of where you might not believe me. I started university and I've met with my ex - girlfriends ex (Female). I never really had any friends to begin with in uni and I was just focusing on my classes. One day she invited me to her group.

There I meet a lot of cool people and start socializing more. Nothing really happens until a couple months in when my ex's ex let's just call her C told me a group from the girl liked me. I was kind off excited cause I just wanted to move on from the past relationship. She tells me who it was but the says ""which is really a shame cause I really liked you too"". That shit kind off shocked me. At first I took at as a joke but the more time we spent together talking I grew more attached.

My dad had MS so was in a wheelchair for most of my life. I would see him every other weekend.
He had an amazingly dark sense of humor and as I've grown up (m/ june 1984, I cant remember how old I am) I've understood more and more why he was who he was.

The issue I have is that as I grew up, I had/made less and less time for him. The last time I saw him, his ms had become terrible and he was almost unable to speak, this broke my heart and I never saw him again.
He died from Bronchopneumonia on the 11th of Sep 2010. 
I've accepted that the guilt I feel for not making more effort to spend time with him will never leave me.
I know he wouldn't want me to feel like this but how do you move on from this kind of trauma?

I joke about being half orphan because I've inherited  his sense if humour, but inside I hurt a little just hearing about other peoples parents.
How do you cope with not being able to apologise to someone whose already gone?

TL;DR
My dad died and I feel bad about being a shitty son.",19Sep2020,1
291,"I have this one friend that used to have a crush back on me in freshman year in high school, currently a senior. Lets call her Shelby (not her real name FYI). I've been friends with Shelby since freshman year and I used to talk to someone last year who was friends with Shelbys new boyfriend. That old friend, also F, had stopped being friends with Shelby's current boyfriend, let's call him Randy (not his real name). Had an old friend who was friends with Randy, and Randy was wanting to date my old friend but she stopped talking to him after realizing he was a narcassist and acts like a drunk abusive dad when he drinks (so I'm told by multiple people), and now Randy dates Shelby. Shelby has even said that he gets easily pissed off when he's drunk. He used to be an alcholic, keep in mind, used to means at least last year or earlier, Randy is a junior right now. The fact he is being labeled by multiple people I know and trust as an alcoholic as a junior says a lot imo.  
I doubt their relationship will last that long but I want to let her know that I have been told by friends in previous years that he is narcissistic and a drunk. But I don't wanna come across like I'm trying to but into her relationship and breakthem up, but I also don't wanna see a good friend of mine get heartbroken or be in a toxic relationship.   
Her old relationship she even admits was toxic and was trying to figure out how to breakup with him for 2 months and they had been together for roughly a year if not more.   
Can someone help me think of a way to help her know of these things I know and not come across like I am trying to get in between her and Randy?",19Sep2020,1

What can I do? It‚Äôs killing me that I‚Äôm just 5 months too young to vote. I don‚Äôt know many Americans here that I can message and encourage to vote, but I will try as much as I can.

But the absolute fucking worst part is I CAN‚ÄôT vote. I‚Äôve done more research than a lot of people I know, and I can‚Äôt do anything with it. My dad is so apathetic and refuses to vote. DON‚ÄôT THROW AWAY YOUR VOTE. YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO VOTE. Vote for me ahaha!

293,"My ex(female) and i(male) were together for over a year and she broke up with me a few weeks ago because she said she's lesbian now. 

When we first got together she claimed to be bi and more attracted to men though. I talked to her a few days after the break up to make sure she was positive in her decision because I feel like she could be wrong based on our sex life we had.

Details: she would squirt and orgasm from penatrative sex and some of my female friends I've talked to have said that, that's hard to get a girl to do. She would start sexual intercourse with me so I figure she found me sexually attractive.

 I am now depressed but not as bad as I was earlier. I just need some other peoples point of view do to me being straight and not very knowledged on bi or gay thoughts.",19Sep2020,1

Mainly harsh consequences for disobeying them, which is why I dont want to risk getting snap and hiding it from them (they go through my phone sometimes). I've been wanting to get it for a few months now, and I've been asking consistently the past couple weeks but they wont budge on their decision. My mom seems ok with it, but my dad hates the idea of messages/photos deleting. And since he wont allow it, my mom wont either. His ideology that theres no accountability for what anyone sends and it can be ugly. I understand that, but I wish I could just make my own decisions and be more independent. Im mature and a good kid, I do everything they ask of me unless I deem it completely unreasonable. I want to convince them to let me get it and I know im responsible enough to have it, but now everytime my ask my parents just get annoyed and I get the answer. Is there some way/something I might be able to do to convince them? Any advice helps, Im also willing to answer any questions. Thanks.",19Sep2020,1

300,"This is my first time reaching out on something like this, I actually just recently downloaded reddit and I guess I just want to tell someone that's unbiased and I dunno maybe get some good advice. Long story short I've lost all my friends except one because of actions I've done.  It's a long story and I'm sure a lot of you will skip to the Tl;DR part, but if you want to know the details here they are.  

I was going steady with a girl and we started having issues, I started catching feelings for a friend of mine that I've known for years and usually met up and hung out once a week for a D&amp;D game.  The D&amp;D was great and I loved everyone that was in it and they were like my family I enjoyed RPing and I enjoyed the drinking and hanging out and partying we did when we weren't rolling dice. The girl and I broke up and eventually the DM and I got closer and closer and eventually things lead to things and well we were hooking up and stuff it was nice and I guess I put too much stock into it, my mind told me I'd be happy here that it will help my depression but it didn't I felt horrible and like shit constantly.  Eventually it came to a time where me and my ex were supposed to go somewhere together because of a plan we previously made and I know I couldve said no but something in me just wanted to experience a new place and run away, and I won't lie I still cared and loved my ex deeply. And well we wound up fucking on the trip, I lied to the DM and eventually it became a regular thing where I had sex with both of them without their knowledge about the other. At times it was hard to keep them separate and I became a terrible manipulative asshole lying and hurting them trying to sow seeds of doubt and everything inbetween.  Needless to say they found out and it was a huge thing, everyone rightfully abandoned me and I wasn't allowed to go to D&amp;D anymore and all my previous friends that were my family don't talk too me.  I don't blame them, honestly I don't.  Even my roommate seems to dislike me sometimes, I know they say the opposite but I feel that's only because we are living together, I can feel it.  I feel really alone and that no one wants to talk or hang out or do anything with me, I feel like I've become a burden even to the people that weren't involved I think about them daily and how I hurt them and I hate myself for that.  My ex said it was a self fulfilling prophecy of self destruction ""you thought you were a bad guy so you turned yourself into a bad guy.""  I just don't know how to make friends I'm not severely antisocial or uncharismatic but anytime I think about going out or reaching out I shut myself down telling myself I don't deserve it and yes I know thats the depression talking but it's right.  I know I should seek a therapist but I don't have the money for that.  I can't sleep anymore and I've been over and under eating constantly, nothing feels fun anymore and no one wants anything to do with me. Thank you for reading this I guess sorry it's kind of incoherent rambling I just needed it out of my system. 

TL;DR:  I betrayed two girls I was extremely close with, and lost all my friends.  I've had depression before this and this has made it worse and I honestly don't know why I'm even saying anything on this on the advice board. I guess I'm looking for advice to cope or something. I just don't know what to do.",19Sep2020,1
301,"My older sister has some issues when it comes to admitting that she has done something wrong. She is straight up trying to lie her way out of it, but her excuses become so stupid that it is laughable. One time she rolled her eyes while fighting with my mother. My mother got mad. My sister then said she did it because she thought of something annoying in her past. My mother didn't believe it. My sister then said she did it because she has a headache. Sure. She also has this when she is wrong about something.

My mother on the other end is highly manipulative. She admitted to manipulating me and then wanted to make me believe that it was just a joke. I didn't believe her. She then started crying telling me that I will regret it once she is dead. I told her she is still in the wrong. Then she told me she feels like she is having a heart attack because of me. I still told her she is wrong. Those conversations then lasted for 1 month until I finally told her it's ok and she did nothing wrong by manipulating me for years. (Funny enough she admitting to manipulating me by guilt tripping)

Now my mother has found a new strategy. She still isn't over it because she doesn't want this ""misunderstanding"" (as she calls it) to be her fault alone. So since that happened she is constantly claiming that it's really to understand what I'm talking about and that I often not make sense to other people and that I also seem to have trouble to understand what other people really mean.

Well and now you can combine those two issues. Whenever my sister claims something wrong and I correct her she starts lying about it. My mother then supports my sisters lie just so I feel like I'm wrong. One example from today:

Sister:""... Trudeau and Merkel really..""

Me:""Trudeau?""

Sister:""The president of France.""

Me:""Trudeau is the prime minister of Canada, Macron is the president of France.""

Sister:""I said that it was Macron!""

Me:""No you didn't, but it's alright.""

Mother:""No she said that it's Macron. See you aren't just misunderstanding me, you also have trouble understanding other people.""

Like what am I supposed to do against that?",19Sep2020,2
302,"For the sake of making the lives of people reading this much easier I'll try and make this short and sweet.

So, plain and simple. I am 19M, she is 19F, we did the whole, fall deeply for one another, text every day all day, multiple video calls a week for hours, lockdown love routine. Groovy.

Then one night she breaks things off. I was not happy about this. The way she did it, felt to me, very, very callous and cruel. However I knew from what she had told me, that she had had ex's before manipulate her with calls and texts saying they'd kill themselves if she left. So I never pressured her to stay in my life in that way. But I knew I couldn't deal with just being friends with her as I would always want back what we had, and honestly, because I still loved her deeply and still do.

I decided I would cut things off completely for both of our sakes when she tells me that she doesn't know what she'd do without me in her life. So ok fine cool, I tried to put my romantic feelings for her aside and just be a friend. I'm sure many of you can imagine how that went.

For context the reason she felt this way was by this point she saw me as her closest confidant and the only person she thought still cared about, and would listen to, her mental health stuff when she was struggling.

Over the next tweleve days, she became very distant, which was an reoccurring thing in our relationship. It meant she was dealing with stuff. OK cool, time to be charming and suave and make her feel good, something I had a near 100 percent success rate with at the time and had to do often. Nope. Turns out due to the change in our relationship she no longer felt able to talk to me. Great.

At this point I fully admit and take blame for the fact I got progressively more frustrated and any time I messaged her she was down, but refused to talk about heavy stuff, or day to day stuff. I started to become angry tbh, and felt helpless as my own mental health was seriously deteriorating trying to spend all my energy on this girl who just two weeks ago had told me she loved me, would never leave me, and that I was her favourite person in the world and I was relapsing really badly back into depression. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm making excuses, or being self pitying, but I would legitimately say this was the hardest period of my entire life, trying to spend every day not screaming about how much I wanted her back, or that I still loved her, or blocking her for my own health.

I steadily became a needy, clingy, endlessly apologetic, overemotional, out of control, cringe machine. I was crying every day and felt like I wasn't in control of myself. I knew this would happen but was too selfish to just bite the bullet and cut things off completely, which is what I knew from the minute she ended the relationship, I should have done to avoid more upset for both of us. 

Eventually she had enough of not being able to speak to me, or relate to me anymore, and how needy I had become (understandably tbph) and blocked me on everything, and left me her number in case I needed her, telling me only to contact her in an emergency. The last time we spoke was the 11th June.

So Reddit, the advice I'm asking is, should I message her to apologise for all the upset and pain I caused her by not just cutting her off when I knew I should've, or do I just let her be and never message her again? 

And btw, if y'all think I'd be doing it to relieve myself of the guilt, I like to think you'd be wrong, but I'm no psychologist. My intentions are honestly to make her feel better about what went down a few months ago, and assuage any potential guilt she is still carrying about how things went. And sorry the post *was* so long in the end.",19Sep2020,1
303,"Tired of people making me feel guilty

Let me preface this by saying I‚Äôm 23 M no kids completely single. 

I work full time and I live alone and pay my own bills. I like to spend money. I like nice things and I have no qualms about treating myself when I see something I like, whether it‚Äôs new watch or an expensive new pistol or some clothes or whatever, but here lately it seems like when I spend money on myself and people around me find out they try to make me feel guilty. 

They go on and on about how it was a dumb purchase or I could‚Äôve used the money to pay bills or I should have put in the bank. 

I recently took leave work from but I‚Äôm still paid my regular salary and when people found out I was off work they were almost insulted that I was still spending money even though I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have a job‚Äù. I gently reminded them that a paid leave of absence is not unemployed. 

I‚Äôm actually saving up to buy a house, however I recently mentioned to a friend I would like a new car as my current one is 4 years old with nearly 100k miles. The conversation turned into this whole thing about how I‚Äôm lazy for taking a leave of absence and it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm on welfare and that I don‚Äôt deserve a new car because I won‚Äôt be working it.

Im 21 and a student, living in a house with other students. We all enjoy drinking and it happens fairly regularly,  maybe once or twice a week. 

The last year or so my anxiety the day after drinking has been unbareable. I go over every little thing I did that night,  worry about the money I've spent, worry about what others think of me. My heart races all day, sometimes even for two days after. The anxiety is absolutely crippling and to a level I don't experience without alcohol. 

I have thought for a while about not drinking, but honestly it feels impossible in this environment.  and also, I enjoy it in the moment. Im sick of writing whole days off and ruining my mental health for the sake of a good night, but don't seem to have the willpower to stop.

313,"Hi all,  
unsure if this is the right place to post, not sure where else to ask this question.  
I need advice of how to approach my neighbors regarding their public use of nitrous oxide, aka whippets, NOS, laughing gas... etc. When I say public use, what I mean is... their porch where they inflate balloons and inhale is directly next to my families living space where my children play and live. We can see them doing it and the sound of balloons inflating is loud and persistent (they use a large canister). 

I personally dont have a problem with people inhaling laughing gas or people doing what they want to do in their own space. I am aware that it is somewhat legal, and as far as drugs go... not really that problematic from a societal perspective. The issue I have with their use is the frequency and fact that my family and kids are surrounded by it, visually and audibly all day long. 

Their use has increased exponentially over the past 3 months from it just being every now and then to being all day... every day (not an exaggeration). Their parties have been going later into the night with more people than ever before, with the sound of whippets being inflated into balloons every 5 minutes. This on many occasions has resulted in restless nights with my kids and wife waking up tired and agitated. Furthermore, I worry that my children are being passively exposed to drug use from such a young age.

I would like some suggestions of what to do... how I raise these issues with them or some advice of what might be the right course of action. I dont want to go to the cops and complain as I dont really want to bring the cops into our street.

316," I want some advice with my friend. I (15F) seem to have upset him (17M), but I'm not sure what to do. We'll call him Alex, and here's some background info.
*mentions sexual assault.
 I talked to Alex after I broke up with my ex, asking for his help. I had been in a sexually and emotionally abusive relationship with my ex, and I told Alex. His first reaction was to sigh and rub his head, then ask if I said ""Yes."" I confessed I did, but it was because I was coerced. He told me I shouldn't have done that, and he looked up laws online. He told me I could sue my ex, and that he was willing to ""testify as a witness."" I was disheartened because he seemed excited by the idea of taking this to court.
 Well, long story short, my ex was let go (I reported it to my counselor) and just had to go to therapy. Fun. Anyway, a couple days after that, Alex told me, ""I usually hate people our age who have sex, but you're an exception."" I got pissed at this and ignored him for the day. It implied that what happened between my ex and I was consensual, when it was not.
He ended up joining a sexual assault awareness group, shared projects with me (some of which I disagreed with because their messages were horrible), constantly brought up sex jokes and my ex, and just did a lot. He ended up triggering my trauma so many fucking times, and I didn't know how to cope. I thought I was selfish for feeling uncomfortable by what he was doing.
 Anyway, I talked to him about this all, and he apologized, saying he was insensitive and immature. Same thing my ex said, LOL. He used my trauma as a reason to end his masturbation addiction (to me, it seemed like he was just a horny teenager?), went on a confession page to explain why, calling my experience ""harassment"" (it's a huge fucking understatement.)
 He's also the type to mainly talk about himself during a conversation, only asking how your day was to talk about his. He's been ignoring some things I say now, and seems to be getting annoyed because of me. We talked about frogs yesterday, and then he said,
 ""Also, wish [classmate] a happy birthday since she's in your class üò∂""
 By the time I read it, I was overwhelmed with school and stress from home. I also freaked out because I didn't want to, but didn't know how to say it (I struggle with anxiety). I ended up just blabbing about how I felt:
 ""I'm not that close to her, and tbh it'd be awkward. It'd kind of like be weird too? I don't think she's ever told me her birthday before, and I don't want to invade her privacy. Also I suck at social interaction :D""
 Well, he left me on read and hasn't talked to me since. I want to apologize to him, but I don't know why. I tried to be honest about how I felt with him for once, and then blam. Right in my face, I fucked up.
 I'm just really fed up with him--he's been EXTREMELY inconsiderate about my trauma, and now he's being really self-absorbed. He's a nice friend and all, but I don't know. Should I make amends? Cut ties?",19Sep2020,1

i push things to the back of my mind and function in everyday life until something pushes me over the edge. and today that happened; sadly i‚Äôve let something as simple as a university assignment get to me. 

i guess i‚Äôll sum up how i‚Äôve feel, and that‚Äôs that i‚Äôve never been happy with myself. i feel overwhelmed by the issues i see in myself and blame myself for not solving them. i‚Äôm fixated on becoming a better person and am constantly frustrated because i feel like i let days go by without any progress. how do i solve those deep rooted issues without knowing the cause? how do i push myself far enough to make progress without setting myself into an anxiety induced spiral like last time.

*trigger warning for ED*
in some ways i‚Äôve made progress especially during this lockdown and was finally able to gain weight. i was so proud. however it my motivation soon slipped away and for once i was faced with something i had denied for many years by just saying i was skinny. for once i came face to face with my intentionally poor eating habits, something i believe stems from a craving for control over anything else. this is something i‚Äôve never mentioned to anyone dealing with this has become a large part of my life recently, and also a priority for me. 

onto the other focus of my life, university which had been moved online. as a while i feel overwhelmed and like i can‚Äôt catch a break from the workload. i have no life outside university and i can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs like to enjoy life. academic success has always been a priority for me up until now, in school i achieved well, my parents expect me to do well and my friends were the highest achievers at school. i‚Äôve always faced the pressure of doing well and always envied those that are able to put aside academic work for the things that are more important in life. i feel consumed with university work and my job and i really wrestle with the guilt of not being productive all the time.

this is the dilemma i‚Äôm facing now, one of my classes at university has an assignment due at the end of this week worth 10% of my final grade. i have never been more confused with an assignment and have spent the whole day reaching out to anyone i could in the class for help, which is very difficult because i don‚Äôt know anyone personally especially since it‚Äôs online. the lecturer is very unsympathetic which doesn‚Äôt help.

i‚Äôm so used to letting academics control me and control my emotion. im not on great terms with my friends at the moment, and honestly i know they wouldn‚Äôt understand where i‚Äôm coming from when i want to sacrifice something in my academic life for  something more important.

i just need someone to tell me that this assignment means nothing in the bigger picture, that i‚Äôm not ruining my life if i do bad. i feel like all you hear now is that the job market is competitive and you need to do well or you won‚Äôt be successful in life. i feel so lost, i have no physical aspirations like a certain job,  all i want is to be happy.

i stuff all these problems in the back of my head to deal with another day. i‚Äôm very good at pretending i‚Äôm okay until i have to face the thing that scares me.

i need someone to tell me it‚Äôs okay to admit even to yourself that you‚Äôre not okay,

i need someone to tell me that putting myself first is not selfish.

 i need someone to tell me that if i fail this assignment, my life will be no different",19Sep2020,1
320,I'm interested in this girl who has been sexually abused by multiple men in her early teenage years. She was lured to hangout with these creeps with material things. I hate the fact she did this more than once and honestly I can't comprehend why she kept doing it besides the fact she might of liked it. I feel really bad because obviously i wasn't there and I can never truly know if that's how it happened.

I know being gay isn't a choice and same goes with being transgender and that's exactly why I'm confused
It felt like  God wasn't  speaking and never was and it just written by homophones.

324," I have a 2 year long relationship with a person I deeply love, but I assure you the path hasn't been soft. My boyfriend was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder many years ago, much prior to our relationship, when I meet him he was in a very unstable phase, deeply depressed and didn't know how to handle a commitment. Regarding his personal life, he couldn't have a job, there was weeks where he barely leaf his room, he didn't sleep or ate for days in a row because he was heavily anxious and paranoid, passing out episodes were not that rare. With time, the right treatment/therapy and a good support base that he was having from me, he was able to get his life back.

Nowadays he has a full time job, a good sleeping/eating schedule, he's much better regarding our relationship in all aspects as well, same for social life, and he's doing well financially too... basically, everything as made a turn for the better. Now, thing is, he has a quite stressful job, with a good amount of responsibility. He's fighting to have a better position and earn more, but that's just stressing him a lot. He has been working more extra hours, and talks about how stressful it feels all week long, he feels tired almost everyday. Recently he commented with me that sometimes he felt withdraw effects from his medication, as if he didn't took it, but then when he checked he confirmed that he actually took it and the symptoms would eventually go away. Usually that happened when he noticed he had done a mistake on work, so, he believed it was purely just anxiety. I believe that, but, I'm concerned about it. Stress is one of the main factors for a psychotic break, for a mental break in general, and he's already showing symptomatic signs that he's not feeling that well.

I've spoken my concerns to him, I've told him that he didn't need to put his health at risk for a promotion, or to prove something to anyone, but I know he just wants to prove it to himself. I don't know how to make him rethink his approach, I don't want him to think that I don't believe in him and in his potential, because I obviously do. I just don't think it's worth to risk another relapse when he has done so much already. 2 years ago he was suicidal, if his path towards now wasn't successful Idk what it is. We all need time to breath and stop sometimes, with or without mental issues. Obviously, on his case, taking in account his health issues, I'm specially worried. I love him a lot, maybe I'm also worrying too much, but I'd like to find a way to help him see that he's enough, every single day, not just a productive day but I don't know how I can do it or if I should do it. In the end, it's up to his decision.

TL;DR: My partner, diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, has done a great journey towards a stable life, but right now is feeling stressful towards work but doesn't want to slow down. How can I advise  him to put his health first without making him feel like I don't value his potential or don't see him as capable?",19Sep2020,1

329,"I tried to post this on r/teenagers but it said my karma was too low so I'm posting it here.

My two friends both take GCSE Geography and are doing some hiking thing but I don't take Geography so I can't go. They go on a Thursday and aren't in school on a Friday, then they do the same again the Thursday and Friday of the next week. 

I had a falling out with 3 of my friends and we don't talk anymore. It's not really something we can all just brush over and it's also kinda wet to apologise and then immediately start hanging out again. This left me with only 2 friends now. The other 3 are the type of people to point and laugh at someone who's alone and I'm absolutely dreading it coz theyre gonna laugh at me. It's not that I don't talk to anyone else, it's just that everyone has these tight knit friendship groups and it'd be so awkward to just insert myself in there for a couple of days. There's another group of friends I have but they're also going which sucks too. I'm in yr11 so it's not a case of ""make new friends"" because everyone's already figured out who they're friends with and stuff. It's just not realistic at all.

Any advice on how to not look like a loser for 4 days? 

My school does not allow phones so I can't hide behind that. 

Also I'm not really allowed inside the building during break times (Covid restrictions)

We're not allowed out of school for break/lunch. It's literally my whole year group out in the playground and there's nowhere to hideeeeeeee

I'm aware that nobody's gonna remember in like 2 weeks maximum but it's really just about actually getting through the days which I'm worried about. Thursday and Friday are already my worst days because I'm alone in EVERY LESSON which is also bad fml.

330,"Please, don‚Äôt judge my girlfriend for this. 

I (17) and my girlfriend (17) had an argument this morning. Around 6 months ago, she went round a friends house and semi-cheated on me with him

Last week, she was invited around again ( both times are a gathering of maybe 3-4 people, drinking heavily ) and I finally had the courage today to tell her that I don‚Äôt want her to go. Her parents are going through a nasty divorce, with the council and police being involved ( her dad isn‚Äôt very nice ). I understand why she wants to go out and get drunk; she just wants an escape. She‚Äôs promised me she‚Äôll be aware, and won‚Äôt drink as much this time, but just doesn‚Äôt sit right. 
Anyway, after a few hours of shouting, she came to the conclusion that I was controlling her, and her actions, and that I‚Äôm a dickhead. She‚Äôs got a lot of mental trauma from the situation ( she was kissing him in the front room however the guy took advantage of her and fucked her, in his bedroom. Neither can remember if that part was consensual, so it may have been her cheating instead of the guy taking advantage. I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm just going off what I do know ). I just want whats best for us, and her. If anything was to happen again, I couldn‚Äôt stay in the relationship. I‚Äôve given her time, but I hate of her to think that I‚Äôm being controlling. I‚Äôd do cancel me plans if I was going to do something that would make her uncomfortable! My intentions aren‚Äôt malicious, I just want to keep her safe. I don‚Äôt have an issue with her getting drunk, I just would like her to do it in a safe environment, with people she can trust drunk ( she told me she didn‚Äôt trust the environment, or the person who allegedly took advantage of her ). 
Your brain does some crazy things when you‚Äôre in need of an escape from reality, but I don‚Äôt think she made the right choice. 

She‚Äôs not obviously not going now, but I still can‚Äôt help but feeling like an arse for wanting to protect her. 

Yeah, I‚Äôm just looking for an outside view of it. Not all details are included, of course. However, please don‚Äôt judge my girlfriend too harshly, she was in a rough situation the first time, and an even rougher one now

331,"I've been noticing lately that I tend to get knots in my stomach whenever I make a mistake. Whether it's saying the wrong thing to someone, or not doing something correctly or even the way in which I deal with people, whenever I realise that I'm at fault, I get this horrible gut churning feeling, and I start to hate who I am in that moment. I can't see past my mistake and it overwhelms me very quickly. I start breathing heavy and my pulse increases, and I don't know how to shift my focus away from my mistake, despite deciding to learn from it.

332,"My parents enrolled me \[16M, India\] into a college counselling service last year. They're really selective and have counselled numerous students who got into t10s, needless to say, they charge an enormous fee. My parents are not as affluent as some of the others in the service, but they've supported me throughout the application process. My father has got our house reconstructed in order to sell some of it to fund my education.  


My performance and productivity this past year has been abysmal.  
After weeks of procrastination, I found myself in a situation where I had no option but to lie to everyone about the completion of my internships and my projects. I applied for the student council in my school - got rejected, applied to various clubs - rejected from all of them.   


My school counsellor had sent us an email regarding our transcripts and essays, I have procrastinated to the extent that I will now not be able to apply  EA-ED and to some UK universities as well.  


I cannot waste my parent's money by going to a school outside the t20s, but I do not come across as a serious contender for the t20s either. I cannot apply to colleges in India, I have devoted far too much time and have already crossed the point of no return.  


I will never be able to muster up the courage to tell my parents or my counsellors about it.

334,"7 years into the relationship was great, he is 2 years older than me, so he graduated first and got a job before me. But when I graduated I was excited to get a job, but he was against it, he did not want me to get a job, he said that it will make us fall out of love! the different time schedules to which I said I can match your schedule since we will be both working a corporate job. To which he said that he just wants me to be home when he gets home I ended up agreeing. from the beginning of our relationship, I have wanted a family. I told him we should talk about it before things progress to which he said we will talk about it when that time comes. at some point I found my self becoming indifferent about kids,  I am asexual (we don't feel sexual attraction) I am in the spectrum of I enjoy sex but is not capable of sexually initiating. So he introduces me to some drugs for inhibition, sex was great.  We moved to a new city and it was great, but he quit his job a year into it so we had to move back to the home town, it was horrible our living space was almost squatter like. I realize that it's such a sad place to be in. then he got another job so we move into an apartment. This sucks because we had talked about getting a house and we even look up houses but 3 days after looking up houses he messages me telling me he just sign a lease to an apartment I voiced it out to him and he told me that he is the one working. so I did not press anymore. I fell into a deep depression but I was fighting it every day! I told him I am depressed to which he replied that I am at home all day I am not doing anything how can I be depressed!!!?. I barely want to do anything, but I tried when I do I cook and clean, and when he gets home he demands that my time is only dedicated to him. He always makes me feel bad if I do something else, ""This is the only free time I get you should spend it with me"" why can't you do that when I'm not home?"" ""I tried to understand this he has a point"" we had a falling out he ask me to pack up so he can drive me home to my mom, while he figures out if he wants to remain marrier or be single. since I loved him deeply I retaliate it was so hard to be in the end where you are waiting.  it was one hell of a ride that moment. it lasted for a month but we were trying to hold on to each other, then he told me he confess to our friend's girlfriend who is underage while we are trying to work things out. Then he wrote me a letter telling me how much he loves me and I am his soul mate and so on and so forth ""I tried to see it in his pint of view "" I am indeed in a depressive state and need to be better"". I fell for it. I forgave him then as he is about to move to a new city he told me to wait for him again till he figures out if he wants to be married or be single. a month pass he called and told me he wants me back, so I followed him there. 1 whole year pass it was alright, was not able to fully heal from what he did because he would tell me it's only emotional cheating some people do the worst things. I was never able to fully feel that he owned up to what he did"". ""See what he complains about is SEX which doesn't make any sense because I am fine with sex it is the fact that I can't sexually initiate is what is missing in his life, not the sex"", and in a Sense can understand that, that is why I research how can a sexual person have a successful marriage with an asexual. I suggested for me to act it out, role-play everything I can think off, he shoots it down saying that's not genuine enough, and that he doesn't want to force me. Anyways the beginning of this year after my dad died he did the same thing again, as my mom and brother are visiting he suggested that I ride back to my mom and brother so he can think if he wants to be single or married.  at this point, I was just done with this roller coated shit show I did talk to him but I did agree, then the day be4 we leave he cried in front of my mom saying he can't lose me he will die, and so forth"" again I was heartbroken that this man I meet is this broken"". So I ended up staying, one week upon staying he asked me for a divorce because he wants to marry one of my nieces. I agree with the divorce. He actually had the audacity to asked me to give good words of him if the said niece agrees to get with him. to which I reply NO. Ohh all hell breaks loose, he called me selfish for not wanting a better life for my niece, he called me prideful because I refuse to help him out with my niece who just turns 18 y/o. he is currently 35. as we divorce (this is that thing where I don't understand WTF he was thinking), he also promises me to drive me back home. I really did not want him to but he said it's for ""his closure"" upon arriving at my mom's he cried and so my mom even knowing everything told me to help him fight his demon. To which I agree. we have a little talk both agree to try to work things out AGAIN.  He bought a plane ticket to get home the same day of dropping me off my mom's. The same night he called my friend who I happen to be talking to telling her the update of what happened. As he messages her ""she said OMG he is messaging in an almost annoyed voice"" she sent me all the screenshot of their conversation. It was bad, he made me look and sound like a useless leach. NO sex doesn't cook, doesn't clean which are all false. I have pictures of all the food I cook and clean because I'm proud of it ""THEN HE TOLD HER, I CAN FEEL IT I WANT YOU"". So  I ended it with him I told him not to talk to me. But he messages my friend in the middle of the night telling him everything. and my friend in turn messaging me begging me to talk to him because he sounds like he will kill himself. He has used that quite a lot he has told me that if he lost me that his life would feel meaningless. So In the end I ended up talking to him he asks for another change told me he took me for granted all these pretty words I said sure, I should have known as 2 1/2 of rekindling our connection far from each other he started saying things that made me feel like I had to visit him how lonely he is how sad he is and so on. so I ask do you want me to visit he excited me say yes. That day came flew to get his place. Stayed for 2 weeks it was meh we stayed home the whole time except when we are picking up the food we watch movies and sleep that was it, I asked him to go somewhere but he never has the energy for it. .. 2 days be4 a am about to go back to my mom's place ""HERE WE GO AGAIN"" he doesn't know if he wants to be single or married. at this point, all the beaten up bridge have snapped into 4 pieces ""I knew I was done"" I knew I can't take any more of this torture, I can't give him another chance because I have to look my way at some point and notice my suffering instead of just focusing on his struggle"" I have to Take Care of my self, I have tried to understand his mistake so many time. I have tried to sympathize ""thinking that maybe my asexuality drove him this mad""  But NO not anymore I realize I did try to research how a sexual persona and an asexual person can have a healthy relationship especially since I am not one of the extremes I am capable of enjoying sex for the with the right person ""some asexual are repulsed by sex.  He never once tried to look up what asexual is he never showed me that he wanted to know me at the deepest level.He and I have so much in common out compatibility is insane but the hell I went through with him these past 3 years is hell and would not think of going back.

I asked her if they had some part time job available since I‚Äôd much rather work a few days a week combined with studying but on their website it says they are ONLY looking for full time day workers, 8am-5pm and it doesnt fit right with me.

She replied very quickly saying how she‚Äôs happy to hear that I reached out and that I enjoyed working there (which I stated in my email). 
And that they‚Äôre unfortunately not looking for part time workers in the near future. 

However she said that they will be looking to extend their Night shift workforce in the coming weeks, the same job I had before, except 2 hours less a day (5pm-10pm). 
She then continued the email asking me about how my studies are going now and for how long I will continue studying. And ended by saying ‚ÄùHear from you soon!‚Äù

if you tell a person that you **HAD** a crush on them, typically would you say it knowing that you **STILL** have a crush on them (even if it's not as strong) and are saying it with a slight hope that the revelation will lead to something?

340,"# TLDR; I got molested by a good male friend even though they knew I was gay and want to know what I should do.„ÄÄOr rather, if I should do anything at all.

(Going to use fake names for obvious reasons)

This happened a few months ago now. Decided to have a drinking party at a friend's (24M) house. Going to call the friend Alex. He works at the same company as me and we've known eachother for a year. We're close and talk about a lot of personal stuff together, play games etc. He has a girlfriend and he knows that I myself am a lesbian. One other girl who works at the same company was there. (23F) Alice.

The night started off fun and we made food, watched netflix and drank steadily. The tone of the conversation gradually got into relationships, sex etc. Work talk too. We all talked shit and it was fairly normal. ( I found out afterward from Alice that while I was in the bathroom Alex had told her that he didn't have a girlfriend, to add to where his mindset was I guess..)

When it was time to go to sleep, we all slept in the same bed and quickly fell asleep. Me on the right, Alice in the middle, and Alex on the left. I got awoken after a while to a hand on my ass. Alex's. I couldn't see Alex's face because of Alice, who was attached hugging me, so I lifted up my head and looked at him like bruh what are u doin lol. he didn't stop. After that he decided to finger me and did so for about 5-10 minutes. He knows I'm gay and clearly I wasn't enjoying it. I lifted up my head several times and made a face at him to get him to stop but it didn't help. I didn't want to move because it was embarassing and it might've woken up Alice. He eventually stopped but tried to then wake up Alice up too and I guess tried to get a threesome or some shit. Alice is not a dumbass and kept her eyes closed laughing saying shes sleepy n just wants to sleep. It stopped him.

We woke up the next morning, I still remembered it all and eventually went home. I knew what he had done was wrong and sure he knew too but as we were friends wanted to make sure there wasn't bad air from here on out. I messaged him and said we should hang out again with Alice, in the day at a Cafe or something. Just have a normal conversation or something. He had said he regrets the night because he has a gf but nothing about what he did to me being bad or w/e. He started to be cold to me and not reply to any of my messages. I eventually started to cut him off but he didn't get the message until I did infact stand up and say (over messages) that what he did disrespected me. Even until now he hasn't apoligized and only ever said he regrets it.

I found out today Alex is still in contact with Alice and they talk. They are currently at a different store and will be returning to the one I am at soon. I'm anxious about it.

I'm angry, I'm disgusted and sure this isn't the first or last time he will do this. I hate that he has this power. Because he works at the same company as me, if I were to tell HR I assume it will get him fired and get him sent home to his own country (We are minorities in a different country, with different views on this kind of thing, but the company is very much American-values).

What I want to know, from reading this, am I in my right to do so? Am I partially in the wrong? I have been told that I should not have put myself in this situation in the first place, but also told that there is no excuse for this and he shouldn't have touched me in the first place. I am worried that if I tell HR, considering it was not flat out aggressive rape, that the punishment will be too cruel.

At this point we don't talk anymore, he started to ignore me since that night.

I want your honest opinions, please.

Thank you.",19Sep2020,1
341,"**I‚ÄôM M19 FORGOT THAT IN THE TITLE, MB**

I just deleted my draft and i dont want to make a long post again, i‚Äôll sum this up:

My fwb and i have slept together for 2 months now. She have hinted a lot of times, since like a year ago, thst she want to be more than friends (Got mad when i told her first that we won‚Äôt gonna date and much more). She broke up with her bf of 2 years, about 4 months ago, since she is bi-sexual and wanted to experience. We have slept together for 2 months now.

She caught feelings for this girl called Sarah and confessed like 1.5 months ago. We pretty Open about This since i‚Äôve also slept with other girls in the meanwhile. Sarah didn‚Äôt feel the same Way at all though.

Well Sarah is still around and is still around at the parties, even though i haven‚Äôt seen Them talk to each other. Keep in mind her ex of 2 years who‚Äôs a really good guy is never there and They dont have contact at all. 

It totally clicked in my head. I didn‚Äôt think to much about it until i was like: ok what if this was a boy she had confessed to and still was around. I wouldn‚Äôt even consider having sex with her. Then i thought, what is the difference between a boy and girl if she‚Äôs into both?

If i had to consider dating her (honestly think she want to Way more than me lol), would this be a red flag? I‚Äôm in no hurry of dating her or anything, but isn‚Äôt it weird they‚Äôre still in contact?",19Sep2020,1

343,"Last night someone left a stroller in our front yard by our mailbox. We think it was empty, and there was no children or note or anything around. I live in Northern Wisconsin, in a nice neighborhood, where there usually isn't much danger other than the occasional break-in, ~~though a druggie tried to drown herself in the river in our backyard last month.~~

My mother and I were driving home from Walmart (only about an hour long trip), and it was already dark. We pulled up to our driveway and there was a stroller, facing away towards our garage. It wasn't there when we left. My mom tried to back up to see what was inside, but I stopped her and told her we should go straight inside and leave all the groceries.

I have heard stories about baby car seats being left at the side of highways, or recordings of baby calls playing outside someone's house to lure a victim into a vulnerable situation. There are a lot of woods surrounding our house, and a whole mess of large bushes where the stroller was, where someone could easily have pulled a victim into.

We got inside safe, and called the cops (who showed up after a hour and a half). All the officer said was it was strange and unusual. He took it back with him and... Thats it. No lives were threatened.

Except, it is now 4am, roughly an hour after I woke up up from a terrible nightmare about the same situation (I will post in the comments if anyone is interested).

My question for you, dearest reddit, is WHY? Why would anyone just abandon an empty stroller in someone else's yard? We don't have any close friends here who would just drop stuff off or try to spook us. Was it just a pre-halloween prank? Was someone drunk and accidentally left it behind? Was it ditched because someone was too lazy to do it themselves? Was it a sign or a threat? Or could it have been actual danger? I'm just very confused. It's late and I need answers, or at least thoughts to chew on.

TL;DR: Someone abandoned a baby stroller at night in my front yard with nothing inside. What is their motive?

If there is a different place I should post this, just let me know. Thanks!",19Sep2020,1

345," 

I have always felt that the idea that there is something beyond death, that you feel part of something bigger and that your existence goes beyond your own skin is something precious, but still my point of view has always been that of an agnostic who does not find a meaning to life beyond what you are able to convince yourself.

I have never rid myself of the feeling of ""I am an idiot talking to myself in an empty room, not praying"", I have never felt any attraction towards the churches near me and I have found the believers around me hypocritical who do not act according to their faith, I have been raised by a man who is a believer and that has made me have respect for the figure of Christ and his philosophy, I respect him as a great man but just as a man, even with everything I have never felt called and I have only come in a hypocritical way in very low moments of my life... Now I find myself in a situation that makes me want to try for the first time, I would not do it for my soul, nor for faith or fear, what moves me is more trivial, I am in love with a woman who is a believer, I am not going to go into details but that person has given a turn to my existence, she needs the person who is at her side to be a believer and if there is something that I want is to be at her side, that is the only reason and it is absolutely selfish and hypocritical so much that I dislike myself and I sincerely do not see myself achieving it.

This is my situation and I don't know what to do, I accept any advice, idea, reading etc that could help me clear my mind, thank you for reading me and for your time.",19Sep2020,1
346,"Sorry for long read! I work in a strip club and the owner of the club (male-40s) frequently invites some of the girls on small trips. We will call the owner of the club, John. So John has taken a liking to me and showed his interest in me from the moment we met. Flirty eyes, winks. Lots of attention. I don‚Äôt mind the occasional male attention, I like it. 
     So, during a day out with all the girls, having fun, he comes up to me and whispers to me that he basically can‚Äôt give me attention or ‚Äúbe with me‚Äù as much that day because, Amanda is here. Amanda is a girl whos worked at the club for a few years and I‚Äôm assuming is Johns #1, or at least the girl he has had some type of connection or relationship with for a bit of time. But they are very clearly not together. I see some PDA but no kissing between them. He kind of pushes her off. Now, Amanda and I are not friends outside of the club, we are friendly and nice but we don‚Äôt really know each other outside of the club. I know Amanda and John are kind of a thing and probably sleeping together but John wants to have sex with me and I want to have sex with him. He‚Äôs a single guy so I don‚Äôt see the problem but I also feel a bit bad that I‚Äôm having to be a sneaking around with this guy. He winks at me anytime she isn‚Äôt looking, gives me lots of attention. Sneaks away to hook up with me. I don‚Äôt want or care to pursue a relationship but I‚Äôm attracted to him and he is awesome when we hook up. 
    I‚Äôm starting to feel a little strange when she‚Äôs very obviously throwing herself at him and even though he does try to equally give us attention, I kind of want her out of the picture. I have no clue if Amanda knows anything. Most likely not. When Amanda screws something up and John gets upset I have to admit I get a bit happy and think that maybe he‚Äôll just kinda switch us out in terms of who he prioritizes. But I doubt it because of how long they‚Äôve known each other and history etc. 
   Ive told him in a joking way that he‚Äôs playing around with me and kinda blown him off a few times. But I kind of want to make it be known to him that he‚Äôs really stepping on rough terrain. Tell him I won‚Äôt go any further with him while he‚Äôs still giving her attention/sleeping with her? Or I can just continue to keep my secret and enjoy myself with him?",19Sep2020,1

For as long as I can remember, any interest/hobbie I've had has always been criticized by my dad. I come from a middle eastern country and my dad has this mindset that if I don't live like him I'll be a loser. He doesn't understand the fact that the way he grew up is nothing like the way I grew up

I used to love to paint and draw as a kid and got so much praise from my mother's side of the family, my dad however? ""What are you some kind of 6 year old girl?""

I used to buy colorful hoodies and shoes and ofcourse they weren't ""masculine"" enough for him

I used to have a fucking dope group of friends but just cause they weren't star athletes on the football team, they're ""losers""

He used to talk shit about my girlfriend, ""that's the best you can do?"". 

I'm an adult now studying for an Engineering degree in Europe, something he could never do. But ofcourse he must say ""this piece of paper means nothing, you must have work experience"" or some stupid shit like that

352,"Looking for advice. 2 questions.

Long story short: my parents were married for 30 years before divorcing when I was 16. My 79 year old father with very little notice recently chose to cease support payments to my 75 year old mother, after 55 years of at least partially supporting her. My mom is bipolar and has never been capable of adulting.

#1: Should I:

Help mom with her legal bills, potentially get nowhere, harbour resentment towards my father about it, and have to choose a ""plan B"" below.¬†

Shirk all responsibility and see a therapist for the rest of my (likely short) life after my mom commits suicide, and harbour resentment towards my father about it

Spend what should be my retirement savings on mom's living expenses, harbour or resentment towards my father about it (because he chose to marry and make her dependant on him while I did not), and become homeless in my old age

Strip the¬† dignity of the woman with a heart of gold who raised me in her old age by sticking her in a single rented room with drug addicts or other covid-19 infected miscreants that no one else wants to live with, and harbour resentment towards my father about it.

Sacrifice my home, sanity, and relationship with my husband by inviting mom to live at his workplace (our home) until we separate, and have her fall down the stairs and become bedridden again, and harbour resentment towards my father about it.¬†


(Just to be clear and fair, in all scenarios I am harbouring some resentment towards my mother as well, but it is judiciously tempered by the fact that her actions throughout life have been primarily guided by mental illness.)

**The Fear of Intimacy!**

Don't blame you if you think this fear is not real hell I haven't heard of it even until just recently and studying it more and reading upon it really made me realize how similar this fear is to me from me personally having this fear from my perspective it's very unconditional I don't do it on purpose not sure if anyone else is like that or even in a relationship the fear of intimacy for me it isn't so much I'm afraid of snuggling up with someone or cuddling or anything like that because I love that feeling it's really nice to have that which by the title you already know yeah I barely get any of that lol.

now in the past I've definitely had some really, really shitty relationships like beyond bad. I did regrettable things she did regrettable things won't get to deep into it but to put it lightly we broke up a bunch of times got back together a bunch of times, manipulated, cheated on, lied too, ignored. All of this now do I necessarily think my fear came from her to that I do not know but in my opinion I feel like I've always had it but never really had fuel to make people hate me so I don't have to get emotionally attached and live in constant fear.

yes, I make people feel bad so they'll leave me welcome to my hell do I feel good about it absolutely not but I do it because I don't want to abandon them my goal in my brain is to get them to hate me so they'll leave me so I don't have to get emotionally attached and making me more afraid it's a complicated amount of  steps that could be simply avoided just by telling the truth saying I have this fear or just telling them that I don't want to be with them

hopefully you can somewhat understand the whole thing is a jumbled mess really so the fear of intimacy for me is unconditionally as well as unknowingly afraid of becoming emotionally attached. This fear makes it incredibly difficult for a man or woman to find relationships and even if you find and have a relationship it's very challenging to keep that relationship on top of that when you do leave inevitably we feel even more hurt even though we clearly know that it was coming we do it so unconditionally we sometimes don't even know we're doing it or at least I don't

it's a very saddening lonely fear haven't hugged or cuddled or snuggled anyone probably for over 4 years now.

Anyways, this community is advice and or asking for it before doing so I do heavily apologize for the horrible punctuation I know it exists before people mention having to take a deep breath and reading as fast as they can I have mild autism and I am horrible with punctuation I can't punctuate if my life depended on it so again I do apologize.

Anyways my question for advice is

1. Why and how does this come about is it from birth or is it purely experiences that cause this anxiety disorder.
2. Is there any way to truly fix this fear?
3. Is there anyone else like me who has similar if not identical experiences?
4. Why do I feel so lonely from this fear (No hugging, No cuddling, No kissing, etc.)
5. Any additional information someone wants to provide on how to cope and live with this fear.",19Sep2020,1

356,"My father (56) first tossed his red Crystal Light drink all over my grandmother (83) and then threw the metal coffee mug, just emptied of the blood-red drink contents, at my grams and struck her in the back of her head.  This occurred in my parents house in front of my mother (51) and my sister (17-minor, senior in HS).  Everyone was in shock and disbelief at what happened. My grandma and mom thought she was just covered in red juice but then mom my noticed it wasn't Kool-Aid at all, it was blood gushing everywhere.  

My mom rushed her to the ER and got her taken care of, ended up just a few stitches in her head and she was later released back to my mom, but not before my grandma gave her statement of what happened to the medical professionals.  She told them what my dad did and the officer onsite questioned her further. My grandma didn't end up pressing charges and my mom took her to her friends house for the night. I was called immediately and advised of what happened. My sister had HS volleyball practice or tryouts so she left pretty much when everything happened and stayed at her friends house for the time being while my mom and grams hid out at my mom's friends house to figure out what had just occurred.

Long, long story short, everyone is safe and my grandma is doing okay. Has a follow up doc visit tomorrow and is up doing crosswords and walking about.

I haven't posted on reddit to something of this magnitude before but I have read countless stories of people getting really good advice from doctors, lawyers, professionals in the fields of topic that are at hand, etc. I felt that I should put my story on here tonight after dealing with one of the hardest and saddest days I've experienced with my family. 

I would love some advice from lawyers and professionals that can help me and my family get through whats going to be probably the hardest thing we will ever overcome in our lives.

I am honestly completely exhausted and haven't slept since 5:30am Thursday and its 2am Saturday but felt if I at least get some raw details out I can get some good advice and maybe come across someone that can offer some help.  There is a whole world of backstory into my family and the issues we have dealt with my mentally unstable father who has done things like this in the past towards myself (eldest of my younger brother, 28, my mom, now my grandma a few times and in front of my little sister, 17). He has never hurt my sister physically from anything that I am aware of or trust me it would've been nipped in the bud a long time ago. His fits of rage and actions of abuse mentally, physically and emotionally have caused myself, brother, sister and mom, worlds of hurt and depression and we are all stuck in this horrible situation with an extremely controlling, manipulative, narcissistic, mentally ill father. 

It's really hard to make this short as I can absolutely write fucking long ass novels if I sat down and put things on paper but I am trying to do this quickly and I am rambling in my exhaustion. But basically my father has had full financial control over my family since I was born and my parents GOT DIVORCED (very important note here) when I was like 3 years old I believe? They had my brother either right before or after? I dunno, makes more sense before but I don't know what the fuck is going on these days.

The CA courts forced 50/50 custody of us and wouldn't allow my mom to leave the state with us even though my dad was cheating on her and starting to act like a real jackass towards her.   They separated and lived in different homes and then they got a house together and tried to make it work again maybe 2 years later? He's always been the bread winner but apparently he stalked my mother when they got divorced and has been threatening her ever since.  Then fast forward a few years later and my dad moved out into an apartment while we stayed at the house (mom, brother and I).  Then about a year or 2 later my dad moved back in and then maybe a few weeks later they sat my brother and I down to tell us we were going to have a new baby brother or sister...? Whaaaaattt? Like wtf is going on?

Anyways, my sister was born into our lives and is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me and my family. We all love her so damn much and she's an absolute rock star of a human. She's definitely going places in life and making a name for herself.

Now back to today...

My father disconnected my moms phone I was talking to her the night of my grandma getting sent to the ER. So I couldn't communicate with my mom, reached out to my sister and got my moms friends number to call her on that and got through. (He has full control of the cell phone plans for my mom, sister and grandma, not my brother or I \[we live on our own with our significant others\], he has video cameras all over the house setup and monitors everything, has alerts and audio recorders in the house and I'm sure listens to everything going on, is a IT guru / business owner and knows everything they do on their computers, phones tablets, etc. Used to monitor mine and disable my internet every night at 10pm when i was in college 19-20 yrs old living back at home, etc. etc.) Basically my mom, sister and gma live in controlled prison environment that he has imminent domain over. 

Jesus Christ i am really rambling but anyways, i had them download whatsapp so he couldn't monitor who they were talking to from imessage or through the mobile carrier, got my moms friend on it and my sister. Was communicating with my sister and my mom this way and come to the next day (Friday), called out of work and went straight to help my mom with my grandma. Got her blood thinner meds at the RX and got them setup, was in communication with my sister who had virtual school and hs tryouts for vball. Then my dad blew up my sister all day with nonsense, lies, abuse, all this shit and put her in the middle of everything. He demanded that she bring the car home, that is legally in my name (whole other story), the house key, and to feed the pets who've been unattended, fed, let out to pee, etc. for over 16 hours approx. He dipped out to the office he owns, most likely as soon as my mom lef to the ER as he figured the cops may get involved.

I told my sister not to respond or call and just text him 1 thing. Something along these lines, simple and to the point, ""Dad I love you and I really do not know what is going on, I am really scared of you and what happened last night.  I have a lot of anxiety from it and I am trying really hard to focus on school and volleyball as you know those are very important to me with tryouts today. I am staying at my friends house and until you can talk to mom and figure out what is happening as I am too scared to go to the house and be alone there or with you. Please let me try to focus today. "" He immediately spiraled into saying he'd always protect her and blah balh  blah bs bs bs ramble about how my mom and gma were abusive to her and all he did was push a cup towards gma and didn't know aht happened even though my sister fucking witnessed it from 10 feet away as a goddamn minor.

Anyfuckinghwho, i had her meet me at the store near our neighborhood with the car and house key, i told her the plan of attack. If he wasn't home then we'd just leave the key, car, and let him know its there and you;d like to grab a few clothes and items from the house and then go stay with her friend.  Well turns out he was home because she has the alarm app for the house and saw him enter the garage and turn on his office light at home like 30 minutes ago. So my next plan was to get the police involved as they already have apolice report from the night beofre. No way in hell im sending her there by herself, fuck that noise.  I knew if i show'd my face too he would probably flip jsut because of whatever manic or crazied state he was in.  I called the police, told them the officers name that reported the night before's incident and  and had them meet us at the store. they sent an oficcer to the house first and one to meet us and itold them what was going on and how my father has lost the plot and will absolutely do something he will regret, esoecailly since he owns firearms and will see the police as threatening.  I I stressed in extremely clear detail that I ABSOLUTELY DID NOT WANT MY SISTER INVOLVED OR TO BE IN ANY DANGER AS THERE COULD LITERALLY BE A GUNFIGHT IF HE SEES HER WITH POLICE. I EXPRESSED FOR THEM TO FOLLOW HER AND LET HER DRIVE THE CAR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE DRIVEWAY AND THEN IMMEDIATELY WALK AWAY AND LEAVE WITH THEM&gt; CASE CLOSED FUCK THE BELONGINGS ITS JUST STUFF.  Well turns out fucking crime dogg mcgruff and whoever the ASSclown was at the house that merely knocked on the door thought OH CASE CLOSED NOBODY ANSWERED THE DOOR SO THAT MUST MEAN NO ONE IS HOME... ARE YOU FUCKING MENTAL? The cop with us was on the mic and tld him copy and I just lokoed at him and said UMMM ARE YOU SERIOUS? YOU THINK THE HOUSE IS EMPTY BECAUSE YOU KNOCKED AND NO ONE CAME TO THE DOOR. I SURE AS HELL WOULDNT ANSWER THE DOOR IF I WAS HIDING LIKE A FELON AND COMMITTED A GODDAMN CRIME! I TOLD HIM LOOK THROUGH THE FUCKING GARAGE DOOR WINDOW, IS THERE A CAR THERE? answer, YES, OHHHHH WELL HIS CAR IS A RANGE ROVER BECAUSE HE GETS ASS BRO AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THE ONLY OTHER CAR THAT GETS PARKED IN THERE IS ONE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DROP OFF RIGHT NOW THATS RIGHT FUCKING BEHIND ME SO GUESS WHAT, HE PROBABLY IN THE HOUSE! FUCKING HARDY BOYS AT IT AGAIN WE GOT OURSELVES HERE A REAL SHERLOCK HOLMES! 

They said well maybe he got picked up by a friend and I said well maybe HE FUCKING DIDNT BECAAUSE HE DOESNT REALLY HAVE ANY AND LIKE WHAT? BRING IN THE HEAVIES RAAAANDY LIQUOR TRAIN IS MOVING FULL STEAM AHEAD! jesus christ just gimme the vest and gun and ill handle it my fucking lord. ANyways, they take my sister and escort her and she leave the car and so i follow in my car after they leave without them knowing and part up the stree in view of the house but out of their sight and staked out the meeting.  The cops eventually escorted my sister with the car and house key, dropped it off and then used the house key with her to enter the house and bascially woke up my dad who was sleeping. 3 officers were there so he really couldnt do anything and eventually arrested him.  I think they had a thermal reader as suburband drove up as the 3rd office and probably had the toys so check if someone was there.

So now its 3am and i think i am going a little crazy on this fucking long ass rant ass shitty fucking day that i bascially got my dad arrested, even though it was all his doing and my ssister was used as bait to get into the house whcih FUCK THE POLICE like WHAt? A MINOR YOU FUCKS and your effort to figure out if someone was there was just to knock and WHAT THE FING RIDDLER APPEARS SAYING GREAT JOB YOU FIGURED IT OUT?!

jesus h fucking christ. I neeed some sleep. but also need to get my family new phones, a lawyer, and how to figure out what to do about 3 females with no income, disabled, frieghtened for their lives, a minor going to club volleyball truouts so we can get a godamn full ride to some inflated ass 80,000 a year bullshit ass university to virtually learn from some teacher fucking livestreaming from the back of their van because they arent getting paid shit and ALSO ITS 2020 BABY FUCKING LET THE RONABUCKS RAIN DOWN ON YALL AND FUCK THIS YEAR!

PS HE KNOWS WHERE MY MOM AND GMA ARE BUT NOT WHERE MY SISTER IS STAYING WITH ME UNTIL I FIGURE A HOTEL OR ANOTHER FRIEND TO TAKE THEM TO.

357,I (17M Nearly 18) am trying to attend a sleepover later this month with my friends and I've talked to my mother about this and she won't allow me to stay any longer than 1hr and 30 mins. Her reasons for it is she doesn't trust my friend's parent (who I've known for 10+years) and says its very under 13 thing to do sleepovers and no one in their teenage years does sleepovers. She won't let me stay past 11pm even offering to pick me up at 11pm sharp. I've only been to two sleepovers both when I was 9 years old. My mother also thinks I am too young and that I'd be irresponsible even though this sleepover is just me and my mates playing board games through the night. I don't know what to do any advice is muchly appreciated and further questions I am happy to respond to!,19Sep2020,1

360,"hello all, 

this is a throwaway as my friends know my main reddit account. i will try to sum up my problem as well as i can. from the last few months, my body has been bothering me. i'm a little fat, which wouldn't bother me a lot but the fat distribution in my body is weird, so my butt and my breasts are flat and my legs and stomach is big. this has made my self image bad. i am working on this problem with a diet and exercise specialist.

my best friend has a ""dream body"", and being around her makes me really depressed because of that. i can't bear to look at her sometimes. we have been friends since a year, so i feel bad for just thinking about this but i want to distance myself from her. until i feel better about myself. would this be a petty or selfish thing to do? i do not know what to do because i do not want her to feel bad or uncomfortable but i also do not want to make my health worse. 

any advice is appreciated.",19Sep2020,1
361,"My birthday just passed and I recieved a parcel from my 1 year bf. (we are in a LDR currently) It was some clothes he had bought for my birthday along with a simple happy birthday card. 

He is very very loving and caring to me, but it just wasn't the type of gift I was expecting. The clothes didn't fit me and they weren't really my style, I also felt that the birthday message from him was pretty short. Especially since I had put in a lot of effort during his birthday with the gifts and birthday card.

When I opened it in front of him I smiled and told him that I loved it and that it was OK that the size was off (am gonna get them tailored). But honestly I was a little dissapointed, I don't expect anything extravagant or expensive and I understand that since we are currently living apart the things he can send are limited, but I would have liked something a bit more heartfelt, especially since its my first birthday with him. 

Should I talk to him about it but inadvertently hurt his feelings or keep quiet about it? Any advice is appreciated!

TLDR: BF's birthday gift to me was underwhelming and I don't know if I should let him know or just pretend that I loved it.",19Sep2020,1
362,"I'm feeling extremely depressed and this is the biggest issue. 
Me and my ex broke up almost 3 months ago and I've been hung up on him ever since.

He had never been in love before so he didn't know how that felt, but he always showed he cared with hugs, kisses and holding hands etc. I was his first real connection with someone romantically. He also has ADD so that's a big factor in the ""feelings"" aspect. The night we broke up we spoke on the phone since we live in different towns. He explained his side and I mine.

366,"Hello reddit, I'm a F, Asian, 14, This is my first time posting on reddit so sorry for all the spelling errors or etc. Anyways here's my story:

I've been fighting or arguing a lot with my parents because of small little things. I don't intend to be a mean kid and I don't think I am? but I'm just confused with my everything and what I did wrong.

Today I had a small fight with my mom resulting in a bigger issue because of my dad. My mom was asking for help on how she can unsend a like on her own message on messenger. I was at that time pretty annoyed but still helped her anyways. My mom left my room but a few minutes later asked the same question. My door was wide open and I was annoyed by that since flies usually would sneakily come into my room and then will end up bothering me with their existence.

So, annoyingly I told my mom to shut the door because flies would come into my room, and I was really pissed off when she kept saying words like, ""why are you being disrespectful"", ""mind your words, that's bad"", and etc. AND SHE DIDN'T JUST CLOSE THE DOOR AND WENT INSIDE TO JUST TELL ME THE PROBLEM SHE KEPT STANDING THERE LETTING ALL THE BLOOD SUCKERS COME INSIDE MY FREAKING ROOM. Ok sorry for that lol. But yeah afterwards, my mom lectured me, finally closing the door.

Now I'm thinking to myself. When will she leave? I'd like to do my own things and hearing her lecturing me was pretty annoying so I was really being disrespectful in her eyes I'll admit and kept lecturing me and etc. I was pretty much pent up with her words and was like groaning and covering my view of her with a pillow. Then she suddenly was like you're so rude and proceeded to grab my other pillow out of anger and hit me with it 2 times. It hurt and I was of course shocked, I knew what was going to happen afterwards..

She then complained about how yesterday, I didn't help her move the plant holder thingy, it was really big and heavy since inside of it was a big palm-ish tree (I'm sorry, I'm not sure on what plant it was but it was huge, like a plant tree) so then my mom flee my room crying, I also cried knowing what was going to happen and my dad rushed into my room, knocked on the door, trying to open it, hitting it, since I locked it after my mom left and asked me what did you do, got mad, dragged/pushed me over to their room which was right across my room and told me to say sorry and how he's going to take away my Ipad and etc.

Then my mom kept crying, adding up more fuel and saying all the sh\*t I've done to her and honestly I don't realize my mistake. I really sometimes don't understand why I'm at fault, I'm sorry it's hard to explain the feeling but afterwards I went into my room and cried, I didn't understand what went wrong. I am aware that I made a mistake but I think it's unfair that if I do something wrong I have to apologize but when they did something wrong to me they'll brush it off and tell me off and end up lecturing me about how I became so sharp-tongued and rude.

I sometimes really feel sad about how I don't really have anyone on my side since I don't have that many friends that are too serious about how I'm doing. Sometimes I think I'm a psychopath with all the plans I have ahead for them. But I don't want that to happen so I just keep praying to God and just accepting that it was my fault not theirs but I just think It's unfair. It's hard bringing this up to my parents since I'll end up not getting taken seriously and treated like a joke.

That's why I've decided to just depend on myself and try not to be such a burden to both of my parents. I will be a good daughter and be nice to them, I'll try controlling my annoyed voice and please them by being a better child. But deep inside, my feelings toward both of them have changed.

I hope it doesn't feel like I'm overreacting or something. I'm aware of my mistakes but I'm simply confused with life. I am willing to accept a positive or negative opinion from you all! Have a wonderful day and thank you for reading this far! &lt;3",19Sep2020,1
367,"No this is not so simple.

Firstly, this is a large sum of ard 2k and I dont understand why he needs the money.

His family has a very decent financial background and from what I know both his parents have very decent paying job which will place them in the middle-high class. Their family does not have any financial struggles that I know of.

Next, he is not exactly the most trustworthy kind. I suggested that he give me a date he can return by and if he doesnt return by that date and doesnt have a valid excuse I would charge him interest. He goes on by saying I am such an ass and threatens not to be my friend anymore. He is my friend since college and i do not wish to lose him

368,"So I have a brother who‚Äôs just started high school and is 6 years younger than me who had a very bad semester(average of 40% in all his classes) at his high school last semester. This semester, me along with my single working mother had a meeting with the principle to discuss how my sibling can do better we agreed on a few things that he could do like office hours after school and stuff like that. Now my brother is very fond of game‚Äôs and has been almost his entire life and we all believe that it is heavily affecting his grades. He would often spend his entire day in his room gaming. He also doesn‚Äôt appear (at least to us) that he cares about school despite us having multiple conversations with him. My mom is very stressed out with work so she gave him an ultimatum where either he starts working harder in school or she would cut him off and just send him to some random public school. So far my brother has done all the office hours and completed all his homework(with my pushing) on time but is still gaming all day and doing the bare minimum with his work. My mom isn‚Äôt home very often but so currently as I am doing online classes for this semester I am trying to get him back on track. My mom just called him and pretty much told him to stop gaming 100% and was very angry and I could tell she sounded really stressed out. Then my brother had a breakdown crying and saying we don‚Äôt praise him enough for doing better this semester and we are only focusing on his bad points. I told him I felt like he didn‚Äôt have a sense of urgency when it comes to his grades and is playing too many games . I play games since I was young myself but I always like I never played it to the point it affected my academics. I felt like this semester he‚Äôs only gotten himself to the starting line when in reality we want him to do better and get in a good college because of how much my mom pays for his education.  How should I approach this situation? And are we being too harsh on him? I‚Äôm really lost at what to do as I do want him to do well and every conversation I‚Äôve had with him just ends with him saying ( it‚Äôs fine or I don‚Äôt have to or I will). and I‚Äôm honestly quite upset at him myself.

I also feel like I don't sound enthusiastic about anything, my voice, even though I actually care. I absolutely hate my voice and my laugh. I can easily have a conversation going for a very long time online, but I feel like I can't do that in real life and that I'll be struggling. I fear that if I ever do, I will lose my friends because they think I'm not the same person as they hoped I'd be. I'd really like to change but it's very difficult.

I have taken out insurance and have backed up most of my important files, but still like the idea of being able to track the devices and easily retrieving them, without going through the hassle of making an insurance claim, buying new devices, configuring new settings etc. 

I have been looking online for tracking devices that can be attached to keys, phones, laptops, but none of the ones I have found so far are either small or discreet. They are mostly big and have goofy symbols on them that show they are tracking devices. The sort of symbols that a thief would know to instantly remove.

Has anyone had good experiences with tracking devices and software that have saved them a lot of headache in the case of a lost phone, laptop or set of keys? And has any buying suggestions? 

I am based in the UK but can order international products if feasible.

377,"I will try to keep this short.  I worked in a doctor's practice which consisted of 5 surgeons. It was a very toxic work environment with an office manager who is condescending and rude to staff and patients.  Two of the doctors (Dr. A and Dr. B) are narcissists who only care about their egos and money. For example, after performing surgery on one occasion, Dr. A humbly walked into the office, with a room full of patients, and announced ""I am a god!""  Dr. A and Dr. B bullied two of the doctors (Dr. C and Dr. D, who are both decent human  beings) into leaving the practice, and they subsequently started up their own practice. I was pushed out of my job as well after many years, in a very classy way. They informed me via email on my day off. Dr. C &amp; D recruited me and I have been working there happily for several months.  Several other staff members left the old practice, because they hated working there as well, and joined us in the new practice. Keep in mind, Drs. C &amp; D did not poach staff, the staff reached out to the drs.

I am close with a few of the staff at the previous practice, who would like to leave, but cannot at this point. One of these people, a very trustworthy source, informed me that she overheard Dr. A telling other staff that Dr. C is having an affair with a young female staff member, who had moved across from their practice to ours. When asked how he knows this, he replied ""Oh, I know"". I know this bullshit, but if this is spread around, it could affect Dr. C's reputation and cause issues for him and his family.  The other staff doesn't know what to do with this info either as she respects Dr. C as well.

392,"Hi! I'm looking for advice how to deal with this situation.

I have a co-worker who has been in a relationship with his girlfriend for 3 years. He doesn't have a car and he asked me to drive him to a grocerystore yesterday straight after work and I did. I've done it several times before and we usually just chat for 5 min while I drive. This time we ended up talking 1,5 hours in the parkinglot.

He opened up about their relationship. Turns out a year ago his girlfriend tried to kill herself while being on mental drugs + booze in a homeparty. He tried to stop her by keeping her on the ground, but she jumped out of the balcony, had her spine crack and hospitalized. She recovered, walks now, but not very well. She's been to an institute for mental illness before, but is home now (can't understand why or how).
They only see each other on weekends, but my co-worker says those weekends mentally feel to him like double-workdays.
They have made a deal that she won't tell if she's about to take her own life. I wondered if it's more of a stress that way, not knowing when is the day he finds her dead.

He worries and stresses, escapes to work. I said to me it feels like he's in a jail of some sorts.

I asked what good he's getting from the relationship, he said when there is a good period, he's getting all the normal needs of a relationship satisfied. And that he fell in love with her before knowing how bad her mental illness was.

He worries if he breaks up with her, she will take her life, and he will have to live the rest of his life blaming himself. And that he is the only good thing in her life, because for example her relationship with her parents isn't any good.

I said no one can stop someone if they really want to kill theirself, and the best way would be to check her in a mental institution where there are professional people who won't let her harm herself, and then break up with her and get on with his own life. Because this doesn't seem like a healthy relationship at all.

I told him to go see a psychiatrist and ask for help there, he said he would rather not rattle about his girlfriend's business to anybody, because it's her decision wether to get help.

He doesn't want to tell anybody, he doesn't think an institution is good for her. He hasn't told anyone who could decide what to do to her situation over him. I asked if he feels alone with this and he said yes.

I know this has nothing to do with me, other than him telling me this, but I can't help but be human, and a girl, and filter all of it through my own stuff as well. I feel flattered that he trusted me over everybody, he told me he feels I'm the most trustworthy and kind in the workplace. I ended up telling about my own past breakup, and him telling me his own insights about that. He even ended up asking me what I look for in a man, and am I looking for a relationship. I told him the truth: I'm not really looking, but I'm keeping my eyes open.

I feel like there is another angle to his problem; he's afraid he won't find anybody else to fill up the place of a girlfriend if he let's her go. And I'm afraid now he might feel I might possibly be a person to fill that place, a gateway to freedom.
Except I don't want to, I'm not interested, I'm not feeling any chemistry. I don't feel he has his shit together at all. If he would honor himself enough, he would already have broken up with her, and at the same time I understand things aren't as simple as they seem to a person who's not involved as closely. But I do feel flattered that a guy want's to talk to me, so I let the talking happen. That's all. How do I let him know I don't want to be anything else than an ear that listens?

What is he's actual main problem here? Is it actually that as long as he has this overwhelming stress over somebody else, that he doesn't have to deal with his own life and his own problems? He said he likes to take care of a loved one, but he would give anything if the loved one wasn't mentally ill. So it doesn't really seem he's escaping his own life into his girlfriend's problem, although it could be.

How far can I go in order to help him, and how can I check myself out of this without getting more involved?",19Sep2020,1
393,"Before I jump into things, it requires a bit of background.

When I was in highschool I was lost and not sure what I wanted out of life. I had a nack for writing, but It was just a hobby for me. 

Around the holidays at that time, one of my mom's clients had invited us to their house as her husband's kids were grown and scattered across the country, and they thought the world of my mother and all of us kids. 

I had met the client before, but this was the first time I had met her husband. (We'll call him Karl.)  He seemed distant for most of the time we were there, but I later found out that he was just a shy man, and that he was fighting cancer so he was tired.

After a while I got bored, I was too old to be playing the games that she had pulled out for my siblings, and I was not one for their chatter so I went outside and continued writing in my notebook that I carried with me. After a while he had come out and say with me. We chatted for a bit and after a while he asked about my writing, asking if he could read it. I was apprehensive, but allowed it. He spent several hours reading  all of the short stories I had written. When he finished, he congratulated me on my talent and urged me to continue my writing. I thanked him and I did. 

We visited them more times for two years, until my senior year of high school. I had decided to write and self publish a book for my senior project. Each time I would visit, Karl and I would sit on the porch and he would mentor me. He became a dear friend of mine in that time. 

The last time I spoke with Karl, I had called him to invite him to my graduation. He was unfortunately unable to come because his cancer had made him too weak to leave his house, but sent me a book signed by an author friend of his and a letter saying that he wanted to put me in contact with someone in the industry. Unfortunately that never happened, as something always came up and after a while I stopped trying.

I wanted to visit him, but with college, I just never took the time to call. Two years ago, I asked mom about them, but she hadn't heard anything in about the same time frame. I stopped by their house but there was a different family living there. We had heard through the grapevine that the client had moved after Karl had supposedly passed, but it was just here say.

Now, six years and three published books (writing another that's on its way because covid) and I wanted to see if I couldn't find him. 

If he is still alive, I want to thank him. I owe everything that I am to him seeing my potential and giving me the push to pursue it. If he he has truly passed, then that is the end of it, and I will be able to truly mourn him.

This afternoon I was going through some boxes and came across the book that was written by his author friend whom he wanted me to meet.

I did some digging and found out that not only does he have a contact email address, but he also teaches at a university no more than 10 miles from my house. Should I contact him about our mutual friend? Or, because it has been so many years, should I just let it go? I don't want to bring up past pain as I do not know how close of friends they were.",19Sep2020,1

397,"Hey guys. First time in Reddit. And I apologize for the long post. 

My parents are really good but I‚Äôve put on weight in the past few years and they haven‚Äôt been happy about it. 
Losing weight and healthy eating and working out are topics spoke ALL the time during every possible situation in my house. 
My parents have been telling me to lose weight from the past 8 years and it has been a daily talking point so much so that even extended family sometimes gets involved. 

The thing is I want to lose weight. It‚Äôs not like I enjoy being commented on or whatever. I want to be healthy and feel good about myself like I used to. But hearing constantly that I‚Äôve to lose weight has affected me and I‚Äôve lost self confidence and find no motivation to work out. 
My mom is soft spoken and we‚Äôre really close so I understand her concerns. 
My dad is a hot head and doesn‚Äôt pay attention to how he talks when he‚Äôs angry and I usually tend not to answer back because I can‚Äôt deal with any sort of conflict (especially related to him)

He gets really angry and says that the guy I‚Äôm going to marry is going to lose interest and not find me attractive and that he‚Äôll leave me and my parents will then have to intervene to take care of it. 
And he gets really involved and idk says whatever he wants basically. Even if it‚Äôs rude or borderline offensive. 
He mockingly asks me if I plan on weighing ‚Äúa ton‚Äù
And there was a time when he yelled at me and my mom for 4 hours straight because I put on weight when I left for college. 

I‚Äôm not allowed to eat ice cream or soda even if everyone else around me is eating. (And there are multiple other small things like these)

After these ‚Äúdiscussions‚Äù he generally tends to feel guilty and becomes super nice. But I tend to take time to stop being upset and being normal around them. And my mom gets super sensitive and keeps asking if I‚Äôm okay and she gets upset thinking I‚Äôm sad. 
But I don‚Äôt know what else to do. This cycle will
Keep happening and I don‚Äôt mind if they yell at me all the time but I can‚Äôt take it when they‚Äôre feeling bad about hurting me and expect me to just be normal. I don‚Äôt want anyone to worry about how I‚Äôm feeling. I‚Äôd prefer being yelled at.

I understand this is a thing that you cannot get solid advice on but I would love to see some sort of feedback. (Skip to the bottom if you want to skip the story.)

 As of the past couple of months I have been feeling more and more down because of me coming to the conclusion of me being lonely. Do not get me wrong I do have two friends, both of them unable to show up to my high school either from them moving away or not being able to come due to their medical condition being more susceptible to COVID. 

To clear things up, I have no problem whatsoever being heard, or being understood when I speak. The problem is that I feel like I don‚Äôt belong anywhere. I tried to pick up on conversations and trying to join in on them or try to start a conversation but only to the end result of it being shallow. Like ‚Äúthe weather is pretty nice today.‚Äù It never goes anywhere. (I was not diagnosed with any sort of social disorder or anxiety.)

You may start to tell me that being an introvert (I think that‚Äôs the term) isn‚Äôt so bad, but I have decided that I do indeed want to have some sort of ‚Äúactive‚Äù social life. Since my school‚Äôs football team is a complete bust and all the years I have put into it and still feel like an outsider, I have decided to slip into a different sport: cross country. Just like the last sport I am still seeing the theme continue.

I do not need to fit into a clique for me to be happy, I just need someone new to deliver that feeling. My question is would be that how do you start a decent conversation and keep it rolling?

So tiny bit of background last year I started in a new school with no uniform after wearing a uniform all my life and since then I‚Äôve been able to develop my own style which I love. 

But yesterday I was talking to my mom and dad and she asked if I wanted to get new clothes for going back to school and I said no thanks cause I actually like my current wardrobe plus I didn‚Äôt want to spend a bunch of money for no reason.

403,"After about 1-2 months of considering breaking up with my girlfriend, I finally gain the courage to do it, only to find out that she is pregnant the very next day. I realize that I should be there for her, whatever her decision would be, and try to make things work between us. 

I‚Äôm 25 and currently live with my mom. Me and my mom live in a trailer home, where she barely gets by on living costs each month. I have my own vehicle, dropped out of college, have a 2 year assosicates degree, and only make about $18/hr working part time ~30hrs/week. I also have student loan debts around $24k

My girlfriend is 18, dropped out of high school, doesn‚Äôt have a GED, doesn‚Äôt have a job, doesn‚Äôt have a vehicle, and her parents have been living in a cheap hotel for the past 8 months. Her parents claim to help support her financially if she decides to keep it.

I don‚Äôt see myself as being ready to have a child yet because I still have goals that I want to reach and there are things out in the world that I want to experience before settling down to have a family. On the other hand, she really wants to keep the baby. She hasn‚Äôt yet experienced what it‚Äôs like to live on her own or have responsibilities to pay for things, and it concerns me. She thinks that having this baby will push her to get things done. 

I‚Äôm not looking for criticism here, because I know that I should have been more safe. I‚Äôm starting to think that maybe things won‚Äôt work out between us because our goals and priorities are so different. But, I‚Äôm scared to end things because she threatened to never let me see the child if things don‚Äôt work out between us.

405,"   We met back in March on OKCupid, we went on dates, and I even spent 2 weeks at his apartment. At that time, we were totally fine with just casually talking to each other and flirting. He lived about an hour and a half away so this was fine. He was soooo into me, always begging to hang out, talk, ect. Once Covid went big my parents didn't allow me out of the house but only to work. Flash forward to late July, I get kicked out and spend 3 weeks at a friend's place. Plans change and I'm left with literally nowhere left to go except this new townhouse he just moved into with an old coworker. I think to myself, this is a godsend. This won't be a problem at all.
   I soon started to realize such heavy emotions fill me and he noticed too we both actually cried about it, he said he really liked me too, but just didn't see a future with me. The man who once begged for my attention, who would drive over an hour last minute just to see me, now is so distant. I actually thought we had connected, and he really liked me....
    The point of me posting this is this morning as I was sleeping, I heard him come downstairs talking on the phone. (I've been sleeping on the couch in the living room because it's a little much for me to be upstairs, it sounds stupid, I know.) I immediately knew what it was. He's officially talking to someone now. He even mentioned her bunny to our other roommate... And please don't read this the wrong way, I'm not angry. I'm not a psychotic bitch who wants to ruin lives or relationships. I want him as happy as he'll ever be, whatever makes him feel good and excited about life. I want to respect his wishes and his boundaries. I miss the him I met very dearly, but I know he doesn't see me that way, at least anymore, and there's nothing I can do... I'm here to ask what I should do about how I'm feeling and I guess, just to get about life living with him. I'm on the lease so there's no backing out now.

406,"I don't know if this is exactly in keeping with this sub, but I don't know where else to post this.

This isn't an issue with just me. It's an issue with my entire community. I live in a medium-sized town in East Anglia, UK (The exact name of which I will not post due to privacy reasons). At the last census in 2017, about 10,000 people lived here, which has probably grown a bit at this point. Cycling is big amongst youth here. Almost everybody under 18 owns a bike and rides it around town, to school and back, etc. I own a bike as well, but I'm homeschooled and usually stay at home due to coronavirus, so I ride my bike for exercise and as a hobby. The problem is: Nobody ever wears their helmet.

Every morning and afternoon during the week, there's hoardes of kids and teenagers flooding the town, going to the local secondary school, almost half of them on bikes. They either don't wear helmets, or wear them with the chinstrap undone. They don't use cyclepaths, either, and I've almost been run over by kids on bikes, without helmets, riding at extreme speeds, on the footpath. Multiple times. This extends to adults, as well - I've seen people riding on-road without helmets.

I know that this post probably sounds conceited and elitist, but I really am nervous and upset about this. I've heard too many stories about cyclists falling off their bikes at high speeds and winding up dead, and I'm constantly terrified to wake up and find out that some poor kid has died because they weren't wearing a helmet. It seems like I'm the only person who realises a problem - I've stopped several groups of teenagers not wearing helmets whilst on bikes and asked them why they're not wearing helmets, and it's usually the same answer - ""You don't have to wear one."" ""There's no need."" ""Why would you?"" In youth around here, if you listen to the government at all, you're a loser. I've been laughed at by teenagers my age because I drink tap water.

I want to do something to help persuade people to wear their bike helmets, use the bike path, and generally exercise good bike etiquette, but... I'm 15. I'm the same age, or younger than, most of the people who aren't wearing helmets. They aren't going to listen to me.

How can I get people's attention and persuade them to wear their bike helmets?

TL;DR: Under-18s in my town don't wear bike helmets and don't see a reason to. I'm 15 and I would like to help persuade people to wear their helmets, potentially preventing deaths. What I can I do?",19Sep2020,1

409,"I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm posting here since I think I know what I have to do. I think. 

I was made redundant in March. Since then, I‚Äôve been actively looking for work, and have continued to modify my resume to job descriptions on the eighty of so applications I‚Äôve submitted, getting further and further from my actual skills and achievements‚Äîtaking full credit here, adding a computer program I‚Äôve never worked with or am not proficient in, there. 

After about five interviews over the last six months, I finally landed a job. I started it a week and half ago, and although I‚Äôve been working, my background check is still pending. Panic set in a when I realised the severity of an embellished job title (Analyst vs Lead Analyst*) when completing the background check information and became extremely stressed about it. Tremendously so.

But here‚Äôs the really stupid part of this debacle. I was preoccupied about the wrong thing. See, about 20 years ago, I completed college. At the time, I was having some issues and didn‚Äôt complete my double major. For some reason, I felt justified in listing it though, so it‚Äôs been on my resume since then. In fact, it‚Äôs been on there so long that I began to believe the lie myself. The funny part about it is that I‚Äôve been in banking since I graduated and the other degree has nothing to do with my profession‚Äînot remotely. Fucking ego. So, one day about a week ago, a light bulb finally went off in my extremely dim mind that this was a huge omission and would certainly be discovered. I freaked out‚Äîdid a bunch of googling, went on my college‚Äôs website. Nothing gave me comfort. I had to come clean. Why didn‚Äôt I just resign, you may be asking yourself, since the background check wasn‚Äôt yet completed?

My spouse and I are purchasing a property right now. That‚Äôs right! From and auction, no less, no conditions. No way out. We have conditional finance approved subject to my first payslip, which I should receive in about three days time. But they‚Äôll likely do an employment check before funding...F.

So, after I realised the state of my absolute reckless stupidity, I spoke with my manager, and told her that I had accidentally omitted the units completed for me degree from my resume when I changed the formatting from one system to the next when I was revamping my resume. Frankly, I have only worked for two companies over about a 15 year period so I haven‚Äôt kept an eye on it, nor have I really thought too much about the obvious gravitas of not listing my exact titles. I really don‚Äôt know why I was so naive about this. It‚Äôs like I had no common sense whatsoever. 

So I came clean. About the degree. ‚ÄúMoron!‚Äù you say. ‚ÄúYou had an opportunity to address all the lies, untruths, stretches, whatever you want to call them.‚Äù My fear prevented this from happening. Fear and shame.

When I saw my boss in person, we had a meeting. No surprise there. She basically said she was only overlooking the degree mishap because I confessed to the omission...and because it didn‚Äôt apply to my role at all. She then very kindly told me I could talk to her...an opportunity to confess to other issues not disclosed, which I didn‚Äôt even entirely realise in that moment because I was so stressed out already. She told me my background check wasn‚Äôt completed yet...Worry set in. I know she knew what was pending, but I didn‚Äôt...I told her about the issues regarding two titles about my acting title and secondment* and she told me I should have listed them as such. But I didn‚Äôt talk through all of it. I explained how I felt that resumes weren‚Äôt black and white and I wasn‚Äôt aware of some of the rules...while true to a minor extent, I knew enough. I can‚Äôt fool myself. I told her I wanted to send her an updated resume, to redo the whole thing, she just shook her head. She said HR did need an updated copy, but to include my coursework units on there and to leave the rest the same. I think they‚Äôll probably go through it with a fine tooth comb. The majority of my achievements and duties are accurate, the main issues are my titles and two computer programs...and that fucking college degree that I didn‚Äôt attain.

A couple of hours after the conversation, while I tried to focus on work, I felt so horrible that I openly started telling her how bad I felt about everything, though I had already apologised profusely. I know it‚Äôs not enough. How can you build a relationship on a lie? Intended or otherwise? And I don‚Äôt think I made it clear to her about the last role having an embellished title because she tried to hush me since I was talking on the floor where everyone was working. I was too ashamed again to ‚Äòfess up when I was given the opportunity in the office. I‚Äôm confident if there‚Äôs another issue, I‚Äôm out the door. I think the meeting clarified that.

After we spoke, I called the background check agency, since I can check the status of it, and they told me when I rang that the employment check was still outstanding. I can also go online and see how many remaining checks are pending. It used to be 21 out of 28. Now it‚Äôs 20 out of 28. The stress is incredible. 

What I foresee as possible outcomes:

(1) Background check comes up roses. Unlikely at best. A fool‚Äôs errand.

(2) I resign‚Äîsaving both of us from further discomfort and embarrassment. The check remaining incomplete. 

(3) I try to ride it out. Consequences be damned. I need that payslip and employment. 

(4) Email her everything. A new resume, my explanation, with no expectation but to clear my conscious and do the right thing. 

Option 3 is the one my spouse wants me to do. He truly isn‚Äôt seeing the big picture, is solely focused on the purchase of the property. He also isn‚Äôt able to fully comprehend what I‚Äôve done. And I love him to pieces, but I can‚Äôt get advice from him, not with this issue.

Option 2 resonates with me. I‚Äôd like to resign, because this can‚Äôt be fixed. My reputation is shot. This is a small city and although my boss is being kind, this is a real fuck up‚Äîthe biggest of my life. I can barely manage to sleep, I‚Äôm crying constantly and I just can‚Äôt handle more stress. But I‚Äôm being pulled in two directions. Keep the job to save the house and the possible litigation or loss that may follow.

Option 4 appeals to me to an extent, but I think it would only serve to make me feel better in the short term and have no impact on anything really. I can‚Äôt undo what‚Äôs been done. 

In the extremely unlikely event that my boss lets me keep the job, I would feel such a sense of doom and shame because of what I‚Äôve done. The amount of time, money and effort that she has already invested in me disgusts me. On top of that, HR is or will be aware of my misdeeds and that isn‚Äôt good either. A blemished, tarnished reputation from day one. And the worst part is that I‚Äôm completely capable of doing this work, probably slightly over qualified. And I didn‚Äôt need to lie, because none of them had any bearing on me getting the job. Pathetic.

You know, I used to think of myself as a person of integrity. I‚Äôve even been told by others that I am. I now question everything about myself.

The amount of guilt, shame and disgust I feel is immeasurable. The purpose of me posting here is not to be judged, though I know that will happen, even welcome it to an extent so I can self-flagellate more. I know what a complete and absolute piece of shit I am. I‚Äôm here solely for advice. 

I also need advice on what to tell people as the reasoning for resigning from a job when they‚Äôve been unemployed and have no job prospects. What do you tell them as a reason? I worry about damaging my reputation further, though I suppose I could tell them about my embellished job title. I know quite a few people as acquaintances at the company from my previous jobs and also have obviously told a handful of my friends about my new job as well. 

And then there‚Äôs the purchase.

FML. And it‚Äôs all my fault.

* Roles on Resume

I‚Äôm trying to understand the rules around drafting a resume correctly, and am wondering if I need to specify that a role has been an ‚Äúacting‚Äù role or ‚Äúseconded‚Äù on my resume. I‚Äôm asking to understand the implications from a hiring point of view. For example, if I don‚Äôt include that, will my background check display adversely? When they contact the employer, what is disclosed for verification?

I was an ‚Äúacting‚Äù manager for a year, and prior to that I was also seconded for six months, though not consecutively. I listed both as the actual roles without indicating the other aspect. 

I just had a gruelling background check which has made me question everything and I‚Äôm worried now that not indicating that the roles were not Permanent may make my background check fail.

Also, to throw in the mix, my senior manager of my last team called me her ‚Äúlead‚Äù and introduced me to people that way so I put that on my resume, but per payroll, I was just an analyst. I called her and she said not to worry about it but I don‚Äôt know how stringent these rules are. I feel like if I‚Äôm off by a month on what I disclose I might as well resign myself to the fact that I‚Äôm not getting the job. 

In regard to the role noted below, ‚ÄúActing Manager‚Äù, I was in that role for just over a year. As I mentioned, I didn‚Äôt indicate it was an acting role, because frankly, I was doing the job for so long and I had four different managers. One of the reasons it wasn‚Äôt permanent is because there were about three restructures that took place, though had I applied, I may not have been successful. By the time my 13th month rolled around, they had made the role redundant and changed it into a Team Leader role instead, which I didn‚Äôt apply for. So, I reverted back to my regular role for four months, but I did a hand over during that time. Right after I reverted to my regular role, I interviewed for a different role within the company, but that was put on hold for four months, which is the first one noted. Anyway, my resume looks like this.

* Lead Analyst (payroll and actual is Analyst)
* (omitted adding the four months or so that I reverted back to Analyst)
* Manager (Acting not noted)
* Analyst
* Analyst (secondment not noted)
* Specialist 
* Advisor (not noted only did for five or six months and was promoted to Specialist‚Äîmore responsibilities, similar role)
* Underwriter (actual Specialist‚Äîlisted as a completely separate title, as the one noted didn‚Äôt describe my duties, but this slightly inflated my actual role.) 
* Manager (omitted ‚Äúteam‚Äù from title)

To clarify, each Analyst and Specialist role is entirely different in nature.",19Sep2020,1
411,"I deleted my previous account because I received death threats. I used to post on NSFW subreddits, just for fun, and people there seemed more open-minded, but I was getting some really awful private messages from people who were threatening me.

I would also post on normal subreddits, for example asking for recommendations or (bad idea) relationship advice, I would get some very bitter replies. I once asked where I could perform live music on a subreddit of a city, without revealing my identity or any of the music I play/sing, and all I got was hate comments, like find another job or work on your act. 

On relationship subreddits I was called (by other women!) cheap, the w-word, the s-word etc after asking fir advice regarding a friends with benefits. 

I admit I became kinda addicted to this site because I read the news, articles, I look at memes etc. But I still fall into some toxic subreddits and I really feel more anxious and less confident because of it.",19Sep2020,1
412,"Hey, 

I am currently a high school student in India. Initially, I chose subjects related to Engineering even though I was good at Economics. I did this because I wanted to start my own business in the tech industry and choosing Economics meant that I had to take over my dad‚Äôs business in which I had no interest at all. 

Halfway through the first year of high school, I realised that I didn‚Äôt like Physics (if I don‚Äôt like physics, I wouldn‚Äôt like engineering either). I didn‚Äôt want to accept this fact, but this was quite evident in my behaviour - I didn‚Äôt study as frequently and as hardly as I used to, I started get frequent anxiety attacks, and I wasn‚Äôt able to sleep well either. I kept thinking that this was because of my teacher, who wasn‚Äôt very good at teaching and almost all students felt the same way, but this certainly didn‚Äôt help in explaining my behavioural changes. So, I decided to change to Economics, but I quickly changed back to Physics because staying in Economics meant that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to achieve my dream of starting my own business and the nightmare of taking over my dad‚Äôs business caught on. I stayed in Physics for a while after this and I realised that changing back to physics was a huge mistake and I kept beating myself up for it. 

I couldn‚Äôt handle Physics anymore, so I changed back to Economics and the fear of taking over my dad‚Äôs business caught on again. My brother took Economics  as his major and ended up in my dad‚Äôs business. I have a strong feeling that I would end up like him by majoring in Economics. I believe you can tell the trend by now - everytime I pick a side, the other side seems to be better.

414,"I've read a lot about this and it's something that millions of people do. So do everyone's sexy/ nude pics get hacked/ deleted? Or are there chances that one might actually be safe inspite of having sent out a sexual image of themselves to a trusted someone? A lot of teens and young adults do it out of choice, pressure or simply to fulfill their partner's needs. It's really messed up if something stupid like this that you did at 18 is going to come bite you in the ass at 30. Especially in more culturally conservative countries.

417,"Due to a busy schedule sometimes I have to get some studying done at night before I go to bed, but since I need to wake up early as well I don‚Äôt want the bluelight from my computer screen to interfere with my brain‚Äôs natural production of melatonin and therefore, my ability to sleep. To compensate for this, I‚Äôll have an alarm set 30 mins before I‚Äôm supposed to go to bed and I‚Äôll always take a melatonin supplement around this time. 

It‚Äôs worked pretty well so far and I haven‚Äôt had problems falling asleep and waking up feeling adequately rested the next day despite my screen usage. 

Here‚Äôs my only concern. If I do this for too long, will it make me dependent on melatonin and render my brain incapable of producing its own? I‚Äôve only been doing this for a week or so now so if this is going to be a problem, I think now would be the time for me to find out.

424,"If this helps gives some context to what kind of person I am, I‚Äôm an ENFJ :) 

Also, this is long so thanks for reading if you do. 

I used to have a toxic friend who didn‚Äôt have any boundaries and who didn‚Äôt respect himself. He self-pitied a lot and seemed to have a lot of self-hatred within him. He was likely struggling with depression and anxiety, and had abandonment issues. I tried to help him but he just stayed stuck in his negative cycle so trying to help felt like useless attempts and was draining. Him not being able to let go of his past was starting to affect me. Knowing that it wasn‚Äôt good for me and he was pushing my boundaries, I distanced myself from him. 

I told myself I needed some space and that I was busy with school and stuff (which was true). He became desperate at some point and started to text me a lot. He sent me some passive-aggressive stuff like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt miss the moon while looking at the stars‚Äù or some shit like that. It pissed me off tbh because I felt like he thought of himself as more important in my life that he sent me stuff like that. 

Our relationship was toxic, draining and unhealthy. It reached a point where I realised that I hated him and I didn‚Äôt want to be friends with him any longer. So, I cut him off the next day. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to be friends any longer. 

After that, he texted me to apologise and I apologised too and I said it‚Äôs too bad that things turned out this way and something along the lines of ‚Äúit was nice knowing you. Best of luck, bye.‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember exactly what I said but it was quite clear that I did not want to talk to him ever again and that that was the end. I was happy we ended things on good terms. 

During the coronavirus lockdown, he texted me again telling me about how he‚Äôs actually ‚Äúliving for himself now‚Äù. And I told him ‚Äúgood for you but why are you telling me this?‚Äù. I made it very clear to him before that I didn‚Äôt want anything to do with him and that was he does is none of my business and I thought we ended things on good terms. I got the closure I needed then but I guess he didn‚Äôt. 

I hated him at some point. He didn‚Äôt respect himself at all and was the type of person who would do anything to keep a friend, even if they weren‚Äôt treating him right. I ended the friendship because it wasn‚Äôt fair or healthy for either sides. I hated him and felt a lot of malice towards him at that point because he represented all the negative traits that I didn‚Äôt want to have. I associated him with them. He put me on a pedestal and him not respecting himself and self-loathing and him doing a lot of unhealthy things that would take too long to list made me feel uncomfortable. He was the type to break his back to keep a friend and I just felt like he wanted to chain himself to me. I believe that being friends with someone shouldn‚Äôt feel like something you have to do, but something you want to do. And I didn‚Äôt want to be friends with him any longer. 

After he texted me and I was as neutral as I can be, I felt a lot of anger towards him because I felt like I lost my sense of closure. So I texted him a long and angry message telling him to f himself and that it was unfair for him to text me again when I made it very clear that I did not want anything to do with him ever again. After that I blocked him. Then I unblocked him because I wanted to end things on good terms. We talked and I offered him constructive criticism because he said he really was working on improving himself. I asked him if he was comfortable with it and he said yes so I shared it with him constructively. I turned off my phone to calm myself down but when I came back, he said some pretty mean things to me that made it clear that he was not over what happened and that he‚Äôs not changed. That led to me sending him 5 long-ass messages, blocking him after sending every one. 

I was super tired by it. I said everything I wanted to say and I was harsh for most of it but I wanted to end things as kind as I could be so I sent the fifth message telling him he could change if he wants to but whether he does or not isn‚Äôt my responsibility. I wished him the best of luck and basically told him I don‚Äôt owe him anything and neither does he owe me. I apologised for everything and said thank you. Then I blocked him.

Occasionally I get irrational fears that he might kill me or hire someone to assassinate me (he was quite into military stuff and guns). But I believe that he might have been a toxic person but he was not a bad enough person to kill someone at heart. So I‚Äôm overcoming that fear. 

Sometimes I get thoughts that I don‚Äôt want to be like him before I do certain things but I feel like it‚Äôs holding me back so I‚Äôm working on overcoming it too. I want to let it go quickly but idk how long it‚Äôll take. 

Any tips on how to let go? 

Also, I used to blame myself even though I know it wasn‚Äôt my fault but I‚Äôm over that now. I did care about and loved him but it was unhealthy so I put myself first and ended the friendship y‚Äôknow? I want to let go because I deserve better. I don‚Äôt deserve to hold onto this anymore. So any tips on how? Or any suggestions on why I still think about him occasionally or is this normal for everyone and will fade away eventually?

430,"So to keep this short recently I've discovered I have one...it sucks because even writing this I know I am going to continue to have it,so about a month ago I downloaded an app and put 50 pound on,long story short I would win some lose some but ultimately tripled my money,so then I thought if I put more on I would get more out,this worked at first,I made  a very good amount of money in a short amount of time,more than my months wages in one day lets say.

So now obviously doing that,I wanted to keep going,the bets got bigger and the chances more stupid,until these last three days,in 3 days combined I lost not only all the profit I originally made,but then got worried,put my whole bank savings in in an attempt to re get that profit,and then lost that....

Now I have 5 pound left on the account and am currently plan on putting my work wages in my bank so I can use that to further my addiction as I am now negative money wise....

I know its extremely dumb that im self aware that I have an issue yet I still do it,but if anyone is willing,when I become even money wise I plan on stopping as its it's obviously an unhealthy addiction.

431,"So a little background. I‚Äôm a 23 year old male and I work as a security supervisor for a decently sized district in my city. In total there are 5 full time people including me and the one other supervisor, and 5 part time guys who have other jobs or work at other sites. 

With this roster we are down about 4 people, so that‚Äôs 4 or more shifts every week where someone is working overtime. I‚Äôve had no more than 3 scattered days off in the past month and I‚Äôm getting stretched to my limits. 

So we hired this one guy who is 20 years old. But he acts like he‚Äôs about 16. He‚Äôs been here alike a month and a half. And he has absolutely zero concept of responsibility. For example, in a single shift I caught him sleeping twice and he ate my food out of the break room fridge. So I‚Äôve held my tongue and have tried really hard to be cool with him, save for a few aggressive words that I later apologized for. But he creates multiple issues every shift basically. So he‚Äôs back in college and only working weekends. He agreed to work the 6am shift and made it on time once. He doesn‚Äôt live far and refuses to take an uber (though I got one and sent it to his house once, which he paid me back for) and always claims to miss the bus. So today I call him 3 minutes after his shift was supposed to start and he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick‚Äù. *I* called *him* to hear that. Also I happen to be dealing with diarrhea that started last night so I had no problem telling him ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt call off after your shift started so you better get here‚Äù. He comes in and is apparently perfectly fine. I had a whole conversation with him and everything. I even told him to take it easy and told him he could stop at the coffee shop for breakfast. So he goes out then comes back an hour later for the bathroom. Then I get a call from the client asking if I can have a guard check if the flags are at half mast so i radio him, he says he‚Äôll do it, and then he walked out the door and sprinted for his car. I didn‚Äôt realize that he left for a while, I radioed him then discovered his radio at base, then I texted him saying to come back and grab his phone, a half hour goes by before I try calling his phone, and the call gets rejected. So I call from the office phone and got rejected again. That‚Äôs when I checked the cameras and watched him run to his car and leave. He has caused me so much stress and extra work and I really want to let him know exactly how he fucked everyone over but I don‚Äôt know how to do it without either sounding like I wanna kick his ass (which I don‚Äôt not want to) or straight up cursing him out. I‚Äôm just so angry and don‚Äôt think anything said will get through to him which makes it that much more frustrating. 

I don‚Äôt hate people, and it literally hurts me emotionally that I feel such hatred towards him. I don‚Äôt want to but I think this is the first time I can really say that I fucking hate someone I‚Äôve met and worked with. And like I keep thinking I understand having a shitty home life making work hard, I understand having severe adhd making life difficult, but the total lack of self awareness is just not okay with me. This is a rant post but I really need a little guidance because before making this post I had to stop myself from sending him hateful/hurtful texts. I‚Äôm just so stressed and he made it that much harder and I will not get closure or even an apology for it. 

TL;DR me, a 23 year old supervisor is pissed that a 20 year old employee walked out after screwing me over for the entire time he‚Äôs worked here. Need an alternative to cursing him out that will convey the pain that I am enduring because of his actions",19Sep2020,1
432,"I have been working at a company for about 3 years and seriously debate on leaving every other day.  Every other day it's like I'm telling myself I'm quitting, I'm done, I can't do this anymore etc.  I don't know what it is but I just get so frustrated sometimes and I lose my cool. 

I think a big part of it is my commute.  I commute about an hour each way to work, 2 hours daily, 10+ hours a week.  Although I generally don't deal with traffic, the commute is killing me.  I still live at home with my parents but I've been thinking about moving out - yet not sure how to go about that.  Is it wise to move out and closer to my job if I think that will prevent me from getting frustrated and annoyed all the time?

The only downside is having to pay rent ($900 - $1,330/mo) than saving all that money living at home.

433,"This man isn‚Äôt necessarily a super close friend of mine, but we have known each other fairly well for a few years now.

He‚Äôs a bit of an odd guy, and the really big thing with him is he can‚Äôt really stop himself from blurting things out and has pretty much no social boundaries, so him not so subtly telling me this wasn‚Äôt surprising, but it has been bothering me. Just an FYI, some of this sounds ridiculous, but he‚Äôs always been incredibly straightforward with me and is an absolutely terrible liar, so I am inclined to believe most of it.

We were out for lunch a few weeks ago and he told me he had cheated on his girlfriend in the past, several times, but that he‚Äôs moved on from it and gotten better. I told him it‚Äôs good to learn from your mistakes and whatnot. He then started implying it was still going on/ or that he was tempted, and I changed the subject quickly.

He then proceeded to inform me that his ‚Äúbody count‚Äù had gone up by FIFTEEN PEOPLE in the past two years (they‚Äôve been dating for probably 3). This i didn‚Äôt know if I should believe and I just rolled my eyes and changed the subject yet again.

He then started flirting with our waitress pretty openly. Hes a smooth talker and is normally pretty good with women and flattery but as I said, no social boundaries, and he did it right in front of me after talking about how much he loves his girlfriend for 10 minutes.

I managed to survive lunch without cringing into a black hole, and later that night he sent me a screenshot of my tinder profile saying ‚Äúomg I found you on bumble AND tinder‚Äù, and I became pretty sure he was still cheating or at least trying to cheat on her, considering he‚Äôs apparently a heavy user of both of those dating apps.

Now, a few things. 

1. As I said, he‚Äôs a bad liar, so you‚Äôd figure his girlfriend would find out yeah? Well, I‚Äôve never met her, but from what I‚Äôve heard she‚Äôs incredibly innocent and naive and I don‚Äôt think she has any inclination to distrust him or ask about these things, ever. On top of that, he‚Äôs in the military and she lives 12 hours away, so he can get away with pretty much whatever he wants apparently without raising any red flags. 

2. Like previously mentioned, I don‚Äôt know his girlfriend. Never met her. The most interaction we‚Äôve had is commenting on one another‚Äôs instagram posts. 

3. I have no concrete evidence of any of this aside from proof that he‚Äôs on tinder.


All things considered, is it really my place to tell her? I figure someone will come along and bring it up eventually since her boyfriend can‚Äôt keep his mouth shut, but I feel guilty knowing this poor girl is getting completely played and is completely and totally clueless about it. I just don‚Äôt want to end up messaging her and causing serious problems for either of them just for her to not believe me because she doesn‚Äôt know me, she has very little reason to trust me, and I don‚Äôt have a whole lot of proof.

Background: moved in with my roommate (A) in a nice place got along well and it was total bliss. 6 months in, landlord brings her friend (F/50s) (B)to live with us. She turns out to be a complete nightmare. Very bossy and controlling so (A) left. I‚Äôve been with roommate (B) for two months and to tell you she does whatever she wants is an understatement.

437,"i have a very very important event coming up that i absolutely cannot miss so i have decided to quarantine in my room for three weeks (i live with 6 other people).
the problem is my cat. this is MY cat and not the family cat. I can‚Äôt kick him out of my room for three weeks because that is where he spends most of the day. The main reasons he leaves my room are to use his drinking fountain (which I‚Äôve moved to my room) and to use the litter box in the bathroom.
I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôd be okay to let him wander around a bit and use the litter box in the bathroom. He doesn‚Äôt really interact with any other family members other than my brother, who doesn‚Äôt leave the house either. I‚Äôve heard some stories of cats contracting covid and if I‚Äôd have to go into quarantine if one of my family members who has been in contact with the cat gets sick I‚Äôd rather just deal with the litter box smell. 
I‚Äôll be using this bathroom too (sharing with 2 others) but disinfecting before every use and wearing a mask while I‚Äôm in there.

438,"This isn't the only example, but the most recent one:

As I listen to the Undertale 5th Anniversary concert on YouTube, I think about how well the creator; Toby Fox has done. He did odd bits here and there, but UNDERTALE was where hey really hit his peak. And he's gone from a guy making something in game maker to his characters appearing in official Nintendo video games, making music for the Pokemon series and as previously mentioned;  orchestral performances of music from his game. (He is a master of music btw)

I suppose, his story is inspirational: UNDERTALE's low quality graphics but fun gameplay and enticing characters is what made me want to get into making video game creation myself; no longer would it be something that the ""boffins"" did for me. But...I don't think i'll ever be a Toby Fox; I don't think i'll even make something good or memorable on it's own merits. And that kills me internally.

I don't dislike Toby Fox; far from it. I also adore the work of UNDERTALE and it puts a stupid grin on my face to see sans in smash brothers. But I have absolutely no musical skill, coding seems like an endless nightmare and I can just about draw decent pixel art (others tell me anyway). I know I shouldn't compare myself to others, but how can one not be envious of his success?

441,"So I have a friend who is like a brother to me, we lived together for many years, and his current girlfriend of many years is a complete alcoholic and prescription drug addict. She's not a malicious addict, she's a good person, but has definitely shown up shaking and passed out at brunch before from ""not eating"". We started hiding the liquor bottles from her when they come over, and last time she found and drank like 6 mini-bottles we hadn't put away and told my wife she had only 1. She also takes crazy medication with all of her excessive drinking, one night she said she took 4 totem poles to sleep. I didn't know this at the time but my wife, who is a nurse, has been hiding any prescription medication in the house when the gf comes over also...

I want to approach him about this, and we've come close to telling him we don't feel comfortable with him bringing her over, but am thinking we should approach him from a place of concern. I'm really afraid he's turned a blind eye and is going to wake up next to a corpse one day. I'm also afraid he's going to ""shoot the messenger"" and our friendship over 10 years will be gone.

442,"Hi, everyone.

I'm a K-5 music teacher with a Bachelor's Degree in Music Education. I've been a teacher for four years. Lately I have been unsatisfied by my job. Mainly it's the music side of the job I'm not satisfied with - I'm just not as interested in music now as I used to be. I like working with kids, but generally my brain has not been stimulated in the K-5 music classroom.

This year, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm really seeing how specials at the elementary level are only in place to give other teachers planning time. No one cares what goes on in our classrooms, as long as the kids are staying safe and engaged. 

So I think it's time for me to move on. I've been closely thinking about my interests to try and come up with some possibilities of what else I could do. One of my biggest passions is learning about the world. I love learning about countries and people and languages and anything to do with those things. I read travel guides and Wikipedia pages for fun, and I'm working really hard to teach myself Spanish. 

One more thing to consider, my wife and her twin sister have a relatively successful blog/influencer page on Instagram, and I think my ""dream job"" at this point would be to help them with their work on IG, but at this point in time that is not an option, since they would need to be able to monetarily support three people. It very well could be an option in the next couple of years or so, however, because it is growing very quickly. 

So, for that reason, I'm not really interested in getting another degree or something like that, because if things go well for my wife I wouldn't need it in a few years anyway.

What are my options? I mentioned my interests above but I'm really open to consider anything that I could do with a bachelor's degree. Or am I too far behind the curve to even consider something besides what my degree is in?

Thanks everyone for your time.",19Sep2020,1

So I'm that way I can just send it to her and she'll be happy too (I think this is a win-win situation). 

But then self realisation dawned upon me that I'm a fucking nerd who watches DARK and plays Among us and minecraft. Idk a bit about drawing, it's like my right brain doesn't work.

457,"My dad‚Äôs life is heartbreaking. He is a single parent with two kids who are both living in different states for college. My mom left us when I was in my first year of high school, running away to live with family. They both immigrated from Korea and a majority of my mom‚Äôs family came as well, so she has a good support system.

My dad however, has no family members outside of me and my sister that live in the US. He hasn‚Äôt visited Korea since 1999 because it‚Äôs illegal for him to. He‚Äôs forced to work under harsh conditions for little pay, he has very little access to healthcare, and he must be so lonely. Stoicism is common for asian men and my dad is no exception. He tries very hard to hide his pain and it‚Äôs very hard to tell when he‚Äôs happy. He hardly ever smiles or laughs... unless he‚Äôs with our dogs. 

We had two maltese brothers that we got in 2008, the younger was the aggressive smart one (Chadori), and the older is kinda ditzy but very kind (Beethoven). My dad saw them as his own children, he pretty much loves them as much as he loves me and my sister. When he interacts with them he‚Äôs always smiling. 

One day, when my older sister was visiting from college, she noticed that Chadori‚Äôs stomach felt bloated and he was panting a lot. We hadn‚Äôt really noticed because we see him everyday and just assumed it was because of the summer heat. After she went back to college, we found a vet to take him to and he was unsure of what was happening. He said that it‚Äôs probably fine, but warned us to not feed him that much. We followed his advice but a week later we found him dead in the living room after coming home from work together...

My dad was devastated, I had never seen him cry before other than tearing up a bit rarely. It really traumatized him. He hasn‚Äôt been the same since that day, a lot of energy has been drained from his soul. If it weren‚Äôt for Beethoven, I don‚Äôt know what would have happened. He still gets a lot of joy from him but it‚Äôs definitely not the same. Beethoven has recently lost his vision, so a lot of the things he loved to do (like going for walks) have become impossible. Beethoven was just as depressed as my dad was when Chadori died, and we were mentally preparing for him to pass away soon as well. 

It‚Äôs been a little over two years since then, and Beethoven is still surviving at age 13. I still worry everyday about whether or not I‚Äôm ever gonna see him again. I love him so much but I worry more about how my dad will react. It scares me to think that Beethoven might be the only thing giving him purpose or a reason to smile. We‚Äôve been debating getting another dog since Chadori died but there‚Äôs a lot of things holding us back. 

Reasons:
1. My dad works 8-10 hours a day 6 days a week; he has very little time to take care of the dog.
2. He has told us to not get another dog, but he‚Äôs someone who always tells us not to get things for him.      Whenever we try to get him a gift he always denies it until it‚Äôs already purchased (then he appreciates it).
3. He will get his heart broken again in 0-2 years and 10-15 years. 
4. We should probably get him two so they don‚Äôt get lonely. 
5. We should get the dogs before Beethoven dies, but I need to be there to potty train them, etc. (Would a month be enough during winter break?)

What do you guys think about reason #1? Should I let my dad enjoy the last few months/years with Beethoven, have his heart broken, and never have to experience that again? Or do I risk the future for the present. Has anybody experienced anything similar?



TLDR: Dad has a fucked up life, dogs bring him so much joy. One dog died, second dog is going to die soon. He lives alone and all he does is work. When the second dog dies idk what will happen to him. If I get a new dog he won‚Äôt be able to spend too much time with it bc he works so much. What do I do?",19Sep2020,1

463,"I work at a daycare as a call in. I‚Äôm not unfamiliar with ADHD at all, my little brother has it in a mild degree (which is still quite the handful) so I spot it pretty quickly now. I‚Äôm not here to diagnose anyone‚Äôs children but I see how it‚Äôs affected my brother. Low sense of self worth is the biggest thing. I see these kids banging on the table, running around, hurting the other kids, often ‚Äúignoring‚Äù whatever the adults are telling them etc etc and then getting scolded. It breaks my heart a little, even if they don‚Äôt have ADHD, they don‚Äôt do it on purpose, I can tell that much. They don‚Äôt bite to be mean, they just have a hard time expressing their feelings.

I‚Äôm just a call in, so I haven‚Äôt taken an education or anything, I‚Äôm mostly there to change diapers, and play with the babies/kids so the others aren‚Äôt overwhelmed. There was a kid last Friday who could not sit still on his stool for the life of him. He banged on the table loudly, climbed around on the chair, got off it to run away etc. I just held on to his pants and let him scoot around for a while but he began complaining so I just let him get off the chair. He ran around the table once, sat still for 5 minutes while eating, ran around one more time and sat still again. Personally I was like ‚Äúgreat, he‚Äôs fed and happy and the rest of the kids aren‚Äôt affected by it.‚Äù 

Is that the correct approach? I don‚Äôt want to give him special treatment or to seem like I know better than my educated colleagues because I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve seen my brother sob so many times while saying his teachers/friend‚Äôs parents hate him and obviously these kids just can‚Äôt. Sit. Still. For that long. 

I don‚Äôt know??? This is just an example of course. There‚Äôs another boy who‚Äôs a few years older where I‚Äôve decided to just stand in front of him, placing my hands on his shoulders and make sure he‚Äôs looking at me when I talk to him because otherwise I could be screaming at him for 30 minutes and he wouldn‚Äôt hear a single word of it. I don‚Äôt mind taking that extra step.

Another kid was being extremely loud while the rest slept and he was told to sit down and shut up like 5 times before I began chasing him around and tickling him every time I caught him. It took 30 minutes and then he was quiet and on his butt for the rest of the day. 

This is really long now so I‚Äôll shut up. Does my behavior seem fine? I‚Äôd never tell the other adults off, I literally don‚Äôt say anything at all, but I don‚Äôt exactly follow the ‚Äúrules‚Äù.

He became in love with me and he recorded HOURS of videocalling of me without my knowledge and consent. That scares me, because I have a very unique name, and he can easily blackmail me.

We all isolated for first mos, then began outdoor visits.  It‚Äôs hard for toddlers not to touch, sit in lap, and give hugs, but we all managed.  Fast forward to now and we grandparents are still isolating, except for necessary trips - we can work from home.  We visited ‚Äòthe kids‚Äô at their home a few times over summer being very careful - they were still all at home.  Now, the parents are working in schools, toddler is in preschool and we have not visited, except once outdoor. The kids are pissed, thinking we are missing out and being too fearful of Covid.  They don‚Äôt understand and think we do not want to be with them.  This is causing big hurt as it‚Äôs not a choice we would make if it weren‚Äôt a pandemic.  It‚Äôs causing estrangement.

469,"I met this friend just a few months ago through work. For the past few days I‚Äôve been working for her family at a trap shoot competition which she is participating in. In the past she has mentioned that her father is emotionally distant and puts enormous pressure on her to perform well‚Äî she‚Äôs involved with law enforcement training, works at a firehouse, and shoots trap competitively. I have seen this firsthand, with him criticizing her in front of other people and joking about her bad performance with and without her presence, suggesting it‚Äôs because of how much she eats (though she‚Äôs very slim) or that she‚Äôs a slut (worded less bluntly).

Recently we have been talking alone quite a bit, and she has elaborated that when she doesn‚Äôt shoot well, he hits her. Always on the right cheek, so when people see the bruises, she can use the excuse that she mounted the gun wrong. According to her, he has physically ‚Äúfought‚Äù her multiple times, but she can‚Äôt hit him back because he‚Äôs legally handicapped (he walks a cane sometimes). He‚Äôs dared her to make good on her threat to kill herself. He‚Äôs led her to cut herself, though she has since stopped. He‚Äôs threatened juvie, and having worked in one, she says it doesn‚Äôt seem too bad compared to her home life.

She also has a younger brother. Her father treats him much less harshly, but she worries once she moves out her father will take out his anger on him instead. So she feels she has no choice but to stay living with him until her brother is 18, an extra two years.

She says I am the only person she‚Äôs told about this. She has never had any proof of any of it, so getting outside help seems like a terrible idea since there‚Äôs no telling how her dad would react. He refuses to find her a therapist, or see one himself.

Until now I have just listened to her and encouraged her to vent, but I desperately want to help in some other way. She says there‚Äôs nothing I can do or say to make it better, and she‚Äôs probably right, but I figured I‚Äôd see if you people have any ideas.

Thank you all. Hopefully this doesn‚Äôt get fucking auto-removed like in r/relationship_advice .

TL;DR My friend has an abusive father and she has no proof. I want to know if there‚Äôs anything at all I can do to help.",19Sep2020,1
470,"(Warning : LONG post ahead)

Hello! I'm an 18 year old guy living in India. 

My mother has schizophrenia, and its been a mental burden for everyone in my family. Tried to get her treatment, but she wouldn't take the meds. And the times when she did take the meds, she only took them for about 1 month or so, and then stopped taking them giving us the excuse that ""the meds weren't working"".

My father died due to cancer when I was 15, which worsened mom's condition. I also have an elder brother, but he lives in another city due to work. 

I've lived alone with my mom for about 3 years now. Constant hallucinations, delusions, muttering some incoherent nonsense, starting fights for no apparent reason are among the many things I experience on a daily basis. Had to be alert majority of the day to stop her from starting fights with our neighbours because she thought they were 'after' our house. 

But to my surprise, I adapted to this lifestyle. I didn't feel anything when mom had her episodes or when she said some stuff to me. I was also able to handle things when they got out of control. But while this happened in my life, I realized I wasnt able to study. I tried to get down to studying, but at times I just wasn't able to study, and at times when I was really able to study, mom's episodes would start again. I have also been feeling less and less emotions as the years have passed, didn't cry even when my father died. 

I had joined a coaching class for preparing for entrance exams back in 11th and attended it faithfully for 2 years. I tried my best to study whilst I was there, because I knew I couldn't get any stuff done at home. Now the coaching's been closed for 5 months due to the pandemic, and I've gotten rusty. Got an important exam coming up in 3 weeks, trying to study but mom's episodes are still going on. (I'll appreciate if you give me some tips on how I should study in this situation). 

So my main question is this. How do I go forward from this? What steps should I take? I know that it is a VERY broad question, but I'll appreciate if you help me out :D",19Sep2020,1
471, SorrY it may be long. So I am a 19F. Back in May out of nowhere during quarantine I felt very on edge and Uneasy for  about a couple of weeks maybe 2 and I didn‚Äôt know what it was: since I was feeling this way and it was bothering me I was trying to find reasons why it may be this way and how do I stop it. Being a person who has never dealt with a mental issue before I thought That anxiety was not an option like I was overrun with myself with toxic positivity telling myself that no I can‚Äôt be negative I have to put a stop to this what‚Äôs going on I must be doing something wrong and little did I know that I was experiencing anxiety symptoms and all those thoughts that I had were adding to it. Long story short I was experiencing a lot of unwanted thoughts and I remember going on Google and searching can people have unwanted thoughts and The first article I read said yes people have unwanted thoughts but what made me keep going was I thought mine was the worst and I came to find out that that was not the case whatsoever. My thoughts were about death but now the kind you think but the reason why I felt like it was unwanted because I never want to think that way but it felt like it was stuck and it was becoming disrespectful and I just wanted to stop it from bothering me which is why I pin pointed it on being intrusive thoughts. Anyways it became very bad and because of my anxiety everything triggered me I felt like I couldn‚Äôt listen to music I couldn‚Äôt watch TV I couldn‚Äôt hear any word without having 1 million times of thoughts coming through my head causing me distress and I just wanted it to stop anyways so I took it upon myself to come on and research which was the biggest mistake I could‚Äôve ever made because I found that OCD was a anxiety disorder that caused people to be be distressed over thoughts as they think they are some meaning. At first I completely dismissed the idea and said no I don‚Äôt have OCD and I thought it was some other weird thing like I said I‚Äôve never experienced a mental health issue but anyway I begin researching I was just drowning in pain and then I think that manifested into depression and I kept getting angry with myself that it was my fault that I reacted Snd made a thought such a god deal and now I know all theses things I don‚Äôt want to;. long story short anyways I‚Äôve been dealing with a bad depression for about five months now since I feel stuck and I feel like a failure. I feel like I cant figure this big issue for myself because I never had a problem before I didn‚Äôt even know about the different OCD types never knew that existed and it‚Äôs just enough that I don‚Äôt want it now I feel like it‚Äôs my fault I thought I was feeling I down that was part of the case but anyways I really enjoy my life I like my family my friends my school I‚Äôm in the program and I love however I feel I  will never get out of this place I feel like shit I feel like I will never get better I just feel terrible but I put myself through this and I feel too nice long for not making my mental health priority I just feel like a stupid like I just turned 19 like a whole adult and I don‚Äôt feel that way I feel dumb and it pisses me off cus I feel like I fucked myself over and ruined my life,19Sep2020,1
472,"I don't know if this fits here, but I'm desperate. 

He got in about an year ago because of drama and eventual breakup with his ex-boyfriend. Since then his mother put him in a Christian cult. 

The cult's name is ""–ü—Ä–æ–±—É–∂–¥–∞–Ω–µ"" or in English the literal translation would be ""Awakening"" ( I know even the name sounds cultish.) I don't know what to do, how to get him out, especially because his mother is part of the cult and is the one encouraging him. 

We have gotten in arguments about this cult before, but it is today that he finally told me the name of the church (He was refusing to tell me before.) and that I could finally do some research that only confirmed my concerns about this church being a money-hungry cult.

Hi there üá®üá¶. This is a long one. 

A little background, I (M, 23)have been dating ‚ÄúN‚Äù (F, 23) for almost 6 years out from high school. We have an amazing relationship and will get married. N deals with anxiety that is rooted from her childhood. I help her daily and let her know everything is ok in her stressful situation while trying to find the best solution to the anxiety driven problem ie. lost keys, bad noises coming from her car(which is always nothing), basically generalized anxiety. 

I am usually good with helping her but sometimes I get mad as the anxiety is usually based on fear of the unknown which I cannot help with or something very minuscule to me, but not her. I would raise my tone, and sometimes yell in a typical situation when I get mad. 

Yesterday was bad. We were out celebrating our achievement of getting jobs during this pandemic as she will be starting Monday and to our better futures. We rented a hotel room. We had a beautiful day but out comes midnight. We had drinks and I was pretty drunk and we realize her key to ignite(?) her car was gone as it got dislodged from her key fob. We had no way of getting home but had CAA. I recommended we call them in the morning and get a tow for tomorrow as we could not do anything after looking around for an hour, outside and in, to find this key. 

This is where I snapped as I was so angry saying and yelling ‚ÄúOH YOU ARE JUST GOING TO BE SO ANXIOUS AND STUPID‚Äù and words amongst that regard of how pissed off I was, minimizing her.  I started throwing my phone, toothbrush, basically anything I could find out of anger. I was absolutely terrible and could not control myself in that situation, it lasted probably 30 minutes of my freakout. I found a cute small sticky note in my pocket 3 hours prior that she wrote to me a year ago saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and other cute messages. I ripped it up in front of her during my spiralling. 

Alcohol was a big factor in this as it escalated this situation and in the end, her mom miraculously found her backup key(gone for years) and brought it the next day. 

I scared the shit out of her, I did not and will never lay a finger or hurt her physically but, I emotionally fucked her. I have done this before with alcohol and it now scares her when I drink just with her. 95% of the time I am a happy person drinking, when her anxiety is involved it is hard for me to calm down. 

I want help, ways to cope with this as I‚Äôm scared of myself thinking how horrible I was. I do get angry sometimes sober about her anxiety but I spiral when I have alcohol. 

Let me know if you need anymore information. Thank you for reading. 

Tl;dr- Girlfriend has anxiety, we got drunk and I emotionally abused the hell out of her.",19Sep2020,1

476,"Tldr: I have a bad mental relationship with food and weight gain and I need help

Despite my main account being 7 years old, I seriously didn't know which subreddit to ask this to but hopefully this is the right one. I'm sorry if the following will be hard to read. My brain is jumbled right now as I write this and I will clarify as much as i can in the comments when asked.

The current problem is I'm on a diet. It has helped me lose a lot of weight but it's becoming less and less sustainable and I feel hopeless when I break the diet or gain weight.

The background: I'm from an obese family. My mother's side, all with the exception of 3 people are obese and I joined them when I hit 200 pounds at age 10. By age 16 I was 260 and hated myself. I knew I was fat, everyone told me. My mother started yelling at me about it when I was 14 and it never stopped until I moved out at age 19. I understand every argument made for me to lose weight. From a doctors perspective it was best for me to lose weight because diabetes runs in my family and I have joint issues that are worsen by the weight. From my family's perspective, I needed to lose weight to attract a good man and by the fact i was overweight meant I wouldn't be able to find one. It's hard knowing from age 14 and beyond that I was ugly because of the weight. I tried so hard growing up lose it. My mother was also trying to lose weight so whatever diet she was on, I was on. None of them worked. I became so desperate. I remember a handful of times I tried to stop eating and then my friends would inform authority figures and then next thing I know i have to find a way to explain why I didn't eat for 3 days because I was so desperate to not be obese anymore. I internalized all the negativity. 

When I left for college at age 18, I really wanted to find a boyfriendor girlfriend. My only experience dating by that point was dating 2 men my mother had choose for me and not liking either of them.

It's very dejecting to feel like your weight is keeping you from happiness. For the longest time I can remember people complimenting my personality. I've have some of the greatest friends who would talk about how nice of a person I am/was whichconfusedme cause i didn't think I was nice. It eventually led to the conclusion that ""if my personality was good and I can't get a date then physically I was bad"".

 I was 260 pounds at age 19 and then I started dating a guy i met online. He lived out of state and we'd visit each other. I can remember one night when he visited me. I had 3 roommates at the time: a tall busty blonde, a short petite blonde, and athletic built brunette. They were beautiful and he let me know as such when he said the words ""you know, I normally go for girls like your roommates but I like girls like you sometimes too"". I know he thought it was a compliment but it just fueled my insecurities. He and I broke up months after that and then i started extremd dieting again. Trying different methods until ultimately finding keto. I treated it like every other diet at first then I lose 20 pounds and decided to keep up with it. Because of it I lost 100 pounds. 

Now cue to quarantine. I started gaining again. I live with my current boyfriend and as much as i try to follow my diet when we go out to eat, it's depressing for me. He'll ask me where I wanna go and then I have to spend 30 minutes googling menus for keto food and being sad when i see so limited options. 

Actually if I'm being honest I denied myself restaurant food while I was doing keto single because I didn't have to go out so therefore no temptation.

Now my current boyfriend is worried about me. The other day I grabbed a pair of jeans from the back of our closet and put them on and they didn't fit anymore. They were bought at the beginning of quarantine. I started crying and ran to my scale and noticed that somehow I had gained 30 pounds and didn't notice it. I break down in our bathroom and he's trying to calm me. He suggests I get rid of the scale because everytime he's seen me use it, it makes me angry at myself. He starts complimenting me and telling me I'm beautiful but I can't here it and think he's being truthful. He has no reason to lie to me but my brain is going ""no, you're fat. He's lying to make you feel better. It's gonna make you complicit in this and then boom you're a fat bitch again"". We tried talking about it. He says I'm healthy because I'm active (when the gym is open I go 3-4 days a week and i try to hike 4 miles twice a week) and that I don't need to be super skinny. From my perspective, i tell him how I felt when I was bigger, how lesser I felt because of it and how I hated being judged. He says I shouldn't care about what others think but for my whole life I lived to please others, I don't know how to change that. I don't know how to not cry when I crave something bad for me, I don't know how to stop the depression I feel when I give into my cravings.

477,"This sounds really childish but my (F19)  sister (F22) recently left her cat at our house. We were watching him for a week while he went on vacation but she left him there because she doesn't want him anymore. He lived in a 1 bedroom apartment with a toddler, a baby and a large dog and he didn't get much attention. He is a very well behaved cat with no accidents and he doesn't really meow. He just follows you around all day. 

My dad is the one who says he doesn't want the cat because our last cat (he died while he was extremely elderly due to kidney failure) peed everywhere the last year or so of his life. We never had to replace anything, just shampoo 1 room which got the smell out just fine. 

Yes, it is his and my mom's house but we have all the supplies. I work at a pet store so the monthly cost of food/litter is less than $20 which i am paying.

478,"Hi Reddit.

So, I have been at this job for a year and I work closely with my boss. Three months into the job, I spoke to him (really upset) and quit because my manager was horrible.. long story short, he didn't want me to resign and organised a hearing where she was ultimately sacked... she was there for 25 years. 

I like him because of how he dealt with that situation but I notice he doesn't ever say hello, and if I do, he will not respond (mostly). If I enter his room, he stares at his computer, without evening giving me eye contact and a dead reply like 'ok'. But with other people, he's very talkative, laughs and gets personal and although I have learnt to adapt to his moods.. I just don't understand why he's always so off with me. 

I am based at a different site to my team - I am the newest and youngest - and they have known him for years. We have a team e-mail where we all can read it.. they respond to each e-mail as I have my own work to carry (they share the workload between the 3).. so I just get on with the day. Although, I was told he often brings foods to the other team whenever he seems them - I don't want his food, it's the principle... and one of the girls contacted him to say she made an error and apologised, he jokingly wrote back 'no more chocolates for you :)' and that's it.. now, this is bothering me. I noticed he responded to that e-mail when I was in his room, handing him the paperwork that I deeply reviewed and corrected (A LOT of errors) and barely even got a thanks. I came in on my weekend off because one of the other girls cancelled last minute.. didn't even get a thank you.

I don't get this guy. I break my back doing my job and more and he just seems to avoid me and be off with me. I have decided that I will no longer to roles out of my occupation and no longer communicate or make conversation with him. I recall asking how his Christmas was last year and he literally replied with 'good' and stared back at his computer, lol.  

How do I give the cold shoulder to him without seeming that I am? Also, am I in the right to feel like this? I seriously am at my tether - I no longer like being in the same room as him.",19Sep2020,1

So we were initially an original group of 4 wanted to get a 5th person so we went random. We tried communicating with Sam  over the summer which led to no avail. We tried again 3 weeks leading up to school and Sam  actually started responding, but we still knew nothing about her. Fast forward, Sam goes to parties where we‚Äôve voiced our concern and she doesn‚Äôt care. 
We‚Äôve tried being friends with her and Sam says because we have different political views were are ‚Äúracists‚Äù and many other things. Sam also takes food without asking and uses a ton without giving any back. 
We take trips to the store and when we do go Sam refuses to buy any food shes eaten or even give any money towards it. Instead sam prefers to spend it on other things like weed or alcohol. Because we‚Äôve tried being friends the one of us who is of legal age buys whatever Sam wants. Of course Sam pays back then but Sam even gets an attitude when we get back to the house and goes upstairs refusing to even help put away her own things. 
I‚Äôve noticed Sam holds her phone weirdly. Like when Sam text‚Äôs she doesn‚Äôt hold her phone directly in front of her she turns her phone towards someone as if she‚Äôs recording. Sam tries to make us admit we buy her stuff or anything else that could get us in trouble with conduct. Sam always claims she has lots of RA friends like good for you but why do you keep telling us? 
Our college tried locking down before shutting down completely where we aren‚Äôt supposed to have people over. Of course it‚Äôs fine if she goes out and party. But suddenly it‚Äôs wrong for us to have a friend over for a movie or dinner. Three nights ago, we had a friend over for dinner and after the friend was done she relaxed a bit on the couch before heading home. Sam comes home from god knows where and sits down. Sam is obviously under the influence and admitted it. Sam later takes her phone out and starts aiming her phone towards the friend. The friend noticed, and tries to cover herself up because that‚Äôs just weird! It kept happening many times of a course of 10 mins. 
After a while Sam got tired and went to ‚Äúbed.‚Äù The friend left uncomfortably, I felt bad for her. 
One of my mates went to the bathroom where she ran into Sam. Sam told her that she has blackmail on us. To which she replied who? And Sam said all of us. 
I‚Äôm at a lost what to do. Of all things that‚Äôs happened this current semester I wouldn‚Äôt doubt she has blackmail.

484,"This is a lengthy story, but I‚Äôm just going to include the juicy bits. 

So anyway, as the title says I (27/F) currently live with my BF (28/M) and his mom. We moved in here with the hopes of saving up some money so he could take over the mortgage (when it was due for renewal) and so that she could find her own place. 

I moved in under the guise that she would only be here for a few months (to help us save) - which I was totally cool with. However, now we‚Äôve been living with her for close to a year and she decided that she doesn‚Äôt want to move out until May, so it seems there is still no end in sight. 

I am a full-time student so the finances are tight, and my BF doesn‚Äôt think we can afford the mortgage and bills and whatnot without her help - which I do agree with. We can afford them, but we would be extremely broke, which neither of us want. 

The problem is, however, that MIL has been getting under my skin so badly that I have actually contemplated moving out and finding my own place. She constantly nags, she is always home, she has little comments for everything, she tries to tell me how to do things, and she has zero boundaries, we have to include her in everything we do it seems - she is just always here. I feel like a guest in the place that is supposed to be MY (+BF‚Äôs) home. I‚Äôm getting to the point where I almost hate this woman, which honestly, I don‚Äôt want. But, at the same time, this is getting to be unbearable and I am miserable 24/7. 

BF has tried talking to her about these things, but she always takes them personally/to heart. OR she‚Äôll change her behaviours for a day or two and then go back to being extremely abrasive and just always around. 

I feel like there is no solution because she doesn‚Äôt want to move out until May. I feel literally trapped here because I can‚Äôt afford any other option, but also, my happiness is slowly fading away. I can literally feel how I am becoming more and more frustrated and annoyed with her everyday. And I don‚Äôt want it to get to the point that it boils over and I ruin the relationship I have with her. Also, I don‚Äôt feel like I would have agreed to moving in here had I known it was going to be a whole year - it was only supposed to be a few months. 

It feels like there‚Äôs is no happy medium, but alas, I am here. Is there a way to find a happy medium? Or do I just have to suck it up until she moves out? I truly feel stuck between a rock and a hard place. But sacrificing my own happiness is not something I want to do anymore. Are there any other alternatives?",19Sep2020,1

490,"One of my best friends father thinks I call him an alcoholic.  


I know this guy since 6 years, but he has no friends other than me and my other friend. We spend our time on discord all the time playing games and go outside and do stuff.  In the last 3 months I just felt bad for him, because he has some complications in finding new friends, and I am his only friend. I really want to distance myself from him, because I know it's destroying me mentally, and getting me depressed. I don't know what to do.  


Yesterday we were talking about electric cars, covid, etc. and his father listened along. This was over video chat. His father just kept on going about conspiracy theories like bill gates and that it's all fake and electric cars are trash etc. He's not really kind. He usually hangs out at the gas station with other people. I told to my friend to tell him that it's easy to shove problems away. He then asked his father from where he knows this stuff, and then he replied with ""From the people at the gas station"".  
I replied with ""oh, obviously, thought so.""

He got mad and told him to shut off the phone.  
Today he got on discord and we played some games. I asked him about the situation yesterday. (Note, I have no way of contact with his dad)  
He then said that his dad thinks I called him an alcoholic.  
This is the point where I just really got mad.

492,"TL;DR: There's a girl in my group who is making it her mission to push me out of the group, so she can be the only girl and get all the attention. I'm a quiet, non-confident person that doesn't know how to stand up for myself and need advice on how to handle people like her.

Awhile ago, my boyfriend invited me to join his friend group online since we all have the same humor and play the same games, and we've all been good friends for some time now. One of the members invited this random girl he met online to join our group recently, and ever since she found out I was also a girl, she's been making it her sole mission to take over the group and push me out. I don't mind other girls joining. I actually welcome it and would love to have another girl friend who can play games with me like my sister does. But I don't think this girl likes that I'm there. It's not just the fact that I'm another girl in the group, I think she just doesn't like it when they all actually converse with me and invite me to games instead of her. Any time I say anything, she has to talk over me. Or if someone else talks to me, she has to talk over them so that the conversation is geared towards her. Whenever I send pics of random things or share something from Reddit, she will spam the chat with stuff about herself and try to one-up me. She won't play anything they play unless I'm invited to it, and then she'll eventually try to get them to play what she wants. I actually didn't realize this was happening until they all mentioned this to me. I don't think that highly of myself, so I was a bit oblivious. I mean, I had a feeling, but now that they themselves notice it and pointed it out, I'm more aware of what she's really doing. They all think it's ridiculous, but nobody will call her out on it. My friends aren't really the confrontational type and neither am I, but she's basically become this leech and injects herself to anything I'm involved in. And it's starting to ruin my fun when I hang out with my friends because I'm just constantly being talked over and socially stomped on. I'm just naturally quiet, and I've always been the ghost girl or invisible girl in my classes or anywhere in general because I like to stay in the background. So when it comes to these kinds of situations, I just feel a little bit overwhelmed and will mentally shut down. When this happens, I wont really talk and will want to be on my own because I already have social anxiety. I know my friends think she's obnoxious, but they're the kind of people that will still invite you over and talk to you no matter how shitty you are because they're just genuinely kind. I've mentioned this to my boyfriend, and he absolutely agrees that she's obnoxious and understands. He has said the others are aware too, but I just feel alone and left out because my friends are very social, so of course, they will engage in conversations with her because she pretty much takes over every conversation. It doesnt bother me they're talking to her. It's really her trying to drown me out that bothers me, and I feel uncomfortable talking to them about it because I don't want to make it all about me, and I also don't want it to come off as ""pick her or me."" I know they won't kick her out, so I want some advice on how to fight back I guess? I'm tired of being walked on like a mat. These are my only friends because I have a hard time putting myself out there, so I feel very protective of them and don't want this girl to try and push me out.",19Sep2020,1

495,"Just a bit of background and on mobile. My boyfriend is an addict. He's built a debt of nearly $6000 with me over the past year. All from heroin, suboxone, gabapentin. We've been living with my grandparents so he has nothing but a phone bill. I still have credit card, student loans, car payments, etc. I still have my job, he does not (covid). These have been by far the 2 most stressful years of my life, and I'm only 27. Dealing with him as an alcoholic for a year was awful. Now after dealing with this addiction, I can't tell which I'd rather prefer.

I've always had problems with control, I know this. I'm a perfectionist and I think that my way of doing things is better most of the time. I accept that and it's one of the many bad parts of me I try to work on, but holy hell does this make it hard. I can't make any progress because he is literally ALWAYS lying about this shit. It's this constant tug and pull between him lying, me trying to help but being too controlling about it, us apologizing, me releasing control, and then him coming back 2 weeks later to tell me all the little white lies he's gotten caught up in. It's lie after lie and I can't trust him. I question everything which makes me look like an asshole.

He says I gaslight him, which I know 1000% I do not do. He on the other hand gaslights me all the time when it comes to this. I'll call him out on something and then he just says no you're being an asshole stop it whatever, and then 2 weeks later it comes out that he was lying and I was right.

He says I'm condescending. I don't always see it, but I'm trying to acknowledge it and work on it. Maybe I am sometimes when I get caught up in a moment where I'm trying to figure out if he's lying.

He says I just got mad when he tries to talk to me. Not true. I get mad because he doesn't try to talk to me about he's feeling, he comes to me when he needs money, or when he needs me to drive him somewhere. If he comes to me to talk about his feelings, or if he actually fesses up to his lies, I'm much more understanding and I don't get mad. Then he says I'm understanding one day then the next day I'm totally not. Yea maybe that's true, but that's because he just comes back right away asking for more.

I've set boundaries and told him no more money, no more ubers, no more me driving around, but he always comes back and crosses those and I give in because I dont have a choice.

I snoop. Yes. Bad. I know. I have a problem with living in the unknown. I like, need to know if he's using behind my back and when he is. I caught him flirting with his ex for a year which also makes me not trust him so I snoop because of that, but very rarely because that trust is KIND of back.

but isn't being truly in love and trusting your partner and being with them as sacred as marriage? doesn't it require the same honesty and loyatly as a marriage? it just baffles me the way he ends up putting the blame on me for questioning dishonesty. but i stayed for 4 years in this, with all the lies. i know a relationship is important even without marriage, and i gave it my all. but now i wonder, when coming from a place where sleeping without being married is not allowed and is frowned upon, doesn't it take more out of a woman to do it without the secure feeling, than doing it after marriage?",19Sep2020,1
498,"Firstly, I don't believe that Excellence = Perfection. You can be excellent and still make mistakes and be imperfect. Secondly, knowing that I will never hit that highest grade, no matter how hard I try and how much effort I put in, really hurts my motivation -- I will always be artificially lumped into the ""good"" category. I want to strive for excellence and really push my self, but because my Boss refuses to give people that rating, I just can't, not because I'm not capable of it, but because I'm not allowed to.

I also did some research and found that some companies are often required to reward employees if they get that highest rating,  or get the highest rating the required amount of times (Raises, bonuses, promotions, etc). I'm unsure if that is the case for the company I work at, but if it is, then I think that goes without saying that what my boss is doing is extremely immoral.

503,"I‚Äôm (24F) so upset at myself for being so caught up in him (20M). I‚Äôm not used to this and I feel outright silly.

We were starting to get to know each other. I meet countless guys through my hobbies and career, but the vibe with him was something I‚Äôve never experienced with someone before. We‚Äôve both expressed this, and he said he couldn‚Äôt wait to get to know me more. Despite my vow to myself to remain single for a while, I was ready to let my walls down for him and give it a chance.

Then he ghosted me only an hour after sending me a playful message.

I reached out to ask what happened, and he told me he doesn‚Äôt know what he wants, he doesn‚Äôt want to do me dirty, and we should forget about everything that happened between us.

I told him I understand and asked if we could still be cool and link up for our hobbies, which he said okay to, but he doesn‚Äôt want to be friends. 

The next couple of days I actually cried. :/ I‚Äôm the kind of person who‚Äôs thrilled by opportunities and possibilities, so I was in a daze to see where it would go. I already felt comfortable with him and wanted at least a friendship with him, especially since we found out we‚Äôre both studying a particular language and have been dying to visit the country. 

Now it‚Äôs difficult shaking off what could have been, and it‚Äôs frustrating because I‚Äôm used to reasoning myself out of irrationalities but can‚Äôt now. I‚Äôve thought about how he could easily be a liar, a soothsayer, etc. to override the hope, but my hopeless romantic mindset is taking over.

505,"In US terms, I'm a senior in high school. I'm not a US citizen. I'm planning on applying for MIT. The application asks for my gender identity and pronouns.

If they find out I'm gay, I'm 99.99% sure that they won't pay for my education, let alone an expensive foreign institute.

My dreams and the reason for choosing a foreign institute are influenced by the acceptance I'll get from the people over there. I want to write this under the section of what I want to do in life and why I'm choosing MIT, etc. If I manage to make my parents overlook that LGBTQ+ part of my application and send it in, will it come back to bite me in the ass? Will that information be confidential or will my parents be able to access it? I would love to go to a foreign institute because of all the better life prospects. My parents are willing to pay as long as it's a prestigious university but they won't if they find out I'm gay.

I'm really scared and confused about this situation. If I lie and say I'm cishet, I would be hiding a part of me and it would affect how I can truly express myself in the application. Also, colleges look for diversity, if I say I'm cishet, will I lose that advantage?

506,"So here we go. I (m,16) recently played a Ren'ai adventure which is about a relationship with an extremly introverted girl. I enjoyed it very much and was really into the story and the fact that you had the ability to make limited decisions on how the plot evolved really gave the feeling to be part of it, instead of just reading an other person's story. 

This turned out to be a problem for me though, as it lead to me developing feelings for the girl. I often enough couldn't even get her out of my mind. A few days after I finished the game, I finally managed to get it under control by constantly reminding myself that she is fictional. The following weeks, I  had a few relapses and thought about wether or not a real person like her could exist, but otherwise I lead a normal live again. 

Today though, I decided to start the game again, as I am currently learning Japanese and wanted to see how much I would understand if I played it on this language and suddenly, everything returned. I am positive that will manage to get rid of the feelings again but I am quite anxious about how something like this will effect my future life and am scared to talk with the people I know about this topic, so does anybody have any advice for me on how to deal with the subject?

509," I(F21) haven't lived with my mom since I was 16, she moved to another state for work and we have had sparse conversations while I live with my dad, who I haven't had the closest relationship with but we're working on it.

Recently, because of a little Worldwide Event, and because of relationship problems, being harrassed and doxxed by an ex, my girlfriend passing away, and a whole lot of mental health issues that I never got help for as a kid, I am having debilitating anxiety attacks that last for the past months and depression. I've lost 20 pounds in the last few months because I developed an eating disorder over my body imagery and dysphoria, abusing dietary pulls, and it didn't help that my anxiety makes it near impossible to even swallow water when I'm in an episode. I broke down to my dad finally yesterday, asking for help to see a therapist and possibly getting medication to help. I guess he told her because later that day she called me saying she was worried about me.

She proceeded to tell me how my father was ""spewing so much nonsense about you I think he is making up how you're suicidal because I think he wants me back and that he and his girlfriend had a big fight.""

I asked right there ""please don't involve me in this, my anxiety is really really bad and this doesn't involve me and this will make my episode worse.""

I tried to open up about my anxiety to her, that I am deeply fragile with how my life is right now, and how knowing intimate drama between them will make it worse and what I was going through, and she told me ""Just get over it. Just Don't be anxious, just don't be.""  
She told me she didn't want to make it worse and promised to not tell me. We proceeded not even 3 minutes into a new conversation, in which I was asking about her work (she works as an ER nurse) and then she started to say ""your dad is telling me a lot of nonsense stuff about you-""  
I stopped her ""Mom, I asked about work.""  
""I know, and so I'm telling you."" she was not.  
She waited for the moment my guard was down to force down how my dad is making up information about how I'm suicidal because he wants her back and said a super smug cheerfully tone ""your daddy loves your mommy and there is nothing you can do about it.""

I started to cry on call, shaking and telling her ""I told you not to tell me this, I need to go I'll talk tomorrow"" and she had no remorse in her ""Mmn yeah"" ""okayyy"" they sounded like in that tone when someone is in on a joke and is teasing as if they aren't up to no good. Like she was so smug happy to manage to get her words in that she is just enjoying the prize of having the last word.

Guys, I feel so violated. She told me she cares for me but despite me asking her not to tell me something she got sneaky with it and shoved it in my face, rubbing it in almost like this was middles school petty drama. She refuses to acknowledge the fact I am severely flawed and not mentally well and thinks that by acting through this and ignoring the problem, like the last time I was in therapy or when she tried to force her racist boyfriend to be present at a family gathering like he didn't just shout racist slurs earlier at me, that we can just be a happy family and nothing bad had happened. I don't feel like she's treating me like an adult or that my feelings truly matter to her and I want to tell her that. I don't feel like I'm talking to my mom but rather a Snoddy middle schooler.

I know she's going through a lot with being in another state in which she is so family orientated, being an ER nurse during covid, is broken from being separated from our big family, and just got out of a four-year abusive relationship that purposely tried to isolate her from me and my family. I feel guilty to make things worse for her but she is talking about coming back to the state ( a state in which all the hospitals in the state wont take her) and I know see won't attempt to adjust to how much of a person I've changed into since I was 16.

I don't know how to approach this. I want to put my foot down, tell her I don't want to talk to her until she apologized and acknlowedged my mental health and treated me like an adult and as well family. But I'm terrified if I would be the asshole if I did that, she was already isolated for a long time by her ex  from us, is living in another state, and i've been told time and time again by everyone that I am the only thing in her life that matters the most but i need her to know that her actions have consequences and that my mental health isn't something to scoff and roll your eyes at.",19Sep2020,1

518,"Hi,

I am torn about work at the moment.

I cannot decide what job to take. I work in before and after school care with children. This isn't my career goal, I am still in university. It is the same position at two different places. Here is my dilemma:

Place A - Pays $2-3 more per hour, don't enjoy being there as much as I don't feel close with my colleagues (have only started working here during the summer, it's really only been 1.5 months)

Place B - Pays less, love my coworkers, sense of comfort, more physical space (aka more space to spread out because COVID), I feel inspired to be better there

Granted, it is the same position at both places. I'm just torn on what to do. When I do the math, the higher paying job rewards me with \~$130 more per week, which equates to about $600 more per month. I'm a college student so yes money is important and I should start saving, but I've been at Place B for so long that I think a part of me is scared to leave?

Not an option to ask for a raise at Place B. The $600/month between the two jobs is quite a difference though.

I mention a sense of comfort at Place B - like I genuinely love all of my coworkers there and can trust them, whereas I do not trust the team at Place A at all. I feel like I'll be a bit more stressed at Place A, but I guess the extra stress can be compensated with the higher pay? I'm not sure. Maybe I just need to give Place A more time? Only been working there the past two months, in comparison to Place B where I've worked for 3 years.

Now with COVID and me panicking about the future in general in post-grad life, who knows? Should I go for the money? My parents are immigrants and I'm worried for them too, financially.

Basically, my head says to go work at Place A, whereas my heart says Place B. Any tips on what to do? Do I do it for the money or overall good time? Hard to decide.",19Sep2020,1

So yesterday evening one of my closest friends texted me. We don't usually text a lot, and she had sent me an unusually long text. Turns out her mom tested positive for Coronavirus. I was really worried for her, especially because she had two younger siblings.

This evening our school sent an email stating that there had been two infected students in our school, and that the school would convert to online lessons.

The school mentioned the grades of the students who were infected, and one of them was in our grade. The school also said the student in our grade who was infected wasn't in school last week (my friend wasn't in school last week). 

I've never been good at social interactions or relationships and I'm wondering if I should try to help her or just stay still. I don't even know how I can help her, but she's one of my best friends and I really want to. 

She's seen the reply I sent to her text yesterday evening but hasn't responded. She was online a bit ago, though.

Should I try to text her at all? If so, what do I say? Are there any other ways I could support her?

551," This is not an incident, its just that I have two opinions and not being able to decide.

So here it goes,

I(16m) live in India with my grandfather(80), grandmother(73), father(50), my mother(45), my elder sister(25) who is married and currently staying with us, my twin(16m).

My dad is a pure narcissist and a helicopter parent. He is so controlling and abusive and very manipulative. He forces me into doing anything he wants and doesn't let me do what I like. He forced me into a college whose timings are 10 hours every day (not referring to online classes) and the college lecturers only pay attention to the ""toppers"" and don't give a shit about other students. I wanted to pursue a career in cricket, he said, "" You can't be successful in cricket because you don't have it in you to succeed. So shut up and do as I say and you must sacrifice this dream of becoming a cricketer."" Ironically he never saw me play and just assumed it.

We are a middle-class family and we have quite a few monetary problems and this lockdown made it more difficult. So he says us that we have to study hard and get good ranks in entrance exams so that the college fees can be reduced, I know this is true and am studying for it. But he over-emphasizes the part of 'fees being reduced' and always keep saying that he doesn't have money and can't help if we (my brother and I) don't get a good rank. He keeps yelling at us saying that we don't study and all we do is pass the time. It is entirely false, I study 7 ¬Ω hours a day and its his mistake he doesn't check on us. IF I say that to him, he will yell and somehow make it my mistake. Few days ago he yelled so bad at me that I started crying (mind you I don't cry easily, so imagine how badly he yelled at me) after that I felt so bad that I wanted to run away from my home. I was never diagnosed but I believe I was in depression since I joined the college.

Now comes the second opinion, my grandfather treated my dad like a piece of shit and basically called him he has no rights (this was back in the '80s) and he still treats my dad badly. So many years of this behavior of my grandfather made him behave how he does to me (I believe) and he's constantly stressed out over the lack of money.

 Some backstory: She‚Äôs marrying someone who I‚Äôve been relatively close to my entire life. Up until Sophomore when we kind of went our separate ways. He was always semi-popular because he was on the football team and I was that weird/fat/ goth girl with a group of other misfit friends. But he was always incredibly nice to me. His other friends weren‚Äôt. They literally made my life a living hell from 4th grade until we graduated.

I can acknowledge and mostly ignore the bullying because I know it doesn‚Äôt come from a place of logic and reason. When it comes to the third type of situation, where I‚Äôve somehow screwed up in a social situation and only realized it later, I can attribute that to my natural awkwardness and, being detached from the situation, figure out how to improve next time. The second situation is what bothers me. I‚Äôve had adults and peers say that I‚Äôm not very good at social situations, that I‚Äôm too quiet, even random stuff, like ‚Äúwe both know we‚Äôre not the kind of people who get asked out on dates‚Äù (my friend).

574,"Heyo (sorry this is long since I can‚Äôt summarize for the life of me)

So for some context I work a fairly generic minimum wage job at a convenience store.

I‚Äôve been there for about 3 months and I am currently 18 (turning 19 in a little over a month).

When I first started it was alright, it got me out of the house and also gave me some spare change to buy stuff with/save. It also helped with my self worth issues because it gave me a place where I could feel ‚Äúneeded‚Äù if that makes sense.

As of late though I‚Äôve been wanting to quit (as you‚Äôve probably guessed). I found myself being signed up for more hours then I wanted (aka I was working full time) and it left me with no motivation or time for what I really care about (my art and music).

Originally I wanted to quit, send in the two weeks notice, you get the point, but my mom said no, so we compromised to where I will only work there 2-3 days a week.

I told my boss to only schedule me for 3 days max and was hoping to add in another week or two to schedule me to only work day shifts.

This only worked for 1 week until a whole bunch of people left (including one person just this morning) and now we only have 5 people (when I started we had 12 employees as our store is open 24/7) so now I am scheduled for full time all over again.

My boss hasn‚Äôt hired anyone new and even when he does I know this also won‚Äôt be this the last time we are this understaffed.

I am starting to see a lot more disadvantages to working now than advantages. 

I have almost 12k saved up so I don‚Äôt really *need* the money, even though none of my family members are at risk of serious complications I am still at risk of getting covid from my job (from customers who fail to see employees as people), I am seriously thinking I have high functioning autism and this lack of a proper schedule is stressing me out (also I haven‚Äôt had time to get therapy because of my job schedule), I keep on being put on overnight shifts by myself where most of the customers are male (and I am a thin, some what attractive female), I‚Äôm not allowed to sit which sucks since I have s-curve scoliosis of ~30 degrees each.

I asked my mom if I could quit again last night but she still said I can if I get the other job I applied to (as Physical Therapist Aide) but I am tempted to quit regardless of if I get the job.

I feel it is unfair my mom is making me work at a job I am clearly unhappy at, I have enough money saved up to contribute to the finances, she just quit her job (because of her back), and neither of my brothers work (20 &amp;amp;amp;amp; 16 (going on 17)). 

She keeps on making the argument that a job is good since it gives me something to do, but I am trying to tell her that it is draining all my energy to work on my art and music (as I have chosen to self study instead of attending college for art (as it‚Äôs so absurdly expensive) this is something that is really important to me. I was doing good for a month or two there when I first started my job (as I was pretty depressed before) but I feel like I‚Äôm falling apart again mentally.

575,"A noose was found at work.

So I work at oil site in Canada and a noose was found in one of the buildings where there‚Äôs a lot of foot traffic.

576,"I \[21F\] have been seeking counseling through my college to address the anxiety I have experienced on and off for the past 6 years (and has gotten worse since COVID started), and while the coping strategies the counselor has recommended have helped some, they aren't enough to overcome the overwhelming thoughts (including suicidal thoughts) that enter my mind on a daily basis.

I've had trouble maintaining friendships with people (especially same-age peers - for some reason I've always been a lot better at maintaining friendships with people much older than me than people near my age) my entire life, in part due to the social differences associated with me being autistic. I've never been able to make more than a few friends at a time (and didn't really have any close friends for most of K-12), and I've lost count of the number of times I've tried to reach out to people I considered friends, only for them to not reciprocate, and for it to become a one-way friendship that eventually just slips away (I know it's typical for this to happen with most people, but I haven't had a single friend this hasn't happened to). I've heard multiple alumni of my school mention how difficult it is to make friends after graduation due to the lack of structure provided by K-12 and college, and while I know there are ways to make friends after college (that I plan to utilize), I am so worried I'll end up being alone for the rest of my life because people don't care enough about me to be my friend (despite my efforts to reach out and try to find friends).

This struggle to maintain friendships makes it very difficult to talk with friends about the issues I am experiencing due to a fear of scaring them away with my problems. Consequently, I end up talking with my parents about the more negative aspects of my life... which wouldn't be an issue, except for the fact that my relationship with my parents has deteriorated significantly since the pandemic started. My mom has anger issues associated with a dysfunctional childhood, and this has resulted in her scolding and/or yelling at me on a nearly daily basis for minor mistakes when I am home with her (she yells at my dad very regularly also). Unfortunately, this tends to result in me feeling horrible about myself for making my mom yell at me yet again rather than me feeling motivated to change my behavior. Consequently, I have to walk on eggshells around her, and it has gotten bad enough that I don't even feel comfortable calling or FaceTiming my parents (I'm away at college currently) out of fear that she will find a reason to yell at me. Being away at college has given a nice respite from the yelling, though I am nervous about having to return to my parents' house once the semester ends.

All of this combined with the crazy pandemic, political, and climate change situation has made me feel utterly terrible and worthless as a person, and I've often wondered if it's even worth carrying on considering what will likely be waiting for me during the years ahead. Consequently, I now have a plan to commit suicide a couple of months from now (which I probably won't follow through with due to a lack of courage), and am too scared to tell anyone about this out of fear of being sent to an in-patient facility. I've heard nightmare stories about in-patient/medical facility experiences for people with suicidal thoughts and about the hefty medical bills associated with them (really not interested in burdening my parents financially when I already feel like a burden to everyone I care about). If I did tell anyone, I would tell my counselor, but I'm too nervous to tell her or anyone for this reason, but I'm worried I'll end up following through with my suicide plan if I don't.

Have any of you experienced these thoughts? What would you recommend I do to address them (without putting myself in a nightmare situation that I regret)? I've thought about calling the suicide hotline number -- would they put me in a in-patient facility or other situation I would regret?",19Sep2020,1

581,"Hello hello everyone.

I am a junior in high school. Ever science elementary school, I was what most people would consider a smart kid. School always came easily to me, I always did well on standardized tests, and I was always sorted into those ‚ÄúGiFtEd ChIlDeReN‚Äù programs. This all really went to my head, and for a long time I developed this mentality that I was just a mega-genius destined to go to Stanford or something and become some NASA engineer/MIT research professor/multimillionaire lightsaber manufacturer or some shit as an adult. I have been laughably serious about these expectations for a long ass time, and I haven‚Äôt really started coming to grips with reality until recently. I‚Äôve even been reading stories about the kind of engineers who get into Stanford engineering, and how they have been committed to science and technology and shit since they were a kid. Meanwhile, I just dropped out of AP chemistry since it couldn‚Äôt handle the workload. 

I‚Äôm not saying that anyone who doesn‚Äôt reach this level isn‚Äôt smart. I mean, I‚Äôm still interested in math and science (to the point where I‚Äôm really really bummed that I had to drop that class), and I‚Äôm sure I could still become an engineer or scientist of some sort. But whenever I consider that, that stupid expectation of myself I‚Äôve had forever starts bugging me. I keep feeling like I should have been doing science shit since I was 7, and that since I haven‚Äôt I won‚Äôt be working at the highest level and nothing I do will have any meaning. I feel like I‚Äôll just become some industrial drone who will just get promoted to management, and I‚Äôll spend my whole life being jealous of researchers and shit. Even when I start looking down other career avenues, I feel like I‚Äôll be quitting on the dreams of my younger self, even though I literally never had the will to start making those happen. Like even right now as I‚Äôm typing this, I can‚Äôt stop kicking myself over AP chemistry, cause I‚Äôm just imagining this imaginary pathway where I could have taken AP CHEM, and the aced it, and fallen in love with chemistry, and done super amazing things with it. 

TLDR: I‚Äôm mad at myself for not living up to this idealized standard of what I think I ‚Äúcould‚Äù be, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it.

when puberty hit, i finally came to the realization that my father is so very toxic for me and he is worsening every aspect of my life. i decided to ‚Äúcut him off‚Äù - but because i never opened up to anyone including my mom about this issue by then, i didn‚Äôt have an alternative but to be in his house, as much, no change, along with the long drives all the way there and the pressure it out on me - so i just stopped talking to him. no talking about friends, school, mom... i didn‚Äôt say a word to him, and that got me okay for a good couple of years.

588,"I have a friend who I have been quite close to for the past 5 years. We hang out often and text each other in group chats almost daily. Previous to that, we shared the same ‚Äúcircle‚Äù of friends so I would see her quite often during group hangouts and such. 

Anyways for the past two years or so, the way I view her has dramatically changed. I first started to notice how much she gossiped and talked about strangers. We could be at a bar and a girl would walk by and she would suddenly blurt out ‚ÄúDamn. She looks like a MESS.‚Äù She would do this often and it would stay in my head. I‚Äôm naturally sensitive and empathetic, so this ended up bothering me a TON. At one point, I did confront her about it and told her how much that bothered me. She apologized and told me she didn‚Äôt know how much it hurt me and that she would work on not doing that anymore. 

Fast forward to this year and I am now noticing her passive aggressive comments to me. I regrettably opened up to her about my family issues that were very personal and sensitive to me. I thought venting would help myself but she basically responded saying, ‚ÄúWow you‚Äôre family is so toxic. Mine would never do that.‚Äù And now whenever family gets brought up amongst our friends, she always makes sure to say ‚ÄúDid you know Sara‚Äôs (name changed) family is so toxic?‚Äù 

It‚Äôs come to the point where I‚Äôm perceiving the most small responses as judgy. For example, yesterday I made a joke asking ‚ÄúWhy does the bank charge me for transferring my savings to my checking? It‚Äôs my money and I‚Äôm poor!‚Äù She then responded in, ‚ÄúDamn lol. How much are you possibly transferring for them to charge you?‚Äù I know that can be perceived as a genuine question. But I think now I‚Äôm holding onto past resentment and it‚Äôs affecting how I perceive everything she does now.

He has told me about this girl. While we were dating she would constantly hit him up asking to hangout. one time she drove an hour to his house just to talk to him. He told her she was in a relationship with me. And he blocks her on snap. when he went back to college she started texting him about hanging out. and he told her to stop texting him.

I asked him if they had consensual sex putting my feelings aside because i know this is serious.

I‚Äôm struggling to keep lean, I have disordered eating, if I feel like I‚Äôm not in a calorie deficit, I‚Äôll enter an anxiety attack at the end of which I will end up bingeing, and the days after that, I will starve myself to ‚Äúmake up‚Äù for it. it is emotionally and mentally destructive and my mind goes to very dark places. 

Lately, I have tried to combat this, I have set a calorie limit of 1,200 - I usually eat up to that limit or slightly below it.

Today however, I was outside all day, I have only drank a glass of milk (160 cal) and i am on my period. i have this urge to eat and i am exhausted, i want to order takeout (rarely do so) but i can no longer tell if this is emotional hunger or physical hunger. there is hardly any food in the fridge. I‚Äôm scared if I do order take out i will spiral and have an anxiety attack afterwards.

598,"I‚Äôm not sure how long this is going to be, and I will try to make it all make sense. I should probably add, this is my first time posting anything anywhere on reddit. I don‚Äôt know if this belongs somewhere else. The parenting threads seem to be all the sunshine and lollipop posts and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin their day. 
Not a throw away because ehhh I don‚Äôt really care. 

My ex husband, and father of one of my daughters has recently purchased the American girl book on puberty. He has had our daughter read it when he sees her on his evening day during the week. She has come home with a lot of questions and I answer them as best as I can without knowing fully what she has read. I sent ex an email asking what the book was, and if he would be willing to share it so that I knew exactly what she has read. He sent me pictures but refused to let me actually see the book. In the pictures I saw that the period chapters were coming up, so I asked if he was willing to leave that conversation to me. I told him I felt like there were things that needed to come first (basic female anatomy) and I let him know that has been in the works on my end. He said the conversation would be left to me, so I responded trying to verify that he would be skipping those chapters for now. He never responded. 
So I had a discussion with my daughter about how some of the stuff she will read might seem scary, or confusing. I told her not to let it get to her too badly and that I am here for her. I told her I will always answer her questions to the best of my ability and in an age appropriate way. 

So here we are, my daughter is spending the weekend with her father, and she just called to ask me about tampons. She said she was ‚Äúafraid‚Äù because she thinks they go up her ‚Äúpee hole.‚Äù Let‚Äôs cover this again, she‚Äôs 8 years old. 
I reminded her about the conversation we had about how some of the stuff she reads in the book may be scary, and I told her don‚Äôt be scared. I told her not to worry, that I would be teaching her everything she needs to know before she needs to know it, and that it‚Äôs ok for her to just focus on being a kid right now. She seemed a lot more relaxed after that. 

I have a hard time thinking that ex considers this in her best interest, and think more so that it‚Äôs his way of taking something away from me. Long story short, we‚Äôve been through some SHEET and he‚Äôs adamant about being in control of anything he can possibly be in control of so it‚Äôs definitely hitting me on a personal level. 

Am I wrong for thinking this concept and discussion should be introduced by someone with a vagina... more specifically - me - her mother? 

As far as the anatomy discussion goes, I have been waiting on some of our homeschool curriculum (which includes the science units about anatomy and puberty, etc.) from the printing place. They‚Äôre super backed up because of Covid, so that‚Äôs why that has not been approached yet. It‚Äôs not because I haven‚Äôt wanted to, it‚Äôs because I wanted all the tools first. I will also add, I had all of that on order before he started having her read the book. 

So I guess I would like advice on how to proceed. Part of me thinks that I should gather whatever age appropriate visual aids I can from the internet and start the discussion with my daughter. There‚Äôs another part of me that is ok still putting it off until we have the curriculum just to make sure important pieces aren‚Äôt left out.  

Has anyone dealt with their kids being introduced to these subjects at such a young age, or ‚Äúout of order‚Äù if you will? If so, how did you handle it?",19Sep2020,1

My parents are gradually being okay but my brothers, who I think are being manipulative, threatens my parents that they would leave if I don't end this relationship. Reason is mainly the religion they belong to. This leaves my parents super stressed and crying - a thing my partner and I cannot handle anymore since they are getting old.

Dad, I'll end up in the pussy (In the sense that I can't do anything and I'll be happy if I have a place to live)  as the biggest poor thing. I don't understand what's going on. I didn't say anything, nor did I do anything wrong. Every time I leave again, my mother says she can't wait to be gone. It's true that when I was younger, I was a problem child, but now? A non-conflicting person who has nothing against anyone? The worst part is that when my brother starts cursing me, I tell him mine, so I get to be quiet and he's right.

606,"The title gives you the gist I guess but the relationship between my mother and I has gone pretty bad over the last few months. Tho the problems aren't new one I guess. I do admit I did some wrong things in the past few years like smoking cigarettes and weed. My parents found out about the cigarettes during lockdown and me and my dad had a talk about it. I promised him I would quit but I didn't and try to hide these things from my parents. I get that this is wrong and have cut down a lot but now my mother doesn't trust me at all and the worst part is I couldn't give less of a fuck about her and her opinions. When my dad talked to me I genuinely felt bad  for being the reason he had to have such an awkward talk and he became normal after the talk. But my mother didn't she tries to unlock my phone all the time(when I am asleep), goes through everything I own, doesn't talk or reply to me most of the time( this is good for me cause I don't like talking to her either).

A few weeks back my little sister who is 8 didn't want to do her homework like all children and my mother hit her with belts and this kind of opened a new box of memories which were somewhat repressed and I remembered how she was.

In third grade we started weekly exams and I got 17/20  in maths which was the first exam and she beat so bad I had to use ice packs. Tore the paper in front of me and said that she would take my name out of the school cause I didn't study. Fast forward to this year when I graduated from high school I got 95% in 3 subjects and 82 and 84 in maths and english. Everyone was happy with the result but my mom said that the maths marks could have been better and that cause of them she had lost pride. This is coming from an illiterate bitch who couldn't even graduate, didn't do a good job at raising me or someone who always cared more about what others had to say rather than what I did.

It's gotten so bad she almost broke my bathroom door because I was inside for a long time( I was watching a TV show and forgot about the time but it was still like 20 minutes)

When I was a kid I lost my piggy bank key a month after getting it but still kept putting my money in it about 6 months later I think that I should just break the lock on it because the key was long gone I do that and the bitch says if I wanted money that bad I should have just asked I was in sixth but still understood that the piggy bank existed just so I could save my money and use it later. She also did this what a knock off handheld console I had and says that I'm the one who cannot be trusted. 

I don't want to save my relationship with her know I just don't want what happened to me to happen to my sister because of my mom's ego or whatever. I have trouble trusting others mostly girls I am in a relationship with and just have somewhat of a toxic view on life

611,"You could say I'm a bit of a serial career switcher. I'm 30 now, but I've changed careers several times in my 20s.

First I thought I was going to be a doctor, but after a semester in pre-med, I got distracted and ended up flunking. So I went into business for a few years and graduated with a BS. Tried an internship and externship and didn't like it. Went back to school for education. Graduated with an MA in teaching, loved every bit of it, and immediately got a teaching job right out of grad school.

I've been doing that for 4 years, going on my 5th. Over the past several years, I've had so much fun, and have had truly good times, though stressful at other times. But this past year, and *especially* this new school year, I'm realizing that all the reasons for satisfaction I once felt are somewhat gone. The camaraderie with my peers; the joy of teaching my students; the experiences and duties associated with my position; the curricula. It's all faded away, sadly, and I'm left with a husk of the professional I once was. I still do my job, but my passion and pride are gone. I hate even talking to people about my work.

I've always wanted to be a surgeon, I think it's the coolest and most amazing vocation ever. It would be my dream. But it can take 13-15 years, assuming all goes smoothly. I'd be in my 40s by the time I was ready to really start. Was also thinking of law, since it's far less time involved. Also, software engineer, since boot camps can fast-track to the path, and can pay well immediately. I just don't want to keep doing what I'm doing now. I live by myself and pay a somewhat high rent. Not sure what my student loan options are, but I'd need to keep making money as I went through school/training. Night school is a plus, since I get out of work at 3 every day.

Really, I want to learn an intricate craft, become an expert in it, and get paid well so I can earn a living while being proud of my career, and respected by others.

612,"I (23f) broke up with my long term boyfriend about 2 months ago and I honestly have no friends and I haven‚Äôt for a long time. My ex actually used to put me down a lot because of this. It‚Äôs not something I am proud of. I lost all of my best friends after high school and haven‚Äôt been able to make any since. 

I know this isn‚Äôt ideal, but I do go on dating sites and will often hook up with guys from there. It gives me something to do on the weekend. I understand that this can be dangerous, but I have been trusting my gut when choosing a guy and all has been good so far.

614,"I (F18) was having a really nice Friday night. I really was. I was with two of my closest friends, watching movies, eating a shit ton, and overall having a lot of fun. 

That was until the guy (M21) I‚Äôve been seeing for nearly a year texted me asking me if I could come over. Because I had already made plans with my friends that night, I politely said no. I then jokingly said he should come over and hang out with us instead. I knew he‚Äôd say no either way so perhaps I was being insensitive? I don‚Äôt know. 

Anyways, he then immediately starts giving really cold, dry short responses. I asked him if everything was okay and all he said was, ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù 

I knew something was up so I told him that if he needed to talk about something, I‚Äôd be here. He responded with, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, I don‚Äôt talk over 1s and 0s.‚Äù He then tells me to enjoy the rest of my night and that he‚Äôll see me later. At that point, I figured it would be best not to fuel the fire so I didn‚Äôt respond. A few minutes later, he texts me again saying, ‚ÄúWell I guess we won‚Äôt be seeing each other later. When ~you~ want to hang out, you can but when ~I~ want to hang out, you can‚Äôt. Sounds good to me‚Äù 

The funny thing is, that statement is 100000% bullshit. When he wants to hang out, 99% of the time, he‚Äôs the one who will ask me first. And because I really enjoy his company (or at least I thought I did), I would almost always say yes to hanging out.  

We kinda went back and forth for a bit but there were certain points when I genuinely didn‚Äôt know what to say so I‚Äôd leave him on read or delivered. I really didn‚Äôt have the mental energy to deal with all that. I told him I would talk to him in the morning but he just wouldn‚Äôt stop texting me, even when I stopped responding. 

Finally, he tells me that he wishes I would come over and he tries to apologize by telling me he‚Äôs been dealing with a personality disorder. He goes on to tell me that he shouldn‚Äôt be treating me so cruelly and that he wants things when he wants them but also needs to take my life into account. 

I appreciated the self awareness but I was still really heated so I told him that I would talk to him when I‚Äôve calmed down. I guess that made things worse because he went on to say that he can‚Äôt help that he has personality/ego difficulties and that it must be nice having good mental health.

His assumption about my mental health really set me off. I struggle with a lot of childhood trauma (sexual abuse), depression, and anxiety. I‚Äôve struggled with self harm, and have attempted suicide three times in the past. I‚Äôm really trying to get better. I‚Äôve even decided to go to therapy. Despite that, it‚Äôs really fucking difficult and having someone invalidate my struggles hurts. 

The last thing I told him was that I wasn‚Äôt trying to negate his mental illness. I just don‚Äôt appreciate being treated like shit out of the blue. 

This has happened once earlier this year. When he apologized, I told him it‚Äôd be best for us to not talk for a while and he seemed to understand at the time. We didn‚Äôt talk or see each other for over a month and when we finally did, we had a really heart felt conversation about it. 

Granted, that time wasn‚Äôt as bad as it was last night. Last night was...something else. I would usually just have a talk with him and everything would be okay. However, after our fight last night, I feel like I could set him off at any moment. I don‚Äôt know how to approach something like this. Thanks to anyone who made it to the end. I really appreciate any advice! 






TL;DR: A guy I‚Äôve been seeing for nearly a year asked me to come over last night and I said no because I was with my friends that I had already made plans for earlier that day. He gets really upset and starts acting like a total dick. He then tries to apologize and claims that he‚Äôs been dealing with a personality disorder. I was still really heated so I told him I‚Äôd talk to him once I‚Äôve calmed down, which somehow makes him even more upset. He tells me that he can‚Äôt help that he has personality/ego difficulties and that it must be nice having good mental health, completely undermining and invalidating my struggles.",19Sep2020,1

616,"Hey guys, I'm posting on an alt account. Here's a little background on my situation:

I (24/M) am a first-year medical student. Our classes are online due to COVID, but weekly labs are still in-person because it's impossible to learn how to properly perform physical exams (e.g., lung auscultation, abdominal exam, listening for heart sounds, etc.) via Zoom. So, during our first lab, a girl sat next to me. Typically, we partner up with the people sitting next to us in order to practice our physical exam skills. 

Long story short, as we were partnered up, this girl and I hit it off really well. As the lab was ending, she asked me to go to the campus bookstore with her after lab to pick up her white coat. We ended up hanging out for two hours and had a great time. At the end of hanging out, *she* asked *me* for my number, saying that we should ""get together to study sometime"" in a flirtatious tone. She even gave me a lift back to my apartment in her car. Maybe I was misreading the situation, but it seemed like she was into me.

Anyway, since we exchanged numbers, I texted her a few days later to ask when she's down to study together. Three days go by with radio silence. I then got a text from her saying that she ""forgot to reply."" Okay, I guess that happens from time-to-time. I then replied asking her when she would be willing to meet up to study. That was over a month ago and I still haven't heard back from her. Of course, I wasn't thrilled to be ghosted, since I find ghosting to be very rude and immature. I noticed that in subsequent labs, she seemed to avoid me like I was Jason Voorhees or something. Haha. She started sitting on the totally opposite side of the room. I thought this was really weird, but whatever ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

Well, when we had a lab a few days ago, she decided to randomly sit next to me again (after ignoring/avoiding me for over a month) and tried talking to me. Oh boy, this rubbed me the wrong way. **Just to be 100% clear, I know this girl never owed me jack shit**, but I still think I'm entitled to think her ghosting and avoiding of me in-person was fucking rude and inconsiderate as hell. Anyway, when she tried talking to me, I ignored her. After a few attempts to get my attention, she asked, ""Hey \[my name\], are you just gonna ignore me?!"" I turned to her, looked her straight in the eyes, and said, ""Ahh, isn't it funny how that works? It's almost like it's really rude to ignore people. Who would've thought? Why are you even sitting next to me anyway?"" Her eyes shot open real wide and she went mum really quick. She didn't say anything to me the whole rest of the lab. It was very obvious that I made her feel like a piece of shit.

Of course, at the moment, it felt super cathartic. But now that it's been a few days, I'm starting to think I might've been an asshole. What should I do?",19Sep2020,1

624,"Here's the backstory...

I recently moved into an apartment complex. I've worked with the assistant property manager the whole time. I was very disappointed as I had confirmed multiple times that it had been cleaned, but all of the deep cleaning hadn't been done. So they hadn't cleaned the doors, door handles, light switches, cabinets, baseboards, blinds, windows, vents, light fixtures, top of fridge, inside closets, etc. I found some cobwebs. They did clean the counters, floors, fridge, oven, microwave, sinks, tub, and toilet.

I was in a car accident last year, so I'm not able bodied enough to do a marathon cleaning session. I have to stop after an hour or two and then I will be in pain and have trouble sleeping.

When I put in a maintenance request about the cleaning (and other issues), the crew came by fairly quickly. The maintenance crew worked on some of the issues and then left me a gallon of professional grade cleaner on my kitchen floor. 

I put the cleaner outside my door and called the leasing office. She told they would need to get a vendor out to do the cleaning. She asked me to email her about it. I sent an email of the unresolved issues. Didn't hear back for a couple days, so I followed up. Her response was that they would talk to the cleaners about it so that it didn't happen for future . She also said the other issues weren't problems either and no further action was necessary.

One of the other issues is the electronic lock on the front door. It took a very long time to get inside. Up to a minute. The system is very, very touchy. 

I spoke in-person to the lady in the leasing office. She said the locks in the complex are touchy and someday they will replace them all, and that I'll get used to the locks. 

Then my dryer stopped working over the holiday weekend. I put in a request. On Tuesday they told me the maintenance guys would come that morning, but they didn't come. 

Being extremely frustrated with how they are handling things, I reported the lock issue to the city. The inspector came and said the lock issue needed to be remedied and sent a letter to corporate.

The guys came Wednesday fixed the dryer.

I called corporate and left a vm stating there were issues with move-in. 

I get a call from the community manager stating over and over how I should have called him. He has offered to have the apartment cleaned. He also had the electronic lock replaced with the exact same brand and model. It didn't improve the way the lock functions.  When I tried it I sucked hardcore at getting it to work. The community manager sucked hardcore at getting it to work too. The maintenance supervisor was able to get it to work almost every time he tried it. Essentially the maintenance supervisor can get it to work because he lives on the property and he goes in and out of units all day long. He know the ""tricks"" to get the locks to work. It's like he's the Michael Jordan of these electronic locks. They seem to require that sort of skill level.

Anyway... the city inspector said that I should get more neighbors to report it. So I awkwardly approached a handful of neighbors. A couple said they don't have issues and the rest said the know what I'm talking about. I asked them to contact the inspector, but I don't know who will actually follow through.

I'm so frustrated by the fact that the maintenance supervisor and the community manager are lying about there being an issue with the locks. They said no one has ever come to them about it other than for dead batteries. They said it's my problem. I know for certain others have gone to them concerning the locks (because I spoke to them). 

I thought instead of approaching people awkwardly in person, I would go online. 

I signed up for Nextdoor, but my ""neighborhood"" only has 75 people and only a fraction of them are active. I made a post about something else, asking for a recommendation, and not a single soul has responded. So Nextdoor is pretty much dead.

My apartment community has an online portal where anyone who is signed up can get messages from neighbors and from the staff. It's like an online message board. Mostly people use it to post about lost packages because the signage and numbering system here is terrible. 

I could use the online portal and post about the lock issue. Part of me is very afraid to do so. But also I'm not keen on the apartment community having the upper hand with having access to maintenance requests and then lying about it. 

I know people use Nextdoor and reddit and the like to post issues about things like this... but I'm not sure if it's acceptable to use the message board provided to me by the apartment community to do so. I want to request my neighbors to contact the city inspector by email or voicemail to let him know. 

I'd guess that the apartment staff might delete my post. They may also find ways to ""get back"" at me for posting it. They probably are already planning to get back at me. 

What would you do in my shoes? Would you post on the community online message board?",19Sep2020,1

My parents tried to get me to tidy up by screaming at me, insulting me, threatening to post pictures of my room online, pretending they are recording me. They would get angry at me for crying when they were screaming at me. My parents never really hurt me besides an occasional push, slap to the face or arm. It kind of messed me up and hurt the relationship between me and my parents.
My father insults me and makes fun of me all the time. I will drop something or forget to put something away and he will say stuff like ""you can't do anything right"" ""all you do is mess things up"". He also makes fun of the way I look, make fun of the way I speak because of my speech disorder and more. My mother often tells me to stop fidgeting, to remember things, or imitates the way I say certain words.
When I defend minorities or other groups my parents are saying bad things about or I defend others they always tell me I'm making them a villain and that I'm hurting they're feelings making me feel extremely guilty. My mother will also use the fact she almost died giving birth to me in arguments.

632,"So, basically I've known my college roommate and best friend for a little over a year and I really like her a lot. I can be pretty clingy and pesky at times and she's an introvert so I try to give her her space but I worry about her sometimes. Let's call her C. I have a long bad habit of reading people's messages and journals and I did it to C a few times last year but she doesn't know. I did it out of curiosity and was wondering if she liked me or not. I've been doing pretty good but I started worrying about her again since she's super stressed with school stuff and a perfectionist. So C has a pretty big family who I met over Thanksgiving last year and one of her sisters is getting married next month. All I knew af first from a few weeks ago is that tensions were high between her mom and sister. I told C to try to not focus on family problems cause it was going to stress her out. On Tuesday night she was on this heated and frustrated call with her mom and looked really upset. I tried to ask her about it but she shut me down. Her phone died so she messaged her mom through FB to continue it. On Wednesday night when she was in the shower, I read the messages. It was worse than I thought and really sad and started to worry me. I should not have read those messages. I am really regretting knowing about what's going on in her family. I'm also worried for her mental health because it's not good for her to be trying to fix her family problems when she's 200 miles away from home. Currently she's having a private conversation and I left the dorm to go knit since I know it's bad cause she left when I came into the room. My guilt and worry from reading those messages is just getting greater and I don't know what to do. I can't just tell her what I did. It will hurt her. I really don't want to hurt her.",19Sep2020,1
633,"Here is my current situation: 

I‚Äôm a 16 year old girl with extremely abusive and controlling muslim and Indian parents. 

I am not allowed to have a job or earn money, create a bank account, I have 70$ total.

I cannot drive, though I have a permit and I‚Äôm in a credit hours class, but i‚Äôm not allowed to actually get behind the wheel and so I don‚Äôt know how well I will do on my drivers test.

I cannot leave the house AT ALL: before they made the safety excuse, and I went just to and from school, now it‚Äôs the coronavirus reason. Now, I have online school.

My phone and devices get frequently raided and there is a software called ‚ÄòBark‚Äô that is on my phone (it‚Äôs not an app I can delete) which basically gives my parents access to my phone and accounts. I use a vpn for 10 minutes a day to check reddit and watch youtube which temporarily disables Bark but my parents will get a notification, so I cannot make a bank account discreetly, or get an online job.

I have no family or friends that would be willing to house me, given the chance I move out.

My parents want me to attend the local state college, and they want to drop me off and pick me up every single day. I am not allowed to live in a college dorm or anywhere other than my house, until I am married (which will be, according to them, by age 23).

When I graduate High School, I am still not allowed to get a job. My parents say they will finance college. My parents have all authority over my legal documents.

I am scared for my life. My parents have told me, the one time when I brought up the idea of leaving home, that they would actually kill me. I‚Äôm scared because I have seen the articles about muslim girls like me, with controlling parents that finally break free and get murdered. 

I‚Äôm a junior in high school right now. In less than two years I‚Äôll be done with high school (i‚Äôm 17 when I graduate, 18 before the first semester of college). I‚Äôm scared for my future and I don‚Äôt know how I will survive. I really, really want to go to college.

Here's what he does:

Whether it's early or in the middle of the day, or late at night, he plays video games. Now, I could careless about him playing video games, that's not the problem; it's the fact that he yells, screams, jump around in his room (he's around 260-280 lbs btw and  we both upstairs), plays loud music enough for me to hear (usually at night), and keeps slamming his hands on the desk loud as fuck for the house to hear.

643,"I just needed to get these thoughts out of my head because they have been weighing me down for quite some time. I am new to Reddit, but here it goes. My family situation is pretty messed up. I am an only child and my parents are divorced. My father used to be an alcoholic and my mother has severe OCD and depression. My father is much better now, but my mom's situation seems to be declining. My parents have never played an integral role in my life and I lived at many other family member's houses for years. I lived with my grandparents for about 2 years, Aunt #1's house for about 3, and my other aunts house (aunt #2) for another 3. During all this, I succeded throughout school, but my aunt #1 (my mom's sister) took her life in 2015. This completely shook me and my family. I came back home from college and attended community college. I lived at home with my mom which was really to make sure she didn't do anything crazy like take her life too. In the meantime, I applied to another university and got in (which was the best day of my life) I just felt so empowered to do great things and make my aunt proud. She was like a mother to me and I knew she would be proud of me. 

I learned a lot at school and matured a lot. However, right when I got my degree (2019) and came home my mental state just went down. I saw my dad like maybe once a week and lived with my mom. Also, my mom never cooks because of the whole OCD, and for the years I wasn't living with my family, I eat out every day. Its been like this for years and I hate it. I don't have enough money to move out and live on my own. Currently, I am applying to medical school but I completely bombed my MCAT and am retaking it in exactly 9 days. I know this is what I want to do, but getting that score back derailed me even more but I know this is what I want to do with my life. Yet, I have no means of financial security or even more so family support. I put a lot of heart and passion for the things I do, I have amazing friends. It's just I don't have a good family, everyone is so worried about themselves in my whole family. I take the stress of my mom and just put it on my plate because my grandmother is worried about losing her last and final daughter to suicide. Which at the rate this is going my grandma just had triple bypass like 2 years ago and constantly worries about my mom. So I don't know what will happen to her.  I just have put the whole weight of everyone on my back and it feels as though I am stuffing all this into my mind and letting it soak.

She works a warehouse job and legit locked her keys in her car yesterday. I needed to go drop off the spare last night. At this rate, I know she shouldn't be driving at all and I still have to worry about this exam coming up too.

Today, one of those people who ostracized us, my cousin, had her first child.

- Invited kid over to use my pool since they live in an apartment and the kid was bored. They came 2 times. 
- Entertained them- food, games for kid, new pool toys, snacks, arts &amp; crafts, etc 
- Second time they came over, kid was asking for all my stuff. My house, electronics, books, ripping things off the shelves and making a mess. Was actually worried he‚Äôd steal or break something. 
- Nail tech is never ready for my appointment. Always doing someone else‚Äôs nails, has a different tech start my nails, so I jump from chair to chair. And my tech still gets her $20 tip.

These dogs get one bowl of food each in the moening and one bowl of water to share, so if they consume it all or knock the water over they are shit out of luck the rest of the day.

So she quit the thing she had dedicated her entire life to. 7 years later, she has a lovely ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life that most people would be extremely satisfied with, but she has this huge hole in her heart where the thing she achieved best at used to live... It was her everything. She is still deeply depressed and has become a social recluse. Feels like she has no purpose and due to not doing the 8 hour daily training for the past 7 years, she cries every time she even tries to attempt to start again. She actually cries most days. This little girl has always had a damaged self esteem due to psychological damage from narcissistic and abusive parents, but she once had somewhat of a self esteem due to being appreciated by outsiders for being a star at something, and now she has become nothing. She has tried therapy and doing ‚Äúnormal‚Äù things but the gaping hole of being told from age 3 that she was destined for huge things weeps daily. And it‚Äôs her fault because she quit. So this little girl wants to go and get private training on that thing she was once world class at. But she is terrified. Because she was trained to always be at the top of the game. And now she doesn‚Äôt even know if she can do it anymore. She wants to reconnect to her spirit, passion and soul, and is hoping by doing that thing she will find herself. 
So should she 
A. Tell the ‚Äúteacher‚Äù she only learnt rudimentarily as a child / teen and pray the teacher recognises her talent. 
Or 
B. Tell the ‚Äúteacher‚Äù the truth - (but then potentially the girl would feel pressure and extreme anxiety) 

The reason I am asking this is that I am curious if a teacher would behave differently to a student knowing different circumstances. 

I don‚Äôt even know if I want to go back into that thing. I just want to feel ME again.

And normally I'd be fine with this and just watch what I say, but not a day later she makes a school shooting joke.

I've been posting on here trying to make new friends for a couple weeks now, no one ever talks to me for longer than an hour, and my posts are constantly getting downvoted, which is really making me feel miserable.

I can't make friends in real life or even begin to imagine talking to anybody I don't know in real life, and even then, I still get horribly anxious talking to people online and as I'm typing this.

The only place I know how to ""make friends"" on is on Reddit, because of the SubReddits, and even then, I'm not successful even though my ability to carry conversations and talk to people is completely fine.

I don't know where else to look, and my loneliness is crippling me. I know it sounds edgy, but it's the truth. 

No one takes anxiety seriously, whenever I tell someone on here ""I can't voice call, my anxiety is too severe"" or something along those lines, they ghost me. 

My main problem is just where and how to make friends online, as I can't do it in a natural environment.

I have a lot of traits (that don't harm others, of course) that people tend to avoid, I'm LGTBQ+ and Non-Binary, Asexual, mentally ill, the music I listen to is extreme and not mainstreamz how I dress and look is considered awful and scary and nasty to most, my interests are strange and things people have never heard of. Most people just talk to me so I can teach them Japanese (as I am fluent in it) everything about me is strange to other people, and it makes me deeply insecure, and that nobody wants to be friends with a person like this.

655,"Hey so first time posting here. I live with two roommates who are a couple and in a domestically abusive relationship. The dude is off his shit insane, and I really regret trusting her about having him on the lease. He's been a nightmare to live with, throwing tantrums almost every night where he yells at her, slams everything, calls her stupid and retarded and just about every other word you can think of. I've stepped in between them in the past, but have refrained from doing so too much because she forgives him within a few hours and the whole cycle starts again. The most notable time was when he locked her in a room and she was screaming her lungs out. I came in and just started shouting what the fuck is going on and he and I almost threw hands but he ended up leaving after she grabbed her keys and made a run for the door. We've had so many talks about getting him out, but she constantly returns to him and makes excuses to the end of time.

This morning around 6am I heard him come home drunk and just start slamming everything. My room shook, and I heard him pounding on the closet door. Apparently she had been sleeping in there to get some space away from him, I figure she knew he'd start a fight the moment he got home. I recorded some of the audio, here it is https://imgur.com/a/TL0FaSl

This is typical of most nights. This is how he talks to her. So after she screamed i got up and went to their room and saw that she was in the closet and he was pounding the closet door over and over i decided to call the cops. When I went outside to let them in, he must've heard or something because he bounced. The cops came in and gave her some pamphlets, big help. About 15 minutes after theyre gone he comes back in and he is furious with us both. She tries to tell him to get out but he outscreams her and she ends up curling up in a ball on the sofa. I stood my ground, told him neither of us feel safe with him and that he was a abusive piece of shit. He tried gaslighting me like he did her, calling me stupid and idiotic. How he would never call the cops on anyone because that's such a shitty thing to do. Eventually he tried to play the victim, saying he has a video of her hitting him on the highway or something. He's lucky he doesn't show that to cops, blah blah. I told him I'd roll those dice and he freaked out. I tried to get my roommate to come with me to my moms or our friends, anywhere else but she shutdown haaaard. She wouldn't come, she went to her bedroom. Its like her body was forcing her to sleep, her eyes started closing and she was shutting down. I didn't know what to do, I went to my room and heard him start up with her all over again. Seriously at a lost of what to do. I wish I could just break the lease and bounce but I've been unemployed since covid and it would just be all my money. I just got out of the hospital for kidney related issues and I can barely walk because I have gout in my right foot. If anyone has any advice or anything I'd really really appreciate it.",19Sep2020,1

657,"I have recently adopted a new cat to my home after my sister moved out with the other one. She is a young (1 year old) mixed race siamese and I have had her at home for 2 weeks now.
The first week she was very shy and scaredy and kept running away from everyone in the house and hid under the bed (she has my sister's old bedroom just for herself). When she began feeling confortable, I was able to call her and pet her which are well received with purring and rolling on the floor with satisfaction.
However there is a big problem, the cat constantly tries to scratch and bite me whenever she gets a chance. Before you say anything, I do know how to pet a cat and I give her space so that she doesn't feel cornered or threatened. Like 1 hour ago I was petting her, she was purring and when I was going to sit on the bed, i put my hand on the mattress and while sitting down, she attacked my hand, scratching it and hissed at me. She hisses everytime she bites and/or scratches.
This is a very hard topic because the adoption center has given me the chance to ""return"" the cat and adopt another one if she is not adapting well to my familiy, and I really dont know if I should take the opportunity since I really don't feel like having a cat which I can't pet without the fear of being attacked and hissed at. I know this is a sensitive subject and I don't want to treat the cat like an object, but if there is a chance of having a cat more receptive to my family and more friendly, shouldn't I take the opportunity?

You can ask anything about the situation before giving me advice, I will respond, I just want to know if I'm being too harsh on the cat.",19Sep2020,1
658,"My biggest fear in life has always been that I would become a selfish monster who brings other people down. I think this fear developed when I was younger, when I went through a period of my parents consistently called me selfish because I wanted to be happy instead of being forced into the stressful way of life they applied. What my parents don‚Äôt see is that around everyone else I am an unhealthy people pleaser. 

I‚Äôm only 14 and I live a life with friends I don‚Äôt want to be friends with, communicating with them daily, and suffering through every conversation. I regularly listen to people‚Äôs problems, emotionally guide them, and then I end up being manipulated. I‚Äôve stayed in multiple toxic relationships, and even after we break up I literally would do anything to be on good terms. Basically my entire life I‚Äôm either a servant or a therapist. I do everything for everyone and nothing for myself, and it‚Äôs wrong. Even saying ‚Äúno‚Äù has become hard for me. It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs not even a part of my vocabulary, even if it‚Äôs such an important word. 

I act like I‚Äôm happy when people are clearly manipulating me. I act like I‚Äôm at such a good mental state just so that I can be willing to do anything for anyone. I want to see the good in people so I dismiss anything that is going to harm me. I‚Äôm like a steeping stool. People can literally step on me to get higher in life, and I‚Äôm okay with it.

I know my behavior is toxic, because in the end wanting to help others constantly can be seen as selfish. No matter how toxic I am, I‚Äôm happy that I am aware of how bad my behavior can be. Being aware is the first step to solving any problem, because if you didn‚Äôt notice that their was something wrong, how would you fix it in the first place? Even if I‚Äôm not hurting others, I‚Äôm hurting myself and I don‚Äôt want to do that anymore. If your upset with me because I sound like an asshole, I understand. That‚Äôs often the reaction I get when I talk about this. But if anyone can just give me advice on how to be less of an asshole, I would be so grateful. Thank you all, stay safe. ‚ù§Ô∏è",19Sep2020,1

665,"So I really want to quit my job and thinking about giving my two week notice to my boss today but I don‚Äôt know if I should. 

I work part time at a small gas station/tobacco shop with a drive-thru window. There‚Äôs only one person working from 6am- 2pm and one person working 2pm-10pm. I always work 2pm- 10pm. With that being said, there‚Äôs no scheduled break time. The only time I really have a chance to eat a snack or even use the bathroom is when there‚Äôs no one pumping gas and/or no one is at the window wanting to buy cigarettes. It‚Äôs usually pretty busy for the majority of my shift and dies down around 6-7, sometimes not even then depending on the day of the week. 


Right now, there‚Äôs only three people working at my store. Me, the manager and the assistant manager. We‚Äôre incredibly short handed. Besides this location, there‚Äôs another one in my town and sometimes we‚Äôll get lucky and have someone from that store come over here to work a shift. Because of how short handed we are I‚Äôm usually scheduled 5 days a week. I only get paid $10 dollars per hour and on a bi-weekly pay period. 


So anyways, I want to quit because after working here for a year it‚Äôs finally taking a toll on my mental health (and it‚Äôs not doing all that great in the first place; I‚Äôm already clinically diagnosed with depression). The stress of working in this fast-paced environment on top of feeling like I‚Äôm being overworked is starting to overwhelm me. My depression is starting to act up again and not to mention I‚Äôm missing out on the very few opportunities I have to see my friends. It‚Äôs all weighing me down and everyday I‚Äôm exhausted.


So my dilemma is that if I quit, they‚Äôre going to be even more short handed then they already are and I would feel so bad about it. But if I continue to work here, my mental health is going to get worse. My partner already told me that I should just go ahead and do it and I agree but like I already said, I would feel bad about it.

I am currently renovating my 120ish year old house and have rented a dumpster to put all of the large boards and whatnot I am tearing from floors and walls.

The dumpster sits on the edge of my property line on my turnaround driveway and the neighbor's driveway/yard. The dumpster delivery driver wasn't able to put it in a better spot when it arrived due to the likelihood of his truck getting stuck in my yard (wet and gushy) so this was as good as it was going to get at the time.

One day, as I am putting stuff in the dumpster, I notice things I have not put inside the trailer, inside the trailer. Another day, as I am getting home, I literally see the neighbor man nonchalantly toss a box of trash up and in.

My issue is that I am not a social person and the thought of confronting him would sour the ""neighborly relationship"" from me to him. I realize that his act is not, in fact, neighborly, however I do my best to be at least neutral in all manners of relationships.

I am torn between confrontation, ignoring it, and chucking the stuff into their driveway.

I've never date any guys and am still a virgin. My goal for the year was to at least lose my virginity, but corona has kinda shot down my chances at that. I'm still hopeful though. I live in a suite with 4 other girls and three of us are virgins. One of the three of us that are virgins just recently started making out and getting felt up by the guy she likes and I feel really jealous. I hate when she comes to us to talk about him because I feel really left out and it just makes me feel undesirable.

As you can probably tell I have really low self esteem and self confidence so hearing about other people getting with the guy they like isn't helping me fucking at all. I am also really bad at talking to guys because my father left when I was a baby so I have only ever had female influence all my life.

I don't currently like any guys but I think I'm just gonna pick one of my guy friends to start seeing if I can get a relationship with him. I've also recently started using tinder but I haven't actually met up with any of the guys that I have matched with yet.

I don't really know what to do. I hate that all girls wanna talk about is their relationships with boys. I hate that no one takes into consideration how it might affect me when they talk about their experiences with guys around me.

Sorry in advance for my poor writing skills, I just really want to get this out.

So, I [15nb] met this person [16F] last year in June at school, and we quickly became friends. We were friends until July of this year, when she started becoming extremely rude and spread rumours and falsely accused me of something in a long paragraph to me, and blocked me before I could even reply.

About 2 months before she blocked me, she dyed her hair the same colour as mine, and got the same haircut as me. I didn't think anything of it at the time.

Then, a week later, she asked me for my Spotify playlist, so I gave it to her, thinking it was strange, as she listened to K-Pop and I listened to mostly Extreme Metal and Goth, which I knew she didn't like at all. I still didn't realise what she was doing.

She started mirroring what I was listening to, ONLY listening to the bands from my playlist, nothing else.

A little while passes again, and she starts buying black and T-Shirts of bands that I like, buying all black clothes and dressing like a Trad goth, EXACTLY how I dress, and at this point I did realise, but I was too scared to mention it to her, or that it made me uncomfortable. I felt horrible, like I had to change, like I wasn't my own original person anymore, that there was something wrong with me. I still feel like that.

She started doing her makeup like me, Trad goth style.

She started writing Google Translated Japanese in her captions and in her bios, and even started learning it, only because I could speak it, of course.

She even copied my bios on my social media, the list of the same bands, written in Japanese, but of course her's was poorly Google Translated.

She even brought the clothes that I showed her and asked her if I should get them myself, and if she thought they would suit me.

I really don't know what to do. It keeps hitting me. I feel horrible. Like I'm not myself. Like I'm not original, and I have to change it, although I was perfectly happy with who I was until she copied me. It's causing me to doubt myself, depression, and insecurity.

I've always supported my family financially to the best of my ability - I currently pay for around half of the household's shopping (the online shopping account is linked to both my card and my mother's and we alternate between the two), all of my own expenses other than my phone bill (¬£13 per month) and some of the family's smaller expenses too (e.g. clothes for my brother, furniture, small electricals and other bits and bobs for the house - basically the stuff that we buy online). I was paying for pretty much all of the food before lockdown along with the other stuff as I was always the one who did the food shopping - I would end the month with literally ¬£0-20 in my bank account. 

The only things I use my salary for on myself are:

* Gym - Cancelled my membership in Feb and started working out from home
* My schooling expenses (¬£220 on exam fees this year as I home educate some subjects (college subjects are subsidised by the college) + tutoring and online courses which vary depending on the month. That adds around ¬£30 max per month). This will hopefully be less next academic year when I will be at university and will qualify for a student loan. 
* Travel expenses (pretty much non existant - I live on the main street in my city)
* Any extra food that I need - amounts to ¬£30 per month at the absolute max
* Driving lessons - ¬£90 per month - they finish next week as I'm taking my test (cost ¬£65)

I stupidly blindly trusted my mum and followed her concept of money belonging to 'the family' and never thought to open my own savings account. Instead any saved money went to her. I've only recently grown wise to the fact that she doesn't have my back, so have put ¬£190 in a savings account over the past 2 months and have around ¬£700 in my bank account + paypal combined. I will probably have a place in my mum's house until early nov so i could save an extra 400-500 for then. 

# Where do I go from here?

I've found a couple places that I think I would be able to afford on my salary. They are all around ¬£350 per month but there's one that would eliminate any travel costs that is ¬£390 and has many other pros to it. I know my manager would be able to give me 4 more hours of work per week and has said she would take me off furlough, which together would increase my salary by around 40%. On top of that my small business is growing - once I sell off the last of my stock I should be able to start buying wholesale. If all goes to plan I should be getting in around ¬£700 on a very bad month. I would also be eligible to around 190¬£ from the government towards accomodation as a student. 

My phone bill is ¬£13 per month but can eastly be decreased to half of that. If i got the place for ¬£390, travel costs would be 0 as school, shops and work would be a 5 min walk. I dont pay for a gym, wifi is included in the flat along with expenses, I dont have a car. I don't know what else I should be factoring in. I have no clue about tax, insurance, credit score. Literally no clue how that would affect me or what it means, so any help would be greatly appreciated. I dont have a credit card, only a debit card and some money on a paypal account. Should I switch to a credit card? Any other tips would be super useful.",19Sep2020,1
683,"I (25 F) have a neighbor (50 ish? F) that will not stop coming to talk to me. My boyfriend and I workout in the garage every evening. She lives diagonally across the road from us and every single time that she sees me out here she will walk all the way up to my house to talk to me. She talks to me about the same things every single day. She talks about people by name, people I do not know, and talks as if they are my friends too. She tells me her work schedule and what she did today and when she got home from work and what she‚Äôs doing next. Same conversation basically every single day. She will stand here and talk to me for an hour. EVERY SINGLE DAY. She stares at my boyfriend while he tries to continue his workout, obviously makes both of us uncomfortable and she stands too fucking close to me. I don‚Äôt like taking to her. I never wave or ask her to come talk to me she just invites herself up, as of a few weeks ago randomly, and now she does literally every single time she sees me no matter what I am busy doing. How do I ask her to leave me alone without being an asshole. I get that she is lonely. She lives alone and is a home care aid for a disabled man, so I understand that she probably just wants to talk to someone. But I can not be that person for her, I don‚Äôt have time to stand and chat every day and i just genuinely do not care about having this same conversation every day.

He requested my mom to call after sometime as he was busy at that moment. And then, he sent a text to parents that he cannot move ahead with this relationship. I stopped talking to him after that. I was doing great and started moving on slowly until one day (Aug end) he sent a text ""I'm sorry, can I talk to you?"" It took me 2 days to respond him ""Yes"" but he didn't respond.

687,"The friends i am talking about are 2 of my ex-roommates whose birthdays are a week apart. 

The reason why i am debating this is that i want to give one of them a gift but not the other, and because their birthdays are so close together it would be glaringly obvious that i favor one over the other, which i do but i do not want to stir up trouble. For context, they live together and i lived with them last school year but am not this year. usually within our roommate group we had joint gifts where the others will pull money for a gift for the bday person, but i am not living w them this year so i am not included in the joint gift thing im guessing.

Long story short, the ex-roommate who I don‚Äôt want to give a gift to has ignored my presence while we were living in the same house. Like, if there was 3 or 4 of us in the living room she would only make eye contact and talk to the others and not me. And if i asked a question to the group she would sometimes answer but as she was answering she would not look at me but instead make eye contact with one of our other roommates?? She also was mad that i didnt want to be in a situation involving a noise violation (which i now have my name on the ticket for her party bc she was intoxicated when the police arrived and she asked me to talk to them, I wont go into details about this bc this post is too long already). Also, and this might just be me being petty, but she gave me sweatpants for christmas last year during our roommate gift exchange and knowing her i feel like it was kind of a dig at me for said noise violation situation/personality clashes between us. I feel bad for saying this bc i never want to be ungrateful for a gift someone paid money for, but honestly its something i think of ngl. I got her 2 nice pairs of false eyelashes since she likes makeup that christmas. Just in general she has a personality that i dont agree with and we probably wouldn‚Äôt be friends unless we were roommates.

So, what should i do? only send one friend but not the other? send a gift that is to both of them so its more ambiguous and keeps the peace? The thing i am concerned with is that if i get a bigger gift for both of them it will be an expensive gift (i am in college btw). I am open to any advice.",19Sep2020,1
690,"Ok, let me start this off by saying I am not one of those unself aware racists by any means. Let me explain.

When i was Growing up, i was never out spoken, It was hard. maybe it was because i have never had a father figure. but I was a huge wimp. I was just naturally awkward. Fast forward a few years of my family moving alot , struggling, and years of having no friends. I found some friends in the 7th grade, and it was cool. 

But now, idk its weird. starting the 9th grade, i don't feel right. I feel disconnected, people look at me white washed. I cant fit in as well as i used to. I feel like I don't fit in with my friends or black people. This was the most apparent at recess when i was hanging with a huge group of white people, some were my friends. But i feel like my humor didn't sync with them anymore. This may have been also most apparent on my lack of connection with my cousins as the years passed by. But i feel like my frendships are deteriorating. It doesn't help that I am one of the ""weird kids."" People expect me to be ""cool."" I don't think I turned out this way because of my tough childhood, because my younger sister(1 year younger) finds it easy to make friends with anyone.

Black people look at me as white washed and weird, and I'm growing apart from my friends. I recently jumped further into Christianity, boxing(fitness), ambitions, and eating healthy food. So i don't think its a mental thing. IDK at this point I'm just looking forward towards highschool so i can reinvent myself(gosh, I never expected myself to say that bs). But i wanna enjoy my last year in junior high, instead of sitting in my own misery and envy till then. Maybe I'm just a shallow prick, but it kinda sucks. If you have any advice it would be much appreciated. Thank you.",19Sep2020,1
691,"Her and I have been best friends for 4 years I wasn‚Äôt exactly the greatest best friend for those years but she considered me still to be one even when I was an asshole. A few months ago I stopped being that way and opened upto her and started being nicer and one night got drunk with her and told her how I really felt. I caught feelings for my best friend because during me opening upto her and trying to be nicer to her we had sex. She asked me about it the following day and I denied catching feelings for her, for months and we stayed best friends but had more trust and honesty come out of our friendship as a result. Just last week we got drunk together again and she asked me to be honest with her if I did catch feelings or not and I told her I did but I got over them in an unhealthy way, and she knew that I did and after I admitted it she asked that I don‚Äôt catch feelings for her again. 

Part of me wants to drop it and just let it go and move on because I enjoy our friendship with what it has become now, but as well since we‚Äôre both single we‚Äôve both been spending time together once or twice a week at best and pampering one another, and doing things for eachother like getting eachother food, treating one another at our work (She will go above any beyond with cutting my hair and wash it and give me a hot towel and massage my scalp and temple), we‚Äôve also been doing small gestures and we openly tell one another as best friends we love one another,  but we both said once one of us gets into a relationship the stuff we‚Äôre doing for one another is gonna stop or be more limited which I enjoy taking care of her and being there for her and she doesn‚Äôt understand why I enjoy it and she enjoys me spending time with her because I never really made time for her all that much in the past because of working all the time.

We‚Äôve dealt with this thing as well for years where we‚Äôve been told by some of our friends we should just be together, that they know we‚Äôre gonna end up together and her and I even have a pact to just settle down and be together if we‚Äôre still single by our 30s but we‚Äôve both wanted to date eachother in the past but when I bring it up now a days or someone brings it upto us about dating I usually say I‚Äôm down for it if she is and she just responds with we do better this way as best friends and I don‚Äôt know exactly what she means by that

We‚Äôve also made our friendship healthier in a sense instead of us just letting things fly in our friendship and we address issues we just tell one another that‚Äôs things we‚Äôre gonna have to work on like her getting used to me being nice now, her being her real self around me and me being my real self around her. Like this past week I slipped up and was mean to her again after months and she put her foot down with me and said no you‚Äôre not doing this again you can do this to other people but you‚Äôre not doing this to me, and I made it up to her for being mean and we just talked more stuff out and just said there‚Äôs things we‚Äôre gonna work on with our friendship which I‚Äôm perfectly fine with and happy with. She was patient to for me to open upto her 4 years, so I‚Äôll have the patience for however long it takes her to get used to me being nicer now

700,"Hi so I just found out I have ringworm, and my dad is telling me that it's all my fault.

I'm 15 and still live with my parents, and in the past there's been a lot of emotional/physical abuse and neglect.

We got a new kitten a couple of weeks ago, and he had patches of fur falling off. We had no clue what it was, but now I'm almost certain it was ringworm. He likely got over it on his own, but now my symptoms are appearing. Funny thing is, the vet didn't see anything wrong.

My dad keeps telling me that I got it because I'm dirty/don't wash my hands, but ringworm spreads from skin to skin contact, and my hands do not have rashes. I have a rash on my face, wrist, calf and thigh, all of which came into contact with the kitten.

What should I do? Right now, he's treating me like I can't touch anything/anyone (even if I wash my hands), and I'm so sick of always being blamed for getting sick.

Just over a month ago my dad (59) passed away very suddenly the morning of my brothers wedding. It was a massive shock to all of us, none of us were expecting it. He had a blood clot in his foot and lungs, but that‚Äôs a whole different story.
I have three older brothers and none of them live at home plus they are all over a 30 minute drive away and work intense jobs in London so it‚Äôs down to me (25f) to support my mum, the two large dogs dad was in love with and three cats. we live in a small village right out in the country ((this means I have to drive and travel to literally anywhere) I don‚Äôt mind )although I love all the animals to bits, I never wanted dogs, I protested when dad wanted to bring them home. Obviously after he did we loved them but I never had much to do with them, I am a cat person. Plus they were dads pride and joy, the dogs never listened to anyone else anyway.  
The only problem I‚Äôm having is that one of the dogs is blind and diabetic and needs two injections daily, one at 7/8am and one at 7/8pm- doing this has fallen onto my plate.
I can‚Äôt get my mum anywhere near close to even trying to do the injection, when I show her how she just walks off or does something else, she‚Äôs even burst into tears a few times. I thought at first maybe she had a phobia of needles but she‚Äôs been a nurse for over 30 years and has never had an issue before now.
Please don‚Äôt get me wrong, I do understand she‚Äôs grieving and is in a lot of emotional pain so I‚Äôm happy to do the jabs for a while but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt worried I‚Äôd be the one doing it until the dog passes away too. I don‚Äôt want to see the dog suffer, I won‚Äôt ever miss his injection. But I work in bars and restaurants which means I have had to give up working evenings as I have to be home to medicate the dog. There isn‚Äôt much of an option to start a shift at 8:30/9pm which means I solely have to work day shifts. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll lose my job, we desperately need the money, I have no experience in any other field. It‚Äôs already cost me any form of social life, I can‚Äôt stay anywhere over night because I have to be back early mornings to sort the dog.

I‚Äôm happy to support my mum but I can‚Äôt live my life around a dog.
I know I sound so selfish, but I‚Äôve taken on the life my dad had, I don‚Äôt want it and I never wanted it. How can I convince my mum to help me with the dog? How do I continue the life I had?",19Sep2020,1

706,"Mission Statement: form a community of (visual) artists - of a range of skill levels - to provide free, varied, and constructive feedback to one another.

TL;DR: I'm looking for advice on a) effective ways to grow the community, and b) ways in which I can motivate the community to get drawing more.

a) So the community is currently based on Discord and has a small number of members that I pulled from my friend groups and a club at my university. I made a post on my IG as well (which had a few hundred followers at that time) to further advertise it. I have thought of posting in places like Deviantart, Tumblr, Twitter, and again on my IG (it's grown since my last post), but without first getting a following on those platforms, it might be pretty useless.

b) currently, my only idea is to have bi-weekly 'challenges' (like the kind of thing the Drawfee youtube channel does, ""draw a Disney princess as a Dark Souls boss"" for example), but without any further incentives, I worry engagement won't happen. I can't afford giveaways or anything of that kind (except maybe doing commissions for people, for free).

So, I'm currently in college (UK) doing a media course and I've just started my second and final year. I'm a bit quiet, so I don't really speak to many people on my course on a regular basis. Now, I've been friends with this guy since my first year and he's relatively harmless but incredibly obnoxious. He's clearly engrossed in the subject, which is great, but I hate working with him and he really doesn't listen to me when I have criticism.

Since we sit next to each other, we were put into a group of three together and were told to create a scene with no dialogue, using only camera techniques to introduce some characters. After our teacher had explained, I told them that I needed to go to the toilet and start discussing our plan without me. I got back only a few minutes later and he was no longer in the classroom. I asked the third in our group where he went and I was told that he went to go set up the scene by himself because he had an idea and didn't tell either of us what it was. When we found him, I asked what his idea was, and he said that he wanted to do an interrogation scene that was basically like the scene from one of the Nolan Batman films. I told him that I was concerned with this idea because an interrogation would have to be reliant on dialogue and we were meant to be introducing the characters for the first time and how this sort of scene would be more fitting for the climax of a film. 

However, despite making my concerns quite clear, he refused to listen to me. Sure, he‚Äôs allowed to justify his ideas, but he was not even willing to try and see where I was coming from. It was as though he forgot that this was a team exercise and just thought we were assistants, not supposed to question anything. 

This is really not the first time he has done this. He has admitted that he isn't good at teamwork and would rather work alone, but I don't think that means he should just use me as an extra set of hands and never let me contribute.

Unfortunately, I'm really quite passive, so eventually, I ran out of energy and just let him do what he wanted, which is my own fault. Although, this led to me becoming incredibly angry once the day was over; so now, I'm incredibly tempted to email my tutor and ask to not be paired up with him again. Should I do it, or is it an overreaction?",19Sep2020,1
708,"Hello!  I hope everyone is having a great day and is staying healthy, and I just want to thank you in advance if you are for reading through all of this. But if you don't have the time, there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

A bit of background information first: I'm 16, I came from a culture where family is the number one thing you should prioritize, and there is a strong hierarchy based on age. Also, there are rooms in our home that we put up to rent (I don't know what they're called in English, sorry)

My mom used to be the person in charge of finance in our family. Sadly, earlier this year she passed away. So all of this responsibility is taken by my sister since my dad is working overseas.

My sister and I are very close, we usually talk about anything that's on our mind. Recently, she told me about a problem that I was unaware of: My aunt and her family (husband and son) have been living in our house for free.

According to her, they were paying for the expenses at the beginning of their stay, but then, they started to miss a couple of rent until they basically live here for free (minus food) My mom never told this to anyone else, I guess she doesn't want to give my aunt a bad name. She has made many desperate attempts to make my aunt move out. One of which is offering her money to start a small business so that at least they have somewhat of a stable income (uncle rarely works) and she declined. This was eight years ago.

Their family, at least from my point of view, seems to have a lot of problems. My aunt and uncle frequently argue, this range from bickering to uncle leaving home for a few days. And I have even heard my aunt yelled at her son just for not washing the dishes. So I never really like their presence.

I do admit that my family is quite well-off compared to them. So despite my opinion towards them, I think lending them a place to stay isn't a problem, that is, as long as they pay for their own water and electricity bills.

I have no idea how to address - or even deal with this situation. My aunt and uncle are very emotional. My sister has tried to discuss this with them, but they were immediately offended by her and refused to talk to her for a month. So I can't just be straight forward to them. I don't think I can just tell my dad, this will bring a whole bunch of other problems. Besides, my sister requested me not to tell him. And I'm not sure I can tell my other family members either, they'll just pull the ''family comes first'' or ''you're too young to understand'' card.

I'm very conflicted. I mean, I don't even know if my aunt is willing to listen to me since I'm ""just a kid""

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My aunt, uncle, and cousin have been living in my house for free for 8 plus years. My sister has tried to discuss this with them but they got upset and refused to talk to her for a month. And they probably won't listen to me since I'm ""just a kid"".

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, thank you for taking the time out of your day to listen to me.

I really need your advice or thoughts on this whole mess.",19Sep2020,1

710,"I dated my ex for 1,5 years. He broke up with me at the end of 2019. Right after I started talking to people and eventually started dating my current bf. I had some on and off contact with my ex. I didn't tell him I met someone new. 

One day my ex saw on social media I had a new bf and got absolutely pissed. He commited revenge porn, and possibly hurt himself. I got the things taken down, stopped talking to my ex and eventually reported to the police. Its currently under investigation, and as far as I know my ex doesn't know about it. He found another girl shortly after that, and stopped bothering me.
Now a couple weeks ago he sent a message saying he knows I'm not gonna forgive him but that he's sorry. I ignored it. But I looked at his fb and saw he was no longer in a relationship. I looked later and suddenly it said he was together with that girl again. Now he's messaged me again and I've ignored it. His fb no longer shows he's in a relationship. So he seems to start talking to me just as his other relationship ends. He even made a new reddit acc (old one got deleted bc the crime). Just to send a message. Haven't read it yet. 

I guess I should just block him. But someone mentioned I shouldn't try to anger him considering what he's done and could do again. On the other hand ignoring him might give the same effect as blocking him, so I might as well block. But I'm not sure. And should I let the police know he's tryna talk to me?

712,"It was a pretty rushed decision, even though I have been wanting to cut my hair for a while. I have been barely trimming my hair for years now so it‚Äôs quite long, it reaches my waist. However, I haven‚Äôt really taken care of it properly so a lot of it is split and dead now. 

I wanted to get it cut to shoulder length or to my collarbones and then possibly get a fringe or the blonde streaks on the front. Yesterday I thought that I had decided on the cut and the streaks, I was discussing it with my best friends and asking people in Facebook groups. I organised for them to come with my to the shopping centre to hang out so they can be there while I get my hair cut and we can get food afterwards, so that‚Äôs in a few hours. They‚Äôre not awake yet so they aren‚Äôt answering their phones.

I woke up feeling really anxious about it and like I don‚Äôt want to cut my hair. I think I‚Äôve grown an emotional attachment to it. I love how long hair looks and I‚Äôve always seen it as a bit of a rebellion because my family wants me to have shorter hair. 

However like I said, a lot of it is dead and needs room to grow fresh. I also do like how the shorter style with the streaks looks and I know that my hair will eventually grow back. I like wearing dresses and more vintage or alt styles so that haircut should go well with it. My current hair looks pretty bad and I need to update my look overall. I think my last major cut where I got it quite short was about 7 or 8 years ago so it did take a long time to grow.

I don‚Äôt know what to do because they might be annoyed at me for cancelling plus I do need to cut at least the dead hair. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll cut it and then immediately hate it and be heartbroken over losing my hair. My friends say that I‚Äôll probably cry when I cut it and that‚Äôs normal but I don‚Äôt know.

713,"A relative I'm very close to in another state has gone into hospice care. I'd like to see them before they pass. I am at a high risk for COVID due to a medical disorder. I was willing to fly since the risk seems minimal--I would use points and upgrade to first class, wear mask and face shield, etc. However, I learned today that other friends and relatives are already coming from all over to visit him and that none are wearing masks, social distancing, or taking any other precautions. When I called one of them out on it they said ""he's dying anyway so why worry about COVID?""

If it was just me I think I'd still take the chance, but I also have a family to care for.

716,"Because of the recent situation surrounding corona, I've got to spend less time with a very good friend of mine. She recently brought it up, saying we should go spend a day together in a city quite far from where I live. Since it was at the start of the year, I had to decline since I was quite busy with course work, and was also a bit worried about the corona situation. Unfortunately, she started to guilt trip me for oftening decline her invitations, making excuses. I felt so guilty about her bringing it up that I agreed to do a road trip after the first course of the year was over. At the time I just wanted to make amends for declining, but I was already quite certain I wouldn't be able to do a road trip for the following reasons:

1. The current situation with increasing corona infections is making me feel quite uncomfortable to go out and do things, especially since she doesn't seem to be careful with corona herself (she goes out and about seemingly not caring too much about the situation, even having a abroad holiday planned for a week prior to our road trip). I'm not so much concerned for my own health, but I still live at home (yes unfortunately still in my mid-twenties), and my parents are quite far into the risk category. If I were to get it, chances are they'll likely get it as well, with possibly dire circumstances. 
2. My parents themselves would be extremely uncomfortable with me taking the road trip for similar reason. Chances are it might even lead to a big fight with them. Although I am indeed of an independent age, it doesn't make things easier. After all, I'm just as concerned about their health, and things will likely remain very sour between us if I decide to go after all. This is quite hard when living with them. 
3. I have a medical condition which is quite private but could become very problematic on a road trip if it does flare up (which often tends to happen). Normally it wouldn't be a problem since I could just go home and deal with it for the rest of the evening, but it is really hard to deal with this issue when I'm far from home. 

I brought up the initial point about my parents health already when my friend invited me initially. However, it felt like I was making excuses, which she pointed out that I often do so when declining similar invitations. With the proposed date of the road trip growing closer, I'm unsure how to bring this up to her again. I feel if I bring it up, even adding these reasons (although I wouldn't like to add the 3rd one since it's private), she will likely call me out for making excuses again. 

I'm quite torn at the moment since she has been an amazing friend, and I've been feeling like a bad friend lately. But at the same time, I'm really uncomfortable with a road trip. Asking to move it again till corona is over would feel like just indirectly declining the affair altogether, which feels even worse.

720,"Every day, the cases in my area grow. The bar I work in is full of patrons who don't care about the Covid regulations, and half my work day is now spent essentially policing them to keep their masks on and social distance. But at the end of the day, I still come into direct contact with their glasses and dishes, their credit cards, and sometimes them. Yesterday my coworkers and I learned that our sister bar in town shut down due to staff testing positive. We share a lot of regulars with this bar, and I feel like it is only a matter of time before we get hit too.

I don't really consider bars to be an essential service, but my state doesn't seem to have any intention of shutting them down, and frankly even if they did, it probably wouldn't be until after the outbreak had spiraled out of control. 

I can't afford not to work, but I struggle to see a viable alternative to avoid getting sick. I am somewhat high risk, and I feel that if I did contract Covid, I would have a fight on my hands to stay alive. I have been hoping for the last few months that my state will just shut down the bars so I can collect unemployment and not expose myself to risk, but that hasn't happened and by now I doubt it will.

I want to be clear that I am not looking for a way to get paid for not working. I work hard for what I have, and I have never taken unemployment in my life. I just don't want to get sick. 

If I quit my job, I could lose everything and end up on the street. If I don't quit, I have a decent chance of getting Covid.

It must have been stirring for a while now, because it seems to have come to a head today when my dad and I were in the car. I just aired out the fact that nothing about life is in anyway enticing, because he's been fucked over by people he thought he could trust on a rotational basis and put us at jeopardy, and the likelihood is I'm going to serve these people that couldn't give a fuck about me for 50 years until I'm too old and in pain to continue, retire in misery and then die.

My mum and dad both have tried to calm me about it, and I give myself the benefit of the doubt that my anger stems from passion, but I just don't want to stomach the powerful and selfish and it infuriates me that it feels like there's never going to be an opportunity to do anything for it, because if I do then all it'd do is paint a target on my back for these powerful people to ruin my life and those around me.

Manipulates everyone who will listen to her that she is the pitiful and wronged when the truth is always the other way round. 

Gambles and lost 40k, wanted me to stop studying to work and pay off her debts, wanted to sell the tiny flat that my dad had finally paid off. My dad passed away from heart attack at work one day trying to clear her debt. 

When I was young, she refused to let me take enrichment classes or attended any school event held outside of school, cause it requires money, but it‚Äôs okay to take my savings from scholarships of $4000 without asking me and lost is all gambling. 

When I was 8, I asked for a $10 betta fish(inclusive of everything needed for the fish) and was told that ‚Äòdon‚Äôt ask for so much when you are not a boy‚Äô, but okay to buy 3 packs of cigarettes at $10+ each weekly for herself. 

Refused to bring me to get medical attention of sneezing blood everyday, having horrible period cramps, crawling out my skin due to skin allergies etc but okay to bring her friend‚Äôs sons out for fast food outings. 

Went missing for months, no phone calls, notes or any information of any kind and gets angry at me for not coming home as I‚Äôm rushing a project at work. 

I‚Äôve had skin issues since I was 5 and one fine night, she finally came home, looked at my leg and ‚Äòtsk so disgusting‚Äô. 

I can go on and on and write a novel of the things that she does, but no one will be interested in my life. 

I‚Äôve literally killed my health due to her. Depression, gerd, gastric issues, worsen endometriosis, anxiety, migraines, honestly the list is almost endless. Gastric issues is due to skipping meals to try and pay her 40k debt. Mental health issues is due to endless stress, constant on the edge and lack of sleep. I slept only 2-3 hours for over 3 years, juggling studying full time and working 3 part time jobs. My lack of confidence now is costing me at my job. 

Now she keeps trying to find out how much I‚Äôm earning and wants me to support her. I earn a fair amount now, but I also spend over 40% of my pay on my medical issues, 10% for my own insurance, 20% for my bills and what I have left for myself is only a few hundred monthly. 

She is hinting at my current boyfriend that she expects at least 5k worth of dowry. Already trying to sell me away when we have just started dating. 

I feel like it will be better for me to leave the flat and cut ties with her. There‚Äôs never been a day that I wish I wasn‚Äôt born since I was a child. 

Ive tried many ways to live with her, talk to her or explain to her, but it had never worked. I need advice on how to handle her and her manipulative ways and if it‚Äôs wrong for me to want to cut ties with her. The law here does not allow cutting of family ties.

Lastly, regardless of if you are giving advice or not, thank you for your time in reading my post. I wish that you will not judge or give me harsh comments, I‚Äôve beaten myself over and over again thinking about things already. Yes there are always two sides to a story, but my aunts(her sisters) have confirmed and talked to me and gave me similar stories on the manipulation part.",19Sep2020,1
735,"My husband and I met in a country that is neither our own. Unfortunately both of us lost our jobs here due to covid-19 and we have to go back to our countries. I'm from the US and he's from an African country.

His country unfortunately is on the travel ban lost so there's no way he'll be able to come to America anytime soon. And if prior to the travel ban it was difficult to obtain a visa.

Secondly I cannot go to his country because high unemployment, every day power outages etc. Also corruption is rife and not really safe.

I'm devastated that I have no idea when I'll be able to live with my husband again. I love him so much. He tries to remain strong but I caught him the other day crying because of this situation.

Unfortunately neither of us have a college degree so immigrating to another country is difficult.

We wanted to start a family but that's now out the window. I'm not getting any younger. I'm approaching 35 in 2 years.

I'm not coping well with this situation. There are even times where I feel like we should end it because it will be years before we're able to love together again.

I need advice on dealing with all of this.",19Sep2020,1

738,"Yesterday I was formally disciplined by my boss. For not doing extra responsibilities that were asked of me without a pay raise. This is my argument against it that I'm going to submit to her on Monday. If she doesn't accept what I have to say and make changes I'm going to quit. Please let me know if: it's coherent, seems like a valid argument, and is convincing. 

 I am asked to perform covid related cleaning precautions and janitorial duties in the mornings. I'm supposed to get in 30 minutes early to do this. On top of that I have to prepare my room (I work at a child care center) for the day. The work that I am being asked to do is mostly just wiping things down, sweeping, apparently vacuuming but that was never mentioned until I was disciplined, and taking out the trash. For three weeks I did not do it for the following reasons. 

1. We have staff members whose sole job it is to clean and wipe down anything the kids touch in the afternoons. They sit in the hallway and wait and are supposed to clean whenever anyone touches anything. I do not see the point in wiping things off in the morning more than 12 hours later (covid dies in a shorter amount of time than that) if people are supposed to be doing it at night and are payed for it. 

2. Sweeping was never and everyday thing before covid. It was always asked of someone when it needed to be done. I saw it as a similar situation. She would ask me or I would see hey it looks bad and sweep. I assumed that was how it would go. It was not. I'll sweep everyday whatever not a big deal just didn't know. 

3. Unlock all doors in the morning and lock them at night. Everyone is responsible for locking their own doors at night. It's on the classroom list of things we have to do. In the mornings everyone has their own set of keys. I don't see why im being asked to do something that would take me 5 minutes to do and everyone 5 seconds to do on their own. One person does not have keys and I lock and unlock her door every day. 

Now, I would have gone and talked to her about this early on. But I am UNCOMFORTABLE talking to her. She's rude. She always acts like every question is the largest inconvenience on her. And she spends all day in the office talking shit about employees and parents of kids. Nobody, and I mean nobody, goes to ask her anything because if we do we will be the subject of conversation for the entire day in that office. They say mean things. They make fun of what you look like, what you do, any weird or awkward thing you've ever done will be blasted on repeat. Anytime you walk into the office to do a temperature check (which we have to do everyday) they immediately stop talking and all stare at you. It's like a weird fucking old lady club for old ladies who still think they're in highschool. 

Now she made a very minor effort to let me know I wasn't doing what she asked. She sent two passive aggressive emails saying ""I don't know if you swept or not but I had to today"" then left a note on my desk listing what I already knew but did not clarify how it was expected to be done or why it was expected to be done. Not once did she talk to me. In fact, she ignored me for an entire week. I made an effort at least 4 times to ask her questions related to the job and or get her attention so that I could talk to her. She flat out ignored me. Walked past me and acted like I did not exist. At one point she ignored me when I needed to use the restroom. It's weird but due to covid someone has to come to your room and watch your kids while you go to the bathroom since we can't have two staff members in the room at the same time. She was the only one available to relieve me and I asked 4 times if she would come over the walkie talkies. I was ignored. She even walked by my room without looking at me and went to gossip with another teacher. Eventually I just left and used the restroom which is a fireable offense (leaving the kids alone) but I have a right to use the bathroom. And I asked a coworker who was leaving for the day to watch the kids from the hallway which he did. 

All of this culminated in her asking me to come into her office where she yelled at me for 20 minutes and made me late and under prepared for my actual job. She threatened to press charges for time theft and wouldn't let me get a word in. I was also underpepared for it and had just finished an exam and my brain was not processing what was happening. 

I plan on telling her all this plus, since she decided to air her grievances with me I will air mine with her. 

I think she handled it in an unprofessional manner. The very first instance she thought I was not doing my job she should have come to me and said ""I don't think you're doing your job do it or you're fired"" that would've solved it. I would've understood it wasn't up for debate or interpretation which is what it seemed like to me. She was passive aggressive and rude and handled it in the way I would expect a teenager with no confrontational abilities or management experience to handle it. I could not approach her about it because of the way she handled herself in the office. She makes me uncomfortable and I don't feel comfortable talking to her. 

Secondly, since covid has started all of the teachers have received an increase in responsibilities (a massive cleaning checklist that has to be completed), a dozen or so new rules we have to enforce including a mask mandate and confronting members of the public when we now have to close down the playground and kick people off of it, and there is now an added risk of contracting covid and we have many positive cases within the first week. Due to these reasons I believe the staff deserves an increase in pay and paid sick leave if we contract the covid. Currently, if we even have a symptom we have to take 3 unpaid sick days. I, nor most of my co-workers, can afford to take 3 days unpaid if we have something like a sore throat. Our duties have been increased and the job has become hazardous. She raised the tuition rates of students only for the staff to not see a single cent of it. She won't allow overtime and won't pay it if you work overtime since it's not permitted. I am fed up. I will leave if she does not make changes and due to covid she has been unable to find workers and needs all of us to stay. In fact, I gave my two weeks notice in the summer and she begged me to stay and I agreed solely because I was given more hours. Which she says was for me to take on the role of janitor so now I'm a teacher and a janitor and not being compensated fairly for either. 

Another issue that I don't know if I should bring up is that she has hired her daughter and her best friend to work with her in the office. Every other child care center in the area has one person doing the 3 of their jobs. I have called and talked with workers to confirm this. She now has 3 salaried workers taking the lions share of the profits (and receiving benefits that nobody else gets) while raising tuition and not providing anything for the workers.

742,"My (20M) girlfriend (20F) (in the US) of coming up on three years dropped the bomb on me today that for the past fourish months she hasn't been attracted to me or loved me really at all. I have known something was up, she has not wanted to talk to me as much, not living together we would usually text or call a lot over the course of the day (especially since corona) but she had started to simply ignore my messages or just not read them and talk about something else. We went from talking a solid 4 hours a day to maybe 1 if we called on the phone, otherwise the typing she would just never respond. I knew something was wrong and I always tried to ask but we both have anxiety and depression and are both on sertraline (zoloft) so it made it so it caused her too much anxiety and caused me to think I was overthinking what was happening. Everytime id try to bring it up I would just be told she couldn't do and I was told that I was loved and cared for and was an amazing human being and I was doing everything right. Today she asked to talk and I knew what was coming, she said she still thinks I'm an amazing person and she cries and wishes she felt the same way she used to but she just doesn't anymore. I've talked to her so much about her medication and her feelings started going to shit when she upped her dosage, she felt worse than before but the doctors have told her its what she needs to take. Thats the same time these feelings started diminishing, I told her when are medicines are tuned right and were cruising we do really really well! Because we do and they acknowledged that too. They even said they've had an amazing time calling and just a good time in general when we do talk or text. I said maybe instead of a straight breakup we can just break from each other for a little and see how we feel and she says she doesn't know if that would do any good. I've been trying for so long to do the best thing I could for this girl, reading studies and studies on meds and therapy options, trying my best to make plans and do things that would work for them and kept them comfortable, and I always always always let them know even if they thought they weren't doing enough in the relationship (because they had made it clear they thought that) that it was enough for me and I wouldn't trade her for anyone in the world. 

Sorry for ranting, I just dont know what to do or feel. I love this girl with all my heart and to see her walk away because of what I think is the medicine fuck her over breaks my goddamn heart to little pieces. I feel used and I feel gross physically since its been so long since we had done anything just to now find out that me taking my time trying to help her know its okay to have your libido killed by the meds and that its normal was all fucking pointless since she wasn't attracted to me. 

I'm just broken and I dont know what to do to pick myself up. My male ""friends"" are all asshole potheads and I dont have any female friends, people like me I just don't get to know anyone because of my depression and anxieties. My parents are mean and my siblings are too young. I just dont know where to turn for a hug or some help so maybe you guys have some advice on how to get back on feet and get out of the depressional rut I know im gonna sink into after this shit, thanks all",19Sep2020,1
743,"Ive been this way for a while, I have friends but we're up and down the country so COVID hasn't exactly helped anything. I just keep going to this feeling, nawing at me at the back of my head.

I want to feel like people want me around and I keep thinking that I don't get it.

745,"I really need some advice on this. 

I (16F) reconnected with a friend (16M) from elementary school about 3 months ago. Everything has been going great considering the circumstances. Before we reconnected my family and I just moved countries around the beginning of the pandemic so we haven't met up face to face at all, everything has been through dms/imessage/ and facetime. 

This last week communication hasn't been great. We both just started up school again, we still have a 4 hour time difference (I'm ahead), there have been some personal family problems, having to make a trip to another city for doctors appointment, and it's also the week of the 1 year anniversary my grandpa died. I guess as a result of this this week he's been the one to initiate contact and I haven't been able to message him back right away. 

Today he texted me in the morning but I had crashed in my bed and didn't wake up until 5 hours after he texted me. When I messaged him back we were talking weekend plans, when out of the blue he sent me a message saying that because he gets left on delivered 70% of the time that he would be relying on me to text first. But that he'd still like to talk. I don't understand where this came from and I feel kinda hurt and confused. I always apologized and explained why I didn't text back so I don't know why he'd say that, especially since it's only been a week. I ended up just saying that was fine with me and we ended the conversation. What do I do from here? Can someone tell me why? Cause if it's something I did I want to know so that I can do better.

Like for instance one time in middle school she choked me, it was because I walked off with a different friend that day instead of her, but it still feels pretty recent and I was only saved because some of my friends where near by and got her off. 

She gets mad at me when I don‚Äôt let her touch me now and she even made an awful comment recently out of nowhere, ‚Äú I don‚Äôt choke people when I‚Äôm mad.‚Äù And she was moved away at the time it was over a call and she didn‚Äôt even apologize, but also she completely hurt me when she was talking about my 13 yr old friend that died recently and said they should died sooner, and I didn‚Äôt text her for a day and she called back crying saying her life is hard and she shouldn‚Äôt have said it to me, but I told her it‚Äôs useless I don‚Äôt want to talk rn I was done with her, but she moved back and now she‚Äôs trying to follow me everywhere in school and I just can‚Äôt.

750,"I use the word broken lightly cause I don't think being sad is a bad thing. However, all these people do is have a dark filter on everything good in the world. They are parasitic, so horribly broken and they can't say one good thing about you cause they are in that much pain and trauma from being losers. Wounded, broken losers with broken self esteem.

They are poor, not that accomplished, don't have jobs, are in debt, are really broken people and I know there is enough in the world to make them survive but I know broken and poor people and these people are somehow worse than that. I don't actually keep class hiearchy. However they are terribly ashamed or in pain. Some are doing crimes so that they can feel better about themselves. For that they will go to jail, but jail would be a positive over their lives. 

I am tired of hearing their sad stories and accusing me of hiding sad stories. I don't have any sad stories. I'm living a very good life. I am highly prolific and proud of myself. I am doing great and I am normal. I'm much happier than you have ever been since you were born. I have great parents and a great family. There is nothing wrong in my life. The only thing that is damaged and broken is you. 

I'm confident, if in the future (things are great now) stuff go bad, I will handle it well and do great. But so far things are going great. I don't look down on you for being losers. But you kinda are, and definitely are compared to me.

She claims to be a coach and has told my friend she's fat, pregnant looking and any other insult that my friend has told her, her family used to call on a regular basis. Ashley has tried manipulating me into not speaking to my friend, and even hoped that I would stop caring about my friend because her what she's going through. Aside from her calling my friend fat, she praises my petite figure and how skinny I am and tried everything in her power to get me angry at my friend for things she doesn't tell me.

It begun at 2018, we met at aikido training. Few months later, we started dating. After nearly year of fucking good time she broke up. Well, for a week after I recievied this fokken message, we still had great contact. We were friends. And then, was one situation when my friend fucked up. He could do bad things to her. But, yeah, why not, he blamed me so we lost contact for nearly year. We spoke for good only at Christmas. 

During covid-lockdown we both changed. And we went to high school. I was little worried because I found her name a list of people I will have in class. I was certain rhat she is still mad at me so I texted her. Well, she told me that she's not angry, but we are just classmates, no more, no less. After one of airsoft games, her best friend who's often my teammate replied with sth similar to this after one of drunk-ass' question: ""no. She isn't intererested in being in relationship, nor I am"". But let's go back to story. So fucking school started. And, well... We started talking and our relation slowly started getting better. We often talk like old good friends, making fun of everything what lives and is dead. But often she replies with ""ok"" or anything that ends conversation really quickly, too. But, few days ago I realised that I felt something to her again. Jokes on me, I can't stop thinking about it.

I didn‚Äôt know what to say and I wanted to start yelling at them and telling them that if it is ‚Äúso good to see me‚Äù ‚Äúyou have to tell me how you‚Äôve been!‚Äù Then where the fuck have you been the last 7 years while I‚Äôve been living in a depressed fog. I thought I had been working towards not hating them. But I wanted to hit my uncle so fucking hard after he asked me how I‚Äôve been. I walked out and drove home and just said I needed to go shower.

How do I forgive them? I want my son to know his cousins. But I don‚Äôt know how to be around these people without wanting to throat punch them and call them all fake fucks.",19Sep2020,1

I am socially awkward with girls, when I try to talk with one it goes nice but then i just somehow screw it up.

761,"Hi guys, so I wasn‚Äôt really sure where to put this so I hope I‚Äôm in an okay place. I‚Äôm sort of looking for advice on stress coping mechanisms and also maybe some stories of people who‚Äôve survived this? I‚Äôve tried looking it up online but I can‚Äôt really find much.

My boyfriend of two months recently went into hospital for a ruptured appendix. After his first two surgeries (both within half a day of each other) to remove both the remnants of the appendix and surrounding infected tissue, he was placed into a medically induced coma and was on dialysis.

He‚Äôs since out of the coma, and had been gradually getting better (but was still off and on dialysis) and was due for physiotherapy today. Unfortunately the doctors noticed he still had a temperature and took him down to CT to get a scan to check for any more infected areas. I don‚Äôt know if they found anything as I‚Äôm getting limited information from his mother, but he‚Äôs since been put back on dialysis, a ventilator and back under sedation. 

That‚Äôs the last I‚Äôve heard about his well-being since yesterday, this has been killing me for almost two weeks and I‚Äôve just felt so anxious constantly. I‚Äôve still been going to work and trying to force myself to go for runs, but I can‚Äôt stop this feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach. I‚Äôm struggling to motivate myself, and it‚Äôs important that I do because I have an AOSB Briefing for the Army in two months that I have to study and physically prepare myself for.

Does anyone have any mechanisms that reduce stress or just anything that might help? 

Or does anyone even have any similar stories where people you know have survived what my boyfriend is going through?",19Sep2020,1

764,"I (35m) lost my girlfriend, who I legitimately thought I was going to marry, last July after the weak heart she lived with all her life finally gave out. She was my best friend for 21 years and I was able to get through it by doing what she wanted me to do, which was keep working and doing what I love to do. One thing I told her younger sister while we were sorting out my girl‚Äôs stuff was that my number one fear was being alone because I had had a female best friend for as long as I can remember. Her family not only are making sure that I am not alone, but have included me in holidays and her (now mine- asked them to consider me an uncle even though I could never replace their aunt) nephews birthdays. 

Helping me out in all this has been, of all people, my ex-wife, who was her good friend too. My ex and I were married for seven years but divorced after we realized we weren‚Äôt in love with each other as much as we thought. We‚Äôre proof that just because we‚Äôre divorced doesn‚Äôt mean we still can‚Äôt be good friends. She now has a near one year old son with her new husband, but they‚Äôre currently separated. My ex and I talk about my girl often and all the good times we had to keep her spirit alive. She too has been making sure that I‚Äôm not alone because she‚Äôs known me since high school. 

Yesterday, about a week after moving into my new apartment, my ex told me that she was going to transfer her job to Alaska (we live in California) so that way her birth mom can see her son more after a cancer scare earlier this year. When I heard this, I told her that I‚Äôd support her in this. As time went on, I realized that my worst fear is coming true, being truly alone. 

Even though my girl‚Äôs family and my ex have been awesome in helping me I realize that I‚Äôve been leaning on them too much and I need to expand my social circle. One small problem: I‚Äôm on the autism spectrum and my social game sucks. Is there any programs or apps I can look at to find some friends my age that get my situation? I don‚Äôt even mind meeting them on Zoom because of COVID, just get my foot in the door. 

And please no sympathies or condolences. It‚Äôs been a year, I‚Äôve gotten past it for the most part. Just need some help with the above situation.",19Sep2020,1

766,"I share a bathroom with a female roommate while other roommates have their own private bathrooms.

Recently I noticed the bathroom would at times smell like rotting fish and thought maybe a drain needs cleaning or something. Cleaned the drains no luck and kind of gave up. I mean it‚Äôs not bad but it‚Äôs the smell that hits you suddenly and you just want to rush getting out.

My roommate left for a week recently and a day after leaving the smell went away. I thought maybe the drains finally cleaned successfully and got  rid of the odour. However as soon as my roommate returned the smell came back within a couple of days. It just hit me that the smell could be coming from her (I‚Äôm male) as I‚Äôve heard many times a fish smell could indicate an infection from a female.

She doesn‚Äôt seem the type to sleep around a lot, more innocent if anything (Asian culture thing). She is seeing a guy recently that seems the party goer type but would not know if she caught something from him.

The smell does gross me out and I don‚Äôt really want to hold my breath when brushing my teeth or taking a shower.

767,"Just last night, my ""best friend"" texted me accusing me of gruesome things. She said I download fake text apps and send women harassing texts that leave them in fear. She also said I spoof phone calls and endlessly harass people. I know that this post is going to sound so silly and irrelevant, but it means the world to me. Not only is she accusing me of these awful things, she's spreading it like wildfire to all my friends and now I am afraid to leave my house because people will look at me in such ill light. I have never felt this horrible in my life. I can't eat, my heart is in my throat, and any attempt at sleep leaves me waking up from night terrors. I never thought in a million years such accusations would be directed to me from my best friend of all people. And now so many people are on board with it and my entire social group is destroyed along with my reputation. I called her to talk about it and she went on a rampage about how I am a horrible person, a habitual liar, etc.

I had always been as good as possibly could be to her and my friends and this entire situation is shocking/scary. Picture laying in your bed at 1 am and receiving texts that you're a psychopath, serial stalker. I could provide more details but I am so exhausted.

Is there anything I can do? I know people will say to block/move on but it's the easy or me. Apparently, the ""evidence"" is stacked against me that it was me. She received a spoof call from her ex and her girlfriend and only I have access to both of their phone #s in the friend group. I would never in a million years do something so silly. After her B/U with her ex, she received some pretty disgusting, inhuman texts and we all thought it was her ex. After these spoof calls last night, she is 100% convinced it was me and is telling the entire world about it. The worst part is that I have no idea of proving otherwise. I would've thought she would trust my word and character given our history, but apparently not. It's one thing to be bashed for something you did, but to lose all your friends and be bashed for something you didn't do is a pain I didn't think existed. These people meant the world to me and wherever they're getting this idea from, I wish I could prove otherwise. If the slander continues and gets out of hand, is there any legal advice I can take? This has been detrimental to my mental health and the idea of performing the smallest of tasks feels impossible at the moment .",19Sep2020,1
768,"tldr; Im going insane from isolation.

Sorry i had to write some min background, some would ask about it anyways and i want to know what people think of this. Saddly this is not made up.

Im 24, work from home, graduating with a worthless degree, live in seperate house in the same yard as my parents. Having any income is achivement in my country.
I'm becoming very burnt out and depressed.

For the past few months i had very little interaction with people and im worse headcase than i was before. I used to be way more functioning. I'm starting to feel like a child.

People tend to view me as stuck up and wierd until they get to know me better, its a huge problem when meeting new people.
I was told that i have no body language, motonous voice and appear to have no emotions. I'm also apparently trying to look smart and in thought. Others think that i'm just lost in space and time which is correct.

Community college kept me from going insane and made me a lot better in the past 3 years.
More than half of my friends are also fuck ups one way or another.

Sometimes im bitter or angry or feel that everything is pointless or feel unreal or defeated. Was on antidepressants for a year and psychs told me i have/had social phobia.

I feel imprisoned in me all the time.
I do nootropics sometimes as they give focus and turn off all emotion for a day.

Its probably too late for relationship bacause im too far gone, never had a gf before and well fuck it half of my life is already over. What girl/woman would want someone like this. Imagine avg looging 6ft skinny shy guy that makes little eye contact and has no interests that are not solitary.

Some girls did show interest in me and it lasts until they see what a degenarate i am. Good thing i have low sex drive.

Had terrible intrusive controlling parents with too high standards.
People who want kids should be tested first, its not for everyone. I'm not eugenisist i just think that some people inflict pointless pain and misery by having kids.

I know i will get a lot better again when/if i get out of this rut, but most people will still look at me like a headcase and ""that guy"". I know a few guys that give people cold sweats... im not nearly that bad, but i might become.

I know about go out there, try, fail, learn, try again...

Any advice on how do i improve overall or how do i give in and stay sane without mood swings is welcome.",19Sep2020,1

772,"I'm 18 year old guy who has asperger's and is bisexual. I never had close friends. I am a very closed and insecure person. And nobody knows my true sexuality. I also think may have social anxiety because I'm so afraid of certain social situations. I always had difficulties in making friends and at school my classmates made fun of me and underestimated me for acting differently and now I feel more insecure about making friends because I feel like I'm just an uninteresting person. My biggest crush was for a girl who was not in my class, I really wanted to talk her with someone. When I was in the grade 9 I couldn't talk about her beacuse they were allways making fun of me, but then in the grade 10 I was in a different class. I didn't have close friends at that time but I felt that I could finally tell them that I liked her, I felt they wouldn't make fun of me. But between the grade 10 and the grade 12 I was bullied again for acting differently. I suspect they told my crush that I liked her, but also she wouldn't like me anyway. I always felt like shit because others were making fun of me. And my sexulity is making my feelings worse. I didn't  allways thought that I was bi, I started to feel atracted to guys arround 13 and I knew that I couldn't  be gay because I also liked girls. During a long time I thought that was just a phase. But I just didn't want to believe that bi was gay. A year and a half ago I realized that I am bisexual. I'm still closeted at 18. I'm not ready to come out to my parents yet, but living with this secret only makes me suffer. I have a sister who is a transgender (MTF). Before coming out, my father used to talk badly about gays. Now it has stopped since she came out but although my father accepted it I see that the relationship between them is no longer the same. It is true that she has her flaws but he started treating her differently after discovering that she wanted to have a sex change. After my father found out she was transgender, there was a time when I was on the phone and he says to me: ""Son, you never show me the things I do on your phone."" And I was like, ""???"" He later says: ""Son, you are an adult and I don't want you to get involved in the same things as your 'brother'"". I asked, ""Are you talking about him wanting to be a woman?"" He said yes. I replied: ""No, but if he wants to be a woman, you have to accept"". And then he said, ""But is being so difficult for me. Don't take the question I asked you wrong, I am your father and I care about you."" And today because of a reason he asked me if I was gay and I said no and then he said ""Okay I'm more relaxed now"". I know that he is my father and I like him but I feel hurt and I am very angry with him, because for him it is the parents who suffer the most when they have LGBT children. If only he knew how I feel like crap and the hate I feel for this world. As if it was not enough to have people outside make me feel like shit, I also have it inside my house.

Hey guys, 

I don‚Äôt post much here but lately I‚Äôve been reading a lot of other people‚Äôs post because I‚Äôm not sure what to do anymore. 

I‚Äôm in my third year of college taking 4 online classes, two with zoom calls twice a week. I also started a full time job about a week ago that has a lot of opportunities to move up and around. I need to work full time to pay rent, etc. 

I‚Äôve always had the mindset that I have to get through school as quickly as possible so I can get a ‚Äòreal‚Äô job. Lately I can‚Äôt help question what that means anymore. I‚Äôm not happy. I have little time to do my school work. I also feel like I have no time for me. Work, school, sleep. Nearly everyday.

I‚Äôve come to the realization of something needing to change after I passed out from a migraine brought on my stress. I got my head and got a concussion. Now I‚Äôm behind in school and I feel like my new boss is disappointed in me for having to miss out on training. 

All in all, I‚Äôm sad. I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to feel. I want to keep going to school and work towards my degree. I also know I need to focus on myself.

782,"WARNING FOR VERY LONG TEXT:  
Yeah so as the title said; i slept with someone else while seeing my ex whom i'm in love with (lets call him Coke). We broke up in January and after a while, we started seeing each other again but decided not to get together again. However he had/has only in his 20 yrs slept with me and wanted to try to sleep with someone else. Then one day he was like ''But you don't feel like sleeping with someone else, right?'' and i just stuttered yes although i felt it was a little unfair that he could do as he pleased and i couldn't.   
So he starts talking to this girl who was very pretty, i felt like she also was prettier than me. One day she sleeps over at his house and i asked what happend between them and he basically told me ''nothing'' and the next day he says he had bitten her breasts and touched her. It was something small that escalated and we didnt really talk a lot.   
Anyhow, a guy slides into my dm and we talk a bit and decide that i'll come to his house (we'll call him Fries). We see eachother three times and i realised i hated him and that i was stupid since i really cared for coke and he had always been so supportive of me.   


Me and Coke starts seeing each other reguraly and I'm thinking of telling Coke but i'm really scared for. what his reaction would be. Maybe two months after i get a letter that Fries had tested positive for chlamydia and that i would need to get tested to. I got tested and then got a call that i also was positive. Now i have slept with Coke after i slept with Fries so it's more than a 80% shot he has it too. So me and Coke makes up plans so that i can tell him. I tell him that i have chlamyida and that i'd slept with someone else and he asks who it is and if it had only  happend one time. And dumb as i am i nod and said yes and later wrote a text later telling the truth about how many times and that i was too scared to tell him earlier and that i understand he will need time. However we had made plans the weekend before but i overslept and offered to take a taxi to which he said wasn't necessary since he had a conflict with his dad. But then when i told him about the chlamydia he told me he had taken home his ex and i thought they didn't have contact at all and i don't even know what happend but he told me they did not have sex. He asks me if i love him and i said yes, and how he will be able to ever trust me and i don't know how you answer that so i just said i don't know.   
Back to the text message he answered with ''Stop being afriad of me and lying. Maybe you tought it was right because we're not a couple (which i didn't tought at all). Even tough you did a thing only whores do i know you're not and actually a nice pretty girl. If you love me remove the millions of guys on your social media and if not block me everywhere. I want to be left alone for a while'', And i did unfollow every guy if it was not someone i know in real life or friendly way.   
I know it was super wrong of me and i feel guilt, shame and even a tiny bit of self-hate right now.  
My offical question is i guess: how do approach him and when's the time for that? This happend only a few days ago and i understand he needs space but should i contact him or should i wait for him to contact me and how do i know when the time is? And what is appropriate to say, should i call, text ask to meet up?",19Sep2020,1

784,"Everyone who reaches out to me (stalks me is a better word and loathes my existence) are usually damaged, broken, pathetic and losers when it comes to people. There is no redeeming quality about their lives. That's not the problem.

The problem is they are hellbent on making my life as miserable as theirs. I am not for that idea. I love whatever I have working for me which is alot. I just hear them out cause I feel sorry for them or sometimes I have blocked them but they need to tell me every broken thought in their head, and then look for that pain in my life and then get enraged and have breakdowns when they don't find it.

I don't know. It's bad attitude. It's illegal. It's wrong. It's not healthy. They need a therapist like yesterday. I can't even be angry cause I feel pity and disgust, like the crusade is not worth it even though I slapped them with legal charges. I also feel they are really stupid cause I don't do things like this at all, so I judge them for doing stuff that shows either low EQ or IQ or both. 

They need a life. They need hobbies. They need to stay away from me if I asked them to explicitly do so, and I'm not interested to be a bolster for their self esteem. I also think they are 100 percent responsible for the problems they have in their lives and need to stop the victim hood and basically stop making this my problem. Even if they aren't, I'm definitely not responsible for it. They are responsible for creating problems in my life which is going really well and I don't know what more I can do than to go down the legal route. 

I will even the equation legally, but they need a therapist instead of attacking the world around them.",19Sep2020,1

When I spent hours trying to see if there was an update to the social distancing guidelines there wasn't.

792,"Honestly when I type this I feel really bad cause my life is quite good in a lot of aspects, I had a really shitty childhood but right now I‚Äôm living nice and asking for help with shitty 1st world problems like this makes me feel like shit but I need to get better for my girlfriend so fuck it ya know 

(For some background)
I ain‚Äôt sure if it contributes towards my issues but I didn‚Äôt really have a dad growing up and one of my brothers was in jail, I got stress nosebleeds n shit it really wasn‚Äôt fun
I got bullied throughout primary and switched schools three times, high school wasn‚Äôt too bad until the second last year.

Idk why but cause of my lack of friends growing up when I actually got into a friend group I was really paranoid and got super anxious whenever I was alone, I constantly thought they didn‚Äôt actually like me and that they were only hanging out with me cause I forced myself into the friend group, I didn‚Äôt even call my best friend a ‚Äòfriend‚Äô after knowing him for 3 years cause I was worried he thought we were only acquaintances (I had been to his house tons of times and we hung out constantly) 

Near the end of last year I tried to kill myself a couple times and was saved once by a really close friend of mine (a car was gonna hit me and he pushed me out of the way) said friend later cut ties with me, I still don‚Äôt really know why.

At the start of this year I basically lost all of my friends, partly because of my behaviour and partly because of some of the toxic people in that group. Because of this I decided to move schools for my final year.

I went through lockdown with no one to talk to and probably only made it through because I started boxing.

Anyway, right now I‚Äôm in my final year, it‚Äôs been a month and I only have one friend, who happens to be my girlfriend, and I‚Äôm fine with that.
However, if she even seems slightly off or in a bad mood, I start to get really depressed and think she‚Äôs pissed at me and wants to leave, it affects me so much that I can‚Äôt workout or do anything cause I feel like shit.

It‚Äôs sad but I completely rely on her, if she was to break up with me and stop being friends I‚Äôd prolly have no one, I‚Äôm not gonna tell her that cause it‚Äôs way too much pressure but it‚Äôs true.

If anyone has any advice on how to overcome this I‚Äôd appreciate it, I really don‚Äôt want to live the rest of my life as a nervous wreck. Sorry for the essay and thanks for reading.

He hasn't come to any of my streams (except for the one where he met me), so I haven't really spoken to him since.

Now I'm closed-off, cold, and a shell of who I used to be because of him.

I don't want to waste someone else's energy knowing that I'm a person with trust issues from an ex.

802,"Hey everybody. I‚Äôm in a really tough spot, and definitely in one of my lowest mental states of my life. 

I‚Äôm a high school senior who is applying to my colleges. I played tennis (important) for ~9 years, have competed for the varsity team for 4, and have competed at the national level. It‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôm a pretty experienced tennis player. 
	Now, onto the pickle I‚Äôm in. Applying to college is a very frustrating and anxious process, and it‚Äôs normal for everybody to feel like that. However, for me, it has been plaguing me. Being an athlete and getting recruited to colleges makes the process 5x more stressful than it should be. 
	My main problem stems here. I‚Äôm getting recruited to play tennis at multiple colleges, but I‚Äôm also applying to colleges I wouldn‚Äôt playing tennis for. These colleges are also on completely different sides of the spectrum. All of the tennis schools are small (~3,000 students), liberal arts schools with everything you‚Äôd expect from a lib arts school (except one tennis school which is a big university). The non-tennis schools are big, state or private schools (~25,000 students) with many opportunities, too. My problem is choosing which path I want. Do I want to be a student-athlete in college? Do i want to have those long nights and early mornings? Do I want to sacrifice most of my social life and miss out on the things I‚Äôd find in a bigger university? Do I want to miss out on majors and internships I could find at a university? Similarly, the other side strikes me. If i went to a big university, do i want to be here and just be a number in the system? Do i want to give up tennis for something bigger than me? Do i want to be a normal kid?
	My biggest fear coming from this is regret. I‚Äôm scared that one day, I‚Äôll be playing tennis in college and think ‚Äúman, I should‚Äôve attended that big university‚Äù. Similarly, I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be at the big school and think ‚Äúman, I should‚Äôve taken that scholarship and played tennis in college‚Äù. 
	Tennis has been all I‚Äôve known for my life and I don‚Äôt ever want to give it up. I also hear about college being the next big step and the ‚Äúbest four years of your life‚Äù, and I don‚Äôt know if i want to miss out on that, either. 
	My parents are suggesting that I play for the club team at a big school because if they have a good Division 1 team, they probably have a good club team. But club just isn‚Äôt the same as varsity. Its more so ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù, where the practices are only twice a week and just don‚Äôt seem like the same intensity as the varsity team. Also, the varsity team has a family and brotherhood that I wouldn‚Äôt trade for anything. 
	It‚Äôs also hard because the schools are so different academically. Most of the tennis schools are smaller and aren‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúthe best‚Äù schools, even though it doesn‚Äôt matter that much where you go to undergrad. These non-tennis schools are Georgia Tech, Georgia, and Maryland to name a few. I don‚Äôt want to give up tennis and the team and its competitiveness, but I also don‚Äôt want to give up more academic opportunities, internships, and the ‚Äútrue college experience‚Äù.

Thank you for reading this, seriously. Any advice would be much appreciated, especially from those in my position, those who have been in my position, or college athletes. Thank you.",19Sep2020,1

807," Halfway through my second year a friend of mine had decided to drop some acid that night and asked if I wanted some too. By then I'd had beer a few times. I thought the blotter paper might be like taking a beer in aspirin form, so I said sure. Then I continued on with my night of attending a 2 hour presentation on rape and sexual abuse.

I ended up peaking in the middle of the presentation. Up to that point I was shouldering a full course load and had even started adding on another course (it was free for just one more course). I think my GPA was something like 3.9. Post that night I had to drop down to a reduced course load, I took an extra year, and graduated with a 3.5 GPA. So the immediate consequences were bad.

However, the experience forced me into a period of introspection that I suppose has continued to this day. I became a lot more accepting of the people around me. I became more tolerant of failures within myself. I became much more supportive of folks who traditionally face more challenges than others. I attended every lecture/workshop/film that touched on anything approaching that touched on what it meant to be human: race, gender, religion, sexual identity, job types, language, etc.

The best explanation I can give is that it was like having a library in your house. Then suddenly a wind comes through and throws open all the doors in your house at once, and you suddenly see many other books scattered about. Then you realize that there are other homes nearby where people have different libraries. It's incredibly disconcerting and confusing at first, but eventually you get used to it. Then you realize that this is a lifelong process that only ends in death. Overall, I got lucky that night. I would be something of an asshole if I hadn't taken the drug.

Anywho, I saw some news articles recently that indicated shrooms are making a comeback as a drug with beneficial psychological benefits. So, just wanted to share my story about it. I recommend it. (box checked!) Also, I only took acid a couple more times and still have little experience with it. I have a family member that seems similar to how I behaved before I took the stuff. I may approach them to try some of it too. To that end I'm hoping folks can share their stories so I can know more about it. Most of what I've read is not really on point.",19Sep2020,1

( I am too but I don't have any problems with gay people) whether my bro turns out gay or not, it doesn't matter to me, I'd love him either way, but if he does be gay, it'll be really hard to come out and when he does, my whole family will hate him and likely disown him. I really don't want him to marry someone he's not attracted too or come out as gay and then have his life ruined.

813,"Before I begin, I just want to state this is not a ‚Äúfinal statement‚Äù of anything suicidal or any self harm for that matter. I apologize for such the vague, disruptive title but please, I really just need to hear from others: 

For most of my life, I have been through a lot of hardship. I was adopted from a young age, and brought to a new country. I grew up in a household where discipline and manipulation were norms. My adoptive mother, had gone through quite a lot. She was formerly a police officer, but grew corrupt over time. Even when she got me, she had committed police brutality. She was removed from the force in our hometown, and became shifted careers. 

Needless to say, her partner, who then moved on, raised me most of the time. And as time went on, I had grew a greater connection with her than I did with my adoptive mother. I only saw her 2 weeks per month, even with her moving towns because of the harassment and violence towards her from my adoptive mother. But they were some of the best memories I‚Äôve had. 

After that, her former partner wanted to get custody of me. My adoptive mother was and still is absolutely ferocious about such. This grew into a 14 year legal battle. I would start therapy very young, only to find out my therapist at the time was being paid off by my adoptive family to tell-and-share everything I was saying. 

During all of this as well, I was being bullied at school. I still remember every single one of their names who‚Äôve done wrong by me. I will never forget. Later on, my adoptive mother got together with another partner, who would be 10x worst. I remember some nights because of the arguments they would induce, they would lock my bedroom door from the inside out so I couldn‚Äôt leave. They got married the day after my 13th birthday. 

That year, my adoptive mother would lose custody of me, and I would go on to live with her former partner. In an act of rage, my step parent sent me the transcripts from court. I found out everyone nearly in my adoptive family turned against me, supporting the lies my adoptive mother stated. 

In the end, I moved. I started high school later on and I just graduated a year ago. I had many ups since then, and many downs. But now I seem to have had another rough period. My dog passed away, and my relationship ended after just a year. I have a gambling addiction, which I seem I can‚Äôt shy away from. I have a job, but I don‚Äôt do anything really anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I really don‚Äôt. 

So, if you‚Äôve gotten this far, I ask you this: what do I do? Seriously, because I can‚Äôt even figure that out for myself. I sometimes write to myself, or just sit outside and look up at the sky. But I feel like sometimes, maybe, I‚Äôm meant to become no one. Maybe this is how it‚Äôs meant to be. Maybe this is set in stone.",19Sep2020,1

Apologies in advance for the long post. I‚Äôm at my wits end and just need help. 

My (21f) best friend (22f) and I have been friends for the better part of seven years now. We used to be super close but she moved about 10+ hours away and we‚Äôve become not as close just due to life and me being married and her being engaged. Back in January I found out I was expecting and she immediately started calling herself the Godmother. Which was fine because we were still close then. But since then, we have become increasingly more distant. She has bad anxiety and depression and I try and be there for her as often as I can and but I‚Äôve noticed she doesn‚Äôt do the same for me. If I don‚Äôt text her first, I don‚Äôt hear from her unless she has a problem she wants to unload on me. And while I‚Äôm fine being there when she vents, she doesn‚Äôt make sure I have room for it mentally before she does it. She just spills it and expects me to help her clean up emotionally so to speak. Well, I gave birth about a month ago and while I was literally in labor she text me complaining about her family. Didn‚Äôt ask how I was, or how the baby was, just unloaded her problems on me. I was NOT ok, I was in pain and struggling because the meds weren‚Äôt working right. The baby wasn‚Äôt (but now is!) ok. The meds made her heartbeat go to dangerous highs and then plummet to dangerous lows. I was in labor for more than a full day and ended up having an emergency c section to keep the baby alive. The day after we got home from the hospital, my mother came to stay with me to help myself and my husband get adjusted to life with a baby. While my mother and I were sat down talking about my mental health after a super harsh pregnancy, an early labor, an emergency c section, and thinking I was going to lose my baby, my friend text me. No hello. No how is baby. Just a LONG message about her family and her fianc√©. It was honestly so long I didn‚Äôt read it. I text her and told her I was spending time with my mother and daughter and husband and would text her back when I had a minute. I told her it wouldn‚Äôt be long because my mother was getting ready to go to bed and I would then have time to read her message. A few minutes later she text me and said she had self harmed. I broke down sobbing because I felt like it was my fault for not being there for her. My mother took my phone, powered it down, and helped me to see that her mental health isn‚Äôt my responsibility, especially when I‚Äôm already struggling with my own. Since we left the hospital, said friend has not checked on me a single time. She has not checked on her ‚ÄúGoddaughter‚Äù a single time. The only contact we have had is her sending me tiktoks she thinks I would like. That‚Äôs all. My husband and I sat down and talked about it because of how upset I was and decided that we wanted my former stepmom to be our daughters Godmother. Not just because of my friend not checking on us, but because she has her life together, she and I are close, she lives relatively close, she had a good job, and she‚Äôs friendly with my mother and sisters and brothers so I know that my daughter would still have her entire family in her life if my husband and I were no longer in the picture. The problem being, I have absolutely no clue how to bring this up with my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. If I just spring it on her, I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll fly off the handle and explode at me or self harm again.

822,"Hi. I‚Äôm 19f. I could sit here and tell you my entire depressing backstory but it would take forever and it‚Äôs too complicated. Here‚Äôs a very short summary of my situation: i live in a toxic, dysfunctional household and am emotionally abused everyday, blah blah blah. I used to live somewhere else, but when I was 15 I moved (with my family) to the state I currently live in. I knew no one. Instead of going to a normal high school my parents made me do online high school classes and work in the senior center next to my house, so I never made any friends. Plus, they took all the money I made because they were going through a financial crisis. Also, since I was never taught how to drive, I could never go anywhere. Blah blah blah. There‚Äôs a lot more depressing details but I won‚Äôt include them. 

Basically, I have no freedom, no friends, and no money of my own (and no license). I feel like I cannot escape. I would like to make money somehow on my own from home without a car (the place I live has no public transportation, it‚Äôs basically in the middle of nowhere) but I don‚Äôt know how. The senior center next to me closed a year ago and I can‚Äôt drive anywhere and my parents won‚Äôt take me. I did make a bit of money selling my clothes online but I used that up already paying for something I damaged. How can I make money so I can buy an apartment somewhere and just get the fuck out of here? I have a high school diploma. What can I do without a car? I would like to work from home online somehow but don‚Äôt know what or how. Does anyone have any methods of making money online they could recommend me?
Also, my bank account is shared with my dad so I have to somehow figure out how to make it separate so my dad doesn‚Äôt take the money I make. It really sucks not having friends because I feel like I‚Äôm all on my own here. I don‚Äôt know what to do.",19Sep2020,1

825,"Bit of a long story: TL:DR at the bottom. 

So, I have high-functioning Aspergers, so I can be pretty self-aware and can catch on to subtle social cues. Basically... from my POV I ""think"" I can act normal when I feel safe.

Anyways, this past year it seems I've developed a self-fulfilling form of anxiety that is positively reinforced every time I perceive a bad social interaction. I say this year, because it's been the most time I've ever spent around other people (ironically considering it's COVID times). 

But I work in a hospital setting as a premed. Normally I spend 100% of my time alone studying or doing my special interests.

Anyways, I'm trying to break this cycle of anxiety by just building more relationships, which is a monumental task for me. I've realized my anxiety usually gets triggered in new environments or around new people.

So, I've been taking the initiative by doing small talk a lot. Although, sometimes other people can divulge too much and it leaves me a bit confused as I can't always relate. 

But small talk is an overall great way for exposing myself in small and positive lil morsels to the people around me. It only takes like 3 solid ones to make them start approaching me and saying good morning forever. :D

Anyways, I always think maybe I've cured my problem and I'll ride this high for a couple solid days and up to a week, but my anxiety always returns.

Usually just for 1-2 days, but it tends to give off the wrong impression to the relationships I've already formed. 

I'll avoid eye contact with anyone that doesn't speak to me directly. Stay stupid quiet. Focus on my work as much as possible. Spend the down time studying. And not reply to texts.

It leaves the people around me totally confused, as one day I'll be super social and the next, I'm a total standoffish prick. It doesn't help some of these people have openly complimented me on my work, so I don't want to give the impression I'm cocky prick.

I just lack social consistency. Anyways, thoughts on what I should be doing? 

I usually just need to get away ASAP to recharge for a day or two and lose myself in my interests or studies.

I think a couple of my workers have definitely caught on as I was recently recommended the TV show ""The Good Doctor"". I just glad at least somebody understands why I can be so weird sometimes. üòÇ

TL:DR: I have high-functioning Aspergers and crippling social anxiety. Sometimes I can be super social, but when my anxiety returns, my Asperger symptoms realllllly manifest themselves. Makes me seem like a robot or a really arrogant prick to the people around me.

I wish I wasn't so aware sometimes......",19Sep2020,1

827,"First and foremost, i will try to be vague about most of this stuff for privacy reasons but I'm looking for advice / an outside perspective on whats been going on for the last few weeks. 

The person in question has been out of a job since the beginning of covid roughly since march in the time she's been more or less confined to her room with the exception of going out to grab food / shop. 

In the past month she has claimed all of the following:

*  She believes her cell phone is being hacked and has been ""fighting"" a hacker for about 3 weeks now. She thinks an old SO which was a toxic relationship may have messed with her phone by installing something on her phone; and is possibly responsible for why her phone no longer works. She's been advised numerous times to just factory reset it and if she's really worried change carriers so she can get a new sim card. despite constantly stressing over this she wont do the later, but claims she did factory reset.

* She started getting a rash on her body and blamed it on mold / mildew (in her defense on this one she does sleep with a mattress on the floor and she never did anything to fix it for about two years so there may be some validity to this) however, in  an attempt to combat the mold she threw out her mattress and bought a new one, cleaned the entire room and then put the new mattress right back on the floor claiming she would get a box spring / bed raiser at some point. this was well over 3 weeks ago at this point and still claims to be sick, however she has stopped mentioning the rash so i assume that is fine now.

* She believes the ""energy in her room is off"" and has tried to fix it by ridding her room of various objects. she believed for a while the source of her energy issues had to do with a container that had old batteries in it along with some change and magnets. 

* In relation to the Energy issue she's moved on to placing tinfoil on the floor under her mattress to help. Claims it's working. 

* recently she cleaned a car with a bad engine in the driveway. Thinks it is somehow or another seeping it's bad chemicals into the house she lives in ( the car is about 20 feet from the front door ) and believes it is effecting her health. 

* she also believes the jumper cables inside the car are giving off weird energy and effecting her negatively 

* she seems to think obsessively cleaning the house will solve the issues. 

* For a while she had some bleach/cleaning chemicals in her car (which she just left in there for a few months for whatever reason)so she believes that she is sick from huffing bleach since it apparently either spilled or leaked out at some point while in her car. 

* she seems to think there is something physically wrong with her body. claiming it aches or is in pain ( i think it's due to her physically doing something since she's a pretty sedentary person) when she had a job she worked less than 20 hours a week. currently her only employment is babysitting a friend of a friends kid for 2-3 days a week for about 5 hours at a time. 

* Lastly, this all started after she came out of a long ""down period"" She's usually very introverted and keeps to her self, But occasionally has a few ""up days"" where she becomes a bit more extroverted interacts with people more. Friends close to her believe she may be suffering from some sort of MH issue. Thats probably gone un-diagnosed. 


I'm not here looking for a diagnosis from you guys but i am just at a loss for what to do. I don't think she's in a good place mentally, but i don't think she reached a point where calling men in white coats is warranted. (I don't think she is self harming in anyway) As you can probably guess i live with this person i have experienced absolutely zero of what she is describing. 


I believe and on multiple times have suggested she goes and speaks with her doctor but she seems to just agree and then does nothing about it.

828,"My (26M) girlfriend (24F) and I just moved in together about 2 months ago. We had been together for 2 years and knew each other for 2 years before we got together. Before we moved in together, I noticed that she would only let me stay the night at her place and wouldnt spend the night at my place. She always just said that she didnt like my roommate very much and I didnt mind it because she didt have a roommate. About a week after moving in together, I woke up before her and rolled over onto something damp. I thought it was just sweat at first, but it didnt take me very long to realize what it actually was. I had no idea what to do so I just got up for the day and went for my run. When I got back I had planned on talking to her, but she was up, dressed, and had changed the sheets. It was pretty obvious that she was embarrassed about what happened and didnt want to talk about it or just hoping I hadnt noticed. This has happened around seven times since we moved in together and each time, I just pretend like it didnt happen to save her from the embarrassment. She always seems to take care of it herself. It would be fine if it only happened at night, but I recently started noticing it during the day too. A month in, she peed herself while cooking dinner and played it off as her spilling water on herself. Last week she called me while she was at work and asked me to bring her a change of clothes because she allegedly spilled something on them. It was my prep period so I brought her some. When I took the other ones home though, they smelled a lot like piss.

I dont know how to talk to her about this because shes clearly embarrassed about it. Its just kind of disgusting and me pretending its not happening or that I am clueless is not sustainable. I just dont know how to talk about it with her or help her with it without embarrassing her.",19Sep2020,1

830,"Hi. I'm 16F and my teacher recently announced to us that she had (if I have this correct) melanoma. I don't know what stage. She told us how she would be going in for surgery to try remove it, and might not be here for our grad (6-8 months away?)

She was clearly very upset about it, and I believe she mentioned she may or may not survive the surgery. I was at such a loss that I can't quite recall.

I've decided that I want to give her a gift as a good luck from my class. I don't know who else she told, so I've decided to stick to just our class, unfortunately. I wish I could find out who else knows without having to ask directly, I don't want to tell those who haven't heard. It isn't my place to say.

Anyways, I have no idea what to get. She leaves in about 10 days. My math class consists of roughly 32 people. I've decided that I will get flowers, but not so sure as for the signing part of it all.

I was thinking a card, which would be the simplest thing to get and have everyone sign. I imagine people will want to write a few words though so I'm not 100% sure a regular-sized card is going to work the best.

I was thinking a frame would be a good idea, but I'm not sure what I'd put on the inside to write on.

If anybody has any other ideas I could use, I would really appreciate it. She's been an amazing teacher and I want her to know we all support her and wish her good luck for the surgery.",19Sep2020,1
831,"Hi there, first time asking for advice, so I guess here it goes. I'm asking on behalf of my parents, and while I am on their side,  I will try to be as fair in regards to my brother' stance on the matter as possible. He has his own reasons for doing things and perhaps we can arrange a mutually beneficial agreement if everyone understands one another. TL;DR at the bottom. 

My parents are in their mid 60s, and myself and my 2 siblings have all moved out. However my brother (36) spends a lot of time visiting our parents due to a job that requires a long commute out in the countryside. Because his place of work is closer to our parent's house than his own rented accommodation, he often leaves work and stays the night at their place, leaving early the next morning. I'd like to point out he has been looking for a house closer to his work for a while now, but due to its semi-remote location and partially due to covid uncertainty, currently house hunting has been fruitless.

My parents obviously love my brother but they are feeling fed up with the way he treats their hospitality. First and foremost, he is very unreliable when it comes to informing our parents if he will be coming over after work. Most of the time he doesn't tell them if he'll be coming over. If my parents ask, he'll sometimes reply with ""I don't know"" or ""I like to live spontaneously"". Most nights he'll arrive unannounced, and even if he does tell them beforehand that he will be coming over he never specifies a time, often arriving as late as 9pm or 10pm. Sometimes he'll say he'll be coming over and then doesn't. 

This indecisive behaviour also extends itself to the matter of food. Because our parents are never sure when he'll be round, they are never sure whether or not they need to cook for 3 instead of 2. For a while he would come over out of the blue, without having eaten beforehand, and our parents would be unable for provide a meal for him. Eventually they told him that if you don't ask to be fed before you arrive then you need to provide your own food. 

For the most part that has worked; now whenever he turns up he'll bring his own sandwich or microwave meal he buys from the shop on the way over, and that takes care of that. However it had lead to some other difficulties, including the situation that prompted me to ask for advice on my parent's behalf. Today my brother phoned our parents and told them he'd be home tonight, and asked if they could cook him an extra portion. They cooked for him and waited for him to come home so they could eat together. When he arrives at around 8pm, he tells them that he went out and bought some fast food after work so he won't need feeding. 

This caused a huge argument between them. My parents told him that he's taking the piss with his lax attitude towards their hospitality, that they cooked extra on the confirmation that he would be staying for dinner and now it's just time and food wasted on nothing. He tells them ""it's not wasted, I'll eat it tomorrow for lunch. It's just dinner, there's no need to get into a fight over it."" As you can imagine that just made things worse and it ended up with them two giving each other the silent treatment for the rest of the night. 

Regardless of the prepared meal, my brother was still happy to eat some of the dessert left for after. He has been known to cause problems with taking food without asking in the past, regardless of whether our parents are cooking for him or if he is preparing his own food. Nothing major, just like cereal, bread, cheese, milk, ham, chocolate etc - things my parents have abundance of, but end up going through quickly because a hungry 36 year old will drop by 3 to 4 times a week and feed himself. Eventually this also had to lead to an intervention (much like the ""if you don't ask us to cook then we won't feed you"" ultimatum) to stop him from so rapidly going through their food, but it still results in the occasional depletion of certain things.

Those are really the major sticking points, but there are a few minor things too. He's very loud when he arrives, and likes to make his presence known. ""Did you miss me?"" he'll shout with a grin on his face as he walks in the front door, like he's expecting a sitcom style laugh track to accompany him when he enters the scene. He expects a lot of attention and will follow my mum around talking to her, even if she's very busy. He's been known to mess about with things on occasion, at one point breaking something something in my mum's study while looking for a paint brush, even after she asked him not to. 

These are all just little things really, and even the worst ones might come across as trivial to some. But the issue isn't that he's done a few really bad things, it's that he's been doing this consistently for around 4 years. I don't think it's ever going to be so bad it reaches a melting point, but it's consistent enough that our parents treat his arrival with the attitude of ""oh lord here we go again.""

A lot of you might think my brother is a self entitled arsehole who needs to be put in his place. ""Refuse him in if he doesn't respect your parents,"" ""tell him he needs to pay if he expects to treat it like a hotel, "" etc. And perhaps you're right, I won't lie in saying I haven't thought about it. But I don't think the issue stems from my brother being knowingly selfish, I think that the problem lies in difference of perspective and lack of empathy. My brother has told me before that he doesn't understand why my parents are so uptight about how they run the house when he thinks that they'd be much happier living a more carefree lifestyle. He thinks they're so bogged down in routine that his deviations from their norm causes them frustration. What he'd rather do is spend quality time with them, but they're too stuck in their ways to enjoy his company.

Obviously I don't think this excuses his behaviour; it's their home, their lives, he is 36 and shouldn't need to be told that he is a guest in their house. But I also believe that what he believes is genuine. He is not looking for an excuse for his bad behaviour, I think he legitimately can't see their viewpoint when he believes that they're too rigid in their upkeep. 

So while it would be easy to say ""play by our rules or get out"" I don't think that's what any of us want. My mother wants her feelings to be validated by him and not shrugged off as making fuss over nothing. I believe his attitude is selfish but not intentionally so. I think that if there's a way to get him to see the other side he is likely to change his attitude, but that said if things don't improve I think the best course of action is to give him some kind of ultimatum. 

What do you guys think? Sorry if this is inconsistent, there's a lot of factors to consider and issues that needed context behind them (I'm also tired and typing on phone). Any and all advice appreciated. 

Tl;dr my brother treats my parents and their house like a service and doesn't understand why they are annoyed at him. My parents want their feelings validated and for my brother to understand why his actions are selfish.",19Sep2020,1

838,"She friendzoned me. I told her to give me time to think of her as a friend. 3 days later she texts me, I haven‚Äôt told her I was ready yet. What is she wanting???

No TLDR.
(I‚Äôm m16 she‚Äôs f15)
So 3 days ago (Wednesday night) I told this girl I like her.  This is exactly what she said: 
‚Äúaww (my name) I wanna start off by saying that you are incredibly sweet and I really enjoy talking to you. I think you‚Äôre a really great guy! that takes a lot of courage to tell me that and i appreciate it so much. right now, i‚Äôm not in a good place to be in a relationship with school and everything but i think you‚Äôre a really great friend and I definitely wanna continue being that way‚Äù

I asked if she was just saying that as a nice way of saying she doesn‚Äôt wanna talk anymore. She responds: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not gonna ignore you tmrw. If that‚Äôs what your asking? I love having you as a friend and wanna continue that‚Äù

So I told her I‚Äôm fine with being friends, I don‚Äôt want to talk to her for awhile because I will need some time to think of her as a friend instead of someone I like. She responds: ‚ÄúOk I totally understand. Let me know when ur ready to be friends‚Äù

3 days go by without us talking. Then today she randomly texts me ‚Äúhey how r u‚Äù I respond and I text 2 of my friends asking what I do. I‚Äôm getting over her, but now I‚Äôm incredibly confused. I text a couple of my friends because I‚Äôm so confused why she randomly text me like that. One of my friends said that ‚Äúshe said she‚Äôs ready‚Äù meaning she is basically saying she wants to date...?  My other friend said either she‚Äôs playing with my feelings or really really really wants to be friends. 

I‚Äôm really confused about this, anyone have thoughts??",19Sep2020,1
839,"Basically, i live in a small town. Its big but 90% of it is just houses. I live like 30 minutes from los angeles but my parents never let me go out of my town. Only thing they ever let me do is go skate around and ive done the same thing for the past 3 years and im sick of it. All my friends get to go places in the city and go to the beach and have fun and whenever i ask my parents to go with them, they always find some creative way to say no. It seems like they do it on purpose to fuck with me (sorry for the language). They look at me as if im some joke and dont have feelings but i cant really do anything about it considering im 16 and cant move out on my own and i dont wanna run away since they provide me with food and a nice house, but that doesnt mean im happy just because i have a nice house. My friends literally make jokes about me and how my parents dont let me out and i dont blame them tbh because my parents are absolutely ridiculous. All i do is sit in my room all day and watch youtube and my parents wonder why im always on my damn phone all day because i have no f*cking freedom.",19Sep2020,0

My anxiety is too severe to be able to make new friends in real life, and it's still pretty bad when talking to someone online.

My social skills are perfectly fine, I just don't know how to actually find people, apart from on the friend finding subreddits here. 

Joining discord severs are too anxiety inducing,  because it's essentially a giant group chat, especially as I was doxxed a few days ago for only saying ""hi""

Most of the things I am and interested in (not harmful to others, of course) people generally don't like and judge pretty harshly, which of course, makes things harder for me. All of my posts get downvoted as well, and no one even messages me from them anymore.

I really don't want to get police involved because she might perceive that as an attack and she might later do something crazy to ""retaliate"" against me (she's not completely stable)  Is there any way I can get this thing back or is it just hers now?",19Sep2020,1
843,"I have always been someone that ""needs"" a job. When I lost my job due to COVID, I was shocked. I didn't think of myself as expendable. I didn't see my role or my duties as something superfluous that could be cut in economic hard times. I am a hard worker and did my job well. Besides the normal stress of being an ""at will"" employee, I never went to work wondering if I would have a job the next day. I am good friends with my coworkers, and had been through hard times with the company before.

My significant other who worked in the same industry got furloughed 3 days before I did. I was heartbroken for him, he had worked so hard to get to where he was, and, in one second his job was gone. And the worst part was, it wasn't his fault. I tried to be supportive, and felt so grateful to still be working, thinking there was no way even with furloughs in our industry happening, that I would be one of the first on the list. Well. I was. 3 days after my SO was furloughed, I was also furloughed. I lost my ""job"".

To me it didn't matter whether I had been fired, laid off, furloughed, or whatever else term people use to make themselves feel better about ""*NOT HAVING A JOB"".*

 I was so embarrassed. 

A few weeks later, I was called in to be permanently let go. I have trouble putting to words how that made me feel. It's just a ""job"" after all... I cried. I was angry. I was hurt. But I was mostly sad. Sad because I knew that no body knew what was happening. No body knew how to act. No body was angry. Everyone was sad. 

I didn't want to tell anyone. I felt like all of my friends were getting to work from home and instead I was just done. I felt like I wasn't important. I was hurt.

I felt so sorry for myself. I lost my job and I didn't deserve it. I had no structure, and I felt like I had no purpose. Because I lost my ""job"".

I realize I felt purposeless because I lost my job. I am so grateful for Unemployment money that I received for the pandemic. 

What's even crazier, is then a little after that...I started feeling worse! I was being paid MORE money, than I was to work, just to stay home! On top of that, another check for $1,200 was mailed to me. This money was just being given to me. Why?

 Because people should make enough money to live!! (Right?!) We had both political parties fight over what this means. So what was determined was a ""livable"" amount, was actually more than I was actually making to work so hard everyday. (I am not even going to touch on the absurdity of minimum wage being SIGNIFICANTLY less than what was deemed as a livable income.)

So here I am sitting at home with no ""job"", making more money than I ever have. I am sitting at home, sad and with a damaged sense of self-confidence, making more money than I ever have, to sit at home, and do nothing. I started noticing how many people were paying with the matching EDD debit cards at grocery stores. I saw all the news and Stats. And I felt suddenly, comfortable. I started making jokes about how I'd been ""fired"". I complained a lot. And frankly, just didn't really feel like doing anything, because I lost my ""job"" and it wasn't my fault.

I needed to wake up. I needed to stop feeling bad for myself. After, I live a comfortable life, I went to university, I have never had to deal with someone being racist to me, I am from the United States. I am lucky. I started to be more angry at myself as I realized how lucky I was and realized that I was being ungrateful for what was sitting in front of me that other people would dream of having the opportunity to have. I realized, that my feelings were no less than anyone elses of feeling sad. it was okay that I felt sad, but what was not okay, was that I was allowing myself to dwell. Just because I didn't have a ""job"" didn't mean I didn't have a ""job"". I had no excuse. 

 My ""job"" is to be the best person I can be for myself and everyone around me. My job is to work harder to improve myself. My job is to build good habits. My jobs is to be happy. My job is to accept that feeling sad, or overwhelmed is okay sometimes. My job is to ask for help when I need it, and provide it for those in my life when they need it. 

Once I realized what my ""job"" was, the craziest thing happened. I started mt next career opportunity. This didn't happen out of luck or chance. This happened because I did my ""job"". 

Mentally, I grappled with a lot during this time, and I am so lucky and thankful for the people in my life that have unwaveringly supported me.  I am writing this post because I want YOU to be more comfortable with the way YOU feel. It is okay to be weak. It is okay to be sad. It is okay to feel stupid. Be grateful for what you have, and the opportunities you have. Be kind. Do not diminish how YOU feel because someone is worse off. Stop comparing yourself.

845,"A very close family member of mine is having a large wedding very soon in Florida and I (F20) am so scared of what can happen as she is choosing to ignore the virus. The wedding is planned to be around 120-200 people, and many of my family members (including my grandmother and mother) are choosing to go. I feel like I am screaming into the void as many of my own family members believe that the virus is not real or not that serious. I've tried to show them what has occurred recently to other large weddings (such as the one that occurred in Maine), but my mother and grandmother told me that I am just being negative and selfish. I am so scared that someone will become sick and die, especially since it is only family going to the wedding. 

For reference, my family is very large, and the older members are very old school and traditional; my grandmother has even said that she would disown me if I do not attend. I have no plans to attend, even if I am to be cast out, but I still worry about my older family members. I am also worried that someone will become sick and pass on the virus to someone who did not go to the wedding. 

Please does anyone have any advice on how I can convince my family member to cancel the wedding? I just feel like I am watching a slow carcrash that I cannot stop.",19Sep2020,1
