1,"I'm an adult.  I have about b1 level in French and expect to be able to pass a b2 exam by the end of the upcomming year.  I am actively in french courses and am receiving one-on-one tutoring.

I would like to study for a master's degree in France.  Of note is that the French university system is a bit different than the US and many universities have many campuses.  There are also a number of universities that have programs for emigrees, but these programs are taught in English for at least one year.  I don't think I want to limit myself to a program that is only for foreigners.  If possible I would like to be able to participate in courses for a person who speaks French assuming I go to typical available resources for students, for instance things like having a person review an essay to check for the types of errors a person with ""fluency"" but not a hugely experienced knowledge of the language would make.

The application process is a year away, but I'm wondering if anyone has experience with something like this what general guidance can be given.  I'm having a weirdly difficult time finding certain requirements for programs in my field, for instance.  I wasn't a straight A student, but I did well enough, have some credentials in addition to schooling, and I have work experience in the field, so I believe I'm a good candidate for many programs.  If I were to study for a master's degree in the US, I wouldn't apply for harvard, but I'm quite sure I could find one that would take me.

Does anyone have any suggestions on this process?  Should I simply call a program even if I'm asking a question as stupid as, ""I'm having a hard time locating admissions requirements for certain programs on your site, can you help""?

I'm old enough that my going for a masters degree, especially one outside of the country, is not just a simple continuation of college.  Any help would be appreciated.",26Nov2020,1
2,"Alright, I am 20F (almost 21) in a relationship with a 21M. We have been together three years and living together for two. My whole life I have been raised to think that marriage is a horrible thing. My mother put us through two divorces in my life due to her cheating, and she told me to never get married because then you’ll be stuck forever. This is the view I unwillingly have on marriage because it is what I have been lead to believe my whole life. I never wanted to get married until I met the guy I’m with now, and he’s changed my perspective on this and a lot of things. I imagine myself growing old with him and it still doesn’t feel like we’ll have enough time together. All this and I am still afraid of the commitment of getting engaged and married. It gives me extreme anxiety to think what my mother would say about it, because I know she would be mad. Any advice?",26Nov2020,1
4,"So this summer, I spotted this beautiful black cat with green eyes in our yard. He ran off the first few times we saw him, but once he started to become comfortable with my family he seemed to get really attached to us, to the point where he comes to our house almost daily now. When we first saw him, he was extremely skinny and had a number of wounds on him. He has no collar and his fur was dirty and scruffy, not to mention that he is definitely not fixed. 

My mom and I made it a point to ask around the neighbourhood and try to figure out if this cat actually belonged to anyone, and someone mentioned that it might belong to someone who lives down the street from us. I messaged the girl who lives there and she said that he was their cat, and when I mentioned how malnourished and beaten up he was she said that “he’s always been small” and that he was missing for two weeks. Now, I’m no expert, but I was immediately suspicious. He looked more like he’d been away for two years than two weeks. This girl also mentioned that they had multiple black cats and that it could be any of them. I think that they might be hoarding stray animals, since they have even more pets and all of them are “outdoor” (not fixed nor taken care of). Anyway, they showed up to see if he was their cat and they said yes but he ran away from them. He doesn’t respond to the name that they call him, but he does respond to the name that we gave him.

Overall, I highly doubt that this cat has ever been to a vet and that he is actually these peoples pet. Even if he is their pet, he has been severely neglected. He’s grown into a very large cat since we’ve been feeding him (definitely not a small cat) and he sleeps near our house all the time. They have multiple missing black cats and I’m wondering if I would be able to take this cat to the vet and have him fixed/examined, and then adopt him. 

TL;DR: Found a stray cat, he’s a very good boi but very malnourished and injured. People claimed to be owners but aren’t sure and may be mistreating him. Can I take care of this cat? Is it ethical for me to take care of this cat? I don’t want to deprive anyone of their pet but I’m so worried that he won’t survive through the winter.",26Nov2020,1

7,"This may help me..

Wondering if anyone knows the process for admitting themselves into a Psych Ward.

I live in Brampton and have taken a leave of absence from work.

I’ve attempted suicided in the past but brought myself to a stop, I had a shift in energy and felt like I had control of my life , but I fell back into a horrible spiral.

I’ve been smoking weed constantly and listening to music for 12-14 hours a day... just to block out the noise.

I’ve read a little bit about it whilst googling, and it really appealed to me.

So if anyone could shed some light for me, 

I just have the following questions: 

1) process? Age? Family physicians consent? costs? Location? 

2) Ive renewed my health card a while back but never got the renewed card due to mailing address issues, I just have my old health card. I was able to get tested for Covid with it so not sure if it’d suffice for the psych ward.

3) this may be a bit too personal but if anyone could share their experience and if it helped them in any way? I’m really curious and interested in this and have high hopes that it may help me 

Please and thank you,",26Nov2020,1
8,"Basically, on my way back from school, I was walking down this one way, narrow street with my headphones in. I was walking the same way the cars were driving, so we would both be facing the same way. 

I saw the car was a fair bit behind me, but someone else was on the road blocking it and slowing it down.

Like 5/10 seconds later, I walked onto the road to pass someone and only just noticed the car out of the corner of my eye. I think it stopped just before it hit me, and it didn’t really affect me at the time, but recently it’s just really been starting to bug me, and like, it’s made me really paranoid and anxious. 

Every time I walk down that road or even any road I need to cross tbh, that memory always comes back into my head and like, I could’ve died if that guy didn’t break in time, it was completely my fault for not looking, so I just, idk I just dk how to cope with it ig. It just, it’s kinda scaring me which is weird cause I don’t really get scared by much.

Any help is appreciated, thanks",26Nov2020,1
9,"I don't understand how people can talk for hours. I am constantly having debates and random conversations with myself, yet when I am with others I am a mess. I can't think of anything. I listen and try to follow whatever the other person is saying but I either can't think of anything, repeat like a parrot or just say a completely random think that ends up making the situation really awkward. In fact, 99% of the time I manage to turn conversations to be really awkward.

The only person with whom I can manage to have ""lengthy"" conversation is my sister. And I end up jumping from topic to topic without deepening on something. That thanks to ADHD. 

I really want to change this since I have no social life. I've already know tips such as people loving to talk about themselves and listening, but even in the conversations when I am really interested, I can't manage to follow up. 

Any advice please?",26Nov2020,1
10,"Ok so i wanna stop liking gay sex. Its really taking a toll on my life. I mean im not even gay. A long time ago i just kinda stumbled across the glorious pleasure of it on my own. I feel like ive been cursed with knowledge. Im thinking of the wolf analogy. Im thinking if i stop feeding this gay wolf it'll eventually die out. So that means retiring everything that makes me crave it (porn, anal play, cum tributes, etc) for about 90 days. Do u guys think this could work?

15,"(TLDR at the bottom) 
I’ve never used Reddit before (so I have near no clue what I’m doing) and I don’t even know if I’m going to get any replies but I guess it doesn’t hurt to try this. 

My best friend has been struggling with depressed for a while now, and I don’t know how to help her. Her parents are verbally abusive, her dad neglects her, her parents are constantly in screaming matches and she has to be the middle man and solve their arguments. Her father also blames her for anything that goes wrong in their life, and doesn’t even know how to pronounce or spell her name right. She was also bullied pretty badly in school, (she does homeschool now) so she has really low self esteem, and all of that contributes to her depressed and anxiety. 

She tells me that nothing brings her happiness, and she doesn’t have any hobbies because they just make her frustrated and sad when she fails- and she’s too scared to try anything new because she doesn’t want to fail. (Her parents have insanely high expectations- they expect her to do everything perfectly and to act like an adult) 

We live hours apart, so I can’t hang out with her or anything like that, and she says I’m her only friend (not including her cousins) 
   Her parents refuse to pay for a therapist/counselor (even a cheap one) because when she did have a therapist she was too nervous to talk to them. They also refuse to take her to the doctors for depression, because they believe she’s just making it up for attention. So, therapy and medication is out of the question. 

I really want to help her- I want her to be happy and find something she loves doing. In all honestly, I’m a shitty friend. I don’t know how to give advice or help people, and when I try to it just comes off as if I’m an asshole that doesn’t care. 

Does anyone know what I can do to help her? Or anything she can do that might help? 
Sorry this is eons long.. hopefully this makes sense. Explaining things isn’t my strong suit.

16,"My friend doesn’t seem to share personal stuff with the rest of us, despite us opening up.

This could be as little as who he hangs out with outside of our group, companies in his portfolio (we all work in finance), what he is up to etc.

Sometimes he would just leave and not tell us where he is going, or being vague about it. Or he’ll tell white lies in order to keep simple stuff a secret.

Is it petty for me to not open up/share as much given he doesn’t do so? Doesn’t seem right to share more stuff when a friend doesn’t want to reciprocate.",26Nov2020,1
17,"TL;DR: Absuive father-in-law bullys me, is a sexist piece of shit, talks bad about me all the time, and when I stand up for myself he blows up. Husband is usually either quiet or takes his side.

Ok. This will be long, but I just need everyones advice. I'm very lost as to what to do. I am not saying this is definitely the last straw... but I will say I should've taken other's advice in the past when ranting about my problems.

I'm married to a decent man, I still love him after all of this happened. He is sadly the victim of a very narcissistic, controlling father, but I would rather refer to his father as a man-child after the shit he's pulled today.

I have made posts in the past trying to figure out what to do. His father in law is a hard-headed trump supporter, he intentionally likes to piss me off by bringing up politics around me. I, on the other hand, try to keep quiet about it. I don't like Biden, but I way prefer him over trump. Whenever I would come around, he would intentionally say shit like ""hm, I wonder who will win the election."" or ask even asking his phone, right in front of me as loud as he can, ""hey google, who will win the election?"" He was hoping google would answer trump to piss me off, but when google replied with biden, he said ""oh that's just fake media."" He has done shit like that MULTIPLE times to piss me off. And he thinks it's a joke.

Politics is not the only problem with him. He has accused me of cheating, accused me of not loving my husband, barged into my house uninvited when he was pissed off one day to say to my face ""she needs to learn how to cook, she's a woman"". He is a sexist prick. God, he's such a fucking prick. I feel trapped under his authority. And my husband is permanently stuck under him.

Today was the FINAL STRAW. I'm asking this to make sure I'm not crazy. Today, he was trying to piss me off about asking about social media of mine. He asks if I ever get into arguments about politics with people on facebook, and I said ""I try not to, but there are some circumstances where if I post my opinion, and someone replies being nasty to me with no logic behind their opinion, yes, I will argue."" he then said ""oh, like what"" and I hesitated answering because I knew this would've turned into an argument. I really didn't want to answer him. But he kept PUSHING it. He kept PUSHING. MY BUTTONS. He KEPT asking for specifics, and I said ""immigration"".

I think you guys know where this is going. I said I was completely against the wall, as it even says in GOD'S LAW that for we were once foreigners in the land of Egypt, we must accept foreigners into our land. (Here's the specific link to the bible verse: [https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm](https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-21.htm) ) I told him that I know, there will sadly be a few bad apples that will get through, too. But you can't blame a whole group of people for a few bad apples. He eventually got so pissed off, that he slammed his mug he had in his hand into the ground, and said ""YOU'RE SO STUPID!! SHE'S SO STUPID!"" My husband was here for this, I'll tell you what he answered here in a second. His father's outburst literally reminded me of a 4 year old child throwing a tantrum when they can't get something they want.

I start walking into the house, he starts ranting about whatever else he has to say about me, all I said as I walked away was ""the second that you insulted me, you lost the argument."" I didn't WANT this to be an argument, but he kept fucking pushing it. He would RIDICULE me for not being for Trump MULTIPLE times, yet the one time I actually stand my ground, he goes APESHIT. I'm so fucking tired of this. I feel trapped. My biggest mistake was not knowing his family well enough before I married him. 

As I hear my husband walking to the house, his dad yells ""she's so arrogant and will NOT listen to people! She needs to be controlled."" and my husband responds with ""oh yeah, she never listens to me, she doesn't respect me."" and walks inside.

Guys. I don't know what to do anymore. Any love I have for him is gone at this point. If you want to read everything else in my history talking about problems I've had with his in-laws, I'll link them at the end of this.

I'm so lost. I love my husband so much. It hurts thinking about leaving him. I'd have nowhere else to go, I have cats that I can't find homes for. And I can't leave without finding them homes. One of them is blind in both eyes due to cat herpes, she has very little hope at finding a home. I'm so scared I'm going to be stuck in this endless loop of not feeling safe in my own home (they live next door, btw). I'm so scared of the thought of how horrible this will end if I continue to stay and let these arguments between me and my husband get worse. His father is ruining our marriage. And my husband has not ONCE. Stood up for me whenever he starts shit. Not once... and at times would take his side.

I'm also not financially off well. I'd be living in my car for the rest of my life at this rate... please help. Just please help. Am I overreacting? Or should I make my escape plan?

22,"Alright, Reddit! I need some help.

So every night I drink this massive jar of water. It's about 16 ounces.

And I'm a pretty normal person, so I don't go to bed straight away. I'm always on my phone or finishing up chores when the night comes rolling in.

The problem comes with the fact that I get all worked up in whatever I'm doing at the time, and I end up having to pee. Really bad. But I'm busy, right? So I don't go.

I always end up really terribly desperate within an hour or two and I barely make it to the bathroom. The circumstances don't really matter so much, because that's alright and I can deal with that.


Problem #2 comes up when this ends up happening pretty much every or every other night and it feels like my bladder is getting a hell of a lot weaker because of it. I can't hold my pee for twenty minutes without feeling like I'm going to pee myself.

 On some level, this premature-peeing doesn't light the same nerve endings as actually being desperate to pee on a normal day so I don't notice how bad it is until it's too late.

So I know the obvious solution here would be to go before I'm desperate to, but I'm *busy* and *lazy* and I just don't really want to do that.

23,"I don’t have an issue with written things that I have time to edit, because I don’t *want* to lie and so I go back and change the untruths that get in. 

However when texting or physically speaking to someone I have real issues. When asked a question lies just pour out of my mouth, I can’t even stop them. If it’s someone I’m close to I usually backtrack and say something along the lines of ‘wait, no, that’s not true, let me think’ and then after considering it properly I’ll answer truthfully. 

With new people it’s a massive issue. Once I’ve lied I’m too embarrassed to go back on it and then it’s awkward later on when they bring up a lie I’ve completely forgotten about and I have to convince them they misremembered— obviously that only works for little things. For big lies it’s horrid because I have to keep adding on whenever they’re asked about and it’s just so stressful. 

The worst part is I very rarely even want to lie and certainly have no reason, bc I’d say over half of my lies put me in a more negative light than a positive. It’s like they just come out and afterwards I’m left wondering why on earth I just said that.

28,"Hi, kind of freaking out right now and needed advice. Basically I've been second best my entire life, and it just hit me that that's probably all I'll ever be. And when I say second-best, I don't mean academically or anything like that really, I mean in relationships.

For context, I'm 19F, living in Ireland and in my first year of college. I was supposed to have 4 other roommates but, because of covid, its just 2 of them here with me. And it's been awful. They automatically became best friends, despite the fact that one of them moved in a whole month after the rest of us. I had become friends with one of them, I'll call them Mike, and we were getting along really well, and I thought that I had finally made a friend all by myself, without them being a friend of a friend first. But then my other roommate, I'll call her Mary, moved in about a month later and immediately I was cast aside. It was easier when the other two roommates were here, but now, because of covid, they've both gone home as they've no in person classes whereas the other 2 and I have in person labs and tutorials.

Whenever we go to the shop for food, I end up wandering around alone in the shop while they go off and do their own thing. I sort of became friends with a guy in one of my lectures at the start of the year, and the same thing happened. He started blowing me off to meet them instead, and when he comes over to work on schoolwork together, I sort of end up getting ignored.

It's getting to the point where I don't even want to go into the kitchen, because I know they'll be there. They're always there, either watching their lectures, talking to randomers on omegle or smoking weed at any point in the day. I've started going to the shop alone, instead of with them, because it's just so much easier than knowing that they just don't want to spend any time with me at all apparently.

And the worst part is, this has been happening my entire life. The 2 girls that I would consider my best friends, I know that I would jump in front of a bullet for them, but they could replace me in 2 seconds with one of their other friends. My friends at work are only friends with me because my brother worked there first and they were friends with him. I've never been able to make friends, and any time I have, they've been a friend of a friend, and always liked that friend more.

I really don't want to spend my entire life being second best to everyone in my life, over and over again.

my father is an abusive narcasstic gaslighter.  
\-choked my older brother on a family vacation and denies it  
\-tells insane stories that are lies to make himself seem better than he is  
\-he's a pathological liar  
his wife is exact same  
\-denies everything  
\-purposely tries to harm my mental health  
\-alocholic  
\-uses me as her slave  


both of them deny my needs, they haven't bought me any school supplies, new clothes, make a doctor appoitment when I need one. i dont even have a bed, i have a egg shell mattress topper as my bed.   
i dont think its for money reasons as they have boughten a new massive tv, both smoke heavily, she drinks, my father and her spend money on mobile games. my father makes this dish called ''bachelour spaghetti which is noodles, butter and salt. he buys really unhealthy foods and proceeds to comment on my weight etc when he makes these meals and is obese with numerous health issues. i get told things ''never happened'' and that its all in my head. i was told if i keep cutting ill be grounded and when i brought that comment up again his wife said ''id never say that, its in your head''  


i struggle alot with my mental health and have for 5 years, they have done nothing more than make a therapist appoitment, although once i found one i enjoyed he canceled the appoitments with her. i have a hard time sleeping at night and have panic attacks and the most ive seen for treatment is cbd oil and melatonin.  


i see a social worker at my school sometimes, and im wondering if if these things are worth mentioning ? will cps be called ? is this even abuse or am i being dramatic ?",26Nov2020,1
41,"Last Sunday while my brother was driving to my house for Thanksgiving, he stopped near a church to clean up after his cat who had made a mess in the cat crate. During this, his cat ran out and hid underneath a shed by a church, just out of reach. After trying to coac the cat out for an hour my brother called animal control and they set up a trap and told him that he would be better off leaving, the next day the cat wasn't in the trap so animal control took it away, and then the following day looked under the shed and the cat was gone.

My brothet has some mental health issues and this cat means so much to him. Hes so broken up about it all and we don't know what to do. The church is about 4 hours away from us so its not like we can just go outside and look, animal control is already printing out and spreading flyers and even put a commercial up on local TV, but we just don't know what to do.

How can I get the cat back and how can I help my brother now or if we never find the cat?",26Nov2020,1
42,"So this is my first ever Reddit post ever so sorry about any mistakes that are made. So here it goes my dad who I decided to live with because I was living with my mom and life wasn’t going anywhere and I decided that I needed a fresh start. So I move a state away using the last little bit of money that I had to come live out here. I start this job at a mechanic shop a month after moving here just to dip my toes in the field to see if this is a career worth investing time into. I love it but dad has to drive me every morning and I’m embarrassed that I still have to be driven and picked up every day. So I start looking at dealerships to see what my options are. I find one and talk to my dad about it and he says that I’d be better off buying used from a private seller. The problem with that is that I’m broke att and couldn’t buy a car outright. So my dad starts dating this girl and she has a car that she wants to get rid of and I can do monthly payments on $400 a month with insurance and at a cost of $4000 dollars for the whole car. Me being new to the mechanic life I change what I can see on the car that needs to be replaced( wipers, oil, air filter, etc, etc) just basic maintenance shit. So as I am learning more and more about cars and what’s minor in convenience to holy shit you need to fix that now I start see everything wrong with my car. Wheel hub bearings, power steering pump leaking bad, the suspension that needs a total overhaul, just little things that pop up over time and that I take notice of. So at this point I’ve consigned to myself that yes this car needs some serious work done to it but I agreed to pay for this car and I’ve already put $600 into paying this woman for the car. (Quick side note my dad and his girlfriend said that it was maintained by her ex husband who was a mechanic and said it was properly maintained.) now with over 200000+ miles on it I’m feeling pretty good that this was a good buy and that yes there are some things that need to be fixed but that’s just the cost of owning a vehicle. Now I didn’t sign an agreement with her and she didn’t just had over the title to the car we just have a verbal agreement that I will pay her $400 a month with her insurance covering the car until I pay it off. Now here’s where the problems with the car start popping up left and right. I’m not going to go into everything wrong with my car but if I bought every part that needs to be replaced not including labor because I’d be the one fixing the car it’s about $2500 just to get it to the point of ok I can drive this without the engine and transmission blowing up or one of the wheels flying off after I hit a bump in the road. That being said I currently have put $2300 in car payments not including insurance into paying the car off. I don’t feel her asking price is fair due to how much shit I have to fix on it to feel safe driving it. What should I do to convince them that the car isn’t worth what they’re asking without coming across a a greedy asshole. I really am appreciative to them but it’s getting to the point that I don’t know if I even want to keep the car if I pay it off.",26Nov2020,1
43,"I have three issues in my house right now.
1) the previous tenant (actually two tenants ago) broke a bunch of windows. The one in our breezeway is still windowless, though the landlord did remove the broken glass about the time we moved in just over a year ago. He keeps saying he will replace it, which we really want since we don’t have anywhere else to keep things like our yard equipment and my bike, but hasn’t.

2) the door handle to the porch door was never installed. For some reason, between the viewing of the house and our move in date a couple weeks later the door or the porch/three seasons room was removed. We did eventually get him to install a new one, but he never installed the handle so the door will swing open when it is windy (and it has been frequently). My cat likes to hang out on the porch and luckily hasn’t gotten out. But since I discovered that this is going on we haven’t been letting her have her outside time (she is not pleased). 

3) we have mice. This seems like it’s not at all his problem so why should he care, but also this isn’t my building and I really don’t know how to even begin dealing with the issue. They came in with the winter, and as much as the pets love this, I don’t. I have a 9 month old and the last thing I need is him coming in any form of contact with a mouse, dead or alive, or their droppings. I rescued one of the babies from my cat just a few mins ago and finally drew the line and filled out an online maintenance request with all this info as well as a picture of the mouse that my brother accidentally stepped on yesterday. 

I don’t know how to do handy man stuff, and I pay rent on time every month so I don’t have to. I also have a job, a baby, a side business, and frankly I like to get to relax once in a while. Crazy, right? But I’m not crazy for thinking these are all landlord issues right? Or that they need to be dealt with promptly? If nothing else, leave the window, leave the door, just get rid of the damn mice!",26Nov2020,1
44,"I'm someone with bad anxiety ( often struggle to sleep, have panic attacks). I'm a very thorough, risk-averse person who thinks through every decision to ensure nothing can possibly go wrong/ it's definitely the right decision, to the point of annoying others.

I feel like I NEED certainty beyond a shadow of a doubt to do anything and I hate it. I need help from Reddit or my parents as a 21 year old (!!) to teach any kind of decision.

47,"Hello, I am a teen that has not worried too much about the coronavirus until now. A couple of days ago my mom started coughing a little bit but she could still easily do everyday tasks. Being the awesome human being she is she immediately made my dad and I stay a good distance away at all times. Today before she got to work she talked to me about how she felt weak and how she wanted to stay home but I was at zoom classes and before I knew it she was gone so she basically went to work. I don't want to get into specifics because I don't wanna give a full Facebook profile of my mother and because I don't know much but basically her job involves her taking care of my grandpa every day except weekends. A few months before (maybe uh two months or three months) my mom talked to my aunt about another caretaker (i presume a physical therapist because my mom already does a splendid job taking care of my grandpa by herself) who wore a mask around my grandpa but the dumbass would decide to take it off whenever she talked to my grandpa???????? So naturally, my mom was pretty as she would say ""frustrated"" at this and yeah I could complain all day about the caretaker but she's not that relevant in this story. Okay, so today my other aunt (I have four aunts excluding my mom) called my mom on her phone and said something about my grandpa, and basically my mom and aunt kind of panicked a little bit. So she called my OTHER aunt (the aunt she talked about when she was talking about the caretaker) and they all started panicking but lessening it because they knew I could hear them.

50,"9 months ago I got my hair bleached from a natural medium brown color to a dirty blonde color. It was an impulsive decision due to a breakup I had.

Almost immediately I felt terrified. When I looked in the mirror, I thought that I looked pretty, but I didnt feel like myself. I felt (and still feel like) I defaced my body by bleaching my hair.

My hair grows really fast, and along with 9 months passing, my roots have grown in pretty dang far. My mom is pressuring me to do something about it and im really scared. I dont want to put any more dye on my head, but I also don't want mismatched hair. This is extremely hard to explain.

There are a few options I could take. The most attractive one (to me) being that I can dye the bleached hair to my natural hair color and progressively  cut off my hair as it grows back in so eventually all of the bleached/dyed hair is removed from my head. 

The second option is that I could do that but instead of going straight brown, I could get dye that ""blended"" into the blonde part and gradually cut it off.

The third would be to simply get my roots bleached so I continue being blonde.

Now, each of these options terrify me, and ill explain why. For some reason, when I think about how my hair was permanently altered by the bleach, I feel disgusted with myself and depressed. It doesn't feel like my hair and my brain is rejecting it.

My hair would be too short if I were to cut off all bleached length, so that won't do. The longer I know that bleached hair remains attached to my head the more sad I get. But at the same time, I think I look very attractive as a blonde and im scared to go back to brown in case I dont like it. Im torn and this gives me consistent panic attacks just thinking about it.

Is there any way to get over this fear of bleaching my hair? Whats reddit's advice?",26Nov2020,1

I begged him to stop (by the time this happened i was half awake) but he continued ignoring me and i kicked him in his belly as response, i dont remember how hard i kicked him but he immediately gave me a angry look and started beating me up. We had a huge fight and he tried to suffocate me but my mom and grandma came and then after the fight he started to call me a son of a bitch and many other insults. I ignored him and shortly after he went to work. Thats just one of the many fights i had with my brothers.

52,"Hey all. Very active on Reddit on my main account but using a separate one for this in case my roommate stumbles across this somehow. Kind of a weird situation / request for advice but I’ll do my best to explain.

I’ve (M27) been roommates with my friend - let’s say Matt (M25) - for almost two years now. We’ve known each other for double that and have always been close. Things have pretty much been smooth sailing until recently. 
Obviously COVID has tested many different households but this seems especially odd lol.

I want to first mention I’ve already been worried about him as a friend this year. Being home all the time for COVID has not faired well for his waistline; if I had to guess (maybe poorly but) I’d say he’s put on 50+ pounds this year since the first lockdown in March. I’ve been wanting to politely ask if he’s doing okay mental health wise or if he needs help with exercise / diet etc but don’t want to overstep and offend him. Obviously, I’d be asking out of concern and nothing else. I think he’s pretty in denial about it too because he still hasn’t upsized his wardrobe, and anytime I’ve ever mentioned that he just brushes it off or says he did the laundry wrong or he’s put on some muscle. Various excuses. But it’s almost like he’s refusing to accept this has happened. I just would like to help if I can. He had already probably put on 25 or so pounds on top of this 50 prior to COVID just since last year when he was transitioning to his new job. So it’s just been a pretty drastic change for just over a year....

I decided not to say anything outright because I didn’t want him to get the wrong intentions, but now I’m second guessing. Lots of my food has been going missing. Way more than to just be me not remembering or my boyfriend having snacks when he is over. Like entire packages of lunch meat or cheese or bags of snacks or packages of meat etc. I have asked him directly several times now if he’s eating my food and he’s completely denied it each time. I know he’s making less money now because of COVID so maybe he’s desperate, but he also has put on at least 75 pounds this year!! Like he doesn’t need to be eating my food on top of his own just because he’s tight on cash - he’s clearly way overeating as it is. And even my boyfriend totally unprompted has mentioned Matt’s behavior to me as being off this year around the apartment (and about how desperately he needs to upsize his clothes - this poor guy is going out in public with his gut hanging out of his shirts).

Anyway, sorry to rant, but I need some sort of foolproof way to prove that he’s doing this. I wouldn’t even be that mad at this point if he just admitted to it but now I just need to get proof so I can force him to stop doing it. Any ideas short of a literal nanny cam? I can’t figure it out. He’s clearly doing it when he’s knows I’m not going to be home.

I also would like advice about talking to him about his weight or figure out what’s going on with him there - as much as this situation really annoys me, I’m still his friend and think this is all related to some bigger issue he needs to deal with? Idk. I want to clarify I’m not being an over dramatic gay and saying he’s obese when he’s only put on 10 pounds or something - I’m a very fit guy and know a lot about fitness and can usually guess a guys weight pretty accurately. We used to be the same weight and I’m nearly certain he’s put on at least 75 pounds just this year. That just worries me. Let me know your thoughts and thanks in advance!!",26Nov2020,1
53,"recently i’ve been dealing with a lot of anxiety and depression and it’s been really hard. i’ve always been a person who’s found it hard to open up emotionally and be vulnerable and i’m sure this is for a multitude of reasons. 

1) asian families and mental health issues are just something that aren’t dealt with mainly because my family just don’t really know what to do and most of the time just kinda hope that with time it’ll just pass...

2) i’m a VERY shy &amp; introverted person. i find it hard to socialise and communicate on a normal level so to open up emotionally is 1000x harder — hence why i usually just tend to keep quiet.

but obviously i know keeping quiet &amp; suppressing isn’t good so i opened up to a teacher i trust at my school. i’ve been to him a number of times already this year and we’ve had multiple lengthy conversations &amp; bless his heart because they genuinely help me so much because it feels nice to know someone actually cares and is willing to be so helpful — whether that be to offer advice or just listen &amp; he always reassured me I can always email/ask to chat anytime I need it.

But for some reason, I cannot help but feel an overwhelming amount of guilt. For me, I feel as though if I go to him too “frequently” (I say this lightly because I’m sure I’m over exaggerating this from anxiety) that he might get overwhelmed and feel that I’m “too much” to handle — I know what it feels like to be overwhelmed since I constantly feel that way 24/7 and I know how draining &amp; tiring it can be... to think I could possibly be putting someone else through that just really break my heart and leaves me with so much guilt. I really do feel as though I am burdening him, that he doesn’t deserve it. 

It’s thoughts like this that will convince me to just go back to bottling everything, to save any positive face that he might have left of me — but I know this isn’t healthy. 

I just feel so guilty.",26Nov2020,1
54,"My brother’s fiancé and I didn’t get off to a great start when we first met(before they were dating). Our personalities clashed immediately. After months of awkwardness, it all ended up coming to a head with an argument over the phone, in which I confessed to her and my brother that her attitude had rubbed everyone in my household the wrong way, not just me. We had a long period of silence but eventually ended up being more cordial for the sake of my brother. In the past few months, we had both been making efforts to be kinder to each other, but after my brother proposed, she refused to allow him to have me (his sister) or his female best friend on his side of the wedding party. Her way of compromising was asking me (but not his female friend) to be a bridesmaid. However, I think it will be awkward to be her bridesmaid considering our past and I don’t know any of her bridesmaids, yet I know all of my brothers groomsmen. She claims that her reasoning is that ‘it’s not traditional’ to have a woman among the groomsmen.

I began to realize that this was a problem and that there was only one real solution: actually talk to girls. I went to a party on campus and I went alone so that I wouldn’t be pressured by others. I ended up talking to a few girls and even though I was shitting-my-pants nervous, I ended up grinding with a girl and she kissed me on the lips/ made out with me. It was the only real success I had ever had with a woman. I decided that this was a better route. I knew I needed to constantly meet new girls/ talk to girls till it got to the point where I didn’t think about it anymore. Problem is quarantine deadass happened like right then.

61,"My ex broke up with me about a month ago now. Actually on the 30th it will be a month. Two weeks after we caught up, had the last hoorah sex and she said that she didn't wanna get back together with me. Which I understood, I hurt her by yelling at her and calling her names. I made sure to give her reassurance that I didn't mean those things, even though I know they'll stick with her for a while. She ended up staying the night. We had a great time, the last time we hung out.

That night I called her a few hours after she got home and told her that it was really nice hanging out with her and that I'm sorry that she felt like we weren't able to work things out. I let her know that I'm trying to work on my emotional reactivity and that I just got prescribed meds for my anxiety/depression and that I'm going to therapy to work on myself. I said that I still wanna get back together with her but honestly, in that moment, that I would not. I wanted to allow myself time to change for her, and myself.

She texted me after and said yeah, I agree with what you said and that we should also take it slow if we do get back together. But let's check in after a month to see if this is something that we want to do.

Now, after all that, it's been about two weeks. Which means we have two more weeks to go before we can contact each other. I've been doing everything in my power to change myself. I'm telling myself it's for me, but in reality it's for her. I obviously feel good about exercising everyday, working hard to find a job (i've been on unemployment for a while), eating right, sleeping right, and making sure I can do whatever I can to educate myself on the problems that I caused in the relationship. I know I can't do anything to sway her, to make her want to date me after this month is up, but I can't help to think that I'll be devastated if she doesn't want to make it work. In the end, all of this work will end up being for myself but I really don't care unless I'm with her.

I'm trying to find ways to go through that devastation early, to prepare myself for her to say she doesn't want to make things work, to prepare myself for the worst but I can't.

63,"My boyfriend (22M) of almost two years now proposed to me (21F) last summer in 2019, I was going on a trip for 6 weeks and asked him if we were serious after dating for a couple months since I was going and he said yes. Two days before I left we were talking and he proposed to me, he said “ I would propose” and I said yes. (Me and my boyfriend are both pakistani, and we come from Muslim families where dating is a taboo/not allowed and it is preferred that the boy and girl’s parents meet each other.) the next day he met my parents for the first time and agreed to bring his family over. When I came back after six weeks, a month later our parents met each other for the first time and the second time we went to their house and they said they liked me and would like to further proceed and do like a ceremony thing in the summer. My parents agreed (This was before covid-19 started). 

However the next month they came over, my dad asked my boyfriend’s dad  if they wanted to proceed with an engagement in the summer and they clearly said no. (I guess they made a decision too soon and changed their mind). For some reason, my boyfriend did not know this. When they were about to leave our house,  my mom gave his mom some clothes as a gift. They then left, but our families still kept in contact and a couple months later we agreed for an engagement ceremony after asking me and my boyfriend what we would like. We agreed to get engaged after graduating university because that’s what I wanted at the time, but later changed our minds and wanted to get engaged this year in the summer. We actually lived together for 8 months near our university pre covid so spent a lot of time together. When our mom’s talked around the same time my boyfriend’s mom told my mom said she hasn’t even brought an official proposal to my house yet and would do that soon. (Again this was before covid 19 started) however, after covid started our families had got cut off due to social distancing and we only saw each other on eid at my house and my boyfriend’s mom gave me a dress my boyfriend chose for me as gift. However, they never brought up anything engagement related. Later, they invited our families over at the park for a bbq and my boyfriend’s dad said that they wanted to invite some family friends to the bbq aswell but didn’t as they didn’t have an “any kind of official relationship” with our family yet and didn’t know what to tell their family friends about us. However my bf’s mom bought another dress and gave it to me that day. My parents liked the gesture but thought what my bf’s dad said was weird. Later my mom called my boyfriend  mom and asked him if they would like to proceed and be official because of what my boyfriend’s dad said at the park, as my mom doesn’t want me to hang out with my boyfriend before we are officially engaged, and my bf’s mom said everything was fine however she took what my mom said in a wrong context and thought she was rushing my marriage when she wasn’t, she just wants their to be an official title for our relationship after two years of dating. She later called my mom after my dad fractured his arm once as they do talk from time to time, later my mom called her just to say hi and she brought up the ceremony and said we’ll all talk about it when they come over to our house. We were doing renovations at the time and couldn’t  have anyone over so when it was done my mom called my bf’s mom again and they set a time to come over. However, I got the flu so we had to cancel. When I asked my boyfriend to reschedule he said they were busy with his sister’s birthday and also cause of higher covid cases and social distancing. My mom even called them but she said she count come as her husband was unavailable at the time but she never called my mom back to reschedule. However she recently texted my mom to ask about how my cousin’s wedding went last month.

My boyfriends parents are more religious/strict so we have to sneak around most of the time and I recently told him we can’t hang out much as we aren’t officially engaged and  asked him where our families are with this whole engagement thing and he seemed annoyed and said he doesn’t know how much our parents have talked. (I woke him up) I even brought up what his parents said for the third time they met, about not wanting to proceed right away, even though they asked first and he said he didn’t know when these conversations happened and that I’m being rushed. He also said he isn’t refusing to do anything and that he already gave me dates for December (which he did once briefly) but the next morning said he apologized and did he’ll bring them over again for a proper proposal. He said we’ll do it in Christmas break but he doesn’t really talk about it and when we got invited to go somewhere for a couple days during winter break, he said yes and didn’t bring up the engagement. We see each other 1-2 times a week as my mom doesn’t want us to hang out as much before a official proposal. My boyfriend even talked to my mom and told her we’ll get engaged in December as she wanted to know what his intentions were. We got an argument which turned to be very emotional that same night and my boyfriend asked if I wanted to legally get married out of impulse I think a month ago behind our parents backs as we can’t see each other often and it’s frustrating. but i refused to that as our education is really important right now and he understood and changed his mind again. I told him we should just get engaged and he said he understood that it’s a better idea and would tell his parents to come to my house but never did. My boyfriend does bring up marriage and the future and kids and we both love reach other a lot but he barely brings up our official engagement and I have to ask indirectly each time. and that makes me anxious because I want him to come to me through my family if we want to be together and make our engagement ceremony official. His parents seem to be okay with proceeding but they’ll only make a move if he tells them to as our families only meet each other cause of us. Also what do I do if he doesn’t bring the proposal by next month? 


TL;DR - does my boyfriend not want to get engaged anytime soon (with our families) anymore as he doesn’t really bring it up? even though he and me both bring up marriage and kids? His parents are okay with proceeding, but they’ll only make a move if he tells them to but he recently hasn’t even after he said he would after I got the flu and cancelled. I’m getting anxious what do I do if he doesn’t  bring the proposal by next month?",26Nov2020,1
64,"I’m a 23m, I snapchatted an old friend because I saw she was drinking on her story, I decided to snap a picture of myself drinking claiming a simple cheers. This was around when the pandemic started in March. She is still close with another old friend I knew, and was with her at the time, and they ended up adding me to a group Snapchat. We talked and got all caught up, and I assumed the next day they simply did it out of kindness and wanted to catch up. 

At first it was standard communication, it was awesome, but over time it simply became me talking to myself and sending snaps that they’d just view and never reply. So I decided to leave, it was nothing personal, but I just don’t want that. 

She messaged me about it and told her side of the story, and I took it with a grain of salt and just dropped it, maybe I was being irrational and expecting too much out of some old friends currently working their way through college. 

Started off consistent. Became the same thing again. I left again. Two weeks later I get texts from both of them, actually being yesterday, around the same time saying they hope I’m well, then immediately dive into asking why I’m upset at them. They proclaim that they were sad and confused I left. 

I told the other girl/friend that I just don’t see the point of me being in the groupchat when they literally never talk or say anything in it. Her excuse was that,

“We are both always doing things and not on our phones much, I’m sorry it made you feel that way. We wanted to each tell you that early on, so we wouldn’t come off as ignoring you (why we mentioned in group when we made it). I’m sorry you feel that way, we were confused when you left and upset.”

I want to make it clear that it would be week or a week and a half before one of the two would reach back or not at all. It wasn’t a day at a time. And they were barely complete messages. 

I got a little upset because I feel like they should very easily know the reason why I left the chat, so I got a little testy by saying that even though I’m also busy I’m capable of finding a few seconds to respond to their messages. She said ouch and that she’s leaving. 

I’m not looking to say that im right, or that their wrong, or vice versa. But I’m a bit of a softie and Im trying to get better at not allowing myself to get stepped on. I’ve never been in a situation like this before so some help would be nice.

65,"Title makes it seem as if i'm a straight up bitch but please hear me out. First time posting, apologies if there are errors anywhere. (also sorry for any grammatical errors im not a native speaker)

Backstory on why i do not want to talk to her: My mother cheated on my father when i was about 9, just after my (maternal) grandmother died.  It absolutely crushed me. I did notice this before though. She was constantly texting someone, saw some messages that very clearly were not for a friend, not a fun thing for a 9 y/o to find out. She left a letter, that i found saying she is leaving. My father got in contact with her somehow, but at that point she said that she was done with fighting or whatever. However, she agreed to come back for my sake. Things went smooth somehow for a few months. I felt like everything was fine. Then again she left saying she needed space. I just remember being very confused. I just lost interest in everything. She came back and left yet again. This time with all the jewellery : Hers and whatever was gifted to me. She texted my father that she couldnt do this any longer. That day was the first and only time i saw my father cry. And boi that shit hurt. Well, she never came back, left a very big scar mentally. We found out however that the second time she left she married someone; same guy she was texting, without divorcing my father first. I isolated myself, stopped talking to people, and just lost hope altogether. I worked hard though, only academically. Socially i was and still am a very big mess. I can't trust people, can't talk to new people, have very bad adaptive abilities to new changes in life. So I just started hating her. I havent met her since i was 11, I am 20 now.  

I never got to be close with her father though. He somewhat supported her decision of moving away. So i kept my distance from him as well . A few days ago, I got to know that he passed away. She wants me to console her now. I wrote that , ""I am sad for the loss and i am really sorry to him for not being in touch with him"", but i dont want to talk to her and i dont know what else to do. Her side of the family thinks im being an AH. My father's says do what i feel like. He has talked to her already and paid his respects. I prayed for my grandfather but I cant make myself talk to her. I cant talk to my friends about this, none of them know what actually happened. So im turning to people who have no idea who I am.

TL;DR my mother cheated on my father and left when i was 9. Left and came back twice, third time went away with all valuables. Messed me up in the process. Wants me to console her now that she faced tragedy. But i just dont want to do anything with her. Need advice on how to console or if i should even do that.",26Nov2020,1
66,"A bit about myself, I’m 16, Canadian, recently moved and now live with my dad instead of brother, mom, dad, and pets. And I’m very very lonely, always have been. I’m going to a new school as well, which is big as I dropped out in grade 9 (now in grade 11, and no, not behind). And lastly, I’m very mentally unhealthy (bad depression, anxiety, adhd, borderline personality disorder, etc).

Here’s what I’ve been struggling with, to get a better idea of what I need to fix
1. I’m struggling in school a lot, depression and life weighing on me makes it impossible to do schoolwork I have no desire to do in the first place. And that makes me wanna drop out again, I’ll try to coast through and graduate but it’s very difficult when I don’t care and don’t have any desire to pursue higher education past highschool
2. I smoke weed to help with these problems and feelings, a LOT. Especially when I start getting worse mentally. At worst I smoke around 5 joints a day, at best, one at night before bed. This has obviously not been helping
3. I’m incredibly lonely and just... isolated... alone. It’s a very hard thing to deal with; having literally no one to turn to. Like I mentioned, I have no friends or even acquaintances, I don’t speak to any of my family anymore other than my father. And our barely existent relationship consists of verbal abuse and nothing else. 

I want to do great things in life, I want to become a better person, heal myself from my issues, and be done with all these problems. But I’m extremely lost on how to do so, any help is GREATLY appreciated

67,"So I need some advice/opinion on something. Last year I went on vacation with a family friend during the summer (keep in mind it was just me and her and we were there to have a good time and just catch up on our lives) and she did me dirty. To make a long story short, this family friend matched with a guy on tinder and they ended up having sex in the ocean right on front of me. Now I didn't see them having sex because it was dark out but I did hear it while I was just sitting there on the beach chair awkwardly. So the family friends family is inviting my family to an air bnb type of house somewhere in upstate NY for new years and I'm obviously going to go because this is my family. I'm thinking about confronting her about what happened because I've been avoiding her ever since the incident (like not answering her texts and muting her on instagram).

69,"Something weird is going on with my body, but I've been too nervous to get help.

(F18) For about 8 months now, I've been dealing with a loss of sensation in my clitoris. Not completely, but very significantly. I have no idea what the cause is.

I haven't told my parents/siblings about it because I don't want to share the details with them. I've been putting it off out of sheer embarrassment because of how awkward that is to talk about with parents. I don't feel comfortable opening up to my mother or sister about it because they tend to judge me a lot. My father on the other hand isn't judgemental, but it is still just awkward to describe something like this to him.

I'm feeling frustrated with myself because I messed up my chance today. I really psyched myself up earlier to finally open up and tell someone about it, but I let the fear and shame get the best of me again. I had a general physical exam today and when my doctor asked if I had any problems, I hesitated and said no.  He saw that I hesitated and asked me why I had to think about it, but I still didn't open up. I just feel like I'm turning what should be a small thing into such a huge deal, but I can't shake the feeling.

Luckily, I'm going back in 2 days for some other unrelated tests, so that gives me another chance to tell him. Can I please have some encouragement to finally open up about this?

Also, is there any way for me to have the details that I share with the doctor kept confidential from my parents despite me being under their health insurance? My dad would be driving me there, so they'd of course know that I'm going to the doctor, which isn't a problem for me. I just don't want specific details about my visits to be shared with them.

Another thing: How could I politely turn down any questions from my family members without sounding suspicious? This issue isn't about pregnancy or STDs or anything since I'm not sexually active. At the same time, I'd still rather keep it between myself and the doctors. It just feels like I'm expected to tell them everything about my doctor visits, which really takes away my privacy.

70,"Hello all, I am looking for advice because I don't know how to handle a situation in my family life right now. I ask to keep it blunt and honesty but I ask you guys not to be judgemental towards me or my fiance as she is not the problem in this situation. 

Me and my fiance have been together for 5 years now we have been together through hell and back almost literally in a sense and through it all we made it out together and ended up with a beautiful daughter to show for it. We are doing very well in life now whereas we used to live in a damn tent together at one point. 

The problem we are facing right now is a problem that gets my blood boiling and I already hate the guy by default and I want to break this guys skull into pieces (just a reflection of my anger towards this situation)

My fiance had two kids before I met her with a guy who was in jail for constantly putting his hands on her. In the beginning me and my fiance were best friends nothing more then that and to the kids I was ""Uncle Jonny"" I had been in these kids lives since they were toddlers and now I am raising them as my own, while this has been happening throughout the year this guy got out of jail and into a halfway house and then locked up again after getting into a new relationship and also beating that woman as well. 

As time went on my fiance opened up and told me other things about how he snuck into her best friends bed and tried to sexually molest her on some creep ass shit and when confronted about it he admitted it, also other girls have come forward to close friends about how he sexually assaulted them as well. 

So now the cocksucker is out of jail again and my fiance is on edge because she is conflicted on how to handle the situation, he is the kids biological father and I am just the step father, but I have done more for these kids then this guy could ever dream of and I am raising them in my image and have been here through most of their lives while he has been mia. 

Now my fiance has been avoiding him when he hits her up to talk to the kids and now he has started to make a big deal out of it threatening to call dcf and ""go to court"" while he is in a halfway house. 

In my point of view I do not want this guy around my kids at all, he keeps coming in and out of jail getting their hopes up and then crushing them everytime because he is 40 years old and doesn't know how to be a fuckin man and take care of his children and then on the other hand this guy is a fuckin creep and I know that there is nothing that this guy could do that would surprise me but I don't want to take the risk at all with this guy, I want to pull the plug for good. 

My fiance gave into him and let him facetime the kids for his birthday after he threw a fit threatening us with dcf and court. I am fuckin livid and I want to kill this guy, she will not let me talk to him because she knows if I do it will not end well for him but I am also on probation for things I have done over half a decade ago and do not want to risk losing my kids for putting this guy in a coma.

71,"So I'm (M18) trying to become an electrician for a local union, and I just got a letter for a test date, and at this point, I don't know if I should dread it, or be happy because its next Friday, but I know for a fact I haven't been the best at test-taking.

So some past context, the reason I chose electrician was honestly that I was at my wit's end, College was a dead dream and a waste of time for me, The military, army, navy, Marines weren't for me. So I just went with the best trade. Was it a hail mary? Probably but honestly I've also had a hard time getting motivated into things, which has been a paradox for everything I've tried. So when my parents brought up being an electrician, I was just like F\*ck it, Ill try it. 

A little later I started questioning it, but I then dismissed it because the pay would be good because I didn't want to go to college and completely bomb 4 years and end up with a degree that probably got me nowhere. Not to mention I had a hard time getting through High School (Anywhere between Ds-Cs-Bs and some A's)

I've already gone through 2 jobs thus far, both part-time as a city lifeguard and a UPS driver helper(Current Job), and honestly, I've looked at this electrician job as an opportunity to make something of myself, but if I cant even get past an hour and a half test of math, reading, and writing then what am I? 

At this point, I'm at my wit's end and just going to try and crunch out this next week with studying, but if any advice could be offered on this, Id really appreciate it..",26Nov2020,1
72,"I am a 15yr aunt of a picky 8yr, who I will address as EL. Her nan is usually here to take care of her, but she has to work and sleep most of the time, so it's up to me and my brother to babysit EL. Her nan is gone by dinner time, and she makes her a plate before she leaves for work. When she's gone, EL will throw her food away and cry for something else. When I tell her no and that she should have eaten what was given to her in the first place, she'll throw a temper tantrum and call her nan/mother. Often that will fail, since they're busy most of the time, so she'll just continue to throw a fit.   


I am not really sure how children work, so all I can really do is leave EL there to sulk. If we weren't dealing with financial problems, I don't think we would have such a problem giving her what she wanted..

Having had so little contact with him, I've always been aware that there's this whole culture/side of my family that I don't really know much about. 
I know my dad wasn't born in Ireland but my fanily was really proud of their heritage. I feel alienated from it, but it isn't exactly something I had any control over. I've always wanted to know more about this part of my family, but there's a part of me that's worried that if I try to learn more, people will think I'm either doing it for attention or acting like one of these annoying Americans who's like ""wElL iM aCtUaLlY TwO fIfThs iRisH"".

78,"Hi! i’m 16 and a hostess at a restaurant. There is another hostess who is 19. I have worked here for 6 and a half months, and she’s been here 3 weeks. 

I just really don’t think she’s a good fit for this job. she is constantly on her phone in front of customers, she walks away in the middle of me training her, and she can tend to have a bad attitude- to the point where i’ve already had multiple customers complain to me about her. ((The next 2 paragraphs are about some specific incidents and how our positions work- not necessary to read, so skip if you don’t want to read it))

I’m not the type to complain so i held my tongue, but recently we’ve butted heads over something. At the restaurant i work at, the hostesses take to go orders. The “senior” hostess (me) focuses on to go orders on the weekend, and the other hostess focuses on to go orders on the weekdays when i’m not there. She has made it very clear that this is not enough for her, so i compromised and said she could take walk-in to go orders, and i’d do call-ins. 

This really isn’t ideal because she takes a very long time to take orders because she won’t let me train her. Everytime i try to show her how to use the computer, she walks away while i’m doing it. But i get how she feels so i let her do those orders, even though it makes the job harder for both of us. But it all came to a head this sunday when she used our second phone to answer the phone while i was talking to a customer, and spoke over me to take their order. Not only is this unprofessional but it’s just straight up disrespectful. With everything else that’s happened, I want to tell my manager because i think she’d be better suited as a waitress. She actually started to train to be a waitress, but we had a management change, so she’s not anymore. 

What would be the best way to tell my boss about her without seeming rude or like i’m complaining? I really just want to find a solution because it’s making work way harder than it needs to be.",26Nov2020,1

81,"I'm a 22yo that built an incredibly strong friendship with my work colleague who is 36yo. We got to a point of talking about how we miss each other all the time and talking about how much we mean to each other and we're feeling something stronger than friendship. We are on a 4/4 roster so when we were on our 4 days off I would stay at her place all the time (mind u I always slept on the couch when I decided to stay cause we hadn't decided whether we wanted to be at a intimate stage and she has had bad experiences with previous partners so we cuddle and stuff then she go into her room) where we would do things like watch movies together, taking her out and just doing cute shit while I also built a strong relationship with her young son. We got so close to the point when I last seen her we hooked up and I stayed with her the whole night just talking about us before I went home to get ready for work the next morning. The night we hooked up she told me that she really liked me but she just can't be with me because she'll ruin what we have now (as in our really close friendship) the thing that fucking sucks is I really thought about alot whether I wanted to be with someone who was much older, and I decided I wanted to commit to her. Her being happy makes me happy but man I fucking hate that it can't happen or that we can't try. Since we talked about staying friends we've taken what feels like a massive step back even just as friends from how we were before, like she asked if we can stop texting each other things like ""I really miss u kiss emoji"" and calling each other ""babes/babe"" because her son seen the text between me and her, and I understand of course like we aren't together but it still fucking hurts not being able to tell her that I'm thinking about her all the time when we've always said how we can't stop thinking about each other to now thinking she doesn't even feel anything anymore, like it just hurts. Texting is super different and feels like we text as just friends that aren't all that close, at least that's what I feels like I dunno. Like today she asked me if I was doing ok cause I mentioned I wasn't sleeping well and so I came up with some bullshit story so she didn't think my issues were about her cause I don't want her to worry and feel bad but man I'm in so much pain cause I thought there might've been a chance or at least we could've tried to make things work. I feel that our age difference is what ruined our chances, cause she's mentioned it multiple times and tried to say things like calling me 10yo and herself 59yo in a joking way, but it feels like she's talking herself out of her feelings but I dunno. I now have to see her everyday where she still hugs me and puts on a smile while I sit there and act normal while in pain on the inside not wanting to look at her cause all I want to do I hold her and say that I love her. Such a shit feeling man.

82,"Hi, so one of my ex friends which i haven't talked to in almost 4 years made a tik tok video about me, sent to me by one of my friends, in which she mentioned my full name. In that video she kept calling me 'toxic', 'trash' and talking about how i traumatized her when it was the other way around. Now i realized why i lost so many friends, god knows what she told them about me. So what should i do now? She has like 9k likes on it. Should i message her? My parents suggested that i go to the police but i'm scared of what she'll do with me next, i had the worst panic attack when i saw it and i don't want to make things worse but i don't want her to talk shit about me either. Any advice would be very much appreciated, thanks",26Nov2020,1
84,"For a majority of my life I have endured a lot of abuse at the hands of my family. I have a slew of traumas that I’m beginning to fix with the help of my wonderful therapist.

I am deathly afraid of men, all of the male adult figures in my life have been horrible to me. Specifically my dad, he physically, emotionally, and mentally abused me for most of my life and I cannot stand to look at him and I feel uncomfortable with him looking at me. 

I was also molested by my oldest brother so every male figure in my life has been ass, my mother was no different. I told her about how I was molested and she refused to believe me because he was her favorite. It’s been an endless cycle of abuse, my parents abused my siblings and I and in turn my eldest siblings unleashed their anger on the younger ones. 

With women it’s not as severe, my mother never acted like a mother. She was bitter and refused to provide help for me when I was in a deep depression. She even admitted she knew there was something wrong with me yet she never cared to help.

For this reason I get uncomfortable seeing a normal family in the media since it feels unrealistic. I feel extremely uncomfortable when people stare at me, I fear that they’re looking at me in a foul way. I also hate being touched. Anywhoosies, now that I’m 18 I feel lost. Im terrified of men, just being in the presence of a man makes my anxiety skyrocket. Even if they don’t have malicious intent I still flinch when they move or fail to make eye contact with them. I was at a doctor appointment today where they ran tests to determine if I had nerve damage, a female doctor and a male doctor? we’re doing these tests. A few of them involved him moving my arms around and i couldn’t stop trembling, it was embarrassing but I couldn’t help it. 

How do I overcome this fear? I don’t want to feel on edge and terrified going somewhere anymore.",26Nov2020,1
85,"I (21M) have insane mood irregularities constantly,  some days I contemplate ending it, the next day I feel nothing , the next day I'm happy as ever. I'm struggling as a distance learner to deal with not being able to go to my favourite hobbies ,meet new people and travel as I wanted to this year to accompany my studies. These things often burn inside of me and I feel in a constant state of bitterness and self loathing.

  I also vicerally experience painful memories, like I remember them and I get a sharp pain in my chest and tense up all over for a while until the thought goes away. This happens every hour or so several times.

To add to all this my sleeping failed me a long time ago, I tried to get early nights in when suddenly around 9pm I get a burst of energy like I just snorted a line of snow and I'm awake until at least 3am, I then can't get up early like I wanted , I then feel cranky and unmotivated all day after getting up late.

I'm scared to go see a doctor because the idea of being on some chemicals(medication) indefinitely in order to be able to function normally makes me feel absolutely disgusting,  not only paying for it but just the idea itself that I'm dependent on something... I want to fix myself naturally

Any advice is appreciated thank you",26Nov2020,1
86,"Good day! I’m a sophomore/ second year college student studying Chemical engineering and Chemistry, for the past year and a half I’ve been doing ftf &amp; online tuitions to pay off my own school fees which is barely just enough to get by and have some extra for pocket money, studying materials etc. In my first year of university, i did pretty well, so i opted for more courses than average, around 3 more than my peers, and took up more students to teach to earn. (My students are around the last 2 years of high school) i have about 8-10 students a week, so around 16-22 hrs a week, and about 2.5k a month, just to give a broad idea) since my parents are not very well-off, i felt that i shoudnt ask them for any money since q young, and have been earning an income since i could work. However for my past semester which just ended, i did so very horribly that profs that took me last semester were q surprised with my performance. So simply saying my grades were a mess. Despite my grades last sem could be used as a buffer, it will still drop by q a bit. So when i graduated high school, it didn’t come across my mind to apply for any scholarships, which now think thinking back i should have T-T. Using my grades this sem, i believe I wouldn’t have any chance during the scholarship selection rounds. I’m very worried that this one semester would affect my entire 4 years, and drag my results down, and I wouldn’t be able to graduate with a good first degree honours. So from today, any advice/ encouragements for me, so i may either improve my grades/ not worry so much/ financial advice? 

Thanks to everyone who would be replying!",26Nov2020,1
87,"TL:DR

The cat I've been taking care of for the past months, the owner has now appeared out of nowhere claiming that the cat is hers and I'm stealing her cat . The owner claims the cat is an outdoor one, however it doesn't have a collar, was in  scrawny condition when I met him, also had fleas and worms when I took him to the vet, meaning he wasn't taken care of. In addition the registered owners of the cat were contacted several times by the vet and they never responded.  This woman is threatening to take me to court over this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since the pandemic started in January and a bit earlier there has been a cat which walks by my backyard and general home area, after some nights of observing him, I decided to give him some food (the cat didn't have a collar or anything and always have branches or burs in its fur), and give it a place to sleep in my backyard. I made a little catbox so he could sleep inside it and be protected from the elements. After some months of this the cat eventually grew accustomed to me and even friendly (he'd follow us anywhere in the backyard area). At this point I didn't know who's cat this was so I wanted to check if anyone posted about a missing cat, I then took him to the vet to get him checked for a microchip (which he had but the previous owners had moved apparently and left the cat). After contacting the previous owners, and with no reply. I decided to start treating him like my own cat, by letting him into the house and sleepover whenever he wanted (he'd only want inside at night or when the weather was bad, otherwise he'd be out and about). Almost 2 months later,  still actively searching for the actual owners of the cat, we find out that some children are the owners of him, but they said that he doesn't get along with their own house cat so they let him outside instead and they only see him in the mornings. After this encounter things seemed fine however, maybe 2 weeks later I get a call from an angry mother telling me that her children are worried about where their cat is, and also that she will go to court if we don't release her cat (we didn't have the cat at the time, he must've just been roaming around). Anyways she speaks in a very aggressive tone and threatens to go to court over this cat, and states how we ""thefted her cat"", when in fact I just give the cat food and shelter, what's more, is I said she should take better care of her pet because it was clearly negligent behaviour to be leaving your pet out at night in storms and any other weather events that occurred during the past year, to which she just ignored and stated it's not my business, and I should stay uninvolved. However this cat was without a collar scrawny and always scrappy when I found him, and when I took him the vet, they found a number of issues with him (worms, and fleas) which were left untreated (clearly the mother didn't care for this cat).  She then went on to say that she is a lawyer and would have no issue going to court (basically just trying to drill in the fact that she can go to court). Also after receiving the call from the angry mother I decided to call the vet, to confirm that the mother was the owner of the cat, to which the doctors laughed and said that they hadn't been able to contact the owners of the cat after multiple attempts. I'm unsure of what to do, if I should just ignore her calls and claims, or if I should try to fight back and go after her for claiming this cat as her own when she has been a negligent pet owner (would that work out?) 

also, I'm pretty mad about the fact that her go-to move was to bring it to court, I feel like that is an abuse of power for a lawyer, especially for such a small issue like this.",26Nov2020,1
88,"I often feel like im an asshole in the way that i speak to people sometimes when i really don't mean to be, i spoke on this problem recently with a new but good friend and confidant from my job who assured me to my disbelief that i was a thoughtful and caring person who is loved and appreciated but i find it so hard to accept that when i find myself in a situation after having just said something to someone and i get a really strange and upsetting feeling that it may have come out sounding wrong or bad. I do try to put thought and take some care in the things that i say and do but even when i do this i often get this same strange feeling after i say whatever it is that i said, and even when i know ive said the right thing, i get this feeling about my tone even when i feel like my tone was good.

89,"I (24f) have been with my bf (28) for almost three years. He has a child from a previous relationship. The mom lives 7hrs from us so we don’t see her often. The mother has never been a saint. Heroin addict, beat her ex boyfriend, fakes pregnancies to get her ex to stay, lied at court over custody. However, she’s been on a good streak for a few months. I’ve developed a relationship with her to keep things cool and collected. About a month ago the same boyfriend she beat up, turned and beat her up. I’m not all for beating women (or anyone in that case), however I wouldn’t call her a victim. She did the exact same thing to him. However my bf went absolutely insane and got super involved. Since then our relationship has been rocky. 


He said it’s stress from school, his child, covid, unemployment, etc. and I believed him. He asked me to move out for a but so he could get his thoughts together and cool his depression. Which I happily obliged.  My bf and I plan on getting married in the next few years. I visited him today and was watching his child while he was at a doctors appointment. I was doing schoolwork and needed extra paper, so I went and grabbed a piece from his notebook. (Something he does to me as well) I wasn’t snooping. But as I opened the notebook I saw a letter titled “to my one and only, it has been X years since we met” and a whole entire love letter explaining how proud of her he is and how his ignorance kept him from loving her in the past. 


Well....I didn’t meet him X years ago. He met the mother of his child at that exact time period. They never dated, they both insist they hate each other. She’s expressed this multiple times. I’m sick to my stomach. I know he’s not actively seeing her since she’s so far. He insists the notebook is years old and it could be a “short story” or a letter he wrote his HS girlfriend. I don’t even know what to do at this point. His grandmother just so happened to visit about 10min after I found it and said he probably wrote it after the incident with her now ex and felt bad. Which makes sense. But just the sight of my bf makes me disgusted. I don’t know what to do.",26Nov2020,1
90,"I’m asking because normally I’m overly nice and let ppl walk all over me and if someone tried to rip me off I’d just let them. 

But lately I’ve been learning assertiveness and to stand up for myself, and I know that this situation isn’t right, I’m just not sure how to deal with it. 

What happened is my cat ran out of her allergy pill refills. The vet said I had to make an appointment to get her checked up to get refills.

I didn’t feel safe doing this due to Covid, and their staff not social distancing. I asked if they could please keep the prescription going until after Covid, and they gave me a huge hassle and finally agreed to do a phone consultation (I was kinda expecting like a zoom appointment or something), keep the prescription going and then make an appointment for a physical after Covid restrictions let up.
The vet forgot to phone me at the scheduled time, so I called her 20 mins later, she talked to me for a few minutes about nothing basically, she just said the same thing as the secretary about how normally they had to do a check up but this time they’d wait until Covid was over. But then I find out they are charging me 60+ bucks for the phone call alone. That’s a rip off to me especially since they still want me to book an actual appointment and this wasn’t an appointment like I thought it would be, idk what it was supposed to be idk why she’s even charging me 4 that. 

After that, the secretary had issues doing payments over the phone so she told me I had to come into pay! I didn’t want to go inside in the first place due to Covid. 

Later I phone back and ask about e transfer and talk to another secretary who says they do e transfers, so why didn’t they tell me before???? I told her I wasn’t satisfied with their customer service and she became rude and refused to talk to me more, and wouldn’t let me my file complaints. 
So after all of this now I’m wondering maybe I shouldn’t even pay for it. 

I’m not going back to them either way, I’m switching to another vet. 

But do u think it’s wrong for me to not pay that 60 dollars? I mean I just don’t feel like I should have to in the first place, I don’t even know why that really short phone call would cost anything, or at least so much.",26Nov2020,1

92,"I know this may sound silly to some. But I used to work at a Panera bread, I nearly worked there for a year and a half. When I first came to the place everyone there was super cool I quickly became close friends with everyone including managers, my girlfriend also worked there too and we’re best friends we never argue. It was the most fun job ever, you’d come in joke as loud as you want, be as obnoxious as you want, laugh as loud as you want, (I mainly closed) work with friends get home and hop on ps4 with them. It was amazing and I have tons and tons of memories there. But good things don’t last forever and I knew that when I first joined the company that all of the amazing people there wouldn’t stay forever. I just never thought it’d happen so fast. 

Eventually workers left there was lots of drama at times but at the end of the day we all liked each other no matter what. About 5-7 cool people left. But I was becoming very good at the job, I’d train mit’s, train new employees, help customers, learned most positions, and had complete open availability. It felt like I lived there but I loved it. Even though I never got a promotion (due to corona) I never complained too much. But a girl joined the company, she was totally ratchet, annoying rude to everyone, and whenever you’d see her name on the schedule you’d go “god damn it.” 

I dealt with her for a long time but she had been the result of quite a few people leaving. But our general manager never cared. She would be passive aggressive to me a lot one minute she’d joke all fake the next she’d be cussing me out. She was tearing the crew apart and the job became sort of sad. Eventually after dealing with her cussing me out, calling me names, and making me look bad I quit. I tried to reason with my general manager several times but he wouldn’t do a damn thing. (He’s a nice guy but an alcoholic and a bad leader) 

I even went as far as going to Human Resources and reported everything he and she did to me. I don’t know if anything was done but I do miss the job badly. I work across the street as a cashier now and every time I leave work I look at my old job and reminisce. It was such a family oriented company every month we’d have a sort of party where we’d close early, they’d have food catered, and you can come wearing whatever you wanted. I literally have dreams about going back. Again I know it may sound stupid like “dude it’s a silly job to be sad over” but it really did mean something to me. And I’m not too fond of the job I have now, it’s boring compared to my old job. I used to be busy all day and now I just stay in the same place repeating the same 3 questions to old people checking out.

93,"I’ve (23m) been using a dating app for about 6 months and have very little luck on it. I’m just using it pretty casually and trying to see what happens. I’m not like in dire need of a relationship but my thinking is I should always put myself out there because you never know where “the one” is. 

A bit of backstory, when I use dating apps I’m pretty conservative with my likes. I only like people that I would genuinely be interested in having a relationship with. Casual hookups don’t interest me. As a male who’s stereotypical is to like every profile that comes there way I feel that I am completely the opposite. 

Anyway, I get a few likes on my profile (I mean like 1 every month or so) that like me first. About a week  ago I get one off a girl who I’m kind of on the fence about, I know that if I just came across her profile I would have probably not liked but I decided to like her back kind of from a place of boredom and how most of the time with the rest of my matches we talk for a day or two and then that’s that and we never talk again. 

But this girl talks to me, and for the first time on this app I feel like someone is actually interested in me and it’s not me trying to prove myself to be worth their time. 

The trouble is, and I know it’s only text, I don’t really feel anything towards her. Don’t get me wrong, we definitely get on and have same interests and same type of humour but I don’t feel attracted to her. 

So here is my conundrum; I feel as if I should go on a date with her as it’s we might hit it off but if I’m not feeling anything towards her now then will I ever? I personally can be attracted to a vibe and energy a person gives off that may not translate in messaging. But I kind of feel bad, as if I’m leading her on a bit and I don’t want to hurt any feelings. 

I’ve never been on a date using a dating app before so this might be a common thing.

97,"I’m male, 31, I’m reasonably good health but do struggle with some health issues alcohol probably isn’t helping (anxiety, GERD, migraines, stuff like that). 

Why I drink: well, it’s there. Life sometimes can just lack excitement. You get up, you go to work, you never act outside of what society deems acceptable, you don’t actually achieve a whole hell of a lot, it’s just tons of struggle all the time, and then - before you have to get up and do it all over again - there’s a few beers there. They don’t taste phenomenal or anything, but they do go down nice and after a few they really help to loosen you up a bit, give you an excuse/comfort to act out a little bit outside the box of normalcy, and clear up my usually anxiety-clouded mind a bit. Also, my whole family are all big drinkers, and connecting with them on that is a big deal. I honestly don’t have a whole lot of personal connection with the people in my life outside of our shared enthusiasm for drinking. And idk. It’s just kinda fun to be a little self destructive sometimes, to me. I’m not saying it’s a good idea to go full 80s Mötley Crue, but I’ve always kind of admired something about those people who light up a cigarette and drink a scotch like ‘oh hell we’re all gonna go anyways might as well enjoy it more here’. 

Why I sometimes think I want to quit drinking: well, it’s bad for you. I suppose having like a glass of wine with dinner sometimes actually may be tied to some health benefits (potentially, I don’t even know if I’m certain of that), but that’s not really the kind of drinking I’m interested in. I honestly typically don’t get real drunk, just a nice good buzz going. But I do that every single day. I’m a real extreme kind of guy and that’s the way that I like it, so I don’t see myself just ‘cutting back’. Again, that would not really be the kind of drinking I’m into. I basically will be either the guy who comes home and gets a bit of a buzz going every night, or I’ll quit and never drink again. And truth is, I worry about my health. A lot. That’s what my anxiety is all about, always. I obsess about it. And alcohol is giving me another thing to worry about. And, it’s a valid thing. Alcohol can really mess you up. And I don’t want to have some extremely painful, maybe even fatal organ problem years from now thinking ‘I wish I quit when I had the chance’. But then again, we are all gonna die, so maybe I should drink up. Also, I have to admit.. I kind of would get a kick out of quitting in a sense. I know I said I’m surrounded by drinkers, but I also have a tendency to play the natural contrarian to crowd behavior sometimes. I’ve always been the outsider, the different one, and I like it that way. Perhaps this should be another way I seek to do that. 

What do you all think? I’d really love to hear some other people’s thoughts on this that aren’t connected to my life.",26Nov2020,1

I have a fiancé who is going to college for a degree in international business.

My family has quite a few successful people that have either dropped out of college or haven’t gone at all, this includes my parents. My parents are very much interested that my sister and I get a good education, and they pushed me to go to college. And when I graduated from high school I wasn’t really given a choice but to go. I was more or less convinced that my dream job was in welding. I actually enjoy the trade and my first semester really helped me realize that. 

Going ,however, into my second semester I started to question that. I soon came to the realization that while I enjoy welding I want to be an entertainer(more specifically an actor/voice actor and I realize that those take a lot of work). Going into my 3rd and 4th semester is where everything started to go downhill. With the start of my general ed classes, my grades started to dip more and more. I kept trying to get my grades up however I can and have felt like it always came short as I could never truly grasp the content.

With me failing my classes, I put a hold on attending my final welding class to catch my grades up and then started to fail that class well. My motivation to continue drop and I have little to none left. I then started to really looking into what need to be done to become a voice actor.

I found out that for my dream career I don’t need a formal education but I will need to constantly work towards my goals and continue to be on the lookout for opportunities to practice and get training. As for welding it’s pretty much the same way but voice acting is a much more long term job in the long run(with little physical stress on the body).

My biggest problem is the way people would react in all honesty. I feel like I might somehow become a disappointment to my family, and even though my fiancé reassures me constantly that she has my back no matter what I feel like it may disappoint her too. But I don’t want to be in college forever because I’m constantly failing the most basic of college courses, and I feel that as long as I’m struggling with trying to not fail college I won’t have enough time to work on what I truly want to become. And I know that I’m not really gonna be famous any time soon or at all but my fiancé and all don’t care about being rich or well known as long as we are happy.

I have to go back and live with him over the Christmas period and all I can think about is how my clothes are going to be stinking of smoke, how the bathroom is going to be grim, how there will never be any decent food in the fridge/cupboards, what the state my childhood bedroom will be in considering I last left it spotless in February.

How is the child supposed to act like the parent in this scenario when the actual parent does not want to help themselves?",26Nov2020,1
108,"Basically as the title says, I'm worried that I'm unlovable. Or, I guess more specifically, I'm worried that I'm unable to cultivate healthy relationships with others. 

I have a decent amount friends, but I don't feel fulfillment from my friendships. Whenever I become friends with men, it seems like they tend to project their feelings onto me and create unhealthy attachments to me. At least three times in the past year, I've had men who I considered to be close friends kiss me in inappropriate situations (ie, we weren't on a date and they hadn't clearly communicated interest in me prior). It makes me really uncomfortable to think that I can't feel secure in my friendships with men because they don't actually value my boundaries or me as an individual -- it feels like they just like having a woman who's nice to them and talks to them. I don't feel seen or appreciated as an individual. I feel taken for granted. 

One of my close friends is struggling with some pretty bad addiction issues, and I've tried to support him as best I can. But our friendship is a bit uncomfortable for me because he asks me out like every week. I always try to laugh it off, but it bothers me that he won't stop asking me to be his girlfriend. I feel an unpleasant amount of responsibility for his well-being. If I don't talk to him as much as I usually do, he usually starts acting weird and asking me if he did something wrong. I want to continue being his friend, but I feel like he's really dependent on getting attention from me, so it puts me in a difficult position. I'm graduating from college in about a month, so I've been trying to finish up assignments for my classes and apply to jobs. It's difficult to focus on these things when I feel like I have to babysit my friend to make sure that he's okay, but at the same time, I would feel horribly guilty if something happened to him because I didn't check on him every day. 

I end up having this type of issue in a lot of my friendships with men, where I feel a responsibility to take care of them. It's honestly pretty exhausting, and it feels bad to admit that.

I have plenty of friends who are women, but they all live pretty far away because of college or just having moved. I feel more fulfillment in these friendships than I do from my male friends who I live close to, but I have this feeling that if I stopped reaching out to them, they wouldn't bother to reach out to me anymore.

The idea of making an effort to develop new friendships and become close to people seems uncomfortable to me at this point. I have a lot of social anxiety, so every time that a friendship fizzles out or someone violates my boundaries, I tend to assume that it's a reflection of me as a person. It's gotten to the point where I feel really bad about myself. When people say nice things about me, I feel like it's because they've created an idealized version of me in their head and they aren't seeing me for who I really am. 

I know that a lot of these feelings stem from me being hurt. Recently, one of my long-term best friends blocked me on all social media platforms (and probably blocked my phone number) after I told him that it was making me uncomfortable that he was sharing personal details about my abuse going on within my family and my mental health with his girlfriend. I didn't think this was an unreasonable boundary to set -- I told him that when I confide in him, I expect that he's going to respect my privacy. Instead, I was getting texts from his girlfriend with advice about how to handle my problems. It made me uncomfortable because I wasn't close enough with her for that to be appropriate. When I explained to him that I didn't feel like my privacy was being treated with proper respect, he seemed to understand and agreed that he could ask me before sharing personal things about me with others, but then the next day he had already blocked me on everything.

I just feel so defeated. It feels like trying to set boundaries with my friends ends up making them mad at me, but I don't think my boundaries are unreasonable. Things like ""don't kiss me when we're hanging out because I don't like you like that"" or ""don't tell other people about my family's problems"" aren't big, difficult requests to accommodate. But the way that people have reacted to me giving even a little pushback against their behavior has led me to believe that maybe I'm difficult to be friends with. 

And that transfers to dating, too. For the past few weeks, I had been talking to this guy who I thought was really nice and cool. We knew each other through some mutual friends. A few weeks ago, we went on a three-day trip to go see some friends we both knew from high school. I had a lot of fun, and I felt like by the time we got back home we had gotten closer. But since he dropped me off at my house, I haven't heard from him at all. He used to watch my Instagram story and reply every so often, but he hasn't watched anything I've posted for weeks. I know he's been online, so I feel like maybe hanging out with me in person for a few days made him realize he doesn't like me. One of my friends told me that I'm assuming the worst, but I don't even know if this guy was actually interested in me to begin with. Still, feeling like I've been rejected stings. 

I don't know how to reconcile these feelings. Is it likely that I'm actually just unpleasant to be around? I feel like that would explain why people seem to have such little patience with me. 

TL;DR: I've had a lot of rocky friendships lately. I'm worried that no one will ever actually care about me. What can I do to stop feeling so anxious and alone?",26Nov2020,1
109,"I am 14 year old boy. I can speak 4 languages (English, German, Spanish, Japanese), can play guitar at a very advanced level (Megadeth, Van Halen level), and have had a college grade reading level since 6th grade. But I wish that I had never done any of these things. I hate all that I have accomplished and wish that I was just normal and didn't  have to live up to any expectations, because I feel like I can never live up to the expectations set. When someone asks me to play a song that I don't know or someone asks me a word that I don't know in German (because that one is my rustiest), I feel really embarrassed and bad and it just makes me wish that I had never gone out of my way and done these things. They always find out unflattering things about myself, like how I like anime and video games and am super physically weak.

Also, I don't do good in school. This year I had an A in social studies (because I love history), a B in science, but then a D in math and a C in Spanish. And it isn't that I don't try and don't do my assignments, but I just do poorly on all the tests. I hate it when my teachers try to tell me that I'm smart, because I feel like a complete dumbass. My teachers are always impressed when I tell them all the things that I can do, but then I regret telling them because then that sets a high expectation and then I just want to fit in. 

I think this might have to do with the fact that I don't have any friends. I want to fit in so that people will like me. I used to have two friends, but I recently broke up with them because one told the other that I lied when I opened up to them about hating myself, and now I'm all alone. I have two acquaintances, but one of them is an emo (I hate the emo culture) and the other is admittedly pretty cool, but he wants to involve me in all of these groups on Snapchat and what not of the popular kids, and I don't want to befriend the popular kids.

That reminds me. I used to be a semi-popular kid who had lots of acquaintances, because I was the class clown. And I absolutely despise that aspect of myself now. I always had something to say, and the class would laugh, and the teacher would sigh because they hated their job. Funnily enough, I'm now an extremely introverted person (I said that I wanted friends, I know, but I just much prefer spending time on my own, however, I do occasionally like to talk to friends, just not too much), and then when we go back to physical school these kids are going to be expect me to make them laugh a bunch again, but I won't do that because I don't want all that attention anymore. 

So overall, this was probably very contradictory and I must look like a complete idiot, but at least I said my piece. Just posting this is good venting, understanding that someone out there knows my pain.

111,"TLDR at bottom

So my little sister is 13 years old and we always get in those sibling fights that involves calling each other names. I’ve called her dumb, stupid, etc multiple times as a joke and not being serious. She does the same back to me. 

So my mom told me that my sister and has been crying about the names I call her and going into a depression because of it. My sister told my mom this “I’m thinking strange things at night when I try to go to sleep”. She said it was because I kept calling her dumb and she’s believing it. 

I feel absolutely horrible for it and I didn’t even think anything about it because my sister just says the same thing back to me and it didn’t seem as if she was taking offense. 

So what I’m asking is what can I do to make it up to her? She’s young so I’m scared it’ll effect her more. What’s the best thing to do to “reverse” the effect? 

TLDR, My sister is getting depressed because I kept calling her dumb. What should I do to fix it, other than stop calling her names?",26Nov2020,1

113,"so me (20F) and my boyfriend (25M) have been living together for 2 years. His sister (16F) lives with his mum who has multiple sclerosis. He visits her everyday to get her out of bed, help her go to the toilet etc. she is on a wheelchair and none of her family come to visit so she is very vulnerable and from what my boyfriend tells me, his sister is taking advantage of that. this is basically what he tells me:

- she has access to her bank card and ebanking
- she is claiming high rate PIP (disability benefit) for PTSD and depression because she had an ‘abortion’. my boyfriends mum told me that isn’t true 
- she spends money on her mums credit card and has left her in debt
-  she will take her mums bank card and phone as if she owns it and threaten to commit suicide if she doesn’t get what she wants
- she will stay at her boyfriends house for days, take her mums card with her and hide her mums phone charger so that she cannot text/ring my boyfriend. 
- my boyfriends mum had money put away in a savings account and somehow she got access to it and spent it all
- last week she rented a sunbed and spent £400 on her card to pay for an airbnb for her birthday. when the airbnb owner told her she couldn’t stay because she was under 18 she admitted herself to a psychiatric hospital. (she’s done this multiple times) since she’s been there she has  spent all of her mums money on christmas presents for herself &amp; has insisted that she stays there until christmas day
- my bf said her bank statement is all purchases via paypal, klarna and cash machine withdrawals over the past year which his mum doesn’t use 
- she has also took out a phone contract for her boyfriend which her mum pays for every month and moved him into her home
- anytime my boyfriend tries to intervene she will lock the doors and stop him from entering the house, she has rang the police and accused him of things and she will tell her family that it is my boyfriend stealing this money (and they will believe her)

my boyfriend has informed the bank, tried to change her bank details several times, contacted her social worker but nothing has changed and it seems to get worse every time he tries. will the police do anything??",26Nov2020,1
114,"my native language is english and it’s the only language i can speak fluently while my boyfriends native language is korean but he and all his friends can fluently speak english. whenever i hang out with him and his friends, they choose to only speak korean while they are perfectly able to speak english. it makes it really hard for me to join in on the conversations and i feel very left out and kinda like i don’t belong in his life. we have been dating for 7 months and since then, i’ve been trying to pick up and learn korean but it’s a very difficult language and i have memory issues so memorizing the hangul is really hard for me. i’ve also been very busy so i cannot spend a lot of time everyday learning. i recently bought a children’s book that teaches hangul so maybe it’ll help me pick it up better. i’m also taking korean on as a double major just so i can learn his language and culture to the best of my abilities so i can be respectful to him and where he comes from. but point is, i struggle very hard with learning languages. i took french for 8 years (elementary-highschool) and i barely remember any of it and hard a really hard time trying to pick it up. my brain just isn’t wired for learning languages so it takes me longer than others; but i really am trying. is it wrong of me to be upset and felt when they talk in their native language when i’m hanging out with them? today me, my boyfriend and one of our mutual female friends hung out and they spoke in korean to eachother for a huge portion of the time and when i told my boyfriend later on it felt like i was third wheeling, he got mad at me.",26Nov2020,1
115,"Got a bit of a complicated history but a real problem I don't know how to solve. Fairly long post including moving out, homophobia, religion and mental health issues, but I hope to get an advise from here as I'm feeling stressed thinking about this.

My Filipino family moved to the UK when I was 11 (now 22). Over time, my sister (now 27) and I grew to have more of a 'liberal' mindset than our extremely conservative parents, my mum moreso than my dad. By conservative, I mean this negatively from my perspective.

My sister came out as gay years ago which catalysed the worst out of my mum. I think it's partially because she doesn't want people thinking negatively about her and definitely her own prejudice. She constantly told me to pray for her soul because 'she's going to hell otherwise', and I basically told her no which got her preaching all over again but whatever. I'm fine with religious people but extremist shit like this crosses the line for me.

Anyway, about 2 years ago, she and my dad told my sister that they finally accept her (she'd been with her girlfriend for about 4 years at this point).

January 2019, my dad passed away. My sister and I were going to separate universities at the time in London, but we knew my mum wouldn't be able to cope with being alone so we decided to have her move to London and we all moved back in together. We don't have a property here anyway so the transition was easier.

Now, my sister still lives with us with her girlfriend. My mum's just used to seeing them together at this point, but she sometimes makes my sister feel that she owes it to her that she's 'accepting' them, when in fact, I feel that she can barely tolerate them together.

My mum started dating a couple of months ago and when the man wasn't giving her the amount of attention that she wants (she needs a lotttt), she started getting depressed - I'm talking staying in bed for days, getting mad at people for no reason, looking out the window for hours. This is on top of everything that she's had to go through in her life. I acknowledge that she's done a lot to provide a good life for me and my sister but having to deal with everything she's throwing our way - her racism that I find too disgusting (she also refuses to listen when I try to tell her it's wrong), homophobia (self-explanatory), her unwillingness to go to therapy despite everything piling up on her (her upbringing, my dad's death, her constant need to 'stand out', denial).

Anyway, she has hosted roughly about 10 parties **DURING** lockdown - My sister and I and her girlfriend all have asthma, and I got a medical history that weakened my immune system, but she gets mad when we say that she's putting all of us at risk by not caring about the pandemic. She has also been to tens of parties since, met up with groups of her friends regularly (my mum's a nurse and most of her friends are as well so it's not like she doesn't see them often), and like I said, been on quite a couple of dates since. Bear in mind, I have seen my friends a total of **TWO TIMES** since March, my sister has seen her friends **ONCE**, and her girlfriend **ONCE** as well. This should show you how seriously we take this virus and how many precautions we take in order to ensure that we don't catch it.

Tomorrow, she's going to a birthday party. which is whatever. then she's also going to see a guy she's been speaking to. which is whatever. but this Saturday, she's bringing a pastor here at home to 'bless the house'. I just don't understand why it had to be now, and when I asked her, she simply got defensive and told me that he'll only be here for 30 minutes, which really worries us but she's not listening even though it's technically illegal to be going out or inviting people indoors. I would understand if she was living alone but she literally lives with her two kids and she's friendly with my sister's gf as well so eh.

So my sister and her gf are thinking of moving out around March (when the rent contract ends). Initially, the plan was that my mum could move in with them and I'll live by myself, but after my sister saw how much she drags you down by her constant denial of her issues (she has loads, i think all stems from her desire to see herself as this perfect woman that can't do no wrong), how depressing it is to be around her and how much prejudice she has towards the people around her, she's now telling me (in private) that she doesn't think she can do that even years from now.

Without my sister, my mum and I would have to move out where we live now because we simply won't be able to afford the rent. And this also means, that my mum simply won't be able to afford to live in London by herself, trapping me with her basically forever. Anyway, the thing is I also wanna be by myself. But she constantly tells me 'what am I gonna do when you're gone?', 'what will I do once you and your sister leave me?' (basically crap like that guilting us into staying with her, which I can understand to an extent, but I don't wanna sacrifice the best years of my life living with my judgmental mother, because guess what, plot twist, I'm bisexual. Literally, everybody knows except my mum. Not ashamed of it, I just don't wanna deal with her preaching at me as well.

I think from this post you can tell I hold a certain degree of disdain towards her. I do, that's not something I'd deny. But I still love her and in her own way, I'm sure she loves me and my sister too. I just don't know what to do now. I can't live with her forever, especially if she's got this stigma against mental illnesses that she won't even recognise that she's suffering from a couple, which is affecting all of us here at home. She's just really problematic. We've tried helping her ourselves but whenever we say something negative about her, she denies it and twists it as us ganging up on her and acting like we know more than her. 

When she's 60 (10 years from now) and I'm established with a job, I would probably let her stay with me again but I wanna move out in a year or two.

It's gotten so bad that I have considered running away to teach English in a different country, applied for jobs in other cities and graduate schemes in other countries in Europe. I've done the latter two, I probably won't get it given the current economic climate, but I would wanna take it if I get it.

SO WHAT SHOULD I DOOOOO? I'M SOO TORN AND UNSURE OF WHAT I SHOULD DO.

tl;dr: My mum's homophobic, my dad passed away, she had to move to London with me and my sister so she won't be alone, my sister's gf had to move in with us, my sister's now unwilling to deal with her prejudice forever after seeing what it'd be like living with her gf and our mum at the same time, I'm bisexual and tired of her unwillingness to get help for her issues, but she constantly guilt-trips us about literally everything that we do for no good reason. She can't afford to live in London with what she earns as a nurse and I don't want her to end up living with other people when she's in her 60s, but I dont want wanna be living with her by the time I'm 24-25.",26Nov2020,1
116,"ok so, hello. um, i’m here just to ask someone (who ever reads this) if my ‘plan’ is good. so basically, i’m a 13 year old, and i don’t have a phone. i do, however, have an ipad. i’m planning on getting in job over the summer due to my birthday being in february. in february i will be 14. in america, if you are 14, you are legally allowed to get a job. so, that’s what i want to do. but, i have one problem. almost all jobs in my area require you to have a phone. the ones that dont require a phone, still, technically require a phone because they are between 10-20 minutes away. and, with an ipad, you aren’t able to like.. call people. it’s also just not as convenient as a phone due to its size. anyway, for christmas i’m planning on asking my dad for an iphone 11 (off of bestbuy) at a slightly cheaper price. i need the price to be as cheap as possible because my family is going through a really rough time because my mother has [goul?]stones, and my father has cancer. my father also has had over 4 feet of intentioned taken out of him. basically what i’m saying is that my family has had many huge medical expenses recently, so that’s why i want to try and get the phone as cheap as possible.
anyway, the phone i found has a monthly payment thing and i’m able to get it at a cheaper price if i pay the amount monthly, for 24 months. this is most likely going to be the only phone i will ever have until i’m probably in college, (if i decide to go to college) so that’s why the phone will be even more worth it (to my parents at least.) 
supposedly, i get a phone. since i now have a phone, i will be able to get an actual job.

(oh yeah fyi, i know you need to have data to call people and stuff, but in my state there are free hotspots LITERALLY EVERYWHERE) i will be able to get part time job, (i’m aiming for between 15-20 dollars an hour minimum) and with that money i get from the part time job, i will be able to pay off the money i would owe to my father.

tl:dr

i’m turning 14 in february and i’m planning on asking my father for a phone for christmas. supposedly, i get the phone for christmas. in february i will try my best to get a job. with the money from the job, i will pay the money i owe to my father. after i finish paying the money off, i will continue to support myself and my family.",26Nov2020,1

125,"Hi so basically I’m (20,F) in student halls and I asked for a sociable flat but the girl who moved in with me never hangs out in the kitchen/is always out. My other flatmates never leave their room. I get really lonely and anxious when I’m by myself especially cos of lockdown and corona, I love being social and it really helps my mental health. I have this group of friends that are spread out over 2 flats. There is one room free in the flat of people who I’m less close with. I want to ask to move in with them but unsure if they would say yes. I’ve known them more about 2 months now and feel like we’ve gotten quite close as a group but I guess just scared of rejection. I’m also worried I upset the flow/vibe in their flat, I’m unsure how they would feel about me asking and I’m nervous it would make them feel uncomfortable or awkward. 
Any thoughts or opinions or advice?

126,"Hi everyone, so I have a small jewellery page on Instagram and it is inspired by colour and cool patterns. I follow a bigger creator on there who has over 80 thousand followers and I loved their work, even bought their products and looked up to them. Her work inspires me but I made sure to not take direct inspo from anyone and create my own unique designs.The only similarity between our work are certain common objects and common colour palettes but I always made sure never to copy her work, and I have just reviewed my account incase I took too much inspiration but this literally is not the case and we just have a similar vibe but completely different products. I realised I hadn’t seen them for a while so decided to search them and couldn’t find their page. Turns out I’m now blocked. I can only put this down to them seeing my page and thinking that I am copying them. I feel so hurt and saddened that I got blocked by my favourite creator. I really don’t know how to carry on feeling positive about the only community when someone I really admired blocked me.

How do I move on and stay positive about my shop?

127,"I (26F) have never lived alone. I lived with my family, then college roommates, then family, and now with my roommate of 2 years. Well, she's getting married next year. I know no newlywed couple wants a roommate, so, we will be parting our ways after this. 

So, now all I can think about is my impending state of solitude. My roommate was the only friend I had to hang out with. Without her, I have no one here to spend time with. For work, I have to often go on short-notice 2-3 day long trips, so a pet wouldn't really work with my lifestyle either.

I have always struggled with periods of time where I've spent a lot of time alone. I get in my head, spiral, and end up breaking down a lot. So, I'm very afraid of living a life where aside from work, I'm 100% on my own day after day after day.

Does anyone have any advice for how to cope with/prepare for this upcoming drastic change of lifestyle?",26Nov2020,1

129,"So I've been talking with this girl for about three years now and we've always had this synchrony with each other. Although we've never met in person I'm planning on seeing her next month. If things go we'll probably do a 2nd visit before we decide on the main part of this post: 

I have always sort of hid in my dad's shadow. I'm someone who feels like my life has restrictions because I try to live in a way that makes him proud of me. I never want to make him angry or upset... Moving out of FL to be out west and up north is actually a place I want to be. Whether it's for the girl or not, it's an opportunity to get out there. The only downside is putting off university for a year to establish residency for instate tuition - which is another reason I can see my dad getting upset. But I do feel strongly about this woman, and having a family one day is important to me. The plan would be to move next summer 2021.

130,"Okay, I (20f) may just be freaking out and being paranoid, but I'll just explain and you can judge me how you will in the comments. 
So I watch a lot of youtube, and get targeted ads pretty regularly, and they'll usually have to do with something I looked up or talked about. Creepy, but idrc that much. 
Anyways, I've been getting targeted ads for pregnancy tests and baby stuff like diapers like every day the past couple days, and I have heard of targeted ads predicting in some creepy way that women are pregnant. 
Now aside from that, I have been in a relationship with a guy the past two years and I just got off my birth control recently as it was having some unpleasant side effects. So it is possible, but rather unlikely. 
With that info, do you think I should be flipping out? If it turns out I am pregnant I will be throwing my phone in the ocean and going off grid because that is just freaky.

Recently I’ve been back applying for jobs and have gotten two offers. One is $25 an hour for a consulting firm doing compliance analysis, but it’s only contract ending in January and doesn’t really have any long term benefits to me in terms of what I want to do with my life.

The other job is at a pretty big law firm for $18 an hour, doing document reviewing and organizing, not contract so I wouldn’t have to worry about finding another job after, and since it’s at a law firm I can maybe learn some stuff and hopefully make some good connections as well.

138,"I’ll try to keep this somewhat short but there’s a lot to go over so I apologize in advance for the wall of text. I’m currently a junior in college planning my living arrangement for my last year in college. Before our campus was shut down due to COVID last semester, I found a really great group of friends that I get along with really well, and asked one of them if they had plans for a living arrangement for the upcoming year. He mentioned that the whole group (6 guys) had already made plans to live together before I got there, since I transferred in the second semester of the school year. He mentioned that the place they had signed for could only fit 6 people, but if something opened up I’d have a spot. 

Fast forward to this year and they were making plans for the next upcoming year (my senior year) for living arrangements.  One of the guys sort of had a falling out with the group and two of the guys sat him down and told him that they thought it might be better to move down to 5 people in the apartment because 6 was too many. He took it well and everything was fine for a few weeks. A fourth guy, one who wasn’t part of the conversation telling the 6th guy he was essentially getting kicked out, had mentioned to me that they were now down to 5 people in the apartment, so I asked him if I could take his spot. The forth guy didn’t know how the conversation between the other three went down, and assumed that the two had been straight forward with the reasoning behind kicking the 6th guy out. The forth guy brought up the possibility of me moving in, and this understandably upset the 6th person because he had been told he was getting kicked out because there were too many people. After a long discussion they had calmed him down but came to the consensus that it would be wrong of them to let me move in with them because they told the other guy that 6 was too many people. After another conversation we came to the consensus that if I was somehow able to make the 6th guy ok with me taking his spot, I could move in. 

This is where I’m asking for advice, I’m currently on a sublease and don’t really get along with my roommates, and if I’m not able to move in with the group of 5 I’ll be forced to find another sublease because I haven’t been able to meet any new people due to COVID.

141,"Hey so I’ve had problems with my relationship with food for a couple of years now however in the past year it got really bad due to lockdown stress and uni. I got too thin and had to gain weight back for my health and I ended up developing some binge eating habits and have gained more weight than I typically wanted to (7kgs). I am now going down the route of wanting to lose weight again as I don’t like the way I look (I know first world problems). How I look now is really effecting my self esteem to the point where I don’t want to see friends and do stuff that I typically like doing but I’m not exactly supposed to be losing weight as my doctor advised me not to and that it wouldn’t help the process BUT I’m just not happy like this. 

I know losing weight doesn’t automatically make you happy (it’s true, at my thinnest I was miserable) but I almost just want to go back to old habits just to lose a few kgs so I feel confident again bc although I was nearly passing out 24/7 I was confident as heck. 

These thoughts come in waves which is why I’m not sure if I need to see someone. I’ll feel amazing for a few days (love myself, tell my self food is fuel and that restriction isn’t the way, no bingeing, happy) and then without warning it all comes crashing down (telling my self I’m ugly, I should starve myself, don’t go out until you look how you want, eat everything in sight, who the heck cares and then feel miserable about myself) and the cycle continues. 

I just don’t feel worthy of having a psychologist because I don’t see this as a huge problem because as of right now I’m in the feeling amazing part of this cycle so I feel like I’m dealing with it and so maybe I don’t need one. But do I? Even though I’m feeling ok (it’s only been a few days). Psychologists are so expensive too I just don’t know what I should do.",26Nov2020,1
142,"The main question is: is this in my head, if not should I pressure it, or let it go.

Backstory:
So I work with this girl. I liked her since day one and we talked a lot. Mainly because that first day I trained her. After that day we see each other like one a week at work. And one day I asked her for her Snapchat. I messaged her and she took a day to respond. I tried to keep the conversation going but she keeped leaving me on deliver for a day or two.  This is kind of a trigger to me as past friendships have done this. So I passively ignored her at work. One day as I was seeming outside she approached me. And I apologize for how I acted. And she said that she’s horrible at replying thus the late replies. Also she said after two days I should worry. I keeped on talking to her and over Snapchat. Untill this last week. (This work relationship is like two months old)
Where I asked her to hang out and she didn’t reply to me the day of the message or the next, she instead replied on the day I suggested and said she felt like but so no. And after that I said something and she never opened it. I worked with her the day after, and basically apologized foe being wierd for asking her out.5 days later and where working together still hasn’t opened my message. And I can’t help it but to ignore her. I genuinely want to get to know her, but I get scared each time she talks to me and just get quiet.  Also this might be nothing but the day I apologize for being wierd she came out of no where and tried to boop my hat of my head.
I want to message her telling her that i feel bad for ignoring her, and I don’t do it on purpose, I was just to scared to say anything that i ignored her.",26Nov2020,1

However, I’ve been encountering some thoughts that really impact my self esteem and mood and impend on my ability to communicate with them.

Some of these thoughts are as follows:

• Because they used to be polyamorous, they are going to want that again in the future (they told me that they won’t but it still worries me as that’s something I’m definitely not interested in).
• That I’m not enough to keep their interest forever.
• That because they have so much more experience than me, they know that there are better things out there for them. Better sex, better communication etc. They are all that I really know in terms of sex and relationships but it’s not the same for them. 
• Comparing myself to their exes and wondering what I’m lacking that they have.

Yes, I’m currently in therapy to deal with some of my insecurities however I’m not able to get regular appointments and I feel like I need extra help. Especially by people who have maybe been able to overcome these things. I’ve been trying to change my core values and beliefs about myself but it’s been really difficult and even if the thoughts are less frequent, they sting the same.

152,"TLDR: I’m sick and tired of constantly being nagged at by my mom because she hates my boyfriend all because of his past reputation and the fact that he smokes weed. She believes he is a bad influence on me and doesn’t trust that I’ll make the right decisions. But she treats my younger sister so differently bc she believes she and all her friends are “angels” and “good people” bc they don’t have bad reputations and ~don’t~ smoke weed and drink underage. Little does she know, EVERYONE smokes weed. Even her own angelic daughter- who smokes weed when out with friends and drinks underage. Literally all my sister’s friends and boyfriend smoke and drink underage and my mom is just clueless about the real world. Why do I have it so hard just because she despises my boyfriend? Should I break the truth to her and say that her assumptions are all wrong and that EVERYONE around her pretty much smokes weed? I’m just tired of this constant nagging. 

So I (21F) started seeing this guy (23M)) about a year ago in the summer of 2019. He is the first guy I’ve really actually been with and because of that, my mom felt the need to really butt into my life- stalking his social media’s, stalking his ex and always having suspicions, even going all the way to find out that his ex was pregnant from one Instagram comment and then believing that it was his baby. Like damn she knows his whole life story and keeps on questioning my life choices because I chose this guy and makes the wrong assumptions. I will admit, he was really immature in the past. He’s been in jail before for like possession of marijuana. I will also admit, he does make himself look bad to my mom and maybe his employers due to all the stuff he keeps on his Facebook and Instagram from the past, like 4 years ago past. Since I’ve been with him, I have realized that my mom is very controlling. Why did I, a 20 year old, feel the need to get my mom’s permission to hang out with him? I feel like bc she’s so controlling and took on this helicopter mom parenting style, it just brainwashed me. Her response was always “yes, but no sex, no pot, do not get in a car with him if he drives” blah blah blah. Like at 20 years old, those things need to be my decision (not that I was going to do anything stupid) and I’ve realized that I really don’t need that kind of lecture. She knows he smokes weed. And that automatically makes her think that he does crack or heroin. Even my dad will jump in tell us to not do drugs when we’re about to go hang out. If I say I’m going to meet up with him for lunch at a park, I get this speechless look from my mom like I just turned into a rebel and she doesn’t know how to parent me anymore. My relationship has been so complicated because of my mom. It’s like we have to do everything in secret all the time just so we don’t have to listen to what her thoughts are. 

Flash forward to today and it’s been driving me crazy for a long time knowing that my mom knows NOTHING about the real world. All because my little sister (19) just has everything so easy- from her relationship to her friends. And it’s because my mom believes they’re all “angels” and I feel like shes way too biased with my boyfriend just because she despises him for no reason. Sure my sister and her friends have good reputations, but my mom has no idea that they smoke weed on a daily basis and drink underage. I bet she’d pass out if she finds out that my sister and her boyfriend and all her friends smoke and drink. I bet she’d pass out if she knew how many of my friends smoke weed. Hell she’d pass out if she knew this guy friend of mine (whom she thinks I should date) smokes weed. 

My sister has been the one to be heavily influenced by her friends to drink and smoke. My mom always thought I would be the one make bad choices all because of my boyfriend whom she thinks is a bad influence. Sure I took sips of alcohol underage but just never chose to really drink and get wasted. Sure I’ve been around weed before, but I just don’t really smoke it because I’m just fine not drinking or smoking. But my boyfriend has never once pressured me into drinking underage, smoking weed, or having sex until I was comfortable with it. Idk why my mom feels the need to direct how my life plays out- she’s always worried that I’m guaranteed to get pregnant if we have sex or I’m going to get arrested because he has weed with him. 

I’m not against my little sister and other people smoking weed and/or drinking underage. Those are her choices and all but I would hope she at least understands the consequences that could follow. But I’m just at a point where I’m tired of taking in all the shit my mom has to nag at me for.",26Nov2020,1

157,"Hello r/Advice, thanks for listening, I really really need your help.  
**If you don't wanna read, there's a TL;DR at the end.**  
I'm sorry that this is gonna be a long post, but I don't know how to be more concise with my issue.  
I (25M) have been obese for the vast majority of my life. The reasons for this, as for anything in life, are complex and varied. There are many things I could've done differently to mitigate what happened to me, and I very much do realize that I can't shift all the blame away from myself. However, due to me being very young when I first became obese, I just can't accept that it was purely my gluttony and indiscipline that led to the situation I now find myself in.  
I started getting fat when I was 4 or 5, in Kindergarten. At that point my Father would start discussing my weight at the dinner table in front of me, calling me fat and lazy. My mom, as is customary for Austrian catholic wifes, always denied that I had any problem and wouldn't listen to anyone telling her otherwise. Even when Doctors told her I was gonna die early if she continued, she would just tell them what they wanted to hear and then told me in the car that the Doctor was wrong and I was normal sized. She was and still is responsible for all the food in the house, as well as cooking every meal, due to their shared conservative values, so all I was ever fed from the very beginning of my life was sugar, carbs and fat.  


At age 7, at the yearly school weigh in, I got the high score of 71 kg (156.5 lbs) on 149 cm (4.8 foot). I don't know exactly **how** bad that is in comparison, but it was bad enough for me to suffer a lot of exhaustion and pain everyday, as well as developing serious health issues early on in life.  
From when I was 4, when my mom wanted me to do anything, instead of ever talking to me or explaining why she wanted me to do that, she'd say I'd get sweets as a reward if I did. And I got a nightmarish amount, to the point where I sustained myself solely on junk foods for weeks at a time.  
If I didn't wanna sleep she'd give me cake, or chocolate or gummy bears to eat in bed.  
I ended up being addicted to sugar very early, as well as forever associating bad foods with motherly love. She wouldn't really give me any attention, wouldn't play with me, wouldn't ask what my interests were, but she'd give me physical affection like hugging me and kissing me, almost only while bringing me food. She even told me the food is how she tells me she loves me.  


So when I was 8 or 9, sometime around there, I'd frequently break down crying, throw tantrums and self harm by hitting myself and things like that, because I hated myself, I hated my body and I hated being fat. When my mom asked me what was wrong, I'd repeatedly tell her I wanted to go to the Doctor to lose weight (back then I thought that's what Doctors were for). She repeatedly told me we were gonna go on a diet, but any time she tried, she just stopped after 2 or 3 days. Like, there was nothing she said to me or my father, she'd just fall back into her old habits.   
When I'd ask her why we're eating Schnitzel or Cake she would start screaming at me that she didn't have time today to cook healthy and I should just eat. Also her ""healthy"" food was garbage in taste and nutrition, but I never told her that.  
If I didn't wanna eat she would yell even louder, that I **needed to eat** and that I was gonna eat her food or else I'd lose some privileges or get extra chores.  
When I kept arguing from there she always broke down crying and left the room, sometimes asking me why I was hurting her, or saying that I was a bad son.  
In the two most extreme cases, she slapped me in the face and told me she shouldn't have had more kids after having my older brother.  


From then on my life was a horrifying cavalcade of dealing with my mom, going on and off diets every few months, getting military-style fat loss training from my dad and long term insomnia. My parents have no communication skills at all, so whenever my dad would force me on a day long mountain hike and call me fat and lazy throughout, I'd come home to my mom saying how sorry she was that dad is so mean to me and feeding me even more sugar to make up for it.  
Even though I continually asked for access to therapy and professional help for my weight, I was denied any. At 16 I paid for a personal trainer for myself, to teach me workout routines, but he took 60€ per hour and I could only afford 2 sessions. At that time that was the best idea I could come up with.  


This situation would continue full force, with almost daily fights, until I moved out at age 18. This is when I'd routinely go to Doctors for advice.  
By that time I was diagnosed with a fatty liver, kidney stones, gall bladder stones, heart problems and had long stretch marks all over my body. I successfully got rid of, or at least mitigated most of these problems until I was 23.  
Later on I got myself a psychiatrist (against my parents' advice), who diagnosed me with body dysmorphic disorder, anxiety disorder, ARFID and bipolar II disorder, which I am currently being medicated for.  


After moving out I lost about 40 kg (\~80 lbs) rather quickly to where I am right now, being slightly overweight but looking quite handsome for my standards, with many mental blocks and issues around food and body image remaining. I still can't shake binge eating behaviour during depressive episodes.  


**TL;DR**  
My parents kept me in a spiral of abuse and feeding me unhealthy foods to make up for the abuse.  
Due to having been very obese for the vast majority of my life, I feel like I missed out on all the beautiful things people get to experience in childhood and I continuously fall into deep depressive episodes because of all the things I can't un-remember. I also developed severe physical and mental health problems due to my upbringing and habits.  


**How do I let go of all the self hatred?**  
**How do I deal with people commenting negatively on my size and stretch marks?**  
**How can I stop hating my mom, when she has already apologized repeatedly, even saying it was the biggest mistake of her life?**  
**How can I let go of the ""how my life could've been different, if only..."" thoughts?**",26Nov2020,1

161,"Hello reddit, for the past few months A lot of things have changed in my life.  Ever since COVID stared, and my mother started working, I had to take care of myself for the first time in my life.  Things went well because I thought myself how to cook, and I also tried working out for a bit. I was doing great and I was happy. But when school started, things changed.   
My classes start at 8am and end at 12. Its a weird schedule because its 1 hour early compared to other schools in my area. I wake up at 7 but sometimes I feel like there is just not enough time for me to make good food.   
So I often I resort to eating easy food like cup noodles, and other instant things. I know that its not healthy for me to eat that type of food for breakfast. And drinking coffee is also not great for my wellbeing. I had to give up my workout routine since school has started.   
Obviously, sitting in front of a screen for 8 hours daily is awful for my mental health too. I often feel really stressed and lazy after my classes. Most of the time, I lay in bed and watch YouTube from 12 to 5. And that only makes my mental health worse.  
I know that these things are really messing with me. And I need some advice from you guys. All help is greatly appreciated.",26Nov2020,1

164,"I'm the youngest in my family. And my brother was a nice guy... But he has a past with drugs. Hard drugs. Since I can honestly remember at this point he has always been using. I've tried to help in the past as best as I could. I still stick around for his children, who he left behind.

I taught one of his son's how to drive. I took his daughter to the daddy-daughter dance, as her uncle. I support his ex-wife when I'm able to.

However, my brother continues to run his life how he pleases and continues down a warpath. He gets what he wants no matter who or what is in front of him. His wants continue to be getting high and destroying lives.

As I mentioned, he has a past with drugs and he has been in and out of prison a few times. 

Since my efforts to connect with him and try to help him have been an ill effort I have distanced myself from him for the better part of three or more years.

It was brought to my attention that not long ago there are allegations against him for very serious crimes. I'll list them below.

* Burglary - 1st degree
* Kidnapping / Inflicting Injury / Terrorizing - 1st degree
* Domestic Assault - 3rd degree
* Resisting / Interfering with an arrest

All this being said, my brother reached out to me today. (I have not opened or responded.) With the situation at hand, should I work with my local authorities to bring him in? I know if I was a victim of the first three items I would want the perpetrator in cuffs, no questions asked. But, it feels weird / wrong because he is my brother.

I was so young I don't even remember when it started but this woman singled me out and would physically beat me and deliberately and systematically bullied me my whole life. My parents were so manipulated by her that they did nothing to stop it, I have been taught over the years not to talk about it and have been made to feel that what happened wasn't a big deal, so for 40 years it has been swept under the rug. After said recent incident, I finally cracked and spoke up about it, not that it was a secret or anything, everyone knows it happened they just choose to ingore it. Since then I have asked my mother, after all these years to please do what she should've done from the very the moment it started, to protect me to stop the abuse and choose me. Even though the abuse is no longer physial the emotional abuse and manipulation still happens, I asked her to cut my Aunt out of our lives, my mother has also been manipulated by my Aunt most of her life too, and finds it hard to fight back against my her domineering nature.

170,"My brother is fifteen. Ever since he got his own room, he only comes out for eating (which he does very quickly and goes back to his room. He doesn't even stick around to enjoy his favorite meals). Every day we see him for not even 1 hour. He locks his room, and it's almost always silent. It also smells. When we see him at the dining table, we can see that he hasn't been showering properly. When I try to converse with him, his replies are short and snappy. Sometimes he doesn't reply at all and ignores me completely. It's like he literally becomes impossible to socialize with.

My parents are worried and angry as well. They try to ask what's wrong and why he won't come out of his room but he just gives shortcut answers and runs back to his room. One evening, my father noticed that my brother is showing signs of having a skin disease (because he is dirty) and he told my brother to shower properly. He just made a sound of agreement and went into his room.

That night, my parents noticed that he still had lights on when it was time to go to sleep.  My parents don't know why he's acting this way. They were discussing how to coax him and make him act like a normal human being again when I suddenly remembered the conversation I had with him months ago. I was joking about how the quarantine period seems so long but short at the same time. He said,"" Yeah, and then you become suicidal"". At that time, I thought he was making a joke so I  didn't take any action. I thought he was just going through a rebellious phase since I did go through that as well.

I told my parents about this, and the moment I finished my sentence, I could feel their hearts sinking. My parents grew up in a place where suicide rates are at an all-time low.  People were trying hard to survive. They couldn't process this. They were at a loss. They worry that his online classes may be too much for him (he takes eight IGCSE O level subjects. That's it.) They try asking him but he won't tell properly.

171,"It just feels like a massive chore. Like, i'm a male, i'm 19, i'm constantly horny. Yet i don't desire to have sex.


It just feels like a massive chore. Interacting with people is already mentally draining for me, having to interact with one in specific to such a intimate level sounds like torture. 

I feel like i have nothing in common with anybody. All  my relationships are short ""friendships"" that are just small talk for the sake of politeness. 

I just don't like people, feel like they are constantly mocking me.

Actually trying to flirt with a girl is hard. Specially for an introvert like me. That's why i pretty much enclosed myself and just focused on studying through my adolescence. 

There's also the whole deal about confidence and consequences of banging a girl (false accusations, pregnancy...). And there's no going back from having sex with a girl, your relationship with her is different now, forever. 

I then started to think: ""Well, if banging a girl feels so overwhelming, then i must be into dudes"".


Wrong.

Finding a guy was way easier (hell, 2 minutes on grindr and i already had a meetup). But i simply didin't enjoy it. It felt good, but just for as long as i ignored the fact he was a dude. I pretended to cum and went back home. 

And the feeling of it being a chore was still there. I had to shave myself, take a bath, separate a section of my day, go to his place, go back, take another bath to wash his scent off... and now to wait for 3 months to get tested, 'cause there's always the chance of the partner lying or just not knowing they have something.

And with a girl it would be pretty much the same. 

I don't know, maybe i'm just an asshole, but sex just dosen't feel worth it. I'm not interested in the intimacy and the pleasure i can get from masturbating, with way less work and stress. 

I don't even know what kind of advice i'm looking for, just tell me what you think about it, what i might be doing wrong...

173,"ok, so I don’t really use reddit but I didn’t know where to go.Im genuinely really messed up about this.
so I’ve had an on and off relationship with someone for five years now- let’s just call them M- and we’ve been through a lot.
A few months ago I decided I was never gonna be with them ever again, and I’ve stuck to that promise. but recently they’ve been saying I emotionally abused them and I genuinely don’t know if I did. this might sound super fucked up and manipulative- and if it is, for the love of god tell me- but it’s very complicated.
M sexually assaulted me. we were on a date, and we had sex for the first time the night before. We were on the couch and they kept on grabbing me in places they shouldn’t have- I begged them to stop, and told them I just wanted to show them this new video game I had bought, but they kept going, begging me to let me have sex with them. I was visibly distressed, angry and shaking, but after ten minutes of begging I gave up and let them drag me to my room.
it hurt. It hurt BAD. I had bruises on me for weeks, and it hurt to put on shirts. I was scared.
I broke up with them later that month. we got back again because I still loved them, and I knew they had BPD and I was their fav person, so I knew if I left for good they would hate me.
but I had already told my friends about it, spent hours sobbing in their arms because I felt so used. They knew, and I didn’t want to carry the shame of people knowing I had gotten back with my abuser, so I told them I couldn’t have anyone know we were together.
we broke up later, and soon after that I told them I could never love them again because of what they did to me. which is true- I never really loved them again after that, in fact it hurt me so bad to look at them because of what they did, but I didn’t want to break their heart. and they showed me love, and as a traumatized and lonely person I just wanted to be loved. we went on and off for a while and they used their BPD against me, talking about how obsessed and how much they loved me whenever I would leave so I would feel terrible for them and come back. then they would tell me that we weren’t meant for each other and that we were gonna break up so why even hang out anyways?
it hurt. but I stayed, for a long time. one day they told me that they had told multiple people about what they had done to me.
but here’s the kicker- they told them they didn’t understand what they did wrong. they said this to people I knew, people I were close with. 
people took their side and didn’t take me seriously except for my best friend. He was the only one who took me seriously during all of this.
I wasn’t the best person in this relationship. I had done bad things, I hadn’t been fully understanding of so many things and I don’t remember a lot of it. but they’re saying I abused them. I don’t think I did. They sexually abused me and ruined my life- I mean, I haven’t been able to have sex with anyone for SO LONG because I’m afraid they’ll take advantage of me again. they’ll beg until I have to let them touch me, and they’ll hurt me over and over again.. I’m so confused. can someone please help me with this? I don’t want my friends to think I’m manipulative if I’m actually abusive. so all I have is this subreddit, ha.",26Nov2020,1

175,"Hi! 

Having some trouble with my current housemate. We both rent my aunties house and at first it was fine. Now our partners live with us and it was still fine but her true colours are slowly showing 

She’s incredibly messy and it’s starting to impact myself who has OCD and Anxiety. For starters her and her bf leave dirt in bath after showers and leave it for me and my partner to rinse every day, they don’t fold their own washing so I end up having to to make room for mine to hang, they leave like 4 big bin bags of rubbish out near the bins but never tie them so everything spills all over and guess who’s left to sort it .. me. 

Her bf leaves dirty trailed through the house and she’s watched me on my hands and feet cleaning it and does nothing, he’s been told to take shoes off at the door but doesn’t. Today, because of my anxiety (and she knows about this) I always keep the chain on the door for safety due to trauma from past burglary experiences. I heard them unlocking the door so I said through the door to wait so I could take the chain off. Instead they forced it open and snapped the chain off the hinges, watched me pick it up and she just said “you’ll just have to replace it” and walked up to her room, no apology, and expects me to pay for it fixing ? 

She’s also said in the past that she knows cause of my OCD that If she leaves stuff messy or in the way long enough I’ll clean/sort it cause I can’t help it so she purposely doesn’t do stuff so I will??? It’s literal torment ??? The smell of marijuana also is linked to trauma for me but she continues to come in stinking the house out with it???

The tenancy isnt up til June when me and my bf will be continuing to rent alone. But until then I’m stuck with her being like this. 

As well, we can’t do anything without it being a problem. If we make any noise at all it’s disturbing them or keeping them up ?? Yet when they wake up at 6am and make loud bangs and noises and it wakes us up we’re not to say anything ??

I’m walking on egg shells around them in my own home and left to fix all their damage and clean up after them. 

What can I do it’s really affecting me mentally :( my OCD is through the roof and she plays on it. Now I can’t settle as there’s no chain on the door and I’m so anxious :((",26Nov2020,1

179,"Content Warning for incest, murder, suicide, sexual assault, and mental illness

I (16M) have been doing really well lately. I've started taking care of myself, feeling more focused, talking to my family again, and my self esteem has been rising slowly but surely. A few years ago, I wouldn't have even thought that this was possible, but now I'm honestly feeling better than ever in most aspects of my life, except one.

Since around eigth grade, I've had really lucid dreams. I've never been able to tell that I'm in a dream until I'm out of it, but they're always incredibly vivid. When I started having these dreams, they really freaked me out because they often involved me drowning, watching people I cared about get hurt, or losing a pet that I cared about. However, even though these were all bad, I could live with them. The feelings they gave me usually left a few minutes after I woke up, and the feelings in the dream weren't bad enough to keep me awake at night. But recently, these dreams have become much more disturbing.

In past dreams I've always been a victim, having horrible things happen to me and those I cared about. Now, I'm the aggressor who's causing all the bad things to happen. I'll have dreams about cheating on my boyfriend by doing super creepy things with family members, dreams about me mutilating myself and cutting off my own limbs, dreams about me killing and torturing my pets, etc. Last night I had a dream where I was being tormented by this horrifying ghost, and it caused me to go insane and try to kill my family. Remember, I can't tell when I'm in a dream, so that whole experience was incredibly terrifying. Almost every morning I wake in a cold sweat and absolutely loathe myself. Of course I'd never do those awful things in real life, but the fact that those things even came to my mind in the first place makes me disgusted with myself. 

I'm pretty desensitized to disturbing things. I love horror movies, I read Junji Ito manga, and I watch letsplays of scary video games cause I'm too nervous to actually play them myself. I'm ok with gore, even Devilman Crybaby levels of gore, but I've never actively sought it out. I got introduced to sexual things via the internet at a young age which fucked up my perception of sex for awhile, but I like to think that now I have a pretty good grasp of what is ok for me to do and what isn't ok for me to do. I don't have too much trauma because I grew up in a really healthy and loving household, and while I have ADHD, several forms of anxiety, gender dysphoria, and clinical depression, these have all become quite manageable. All of this makes it so much harder for me to figure out why I keep having these nightmares. I plan on talking to my therapist about it at my next session, but I don't know what to do until then. I've told my boyfriend about some of it, and while I know hes the kind of person to not judge me if I tell him the harsher details, apart of me is to ashamed to tell him more. What do I do?",26Nov2020,1

I didn’t question it but after I was done I wanted to cancel. I was so frustrated and stressed.

I couldn’t find card anywhere on the site to remove.  I should be able to take my card off and cancel a subscription. I shouldn’t have to do all this stuff. Should be illegal tbh. But it’s porn they try to be so sly. I could never tell my fam. Idk what to do. And there were people saying tell your bank and I used a prepaid card. And it would take forever for the money to drain out if that’s my only option. I’m crying rn. Idk way to do. I really think I should tell my fam. 

Why can’t I just cancel it like normally?? I downgraded to regular and it said my membership will expire soon so I’m happy but I need to get the card out.",26Nov2020,1
181,"this may just be a temporary moment of anxiety and overreaction, bc this happens like twice a day, but i am beyond sick and tired of feeling like this. ive (15f) been dating my bf (""derek"", 15m) for about 5 months now and its been good and one of the best experiences of my life. there have been a lot of firsts and a lot of feelings i didn't know i could have for something. but ive noticed that dereks fatal flaw is his communication. he almost never communicates his feelings without being asked directly (which then hell explain, but then wont say why he did whatever he did). for example, he says that he likes flirty texts, but will sometimes either:

a. not respond

b. brush it off, not reciprocate, and change the subject

he used to be as affectionate as i am (and yes, i admit i am a very affectionate person), but now he always does one of the above.

were neighbors and so we see each other often, but don't go to the same school so not as much as we would like. its been nice being neighbors, since we can sneak out sometimes, and go on walks or make out somewhere, and those are my favorite moments with him. but whenever i ask him, hell always not respond for an extended amount of time and just have some excuse. idk if its an excuse or if he's telling the truth, but this is bullshit and im sick of it. i want him to be as affectionate as he used to be and actually see him once in a while since i cant really do it as much as we did in the summer. i miss the guy i liked, and he doesn't really act like that anymore. it seems like the only times when things are good is when his hands are on my tits/ass/whatever and were making out, and even though i like it too, i realize that this is a problem.",26Nov2020,1
182,"I'm sorry for the long post, but I'm honestly not sure where to post this, so I am grateful to anyone who reads this and hopefully reads my story. 

So to begin, I (19 F) am living in a granny flat on my own. I pay rent, groceries and all that sort of stuff. I have finished my first year in a nursing degree and have aspirations of specialising in my career in the future. However, I currently work at a supermarket at a checkout. My family involves my dad (d), mum (m) and older brother (in his twenties) (b).

At the beginning of the year (literally like the first week of January) I went on a family camping trip with my partner (19 M) and his family. We have been together for a year and a half or so now and have had our ups and downs, like any healthy couple, and are very happy and in love. He is also going into the army next year as some background. I have a great relationship with his family and honestly consider them to be more like family than my biological family. Anyway, so the night I get back from this camping trip, m pulls b and I aside to talk. D is in the room silent. And she announces she's leaving my dad. This was on the one hand a shock as I was not expecting to hear this at this moment, but not surprised she was leaving him. Since then I twisty and complicated series of events ensued.

So, here is where it gets interesting to you readers.
My dad is very hard to explain so I'll do my best. Put it this way, I have a therapist and she agrees that he is emotionally and verbally abusive after me showing done evidence to her. He is a stubborn man who believes that he can do no wrong and that whatever he believes, days and thinks is correct, and the only right option. He is headstrong on the belief that a patent it's better than the child and is always right over them and should have complete and total undisputed respect. Although it's is not a regular occurrence (add in every day, well or whatever), there are plenty of examples of his behaviour I can give where he has certainly crossed boundaries of personal issues and the line of what is appropriate to a situation. He is known to blow up when he is upset and mad and is frankly terrifying. 

A few examples of his behaviour so you can hopefully understand.

1) during the separation my mother for a period of time lived at her mother's house (grandmother and husband were away so she was on her own), because she couldn't be uber the same roof as him due to his behaviour. I have a close friend from high school and we were going out to dinner to hang out and catch up as I hadn't seen him in ages (completely nothing going on besides friends, my partner knew and was ok with it as he is also close with this friend and we have good trust). My brother was or if the house at a friend's house and dad was at work. I was getting picked up by my friend in literally a minute and had already pushed the time back as I was running late getting ready. My dog was inside, he normally lives inside but goes outside when noone is home and overnight. However, there have been a few times he's been left alone for a short period and he was fine. I knew dad would be home working about half an hour and knew he had plenty of water and had peed recently and world be ok. He is also fairly lot well behaved. Howevrr, when anyone gets home (whether he is inside or not) he goes nuts out of excitement and carries on saying hi like he had been left alone for years. so I left him inside and locked the door. While at dinner with my friend I get this text (literally copied and pasted, changed one sentence for privacy tho).
""Which brainless fuckwit was the last to leave? They'd better start thinking of somewhere else to live  and I would strongly suggest they spend the night at (grandma's place, where mum was temporarily staying alone). To lock the house and put the keys for the back door somewhere different (I had not, they were in the normal spot), so they drop and get lost the second you try and pick them up is one thing. BUT TO LEAVE (DOG) LOCKED INSIDE THE HOUSE IS TOTALLY INEXCUSABLE. To say he was distressed is a massive understatement. He had no water and it is bloody hot in here (hotter outside). I will be discussing the punishment with mum and you'd better pray that she is more forgiving than me.""

When I read it, it was.a massive shock as I was.honestly actually enjoying myself for the first time in a fair while as everything with the separation had been causing me so much stress and anxiety. And it honestly took so much not to just cry in the middle of the restaurant (although I admit a few years slipped through), my friend excused himself to the bathroom after a few minutes to give me a moment and I messaged my mum who said my brother and her had received the same message. I asked if I could stay the night at grandma's with her and of course she allowed me to. I ended up staying there for a week and only once went 'home' with mum with me and didn't say a word to dad when we got there. Just went to my room and packed as much as I could that I would need over the next week or two. He didn't even acknowledge me when he saw me. to this day he will not acknowledge he has done anything wrong besides ""I should have worded it differently"". He has never apologised or anything at all to even slightly admit any guilt or anything. I admit, I shouldn't have left the dog inside but omg please tell me that that was honestly an overreaction based on the situation? 

Another example, one day while we were still all in the same house, right before mum left him. My dad used to harass me. To the point where he literally could not go without seeing me without making a snide or sarcastic comment about myself, i.e. how I was dressed, my room, my car or setting else. (My car is technically his as it is in his name, although it was explicitly given to me for my own personal use, my brother had the same deal.) One day, I had come downstairs to grab a drink and snack after a bad night's sleep (used to get night terrors and stuff all the time). He made a rude, snide and sarcastic comment about my room and I lost it. I basically said  ""I get you don't like the state of my room, but I literally am only just seeing you for the first time this morning and this is your greeting? You wonder why I never leave my room and don't socialise at dinner or whatever yet you act like this? You are the reason, I can't go anywhere or do anything without you harassing me about it and I'm done, I can't take it anymore, leave me alone."" I then went to my room and silently thought about it all. A while later dad knocks on my door and immediately opens it without waiting for a response (he always does this and it annoys me to no end for privacy reasons, there is no lock). He then says ""I have taken all of your stuff out of my car, it is all outside your door."" He then shuts the door and disappears by the time I come out of my shock and go to follow him to figure out what is happening. I then find mum who tells me, he is mad I disrespected him and has ""had enough"" of my attitude and has taken his car back off me. Now to explain a little more. At the time I struggled with depression, anxiety and chronic stress and living and being in that house honestly made it so much worse as I could.jever feel safe or comfortable there. So I drove almost everyday, even if it was just to work somewhere and sit there, because it was my only escape and release. He knew this, and long story short I was unable to go anywhere or do anything. I didn't speak to him until the next day because I was too scared to face him and honestly was so angry at the same time I was waiting till I calmed down enough so I could talk maturely. So when I talked he set all these rules about my maintenance of it and stuff like that. He said the reason he did it was he was ""tired of the disrespect to his car"" and wanted change. I understood and admitted it and we spoke a bit. But what got me was.my brother treats his worse and us a lot of priveledges I never had (even before this incident), so why does he not have these rules in place. His response ""I don't care, you ungrateful little brat"". 
I have the car again now, and he has not taken it since but I fear he may try to when I'm not around as he knows where I now live and he has the spare key, and I know I legally can't stop him since it's legally his. However, due to the location on where I am (rural), I can't get anything nearby to help me, noone delivers food here, no uber, no taxis, nothing. So if he chooses to I'm stuck, can't work, can't attend University and can't do anything, and if I can't work, I cannot afford rent or food and will be  in massive trouble there.

One more example. I have limited childhood memories as most I have blocked or forgotten, as I honestly can count the happy ones on one or two hands. One of my earliest memories (not sure how old, maybe around 6?) Was of me getting into the shower. I was too young to run it myself so my parents would run it till I liked the temperature, then leave the room and I'd undress and do my thing. After he ran it (I believe we were.the only two home), I undressed and got in, but the water was aimed too high and was barely on me, so I reached and tried to adjust the shower head, only for the front cap apart of it to fall off, nearly hitting me and fell onto the tiles with a loud metallic sound. He then came running in screaming about how I could have damaged the tiles (no they were not new or remodelled) or scratched them and how stupid, ungrateful and bratty I was for never being appreciative of what he did for me. I was terrified, naked, cold and kind of wet and just wanted to cry. I can't really remember  what happened after that, but I don't think I said anything to anyone about it.

So, enough examples. At the moment I get by paying rent, groceries and some of my fuel. My dad agreed to assist me with some costs, the ones he agreed to are with reason and moderation, he pays for the same things for my brother. This includes, fuel money for my travel to university (he paid for my brother's travel when he studied), medical costs like appointments, (I pay for prescriptions and some other things), car registration and insurance, university tools (books and small fees, but not the main cost as that is government debt). I pay everything else. However, I work as much as I can but my job does not allow me to work as.much as I need because they don't often roster me for enough shifts as I have requested. My main income is from government student assistance, this amount covers my rent and that's about it. I have been struggling financially to get through, but am coping. Barely. I am not willing to live with someone else I don't know well and am not close to for many reasons, including a fairly traumatic series of events of when I first moved out and moved into an apartment that ended very badly. I am also unable to live with my partner at he lives with his parents and will not yet nice out of home. I am currently trying to get a job in nursing as an assistant so that I can get experience in the field and leave a job that honestly makes me due inside a little bit more every time I walk through the doors. However the pay isn't exactly that much better. I need a job in nursing as sure to complicated stuff I need experience asap to get into a specific program that will set up my future in my desired speciality. I  have a hot and come relationship with my mum and for the sake of length I won't go into it much now but I also have essentially no relationship (nor the desire to have one) with my brother. I lived with the two of them for several months after dad temporarily moved out, but it was almost as damaging to my mental health for many reasons. Since I moved out, I have been mentally doing very well and have actually been genuinely happy. I love where this place is, it's just affordable and is honestly amazing for the price and is far better than anything else I would get for the same price or less. There is also nothing available for less I should mention. 

So if you have made it this far, I honestly thank you so so very much as I know it's long, I've kind of been needing an outlet and i am looking for advice. Honestly on anything here I have said, but mainly on how I should manage things now with my dad. As if I do something or say something about how he acts, I know he will use the money to get his way as he knows I need it to continue living out of home. But at the same time he has done so many things, and caused me so much hurt, pain, stress, anxiety and everything I just want to cut him out. But he also has said he's suicidal many times and I fear doing this will make him actually do it (he is pretty genuine about it, and he has depression). I cannot live with family for many reasons, my partners isn't an option and I don't have any close friends I could live with. Please help, I'm happy to give more stories or context if requested, but have already left so much out as I know.its already so long. So thanks once again if you made it this far and please, any advice is welcome.",26Nov2020,1

184,"So I have a new problem relating to my earlier post about my selfish cunt of an uncle.  


If you've already read the story, you can skip to the hyphens.  If you haven't, you can keep reading for the short version or you can read the whole dumpsterfire, in its entirety, here: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/j9eh07/my_family_is_fucked_and_i_need_some_advice/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share, 


Basically my estranged 70-year-old uncle has recently come back into our family's lives after telling us of his decision to divorce his wife of 30 years (she's an asshole, so we are glad).  


All was well and we were happy to have him back until about 1.5 years ago when he tells us he has a son.  A newborn son.  He accomplished this by getting a surrogate in a foreign country (because our country told him he's too fucking old!).  He previously had an adopted daughter (his wife's sister's child), but they abandoned her when she showed signs of mental illness in her teens.


About 10 months ago, he also decides that his niece or one of his nephews (my two brothers, my two cousins or me) should adopt the child in the unlikely event he were to ""... get into a car accident."" (His words).  We've all said no for now, but added if there were any chance of one of us adopting the child, he would have to move to our rural area (where the rest of us live) so we could get to know the child.  He won't move because he's looking for a wife/girlfriend/vagina in the big city.  So there's that.


--------


So now he's coming to family gatherings like everything is just fine, and the rest of my family, appears (to me) to be acting as if nothing is amiss.  I find this absolutely insane and have found myself questioning if I am the crazy one.


He was over for Thanksgiving 2 weeks ago.  It was just my parents, my Mum's parents, me and SC and his baby.  (We are in a rural area that has had &lt;20 cases total since March and SC has no friends in his city, so the risk of COVID-19 spread was low, although I did try to use that as an excuse of why he shouldn't be there.) 


I had a very hard time being civil to this human after all that has happened, and it was extremely noticable to both my parents and grandparents.


So my parents have basically told me that if I can't be polite to SC, than I shouldn't be around for the holidays (aka Christmas, aka Saturnalia).  


Now, I understand that I am not great at hiding my emotions and my parents don't want to have to stress over the holidays about their ill-tempered daughter snapping on my father's brother.  I agree it's not fair to put that stress on them.  Normally I wouldn't be bothered all that much, and would probably go bundle up and go camping or something, but my brother recently got married to a foreign woman (who is just fantastic), and this will be her first Christmas in Canada so I really want to be there.


So I need some more advice.  What should I do?  Does anyone have a secret technique for tolerating a complete chicken-fucker of a human?  Or should I just go off into the wilderness with my dogs for a week or so?  Or is there another solution I'm not seeing?  I just don't know what to do.  I'd be grateful for any sincere advice I could get.",26Nov2020,1
185,"My best friend and I have been close for about 2 years now. We think and act very similarly, have similar struggles and have been pretty much inseparable since we met. About 4 months ago, I moved with my fiancé (we’ve been together 6 years) about 5 hours from our original location. Dealing with the move, being away from family and not working because of COVID has really taken a toll on my already suffering mental health. I’ve been really, really struggling and this has caused issues between my fiancé and I. I always vent to my bff because that’s what we do, we tell each other everything. After venting to her about an argument i had with my fiancé and how I’m struggling, she basically told me to do just something about it and stop complaining. The most hurtful part was when she said “ i can tell you until I’m blue in the face”. This basically made me feel that she doesn’t want to hear my problems or be there for me. Like she couldn’t be bothered with me. I’m not sitting here saying she’s wrong....i need to do something about my problems, but i have already taken several steps to help my situation and am currently awaiting starting therapy/medication. And before i could even tell her this she jumped down my throat. Now we haven’t spoken in over a week. I don’t want to instigate a conversation because i feel I’m owed an apology.

188,"So I'm married and have two kids (2 and 4 years old) and I was working locally but I got a big salary hit due to covid. We are not doing too bad TBH, the laws in my country made it so that we don't have to make any payments to banks (mortgage, credit card, loans, etc), so the little I am making is enough to feed my family. That being said, credit cards still accumulate interest and as it is, they are currently maxed out. So while going homeless or starving is not a concern right now, once this is over and I DO have to make payments, we are gonna be in a bad spot.

So I'm taking up any opportunity that arises. I even started a business in a partnership with some lifelong friends and the business is doing pretty good and it's growing well but right now it's really putting money in my pocket so this makes my SO feel uncertain of the future. I'm the only provider of the home and have been doing okay before the pandemic hit.

This takes me to this week where I found a work opportunity that fits my profile like a glove, I send a resume and immediately get a call to schedule an interview, which I nail and then an hour later I get called to have a second interview (to be had two days later) with a higher up and discuss more details about the job and salary. 

At first I was offered an not so tempting offer (though not really bad considering the pandemic) which I counter offered with an amount 50% over what they were offering. They didn't outright refuse and said that they would have to confirm with a superior to approve my asking salary. But beside the salary portion, I was a perfect fit for their needs.

So here's the BUT part. I'm a really family focused person, I ADORE my children and SO, they are the light of my life and the job requires me to travel overseas where the project is being performed. It would be a 3 hour flight and they said that they would pay for two round trips a year but if I needed to come back more often, I would be allowed to travel as often as I'd like (during my days off) but it would need to be out of my pocket. All expenses would be covered for me over there.

The salary I'm asking for (if approved) would be quite life changing. I'd be almost debt free (except for my mortgage) with a year worth of this salary and I'm guaranteed 2 years of work with a high chance of many more years.

So I'm debating if I should take this opportunity. On one hand, after 2 years I'd have basically payed off half of my mortgage and all other debt would be gone. On the other, I'm worried about missing out on my children. Also, there's the business venture I'm currently on that has the potential to be VERY big.

I've already talked to my business partners and they're glad for the opportunity that I have and have supported me by saying that whatever decision I make, they'd have my back. Even if I leave, I wouldn't actually miss on the earnings the venture would make because I'm a major shareholder of the company but I feel like I'd miss on the startup process of the company. Due to the nature of the company, I'd be able to do some work over there but the time I'd have would be massively affected.

My SO doesn't show any feelings (good nor bad) about the whole ordeal because it feels kinda unreal and hasn't really grasped the situation.",26Nov2020,1

I was helping my mom out on discord because she wanted to watch me play a VR game because it involved star-wars and she thought the idea of it being in VR was cool. I didn’t want to accidentally hit her with a controller since you of course cant see the outside world in VR so I told her to get discord so i could share my screen with her while I played. She wanted to friend my brother on discord also and get a profile picture. Since she doesn’t know how to use discord and she’s in her 50’s I helped her add my brother and get a profile picture. She wanted to have the profile picture be of her face like it is on facebook. I was helping her choose a picture (with her consent {important later})but I gave up looking through all her photos because it was mostly flowers, mountains, New York, etc. Then I realized I could search by albums. I assumed she might have an album of just her so I could nab a profile picture for her quickly.

This is where it takes a turn..

I started looking through the alums and I couldn’t find any of her until I found an album titled “mine”. I luckily only saw the first image because she uses an apple phone (I think it might be different for other phones but i could be wrong). However I did see a picture of her naked because “mine apparently meant ‘nudes’ to her. I did however luck out once again and was only able to see her left breast because I looked away fast enough. She never apologized to me once or did anything helpful but instead she acted aroused that I saw her naked in a picture. (I don’t know how specifically to put her reaction in words; but I figured that’s the closest I can.) And of course she is mad at me for swearing because in a state of shock I said “what the fuck?!” And went to my room. What do I do?",26Nov2020,1
192,"I'll try to keep this short - around the beginning of the covid lockdown, I moved in with my sisters due to some tension between me and my father (who I was living with previously).  I was far from my friends and was extremely socially understimulated for the entire lockdown, which led to a sharp decline in my mental health. My sisters were always working, so I was nearly always alone. Then, about three months ago, we moved and I decided to get a part time job. The main reason was because I desperately needed to talk to and meet people. 

My job is where I ended up meeting X. He trained me and we became friendly after a few weeks.  I never had a crush on him, and I don't develop crushes often in general.  I've also never had a significant other; it's something that interested me. I came to learn that X had a girlfriend, and it didn't bother me. They have a long distance relationship. As we became more friendly, we began popping sex jokes (as teenagers do), and it wasn't awkward or anything. Cause they were just jokes.

The jokes started getting a little stranger (where they'd basically be scenarios involving both of us and zero punchline), and I began to wonder if he was interested in something else. It upset me to think that this whole time there was the possibility he only ever made effort to be friendly in hopes that I would eventually do stuff with him.  And also, he has a girlfriend. I was confused. He also told me that his last girlfriend cheated on him and talks about how cheating is an awful thing to do. So I was double confused, and thought that maybe I was overreacting.

I eventually ask him if he wants something other than a friendship from me, and he kind of implies it without saying it.  I bring up his girlfriend, and he explains that he actually talked to her about it and she said that she understands that she can't fulfill his needs for him so it's fine if he does stuff with someone else as long as nobody else knows about it, it's strictly physical, and he doesn't choose me over her.  That whole thing sounded weird to me, but he didn't seem like the type to lie.

I spent some time thinking it over. I wondered for a long time if I was asexual, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to test that theory. I also really didn't want to lose him as a friend, since he's the only person I've been able to talk to in a long time. I ended up agreeing and we fooled around a bit.  I don't necessarily enjoy it, but knowing he enjoys it gives me some sort of comfort(?). The more and more we do it, though, the more and more I feel worse. Countless times while we were doing whatever I would start crying without knowing why. I can't get pleasure out of anything either. I keep doing it because when I think about it, I don't really have a reason not to.  It doesn't bother me consciously.  

I think one thing that does bother me is the fact that I feel used in a way. Like...I'm just a temporary fix for him. I'm number two. His girlfriend sends him things like bracelets in the mail and when I see him wearing them I feel really upset for some reason. I remember he asked me to send pics all the time and eventually I just did it. I did it a few other times even though I don't really like to. Then another time he asked, I said ""why not ask your girlfriend?"" He told me she doesn't send pics. I don't know why that made me cry.  He has an actual girlfriend who he values as a person and I'm just a sex thing. That's what it feels like. I definitely don't like him romantically, or as anything more than a friend, but it still bothers me. I don't want to bring it up to him in case it sounds weird and needy. But I also don't want to stop hanging out with him. I'm just wondering what the best course of action is from this point.",26Nov2020,1
193,"I’m not sure if this is the correct sub but I just really need some advice. I’m going through an extremely tough time. I’m currently living with my parents, and unfortunately I recently got laid off.  Sadly the manager at my job decided to let a few people go and  and I was one of them.  My parents are annoyed with me not having a job right now and they’re making me feel like crap about it.

Now, I’ve decided to continue my education and pursue a career in nursing. My parents, however, are very unsupportive of me in general and have called me a loser, bum, failure, etc. ever since I dropped out of college. What they don’t realize is how badly I’ve struggled with my mental health and how their nasty comments add to my continuously deteriorating mental state. They don’t understand. 

I want to continue my education, but if I do, I’d probably have to live at home for the next 3 years. I don’t think I can handle living with my toxic family members any longer. I want to move out and just take some college courses online or something, but It’s almost impossible to find a job these days where I live and I just have no idea what to do. I just want to be able to support myself and get my life together but my parents hold me back and continue to remind me that I’m a ‘failure’ and that I have nothing going for me. They said I can stay at home until I finish college, but the way they treat me has become SO unbearable. I’m just constantly being put down.

I’d really appreciate some advice. I don’t have anywhere else to go right now and I’m very confused on how to go about bettering my circumstances. I’ve been applying for jobs all week, and have also applied to a local community college. I’m trying to take the steps to better myself but I feel so lost, especially with my parents constantly treating me like crap.",26Nov2020,1

196,"Little backstory,
My partner and I have been dating for 2 and a half years. It is a really happy and healthy relationship, which is something I have never been in until now. My past boyfriends were quite toxic but that's another story.

A year ago I was diagnosed with PolyCystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and I have gained approximately 80lbs because of it. The weight gain and health struggles I have been going through have been really difficult for me. This weight gain was anything but my fault and I am trying to get my weight managed. 

I noticed since being at my biggest weight ( so the past few months) he won't save cute pictures of me that I send him on snapchat and won't take photos of me like he use to. At first I thought it was because we are getting out of that new relationship phase but the thought of my weight crossed my mind. 
When I asked him today if he finds me as pretty and as attractive as I was when we first met, he said you are pretty and later tonight clarifed that it was an unfair question to ask him and that he doesn't want to make me upset but he wants to be honest with me. He reiterated that I am pretty but it seemed like he made sure not to say "" you are just as pretty as ever"". 

I know it was like self sabotaging to ask him this question however I don't know where to go from here. I feel more self conscious than before and it's kind of all my fault. It was an unfair question for me to ask and I did a disservice to myself in asking it but, I can't shake how this has made me feel. Of course he didn't say he doesn't like my body anymore or anything to that effect but it feels like a bit of a slap in the face.",26Nov2020,1

I don't have the same relationship with everyone but I generally like all the guys in here (we're all dudes in the group). I'm super close with a few guys in the group as well and when we hang out individually it's all good and chill mostly. But the group chat is super toxic and they usually target me because I'm a highly agreeable person and not good at fighting back that well, especially not against my friends. I've been getting better at sticking up for myself but it's still hard when you have like 6 people in the group chat just making fun of (nothing serious or genuine just a joke). I've expressed my frustration before and even left the group chat twice and they'll stop for a while but they still get back to it here and there. I can't completely cut them off because they are some of my closest friends and my roommates are in the groupchat. What do you think I should do to better stick up for myself and/or get them to stop always targeting me for the jokes? Thanks in advance for any help it's always much appreciated.",26Nov2020,1

So I was just sitting in my room and my parents took literally every electronic device in this house and created these dog shit rules which make no sense at all.

They provide my siblings and I with the things we need and if we wanted something they would be nice and get it but then the next day im getting screamed at. And especially my mom she screams for the point of screaming when theres 0 point of it. So im just asking did my parents go overboard?

206,"I'm going to preface this by saying that fortunately, the situation is now a hypothetical.  I'll explain that at the end.

My cat was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year.  The chemotherapy required some precautions, since it made her saliva and waste toxic to humans for a period after taking the pill.  As someone with pre-existing health anxiety, I rapidly developed a severe case of OCD around the medication's (minimal) risks.  Within two months, I had days where I stopped eating completely because I was spending the entire day compulsively cleaning my home, and once I even had to go to the ER.

Long story short, my cat was boarded for two months while I sought treatment, and I left that program in much better shape.  However, given how severe my OCD became, I didn't think it was safe for me to restart her chemo.  I could therefore keep the cat and discontinue the chemo, or surrender her to a family that wasn't compromised in this way by mental illness.

My therapist, my sister, a rescue shelter, the vet, and my friends all said that I should hold on to the cat regardless of whether I continue the chemo, because I clearly love her dearly and she'll be happiest with me regardless.  I understand the sentiment, but I thought that when unable to care for a pet, the ethical thing to do was give her up to a family who could.

\*This question is moot because the vet recommended discontinuing the chemo for medical reasons.  Although I'm no longer faced with this decision, I'm still curious what answers I'll get.",26Nov2020,1

I recently came out as FtM to my entire immediate family which includes my Dad, Mom, younger sister and two older brothers. My sister already knew long before and she is extremely supportive so this post excludes her lol. 
Anyways my oldest brother, Shawn, made it extremely clear where he stands on supporting me. When I came out to him, he sent me a long paragraph stating that ""no matter how much stagecraft I do to convince myself I'm a boy I will always be [deadname] his sister"" he wants me to ""respect his beliefs"" aka let him misgender and deadname me because he doesn't believe trans people are real. 
Everyone else reacted moderately when I came out and either didn't refer to me or tried to use he/him sometimes which gave me the impression that they were at least trying.
Well now its Thanksgiving time and Shawn flew in from another state today and has been hammering me with my deadname/wrong pronouns every opportunity he gets. This has caused everyone else (excluding my dad because he's at work for the next couple days) to completely forget to even attempt to gender me correctly and they've all been saying she and using my deadname all day.
Unfortunately I'm very non-confrontational so I havent said anything to them. But this hurts me so much I've practically been on the verge of tears all day. I thought they were genuinely trying to respect me and show they care, but as soon as Shawn shows up they throw everything out the window.

224,"Sorry for the long post! I could really use some non-judgmental advice. 

For just a little context- My ex (20M) and I (18F) were together for a month or so. I was in a very bad place emotionally when we met and so I allowed myself to be manipulated into the relationship because I craved ""love"" and support. It was crazy that we started ""dating"" on the second day of our meeting, but I let myself get carried away. That's on me, I know.

Now, sex has always been a very big deal for me because of a past sexual trauma and he knew that. It didn't matter though. He was insistent and pushed me to a point where I eventually just gave in, even though I wasn't comfortable with it because I ""wanted to make him happy"" and ""was afraid he would leave"". After we'd done it, I felt pretty numb to it all but in my head, the relationship was already over because my safe space was violated. I don't blame him because I'm the one who gave in, but he was unnecessarily pushy and persistent which left a bad taste in my mouth. Eventually, we broke up for other reasons and I've remained cordial with the dude. 

So thing is, he says he's still in love with me and all that. I don't encourage that and I don't lead him on, but I still have him on my contacts and answer the phone when he calls if he needs me for anything. 

Now to the actual issue: he called yesterday to talk saying how he ""missed hearing my voice"" and all that. I politely steered the conversation away and while we were bantering on a friendly note, something came up in the conversation and he called me a ""stripper"". That, for some reason, really bothered me and I got quiet and awkward and ended the conversation soon. I'm really passive and so was afraid to confront him though it bothered me. However, when one of our mutual friends found out, she was absolutely FURIOUS and called him up to essentially yell at him about respect and stuff. 

Shortly after this I get a call from him and he was just yelling at me the entire time saying it was ""just a joke"". I was annoyed and asked him how that was supposed to be funny, especially given the fact that I was his ex and him knowing my position on sex, was  being extremely inconsiderate. He then turns it around on me and said that he only said that because I had made a similar joke when we were dating. He said that I was the one to initiate it by calling myself a stripper and apparently by asking him if ""I should strip for him"", and when I tried replying to him, he hung up and blocked me. 

I know what I did and didn't say, and I sure as hell never said anything of the sort because it goes completely against my character. However, the way he said it shook me to the core and I feel so gross and disgusted with myself. I wish I had remained strong when he pressured me and not given in because I now regret everything that happened. I can't change the past, but I'm currently feeling uneasy and on edge all the time. I feel gross and naked everytime a stranger LOOKS at me and I've been wearing at least three layers of clothes at all times. 

I'm aware that this isn't normal but I'm afraid to tell people because I don't want to be told that I'm ""overreacting"" because after all, it was ""just a word"" told as ""just a joke"". What should I do about this? How do I get over this and feel normal again? AM I overreacting? I feel really lost and alone, and any advice is welcome.",26Nov2020,1

Jackie has the largest and nicest room
Allison has the smallest room
I have a mid sized room probably just a tad bigger than Allison but nowhere near the size of Jackie’s. 

In the beginning of the lease we all agreed we would split rent three ways evenly. Everyone agreed and all was well.

Fast forward to a few days ago and Allison comes to me and says since her room is smaller than Jackie’s she wants to pay $100 less in rent. She said it never used to bother her but she has had a few friends comment how small her room is, and now it does. 

Since my room truly isn’t much bigger than hers, I don’t really want to have to pay more, but I know Jackie will insist on me splitting the extra hundred with her if she even goes for this at all. Can anyone give me advice on how to handle this. They are both my really good friends. 

Thank you for your help!",26Nov2020,1

229,"TRIGGER WARNING FOR SEXUAL ABUSE




My bf and I have been together for about 6 months and we have had a sexual relationship. The last couple months I just haven’t been in the mood. I do have a past where I was molested, sexually assaulted and sexually abused as a young child. I understand that my lack of “mood” is most likely from my past but my bf is having trouble with my lack of interest in any kind of touching (even cuddling) 

Since this has started my bf has been mildly pressuring me to have sex. At least once a night he’ll ask me if I’m in the mood or just straight up if I want to have sex. Btw we are both adults and live together. I’ve told him before that asking doesn’t help get me in the mood and that I just haven’t been interested in it and he knows about my past. My bf does love me and I don’t think he’s trying to “break me down” or anything like that I just think that he doesn’t fully realize how I feel and I don’t know how to explain it to him. 

Can anyone help me with this?",26Nov2020,1

I honestly don’t know why I’m here. I figured talking to someone might make me feel better, but that’s just the name of the subreddit. Sorry in advance if my paragraph spacing is odd, or if my writing doesn’t meet an acceptable standard. I am typing on mobile, which often formats text in unintended ways. By all accounts, I am not a good writer either. Just a disclaimer/apology before you go into this. 

From the start, I acknowledge that my problems are pretty minor compared to most other people, but I am coping with them very poorly. I’m not a very strong person in stature, mental capacity, nor emotional tolerance. Some of this may be attributed to being a high school senior, but I fear most of it is based in my personality. I suppose I just wanted to throw a pity party for myself and see what people had to say. I think you call that “venting”, but I may be mistaken. I don’t speak with people often, in person or online. 

As previously mentioned, I am an 18 year-old high school senior, and I really just want life to pass me by. Nothing in my life is particularly tragic. I come from a middle class upbringing. My mother left my father when I was six and married a rich man, her sixth husband. My father won primary custody, which was a good thing because my mother was abusive, dependent on alcohol, suicidal, and prone to travel often without family. Namely, she has borderline personality disorder, but it simply comes across as lack of identity or care for anyone but herself. She is relatively stable now, and I still visit her to get her off my back, but she was physically aggressive with my father and attempted suicide multiple times in front of me as a child. Specifically, I recall her smashing a vase and trying to slit her wrist. I’m not trying to be edgy, but I think that may be my earliest memory. Other than that, she really doesn’t seem to care about me all too much, and my stepfather is fine enough. 

I live and take care of my grandfather and father. I feel as if I can never please them. I clean the house everyday to the point of being nearly sterile. I fix their dinners. I let them complain about their lousy days. Even then, I feel like every “thank you” is a backhanded insult. There’s no emotion behind their feigned gratitude or praise. I just want to make them proud, and it feels like I fall short. Since my mother left more than ten years ago, my father has been bland. My grandfather loves me, but he is very stoic. In my house, everybody including myself are always having terrible days. I really feel as if there’s nothing positive in my life except for the things that one would traditionally take for granted, but I even appreciate those things. It’s hard to imprint emotion into oneself at the sight of shelter and electricity, though. 

School is awful. Up until the fifth grade, I was beaten up and bullied pretty badly. I’m sure I’m not the victim in someone else’s story, but it seems to me that I was bullied simply because I was the fat, mild tempered kid. It made me an easy target for someone’s pent up aggression. I transitioned to a private school in the sixth grade with a 60% scholarship and it got worse. The bullying stopped, but my life got worse. Still fat, ugly, and stupid, I was simply ignored. My school prides itself on being a “close knit community”, and that’s very true. The problem was that I’ve always been more of a stain on that tight-knitted fabric than another thread. I have tried to be many different people in hopes that I would be accepted. None of those people I became were bad, but nobody cared for me. No matter what I did, who I tried to talk to, what I did for everyone else, nobody cared for me. This persists today. I have no friends. I have tried so hard. 

Despite my best efforts over a span of six years at this school, I still am literally the only person to be alone on the field trip bus. I’ve gotten too anxious to sit alone at ouch, because people stare, so I just head to the library and sit in the empty meeting room until classes resume. In the eleventh grade, I starved myself, and still do, to maintain a figure that is not too fat. At the very least, I find myself more aesthetically pleasing at 105 lbs 5’8 than 170 lbs 5’2. The dieting won’t fix my face though, so I’m left questioning if it even matters. The point is that I may simply be too embarrassing for people to be around. What is most frustrating is that I can’t get a straight answer on my looks. It’s impossible to ask how attractive I am to my colleagues at school, so that’s a no. Additionally, I posted to r/amiugly on an old account, and people regarded me as very handsome. I’m not an edgy person, despite my post’s tone, and my school wears a uniform, so it’s not as if I wear black chains and mope around to grunge music. 

College application deadlines are coming up, but I am struggling to find the motivation to write my personal essay. Ironic, seeing how far we are into this post. I find it hard to believe that I’ll be good at anything I attempt. I have no motivation to do my homework or study, so I have failed many of my recent classes as I’ve been getting lazier throughout the years. Even if I made it into college, it likely would not be a good one. It doesn’t feel great to be behind your peers in every academic and social pursuit, especially when I used to be a phenomenal student. I don’t know what happened. Adolescence, I guess, without the strength to keep my head up for the duration. 

I don’t know why, but I wanted to touch briefly on intimacy. I am a straight male, and I used to find various females very attractive. To this day I recognize attractive people, and have no questions about my sexuality, but I can’t breach this newfound mental barrier between self loathing and intimacy. I have tried many times with no luck. Any time I see someone attractive, my brain skips the primal urges and jumps straight to the social impossibility that anyone will ever care for me. I have been alive for eighteen years and it seems that nobody every has. 

I don’t feel as if I have an identity. I have spent so long trying to be everyone else that I’m not sure what I enjoy doing. After this long on earth, though young, I don’t think I have ever wanted to accomplish something. I don’t think I have any established interests. I feel like a side character of my own life, and I just want to protagonist to ignore me so that I can sit back and die. Wait it out, you know? 

I have made nothing of my life, and in some cases screwed it up for the future. I was dealt a good hand and failed to make the most, or anything of it. I fail to exhibit masculine strength or masculine urges. I fail to form relationships with others, and I don’t even feel the emotions that go along with it. The worst thing is that despite the money, effort, and emotion my father and grandfather have put into me, I don’t think I have ever loved them or anyone else. Cliche, sure, but I really don’t think I have experienced the emotion of love, as well as a range of others, in my life. I truly only remember feeling sadness and frustration. 

Thank you for making it through my pity party. I’m sorry, again, if it didn’t read well. On top of being inept at writing, I rarely share my true emotions with anyone. Feel free to respond if you want to.",26Nov2020,1
235,"Ight sorry if the grammar is kinda shit in really upset right now.
Ok so I'm 16 my sister is 15 my dad is in his 50s same with my mom.
      A few days ago when I was at work they were going to go out too eat and my sister couldn't make up her mind, she was winning a tiny bit. Apparently my dad just kinda snapped and went of about how he feels like noone cares about him and how he feels like we want him gone, my mom was really upset and crying and shit.

      Moving on to tonight at dinner he gets weird like asking where we would want to go to vacation but in a weird way it's hard to describe. He move on to say that he felt like we were not a family but people who lived together. After taking about how much fun he had drinking with randoms. He had me pick a number between 3and 5 so I think that's how long he has felt this way.

     By now my mom is crying and my sister has tears leaking. I say look at them u think that's how they feel. And that pisses him off. My sister then goes at him and it's kinda a blur.

Lastly he turned off our data using our shitty wifi to post this. He gave no warning that he was gonna. When we confronted him he said it's all we did and our brains were going to mush. I then asked him what he expected us to do as everything is closed bc covid. He then just got up ignored us and went to bed.

239,"I have NEVER done any drugs besides alcohol. I had to  get drug tested for a job so I went and did the test. A few days later I got a text saying I needed to call the testing company for follow up. I got ahold of the “medical review officer” and was told I tested positive for morphine. I was very caught off guard as I have never taken pain killers. I was prescribed them once a few years back and did not take them due to family addiction history. The medical review officer asked me if I had taken pain meds I was prescribed or any other medicine and asked if I had taken any recreational drugs. I told her no so she asked what I had for breakfast that day. I had an everything bagel like I do every day. She said the poppyseeds likely caused the positive test because the company I’m taking the test for has no minimum threshold and my numbers were very low. She said she’d mark the test negative and that she would send it to my company. She wouldn’t send me an email to that effect so I wrote myself an email transcribing what I could remember of the conversation highlighting what she said to get a time stamp of what I was told and when.
Is there anything else I should do besides hope this medical review officer does what she said on the phone? I’m confused and anxious by how this is real.",26Nov2020,1

243,"     A year ago, my mom started dating this guy. We'll call him Tom. Tom is a pretty great guy, is nice to our family and helps out a lot. He had kids of his own, but got divorced. He is also the current breadwinner of the house, as he has moved in with us. Now, I really I had nothing against it, I knew he was a cool dude, and makes my mom happy too. However, today my mom and I got into a huge fight with him. I vividly remember how it went, but it all started with the mention of vaccines. He started going on about something crazy, then I told him ""Please tell me you vaccinated your kids."". He then was spouting out how vaccines are super bad, how they only make things worse. He also mentioned how the Earth is not actually millions of years old, only thousands. I told him how vaccines are actually super useful. Tom said that vaccines are man-made, therefore they're bad. He said that any medicine that was made by man was bad, and that natural stuff is much better anyway. I told him that not all man-made medicine is bad, and some are needed to help people through their causes. I also mentioned how, scientists have proved that the Earth is super old, and that it can be explained in many ways. Then, the conversation spiraled to chaos. My mom was screaming, Tom was screaming, and I kind of just stood back (Arguments just make me really uncomfortable). He then was talking about the bible, (we are both Christians, however, I'm not one of those crazy ones, dw) and other things, I dont quite recall. I told him the boat story, the one about how a man on a boat had many chances to be saved, such as another boat and a helicopter, but waits for a sign of god instead. He then passes and gets to heaven and says, ""why didnt you send me anything?"" Then God follows with ""I did!"". He tells me how that story is stupid, and how that would never happen. I get confused, because there would be no way he would know if that's real. Then I follow with that, not everyone believes in God, (I dont remember how this was brought up), and there are things such as reincarnation or just... nothingness. Tom says that, there would only be one way of reincarnation, that being us being spirits, being a human, then becoming a spirit once more. I said that, there are actually many ways of incarnation (turning into a bug, turning into an animal, etc.). He states that it's a really stupid idea, and that him dying and turning into an animal would never happen. Tom said that he'd like to talk to my priest and see what they thought, and he would persuade my priest into seeing the ""truth"". He called all priests greedy and terrible people. I had about enough, because my priest has been there for me since forever, helps out in the church, and even pays for us when we do group stuff. Not to mention, his daughter is one of my closest friends. My mom could sense I wasn't doing well, and told him to stop (total shocker, he didn't). I just went to my room and started playing some Among Us. Probably doesn't help how I was feeling, but it was fun.

247,"I should really see a psychiatrist or therapist, but I simply don’t have the money. I’m not going to hurt myself or others so it’s not anything super important, I just generally feel like I’m crazy sometimes.

My current problem is that I cannot stop myself from feeling like I don’t drink enough water. I get these weird complexes with different foods that come and go, and I don’t know how to stop myself. I drink more than enough water. My urine is crystal clear. Seriously.

Somehow I keep telling myself in my head that I don’t drink enough though. That one more bottle today (and the clock resets daily) will be enough. But it’s never enough. 

Also, I will go long periods of time avoiding water because I am worried it’s “contaminated”. I will get so dehydrated, but my brain is worried that the plastic has leeched into the water or that there’s something toxic in it.

When I was a child we had rusty pipes and my mom told me that the water was brown because our sewage got mixed with the water. Now I can’t drink tap water plain, but if I mix it with another drink or put flavoring into the water I don’t have a problem?? It’s so stupid I know but I can’t bring myself to drink it plain sometimes otherwise. Oh and also I don’t drink the bottom part of my drinks. My mom told me that all of my backwash goes there and it is like drinking straight vomit. I know it’s not true, but I can’t get it out of my head. 


It’s not just food related things I get weird about though. I can’t wear an item of clothing twice without washing it. I know it’s terrible for the environment and I hate myself for it but I just feel gross.

Oh and also, I almost always do those things, but once in awhile I will drink the bottom of a glass without thinking about it or drink tap water plain if I’m really thirsty. It’s not 100% consistent. Just 99.9999%. That’s why I feel like I’m crazy. It’s not like I do the same thing every day. It comes and it goes. I feel like if I had some sort of condition it would be consistent right?? 

I have a thing about my toothbrush and the “bathroom air” so I use a travel toothbrush. Which doesn’t make sense right? The travel toothbrush goes into its little container damp and probably grows tiny mold. But somehow that’s preferable to the bathroom air touching my toothbrush. Ugh I feel so silly saying all of this. Sometimes my boyfriend will notice my little odd things I do and call it cute, but I find it embarrassing that my brain needs to have things this weird way. My mother was a self-declared germaphobe and some days I feel like I’ve turned into her. Some days I wash my hands every time I touch anything “dirty” and then my hands end up very dry and stinging. Some days I don’t care.

Todd came in that day and bought me a flower, he said that I was really nice and seemed a bit off so he wanted to make my day better. I was a little hesitant but it seemed like a nice gesture. He even made a comment about how he didn’t want to seem “creepy”. I see him a few more times and it’s just normal conversation. Once I mentioned how my roommate had been jealous as she works in a grocery store too and no one had ever bought her flowers before. Flash forward like a week and the next time he comes in he bought flowers for me and for my roommate. I laughed it off again and he made a joke about how he didn’t want her to be jealous.

I don't know exactly how to solve this shyness and timidity I have with girls, but I think if I start talking to more girls, then that will get me more comfortable.

262,"I'm at a bit of a crossroads in life right now. This week I found out my whole team at work is now not coming back to the office except for me after the Covid-19 pandemic. I'm naturally thinking about permanent remote options after this news. I'm originally from the New England area and I was doing in office work for Chicago. I'm riding out the pandemic at home with my parents right now and I've been here since April. I naturally prefer in-office work over work from home but the difference is only marginal.

A bit of context is that I have a decent amount of baggage tied down to Chicago like a good amount of shit happened to me while I was there and poisoned my view of the city. If you asked me this question in April of this year, this was a no brainer to move away but over the pandemic, I made peace with the shit that happened to me as well as the city of Chicago itself. I believe I'm ready to try that city again. I think my issue is now that I have no reason to stay in Chicago now other than my friends are there (family is in New England) since originally that was work but now that's not an issue (I'm a single male in twenties).

So here are my options now. If you could give me a suggestion for what option or some option I'm not considering that would be great:

1. (Doesn't matter which choice I take here) Stay in Chicago for a year and if that doesn't pan out move to New England
2. Go permanent remote and move to New England",26Nov2020,1
263,"Hello all, I understand plagiarism is an awful thing, but please don't judge me too harshly, i truly did not think it over. :( 

Context: 
I posted a week ago in a FB group where there are a lot of jewelry workers/silversmiths. I wanted to look for someone who was skilled enough to carry out one of my (own) designs. However, I did not wish to broadcast my own design in the group. As such, I just put a bunch of random images of nice jewelry pieces that I found on pinterest, and it didn't occur to me to put a disclaimer or something saying: ""i dont intend to copy these pieces, etc"" because I chose the pictures solely for the techniques used in the production of them, not the product itself. I should have put more thought into the post but I just wanted to quickly look for someone and didn't think much of it, which is where I went horribly wrong.

Was contacted today by the shop that owned one of the products in the picture i had taken off of pinterest, via email. They asked for an explanation, should I tell them the exact same thing I mentioned above (as in the truth)? Or should I just ignore the email? I'm worried they might not believe me...

I'm so stressed out. I did not mean to plagiarise anyone's work, I just needed some way to explain the techniques I was expecting for my own design, and I understand it was thoughtless of me, and I should have been more thorough with my post instead of just carelessly putting it out in a hurry. 

Any advice would be much appreciated, never had to deal with issues of plagiarism ever, especially not on facebook :(",26Nov2020,1
264,"I'm really not sure what kind of advice I'm looking for but, I'm trying to move on from my online friends since I've been grounded and I won't be getting my phone back form a *long* while. I want to rejoin this discord server (on my iPad) but I shouldn't because of this older man that was speaking inappropriately with me (reason I got grounded). 

I know I just need to stay away, as I've been grounded already for months and I have no reason to go back but really I just miss my friends I guess. I'm sure they've already forgotten about me (I mean, I wasn't that close to the people on there) but I just want to see how everyone’s doing I guess; I have the older man blocked so he wouldn't see my messages anyway.  

If I did rejoin, I’d have to ask one of the people for the link and I'm too shy because I know I have no business joining even if for only an hour and I’d never ask to come back again. I understand this is probably childish or something that requires common sense and not real advice but, I just need help moving on. 

I've been distracting myself with other things, I've already moved on from my school friends in a way, not speaking to them for a few months now and I stopped aching to talk to them.

265,"This is a repost. 

I honestly don’t know why I’m here. I figured talking to someone might make me feel better, but that’s just the name of the subreddit. Sorry in advance if my paragraph spacing is odd, or if my writing doesn’t meet an acceptable standard. I am typing on mobile, which often formats text in unintended ways. By all accounts, I am not a good writer either. Just a disclaimer/apology before you go into this. 

From the start, I acknowledge that my problems are pretty minor compared to most other people, but I am coping with them very poorly. I’m not a very strong person in stature, mental capacity, nor emotional tolerance. Some of this may be attributed to being a high school senior, but I fear most of it is based in my personality. I suppose I just wanted to throw a pity party for myself and see what people had to say. I think you call that “venting”, but I may be mistaken. I don’t speak with people often, in person or online. 

As previously mentioned, I am an 18 year-old high school senior, and I really just want life to pass me by. Nothing in my life is particularly tragic. I come from a middle class upbringing. My mother left my father when I was six and married a rich man, her sixth husband. My father won primary custody, which was a good thing because my mother was abusive, dependent on alcohol, suicidal, and prone to travel often without family. Namely, she has borderline personality disorder, but it simply comes across as lack of identity or care for anyone but herself. She is relatively stable now, and I still visit her to get her off my back, but she was physically aggressive with my father and attempted suicide multiple times in front of me as a child. Specifically, I recall her smashing a vase and trying to slit her wrist. I’m not trying to be edgy, but I think that may be my earliest memory. Other than that, she really doesn’t seem to care about me all too much, and my stepfather is fine enough. 

I live and take care of my grandfather and father. I feel as if I can never please them. I clean the house everyday to the point of being nearly sterile. I fix their dinners. I let them complain about their lousy days. Even then, I feel like every “thank you” is a backhanded insult. There’s no emotion behind their feigned gratitude or praise. I just want to make them proud, and it feels like I fall short. Since my mother left more than ten years ago, my father has been bland. My grandfather loves me, but he is very stoic. In my house, everybody including myself are always having terrible days. I really feel as if there’s nothing positive in my life except for the things that one would traditionally take for granted, but I even appreciate those things. It’s hard to imprint emotion into oneself at the sight of shelter and electricity, though. 

School is awful. Up until the fifth grade, I was beaten up and bullied pretty badly. I’m sure I’m not the victim in someone else’s story, but it seems to me that I was bullied simply because I was the fat, mild tempered kid. It made me an easy target for someone’s pent up aggression. I transitioned to a private school in the sixth grade with a 60% scholarship and it got worse. The bullying stopped, but my life got worse. Still fat, ugly, and stupid, I was simply ignored. My school prides itself on being a “close knit community”, and that’s very true. The problem was that I’ve always been more of a stain on that tight-knitted fabric than another thread. I have tried to be many different people in hopes that I would be accepted. None of those people I became were bad, but nobody cared for me. No matter what I did, who I tried to talk to, what I did for everyone else, nobody cared for me. This persists today. I have no friends. I have tried so hard. 

Despite my best efforts over a span of six years at this school, I still am literally the only person to be alone on the field trip bus. I’ve gotten too anxious to sit alone at ouch, because people stare, so I just head to the library and sit in the empty meeting room until classes resume. In the eleventh grade, I starved myself, and still do, to maintain a figure that is not too fat. At the very least, I find myself more aesthetically pleasing at 105 lbs 5’8 than 170 lbs 5’2. The dieting won’t fix my face though, so I’m left questioning if it even matters. The point is that I may simply be too embarrassing for people to be around. What is most frustrating is that I can’t get a straight answer on my looks. It’s impossible to ask how attractive I am to my colleagues at school, so that’s a no. Additionally, I posted to r/amiugly on an old account, and people regarded me as very handsome. I’m not an edgy person, despite my post’s tone, and my school wears a uniform, so it’s not as if I wear black chains and mope around to grunge music. 

College application deadlines are coming up, but I am struggling to find the motivation to write my personal essay. Ironic, seeing how far we are into this post. I find it hard to believe that I’ll be good at anything I attempt. I have no motivation to do my homework or study, so I have failed many of my recent classes as I’ve been getting lazier throughout the years. Even if I made it into college, it likely would not be a good one. It doesn’t feel great to be behind your peers in every academic and social pursuit, especially when I used to be a phenomenal student. I don’t know what happened. Adolescence, I guess, without the strength to keep my head up for the duration. 

I don’t know why, but I wanted to touch briefly on intimacy. I am a straight male, and I used to find various females very attractive. To this day I recognize attractive people, and have no questions about my sexuality, but I can’t breach this newfound mental barrier between self loathing and intimacy. I have tried many times with no luck. Any time I see someone attractive, my brain skips the primal urges and jumps straight to the social impossibility that anyone will ever care for me. I have been alive for eighteen years and it seems that nobody every has. 

I don’t feel as if I have an identity. I have spent so long trying to be everyone else that I’m not sure what I enjoy doing. After this long on earth, though young, I don’t think I have ever wanted to accomplish something. I don’t think I have any established interests. I feel like a side character of my own life, and I just want to protagonist to ignore me so that I can sit back and die. Wait it out, you know? 

I have made nothing of my life, and in some cases screwed it up for the future. I was dealt a good hand and failed to make the most, or anything of it. I fail to exhibit masculine strength or masculine urges. I fail to form relationships with others, and I don’t even feel the emotions that go along with it. The worst thing is that despite the money, effort, and emotion my father and grandfather have put into me, I don’t think I have ever loved them or anyone else. Cliche, sure, but I really don’t think I have experienced the emotion of love, as well as a range of others, in my life. I truly only remember feeling sadness and frustration. 

Thank you for making it through my pity party. I’m sorry, again, if it didn’t read well. On top of being inept at writing, I rarely share my true emotions with anyone. Feel free to respond if you want to.",26Nov2020,1

269,"I know this has been asked in almost every subreddit where people can talk about their life and i have read a lot of them too, but i still can't make up my mind and i need someone to listen to my problems since i have nobody else to talk with. 

And... English isn't my first language, so I'm sorry if I make some mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in my fourth year in university pursuing a graphic design degree. I should have been graduated in May next year, but I failed 2 out of 6 semesters due to my mental health. In order to keep continue studying in university, I need to repeat those 2 semesters, but my anxiety has kept getting worse to the point where even a sound of knocking door could trigger my panic attack. In my 7th semester (right now) I thought I could do an online class just well since I don't need to meet up with others face to face, but i really can't so i'll need to repeat this semester too. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So, here's the problem...**  
I'm faced with two options right now, either i'm going to drop out or repeat another year.  


**About repeating another year...**

I have talked about this with my psychiatrist and my university student's support, both of them said that i should keep going with my study. 

The problem with this option is during 2 semesters where i can't attend classes, my university gave me 0 points on my GPA and they don't even refund my money on those two semesters. 

I don't know how's the system works with other university but on mine at this point, i can only take a total of 12 hours of classes weekly on the next semesters (about 3-4 classes) where each semester i should take about 6-8 classes (24 hours). So, i can't repeat the semesters i failed within 1 year. What's worse is my university has a term where a student must graduate within 10 semesters (5 years), if a student failed to do so then they must repeat from the 1st year again. I don't know if i could negotiate with this since i can't even negotiate on 0 point GPA from the semesters i don't even attend.

&amp;#x200B;

**What about my plan after drop out?**

Now, if i'm going to drop out i'm planning to take 1 year to develop my portfolio and studying foreign languages then going as a freelance illustrator or getting a paid internship that doesn't require a college degree to get more experience and paying my medical bills. 

To be honest, i'm more comfortable with this option but i can't say the same for my family. My parents have even prepared to send me to study overseas right after i'm graduate (we aren't rich at all but they work so hard to get all of that money). They put so many expectations on me and i'm terrified to betray those expectations. 

My mom wants me to make a lot of money so i can take care of my family and send my little brother to university (I'm 8 years older than my brother) when my parents retire. But.. i feel like this is unfair, i want to do something for my own life and even though i don't think i could do this but i do want to have my own family in the future. I don't think i can keep on supporting my family when i want to start preparing for my own life too. 

My dad, on the other hand, is kinda indifferent. As long as i can show a result then it's okay. But with my current condition, i feel bad since it's my choice to went for a graphic design major when he suggested me to go for another major instead.

I'm not close with my family, we rarely talk to each other except it's really important. That being said, i haven't even told them that i have panic disorder. They don't believe in mental illness so yeah this is another thing that has been bothering me.

&amp;#x200B;

**My concern is...**

I have read a lot about the consequences of dropping out and how harsh freelancing can be which makes me even more confused about what should i do to the point where I started to think about ending my life lately... 

I'd appreciate if i could get an advice or even a correction regarding my point of view and to the parents out there how would you react if your child wants to drop out of their study? 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

 I failed a year in university because of mental health and now i'm struggling whether to repeat another year or drop out

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concern, i might not be able to respond quickly if someone is replying to me since i'm still kinda afraid to look at notifications on my phone but i'll definitely read your reply! Thank you very much! Sorry for the long post",26Nov2020,1
270,I had been seeing him for about 5 months and long story short I just didn’t think it was gonna work out. I knew he wanted more from me and I already felt like I was carrying a secret by having doubts about the future of me and him in the first place. We live in two different states and I just got out of a really toxic long term relationship in April that also was long distance for a portion of the relationship. I don’t feel like I have any capacity at this time in my life to grow or live with the weight of someone’s hopes on top of me and so I tried as best as I could to end it and have a conversation with him and explain where I was coming from. This is the first time I’ve ever broken up with someone or even significantly hurt someone (that I know of). Now he’s texting me that I broke his heart and how much it hurts and I genuinely don’t know what to say to him or how to react. I feel and immense amount of guilt for hurting him and I don’t know what to do I’ve been crying since we had the phone conversation.,26Nov2020,1
271,"To start I'm a 25YO M who got hit pretty hard when Covid hit, resulting in me going back to live with my parent(mom) until I get stable and on my feet. I ended meeting the most wonderful woman around June and I asked her to marry me in August and everything was great, but she also didn't have her own do to Covid messing up her plans. So I ended moving in at her grandmother's house with her, this is key because her grandmother was very abusive towards her growing up, i ended moving her to my mother's house because her grandmother was too toxic for us to be around. We've been at my mom's for about a month and a half mind you my fiance is pregnant now and she felt like a burden so she wanted leave and go back to her grandmother, I kinda took that as if she were leaving the relationship and cried and put on a whole show. Her grandmother would tell her that I would abandon her or that I was crazy and I feel I did exactly as she planned it's been 3 days and she says she still loves me but idk what to say to get her to talk with me on the phone rather than text. I need someone to really talk with",26Nov2020,1
272,so.. a few weeks ago i went to a coffee shop with a friend and the barista taking my order gave me a free drink bc we started talking about a new drink i should try. afterwards my friend and i were sitting outside and he was leaving and he asked me how i liked it and had a super short convo. a week later i went again w a friend and he was coming in to the shop and he stopped on his tracks and looked me and gave me handguns bc i pointed at him bc i wasn’t sure if it was him bc of the mask. i then said i thought he looked familiar bc of his tats and then he asked me how work was. that was it bc the girl checking me out started asking what i wanted to drink. then a week later i went alone and i saw he was in the back and through the corner of my eye i saw him walk out look at me and walk to the back again. so.. was he just being nice with the drink? i’m a clown i know lol,26Nov2020,1
273,"As background context; my mental health is... not great. You can check my post history for further details on that if you wish. What matters in this post is that I have been able to stay afloat due to a small support network of a few great friends, and my girlfriend.

So now the awful rom-com begins. I don't think I want to pursue a relationship with my girlfriend into the future. She's one of the best people you'll ever meet on the face of the Earth in practically every way imagineable, and I am very lucky to have her in my life. But, sadly, we just have a handfull of incompatibilities that aren't solveable, and I've fallen out of romantic love for her a bit I guess. I have stayed with her for months longer than I should have, partly because I wanted to see if this was a passing feeling and if we could work things out, but also because I do still love her and want her in my life in some way, shape, or form.

So here comes curveball number one. For the past year or so, I have developed an increasingly strong crush for another woman in my life... the girlfriend of one of my only friends. I'm not dumb, and I'd like to think I'm not an awful person, so obviously I have not said or done *anything* in regards to these feelings. I have tried to distance myself as much as possible from my mate and her, but it's difficult as they are great friends with my girlfriend also, and when I distance myself from them I pretty much lose my only support system outside of my relationship. I really am great friends with both my friend and his girlfriend, and they help me out a lot. 

I'm not in college anymore, so I can't just abandon everyone and make new friends. I'm incredibly introverted anyway. I don't imagine I will be able to find relationships like this again.

I know you can't be around someone you're pining for, especially not when they are happy with one of your best friends. If I tell a word of this to any of them, obviously that destroys my only remaining relationships in my life. I burn all my remaining bridges.

If I break things off with my girlfriend, which I think is best for her as I have been extremely unfair leaving her with someone who is not loving her as much as she deserves, she and the other two people involved will gravitate towards each other as I'm definitely the 'weakest link' in this friendship ground, leaving me with nothing as well.

I only found out cause on the phone I asked how the dogs were doing and she tells me what happened.  I grew up with these dogs for 13 years and never even got to say goodbye.  

Since then I've decided to cut her out of my life permanently.  This topped off 5 years of her consistently acting in a way that stepped all over my feelings and made me feel miserable.

I feel great not having her in my life.  But when I share my decision with others, they see me as the asshole.  They think I should be more understanding and forgive her, and that a relationship with my mum is important and I should try harder.

My problem is I just can't do it.  I don't even want to talk to her about any of this because I know how the conversation goes.  ""I'm really sorry anon.  You know I did my best.""

288,"BACKGROUND 

- My partner and I are both from a relatively misogynistic and regressive Islamic developing country. 

- She comes from a poor, abusive family. She is highly intelligent, constructive, positive and entrepreneurial but has difficulty fitting in with others. 

- I come from a more-well-off, less-abusive family. I'm good at superficial social interaction, but I'm unintelligent, lazy, narcissistic, exploitative and a compulsive liar. 

Despite being ridden with gender dysphoria issues for my entire my life, I hadn't considered transitioning until I met my partner. She suggested it and basically helped train me to blend in. 

- We met online about 6 years ago.Both of us were unaware of my problems at the time. After hitting it off, we moved in together to escape her abusive family ASAP. We also got married (Legally-speaking I'm male).

- My life partner and I have been trying to build a life together for 6 years now. The goal has been to build a business and/or career/s together and leave this country to move to Japan.



THE PROBLEM

I keep performing constant and dangerous acts of sabotage on her:


- My logic is consistently faulty in a way that leads me to keep doing things that waste our resources or even potentially put us in legal/financial trouble. 

I have answered bank/insurance phone calls and even made a bank visit pretending to be her. I actually thought this was acceptable simply because no one would notice. Just last week I almost called the tax office pretending to be her. 


- I regularly interpret her requests and instructions in the most malicious way possible. 

The aforementioned tax office call happened because she told me to call and find out how to get MY taxpayer number and explain the process to her. 

I literally remembered it as ""Call, PRETENDING TO BE HER and ask for HER taxpayer number"".


- I keep instinctively lying and defending myself without reason when speaking to her. Every instinct I have seems bent towards playing the victim and painting her as evil. 

She can literally be showing me info on a screen asking me about a discrepancy in my work, and I'll just keep mumbling things like ""Oh, that's weird, I don't remember there being a discrepancy..."" whilst NOT ACTUALLY LOOKING at the screen. 


- I keep blanking out and ignoring or mishearing (Maliciously, as-described above) important information from her. I just subconsciously seem to have no respect for her. 


- When she entrusts me with an important task, I will regularly perform it normally for a while, then subconsciously stop doing it or alter how I do it so that it's somehow harmful. 


- I'm not sure whether I truly ever knew how to take criticism, but after years of this, now whenever she criticizes my behaviour, my brain slows to a crawl and all I can think of is either trying to justify myself or a stream of ""Oh...Yeah, okay, I agree...I'm sorry...I'll try and do what you say..."" which feels off to both of us and even I have zero confidence in, because every time I apologize or resolve to do better next time, I just go and do the exact same thing again. 


I have been constantly doing all of these things for 6 years, it is getting worse and I even constantly forget that I do these things in the first place until reminded. 

My only subconscious takeaway from these 6 years seems to be that my partner is ""verbally abusive"" and constantly ""misjudges"" me due to my track record. I keep defaulting to assuming I'm doomed to being wrongly accused by her all the time. 

I really, really want to stop. Consciously, I want nothing more than to be the supportive partner to her that we both expected me to be, but it is not going well. 

We have spent tens of thousands of hours (Literally 6-12 hours frequently, even daily at times) discussing how I can stop being like this, but I just keep unconsciously slipping back into the same pattern. I even drag on our discussions for hours longer-than-necessary with drama, repetiton, derailment and gaslighting. 

Worse-still, my memory is failing and I find myself spacing out/floating away more and more often, even when alone. I literally feel as if I'm losing grip of myself mentally. 


OUR CURRENT STATE

-  Her planned business has been unable to start until now because of my behaviour. 

- We are currently trying to limit my interactions with her, but I'm still getting worse anyway.

- We've taken me off handling anything important (Bank stuff etc).

- We've concluded that in my current state, I am a liability to the business and should not work in it. 

We've determined that because I'm basically bilingual in English and Japanese (Several years living experience in Japan, Japanese Associate Degree), have a knack for languages and like talking to people, I can and should contribute by becoming a translator. 

This way, I can earn a decent income to help fund her business and get us to Japan.


CONCLUSION

The massive problem with this plan is that my partner DOESN'T SPEAK JAPANESE. 

We want to make this work, but considering my ongoing horrendous issues, it hardly seems safe for us to go to a country where she can't speak the language and will be forced to rely on me MORE for important stuff.

Yet, if we don't do this, we're essentially stuck in our regressive, misogynistic home country with no real opportunities (Both of us have no meaningful work experience or connections here).

In the end, my partner and I have both decided that I should go and ask for advice anonymously (We have no close friends to talk to about this).

What, if-anything, can I do to fix this situation?",26Nov2020,1

290,"I'd rather not bore you with the Long details. Long time ago, a friend (F) and I (M) were very close for almost 2 years. Texted and talked everyday, but never hung out to much because she was 2 years younger than me. We both looked at and talked to each other romantically, but we were both too scared to be the first to make a move to ""date"", I was especially afraid because of anyone thinking I was preying on her being that I was older and a male. We had hung out and kissed a few times before and nothing ever came of it.

Anyway, one day I made a sexual advance at her, but I realized after that it was probably not welcomed and stopped. I panicked and left. I later apologized via text and we never really revisited the issue. I felt like I caused her a lot of issues with leading her on but not following through.
 We stopped talking for almost a year. We never really returned to being as close of friends as we did in the past, but she did ask for advice with her new relationship as I had a new girlfriend and she had a newer boyfriend. I happily gave advice and helped her talk through stuff whenever she asked. But after a few months if that we stopped talking altogether.

After a few years went by, I realized how damaging the incident could've been to her as far as my advance towards her. And even some years after that, I still currently feel a discomfort that I feel like I never truly apologized for my wrongdoing. We no longer talk and haven't for probably 5 years, and are just mutual friends on social media. I've recently learned that she's engaged to the boyfriend she had all those years ago that she asked relationship advice about, and it stirred up these memories for me.

So I ask: do I bother apologizing for what i did in the past? Am I selfish for wanting to apologize because I feel bad? and have this weight on my chest and want to let her know I realized what I did was wrong? Is it worth bothering her with this apology if she's perfectly happy almost 7 years later? 

I've thought about apologizing for years but have never wanted to interrupt her life and possibly open up old wounds that might cause(d) her discomfort. What do I do? Apologize, or suck it up and deal with the fact that I did something wrong?",26Nov2020,1

I’m fine when I’m alone with friends or strangers, but when my parents are with me and I see a friend or someone I know, I go back to finding it impossible to greet them.

A similar thing happens with other basic manners such as ‘thankyou’, just like with ‘hello’ and ‘goodbye’ I can say ‘please’ fine all the time but it seems impossible to say ‘thanks’ to family members or even others whenever my parents are around.

294,"Hi everyone. I need some advice of a situation that has been happening for months and received bad feedback during my review. I just need to come to peace with it. But really want to know if I am crazy or wrong with the way I think.

I have a new team member who joined the team almost two years. I have been in the team for five years. I understand people are new to the team and take their time learning. I enjoy training people and have trained this individual multiple times. I lead a subgroup of a handful of people who are responsible of completing a certain process and must be completed within 3 days. Fairly simple process....1-5 steps and you are done. All of this information, the reason, why, how, what, who, etc is all provided to the team members before hand. This new team member joined a year ago and trained this person right away so they become comfortable with the process. Earlier this year, it came to my attention that the person had completed this process wrong more than 15 times and needed to be corrected. I reached out to the person and walked through the mistakes, explained the reasoning why, and very open to communication/questions and helping any way possible. The thing is that I am open to helping but not doing the work for them. I can guide the person but not going to do the work for them because the purpose is to work together as a team... anyways. This person comes back and does not understand the process. Again I sit down with the person and another team member to help guiding this person. Well... they don't understand and continue making mistakes. I have been documenting all these instances along the way because I did not want this to backfire. Well it did. I noticed that after 3 days the person still had not completed the process. I would email them and no response... then I started cc'ing management The person finally would reply. This continued on for several months. Making mistakes, retraining, mistake, retrain (explaining in different formats) etc. During this time, I would correct the mistakes and would walk them through the five steps needed.... to correct it. I felt was very direct, patient, and timely since this does tend to be time sensitive. Total training has occurred about 7-8 times.

Fast forward to the end of year review, management stated I was passive aggressive and would stress the team member out with emails? That I should instead call and do video call because the team member is ""too busy or may not understand emails or may have missed the email"" .... I thought to myself.. well why did they hire this person if they can not read emails? Mind you this is a professional setting where MBAs/CPAs/professionals work. I did not say that thought out loud but I do feel like this was flipped on me for no reason. I am super involved at work and really working towards getting promoted... but this was a ""setback"" and was told to ""really consider the environment this person is in"". in addition to that, I was told to coach this person and remind them of competencies needed to be successful. hmmmm last time I checked we are all working from home..... and I too get stressed, anxiety, and feel overwhelmed, but still timely with my work, deadlines, and believe a strong work ethic is important.... if I can not meet a deadline (very rare) I let the individual know. I do not like to not say anything because the person in charge does not read minds.... anyways, I felt this was super unfair towards me. Any advice of how I should tackle this and deal with a team member who is basically getting away not doing work and I am blamed for things? (this has happened with alot of other instances, very similar but this one just really really made me upset)",26Nov2020,1

I am in college and almost have my bachelor's in Computer Science, and am in honors and on the Dean's list. Here's the problem, I've still yet to really try at all. I'm not a perfect student, but I usually get an A with minimal effort, I don't even study. I got a 27 on my ACT, which isn't great, but people said it was pretty good, but I didn't prepare at all for that. I got a 74 on an ASVAB, the same story. So, you can see I'm no god based on those scores, but people are always proud of me. People always know me as ""the smart guy"" but I don't see how I'm smart when I don't do anything besides play games and school work. 

Basically, I don't know if I should be proud of myself when I am just drifting through everything with minimal effort. I would challenge myself, but everything has been so easy for so long (in my academic life at least) that I don't even know where to start. I don't even know if I can handle anything difficult.

302,"Me and my mom have nothing in common. I have a feeling she always wanted a girly girl but I am just not that. I’m not a tomboy either, except for the fact I like to run, but I’m more of a nerd who likes video games and drawing. The only other interests I have are gardening and cooking which I have only recently gotten into.

My moms only hobby is makeup and watching Disney bloggers. Other then that, she’s overweight and just sits in bed all day while working on her computer or watching makeup tutorials while talking about politics. When I mentioned how I wanted a gaming PC, she just said, “Oh.. so you are still into that?” And she would just talk about how most gamers just smoke and sit in an empty room all day.

I like console games more, but want to get a good PC for all of the indie games I like and RPGs. Before, I noticed how she watched a lot of horror movies so I talked to her about Fran Bow. That didn’t work so I talked about Little Nightmares. She said she would play it with me but on the night she promised she would, she just sat in bed and said she was too tried and lazy to go down in the living room.

When we had a long talk, I came up with the solution that we should get into something we both like together, so I talked about Animal Crossing. I know she would like to build her own spa on that game so I thought it would be a good idea and she agreed but honestly, I feel like she just won’t.

I want to show her the hobbies I like and try to form a bond with her but she usually is too lazy to do it, procrastinates, or finally does it but doesn’t really pay attention. Whenever I talk to her, she reads an article on her computer while she listens and it feels as if she really just doesn’t care. It breaks my heart because I want to form a bond with both of my parents.

I’ve realized how I spend most of my time secluded in my room and that my parents deserve to have a proper bond so I’m working on that. Things are going good with my dad because he actually pays attention and he also likes console games, but my mom not so much. It hurts because I know that when I move out, I won’t have much time left and living at home isn’t an option I want.

I don’t want my mom to grow burden of the fact that we don’t really have a connection and realize that later because I know that she is distracting herself with TV to the fact that she can’t really just get up and start a garden with me.

I had a best friend that I would hang out with almost every weekend. we’ll call him teddy. once COVID started I didn’t see him for a few months, so I went to spend the weekend at his house. we would hang out and play video games all day pretty much and then at night I would hang out with his older sister. we’ll call her hannah. I went into her room and we would watch shows and stuff until we went to bed. the next weekend I came back to his house and repeated the same activities such as playing video games with teddy, and at night watching a movie with hannah. this time halfway through the movie we started cuddling. my heart was fucking racing and I didn’t know what to do because something like that has never happened to me. I end up making out with my first girl that night. these next few months were the weirdest in my life. her parents unfortunately found out about me being In her room and us doing stuff so I was kinda banned from being at his house at the same time as she was. we were however allowed to go to the beach together, so we went to the beach. my parents drove me there and also unfortunately witnessed her on top of me while we were making out. my dad actually screamed “STOP WRESTLING” from across the beach. they were actually pretty cool about it in general but it was super embarrassing to her. anyways I’m getting sidetracked. At some point hannah started being really weird and wouldn’t text me back and was being passive aggressive which really weirded me out because she’s usually so sweet. (I learned she was dealing with terrible emotional trauma and depression and was trying to get rid of me by trying to make me hate her)I wouldn’t sleep for days because of this. the only thing that helped me get through this was video games. I sat up playing destiny 2 for about 48 hours straight without eating or drinking. this hurt so bad because I was so attached to her and didn’t want her to go. the only thing I felt was guilt for something I wasn’t aware of / didn’t do. we ended up breaking up and I cried myself to sleep for weeks after that. I couldn’t do anything and I only felt sad. it hurt so much. I still talked to her about it throughout feeling terrible. it’s been six months and I have moved away from California and to Washington (she lives in California) and i flew back to San Francisco just to see them for a week and also meet up with a girl who ended up cheating on me. it was actually great I had a lot of fun except we broke a lot of teddy’s moms rules and we also got caught smoking weed. teddy actually ended up bending the truth and being a pussy in general on top of throwing me under the bus for no reason. I also had met this girl at some point and we had exchanged nudes. I was very excited about this so I immediately texted all my friends and for some reason teddy fucking asked me for the pics. idk why but I said yes. and now that’s hes telling on me about shit and not being a good friend he I told someone to kick his ass to teach him a lesson. (He was on the gc when I said that) from here he threatened to leak my nudes to gc which he recently added his older sister hannah to. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY. so my ex girlfriend and some of my still close friends have seen me naked which just makes me want to barf. I don’t talk to teddy anymore for obvious reasons. Except his sister Hannah won’t talk to me either because of this. I have no one. I lost all of my close friends. I have barely anyone to go to when I need help. hannah was the coolest nicest person I had ever met and she understood me so well and I couldn’t ask for anyone better than her and I have lost her. what do I do. I still love her so much. and she looks like she’s enjoying her life and it makes me happy and so sad the same time. how do I get through this? please help me.

TL:DR I lost all my friends and I’m very depressed.",26Nov2020,1
323,So I’ve have been working in this new place and a lot of chill people work there and we always have a great time. But this one guy in particular really doesn’t seem to like me but it really doesn’t bother me. But he gives me a sort of attitude like if I’m below him or something but I always try to stand my ground. But the next day I was partnered up with him didn’t mind it but I started making small talk and we started talking I was being nice and respectful and it seem he was being nice and respectful too we had a few laughs and I was thinking in my head like this guy is not so bad we could be friends or something. But the next day I see him and i was like are you doing good man and shake my head with a smile but he looks at me for a split second and just looks away and with an attitude tone he responds with a yea I’m good and walks away and starts talking to other people. But I was just confused because I taught we were getting to know each other but I guess not. Is there something I’m doing that makes me annoying or should I just ignore him and let him be?,26Nov2020,1
324,"I am feeling a mix of emotions but I need some help figuring out where to go with those since I obviously can’t change anything but the way I handle/cope with my feelings. 

So I started a new job three months ago at a very small firm (~10 people) and I have loved it so far. I have a person who is unofficially training me, I am trying out different sorts of projects and discovering new areas in an attempt to see where my interests and talents lie, and I come in to work around 10 am which works great for me since I’m not a morning person. 

Today I learned that an intern they had right before I joined has accepted a job offer (the whole team was involved in discussing whether the offer should be extended in the first place but since I never worked with her directly, I did not weigh in on the discussion). And all of a sudden I fell upset, sad, and frustrated. 

1) I am upset because even though I know I can be friends with the person around my age and rank and grow together professionally, I can’t help but think that we will be compared by people, which will create a competitive environment that I was looking to avoid by joining a small team of people in the first place. 

2) I feel sad cuz I feel like I was being cheated on since when I was interviewing, the president of the firm said they are not looking to grow and would like to keep the team tight, which led me to believe that I will have more time when the attention is focused on me and my growth and now I feel like my time will be cut short since resources will be relocated towards the new hire (the hiring was necessary since a member of the team is planning to take a paternity leave next year). This might also be related to the fact that i’m the youngest in my family and do not have younger siblings so don’t know how to deal with plain simple jealousy. 

3) Frustrated because I was enjoying having a flexible schedule and finally finding a job that would accommodate my desire to work later hours. And now if the new hire comes in before i do (which might based on her personality) regardless of actual productivity level, she will be seen as the more hard working and committed person. I hate to change my routine just to look like I’m working rather than come in later and actually be efficient and productive. 

So there we go, I think I’m seeing all the bad parts but I’m sure there are some bright sides/coping mechanisms that I am not yet seeing. Please let me know if you can offer help/advice. Thanks in advance.",26Nov2020,1

330,"So I met this girl on tinder and she was literally the most gorgeous girl I had ever seen and she had her snap in her bio so I added her and shot my shot. She added me back and we started talking turns out she was from Chicago and was planning to move to Arizona pre Covid she was looking for friends cuz she had a boyfriend at the time and was like sure. So we stayed in contact and talked everyday. It felt so comfortable and natural talking to her and we grew close pretty quick. She has been my best friend and I love her. We are so different yet so alike in the same time. I trust her and have never connected with anyone like her before. I fell in love with her but she didn’t feel the same way but we still wanted to be friends cuz we knew the connection we had and didn’t wanna throw it away. 
I’ll talk about her boyfriend now, she is 23 and this dude is 18 (I’m 22) this kid treats her like shit, has cheated on her multiple times and she still wants to be with him. She broke up with him but they still live together and are trying to make their relationship better while he still talks to multiple girls. She complains how she will never find a guy who treats her right yet I’m right fucking her. She is the first girl I’ve ever fell in love with. She has family in Arizona so she has come to town twice I even fly to Chicago to see her something I would have never done in the past. We have been friends for 7 months now and it’s hard to imagine my life without her but I can’t get over her and feel it be best to cut her off honestly Ik it would mentally destroy me but in the long run maybe it’s better cuz she will never see me the way I see her and it kills me when she texts me complaining about him and being alone.

332,"I’m a recent graduate with a master’s degree in business. I have over 8 of sales experience. I recently got a job offer from big a wine/beer distributor to start as a sales trainee. I signed the job offer. After I signed it, they made me take a fit-for-duty test. They required that I have to be able to lift 60 pounds which is crazy heavy for me. I was so sore the next say from even trying. I’m a female and 5’2’’ and 109lbs. So I failed to lift that much and put it on a pretty high shelf. The HR from the headquarters said I couldn’t work for them. My local branch who interviewed me told me “this is ridiculous and we are going to fight for you”. I waited for 3 weeks to hear from them. They called me today and said they are withdrawing their job offer. I looked up their merchandiser and truck driver open position descriptions on their company website which said they need to be able to lift up to 20-40lbs. So something is not right about this. This company didn’t want to make changes or accept something doesn’t fit right. The sales manager told me lifting is not what I would be performing daily and they are trying to train a salesperson, the heaviest thing I would lift would be a wine case which is about 29lbs. On top of all this, they called my current bosses before they even made me a job offer, so not only my current boss knows I’m trying to leave, they decided not to hire me after all. So I’m screwed either way. I feel like I’m discriminated. All of the sales reps I talked to in the area told me that they do not do this kind of heavy lifting. So what is the point of this test? Why are they requiring 60 lbs for a sales position? Can I seek legal help for this?",26Nov2020,1
333,"Hi everyone,

I would like some advice because I have really unhealthy behavior/experiences when I work in group projects.

I feel terrible that I a) if I can't see my work or contribution in group projects/assignments. Sometimes I will contribute but 90% of the time it is rewritten. b) can't meet team members expectations c) people are just ""carrying me"" through the project/class d) it feels like I am taking advantage of them (even though I have no intention of doing so).

I would say I am shy but can speak up when needed (or when I am comfortable). Am I being placed in groups with bad ""team"" members? Do I need to change myself? Or do I just accept that sometimes things are this way? The problem with accepting that ""things are this way"" is that I don't want the teacher to think that I don't do work or contribute (if somehow my team tells the teacher or if the teacher asks). It's never my intention to be lazy, I am always ready to help and contribute. But no one seems to understand me. 

Any advice would be helpful.",26Nov2020,1

It’s the same day every year. I have had the same friend group for years.   One friend has the exact same birthday as mine and he forgets every year. He didn’t even say it back this year. 

My boyfriend says it’s because I don’t have Facebook, and that it’s what most milennials use to remember birthdays. I haven’t had Facebook in years though. He says that I also expect too much from people. Is remembering expecting too much though?

336,"I am a 20 year old student pilot. I have been training since I was 14 years old and never had the common feeling of being directionless that so many young people have. Over the past few months I have felt that being a professional pilot may not be what I am meant to do. 

A few things you should know about me, I am a hard worker yet I do not like professionalism. I have always seen myself as a leader than an employee. My ultimate goal is to become financially independent no matter what, I do not want to be an employee until I’m 65. Also, my best case scenario is to travel the world, I don’t have to be rich, I just want adventure and a satisfying life.

I’m taking next semester off to think about it and these are my options going forward:

1. Travel to a foreign country to work on a farm for several months just for life experience.

2. Continue on my path of being a pilot.

3. Get a business degree from an instate college

4. Get my real estate license to make money and learn about the market so I can become a landlord in the next decade. 

5. Get a degree in restaurant management and take over my dads restaurant in the future.

337,"The dog is not supposed to be outside by himself, yet he somehow gets loose almost every day. It’s a small yorkie, so it’s not threatening or dangerous - more-so it’s needy and probably vulnerable to the feral cats, skunks, foxes and hawks around here, not to mention the cars. This is near a relatively high-traffic street.

For some unknown reason, the dog is not fixed, so he pees all over my porch and I’m sure everyone else’s porch when he’s out.

My dog is somewhat territorial, so when it’s time to go outside and this dog is roaming, she growls at him and won’t go. The yorkie tethers to her and will not leave her alone.

Right now it’s 3:00 AM, and I’m not comfortable knocking on his door. I’m not exactly sure which house he lives in anyway - it’s probably on the dog’s tag though. I’ve tried to take the dog to his house before and no one answered. He’s a bit of a dick and loves guns, so I’m not going to risk spooking him at this hour. I only know him because he searches my property for his dog every day, while complaining about it and blaming the dog for always getting loose.

I’m considering calling the police and telling them it’s a regular problem, and that I’m uncomfortable knocking on his door this late at night, but I don’t feel this is the neighborly thing to do. I also don’t want to make an enemy of him or any of my neighbors. I’m not confrontational. Unfortunately, none of the neighborly things have worked, and this has been going on for years.

Sooo, I liked everything, except for the area, i liked being there but I didn’t really want to be a programmer or something to do with that, so i left and tried to go to the Science area, the classes were already full, so i went to a school that i hate and tried to see if i liked the area, figured out i hated it eve more than programming, now i don’t talk to anyone in my class, the teachers are always trying to push me down for some reason, my grades used to be great and now they’re crap, yeah, so i tried to come back to the school i liked and go to humanistics, which has like history and geography, stuff that I actually enjoyed and had good grades on middle school, turns out the fact that i left that school kinda makes me a last option for them, even if i try hard to get good grandes and be a great student, they won’t accept me because i left that school and if someone leaves they will replace the spot with someone already from that school that tries to go to humanistics. 

But, the Science area has some classes that are not full now, but i don’t really like it and turns out I’m not very good at it, and the humanistics area has a spot on this school that I absolutely hate, so, either go to a nice school and go to an area that I don’t like, or i stay in this crap school and go to an area that I will probably like much more, but still with bad teachers and students i much likely won’t talk to because this is a school for most of the students that didn’t do crap and smoked ganja all day long, so yeah, kinda deciding my future now and i need some tips, I still don’t know what job i want and what university i will go to, i just need some advice, don’t judge me if I’m being stupid or something, I don’t want you to tell me what to do, just give an opinion, and sorry for the long text, if you know of another subreddit i could try and post this on pls tell me, thank you

349,"I have been renting a room from a family friend since about July or so. There is no set lease or contract, we simply agreed upon a monthly amount until I move out. They have been generous and given me cheap rent ($400) due to being a mostly broke college student which I’m grateful for. However, because of how cheap it is, there have been several occasions where I was kicked out of the room and had to sleep on the couch for a night with no notice if another guest was coming. One time this happened when I had to leave at 4 am for a flight the next day and I wasn’t told until 8 pm the night before. I didn’t make a stink of it since the rent is cheap and there’s no charge for utilities etc. My point being that the whole situation has been fairly laid back versus a professional rental setting. 

I just found out I will be gone the entire month of December and am wondering if it’s out of line to ask her thoughts on a partial/lesser payment for that month. I did leave a few things in the room that would probably take 5-10 mins to put away if another guest comes, but it is overall clean and ready to be used by someone else  

If she says she’s counting on the payment then I will hand it over no problem, I was just curious for another opinion. Thanks!",26Nov2020,1
350,The heading says it all. For some background context i am female &amp; this person is male. Both adults in relationships with other people. I met this person last year in a social setting &amp; had some good times together. We didn’t get to be too close &amp; it’s not like we were best friends or anything &amp; to be honest we never shared deeply personal things with each other that could create some type of deeper bond... but i definitely felt a strong connection to this person almost instantly. Things ended on a kind of weird note and we haven’t spoken for months. Now that i look back on some times we had together I realize how maybe this person wasn’t the best friend to me. But it’s been a year basically and i can’t get over this person. I know 100% i’m not romantically interested in this person although i may have had a small reciprocated crush at the beginning. But for some reason i feel so incredibly sad i don’t get to talk or share details of my life with this person anymore. I feel guilty for feeling this way because if my partner ever found out how i feel it would break their heart and instantly think i have feelings for this person which i dont. The last thing i’d want to do is hurt my partner. But why do i feel so sad about this? I’m not this type of person to get hung up about ended friendships so why do i feel so strong and differently about this?

I need all the possible advice i can get on getting over this person and fully moving on and as well as explaining why i feel this way?,26Nov2020,1
351,"I (22F) made a friend (25F) just a few months ago, and although I find that sometimes we have different values, we’ve gotten along really well so far. I have to admit, I find myself doing more to accommodate her personality to keep things smooth. I don’t really mind it, because that’s how I approach most relationships. I’m just comfortable being the person other people are comfortable around. 
That said, we celebrated her birthday over the weekend (about five-ish days ago), and we haven’t texted since then. I finally reached out to her yesterday to find out if she’d like to do a sleepover some time, and completely uncharacteristically, she has still not responded. It’s not that we text all day long, but for some reason, I do sense some trouble. The last thing I sent was a message very casually mentioning that something seems off and we could definitely talk about it, if there is anything at all. 
The wait is excruciating. I am so worried that I’ve offended her without even knowing it. The reason I’m so concerned is that she’s told me herself about things other people do that have upset her, and those are all things I would brush off. I’m always on my toes around her, because I know she can be a little sensitive. 
What do you think I should do about it, if anything at all? The current plan is to wait it out, but I just keep growing more anxious as the hours pass.",26Nov2020,1
352,"Dude I’m seeing

has a bit of lack of compassion and understanding for my liking. He(28,m) and me (28,f) have been seeing each other for over two months. We met off of tinder. For the most part, it’s amazing. I’m super happy. We have tons of fun, joke around, get along great- he has the majority of the qualities I’m looking for in a person. However, he’s not the most understanding person, and it comes across as judgemental. I have BPD, and this time of year is super hard for me mentally. It’s the change in seasons, lack of sunlight, and things in the past that happened around this time (fiance proposed end of December three years ago then committed suicide,) that get me. So, I’ve been in somewhat of a depression hole- sleeping too much, letting go of cleaning my apartment regularly, and generally just being more on edge and sensitive and emotional. 

Today, he said he’s “getting tired of it.” I immediately reacted in not the most effective way. I said if he wasn’t happy I’d understand if he wanted to find someone who made him happier. I then explained what I am going through and why I’m behaving as so. He came over and we had dinner and kind of ignored the whole conversation prior and had a good time. 

When he left I realized that although he came across harsh and rude, he was right. I can’t expect to feel better at this time of year by doing the same shit I always do which has never benefitted me. I need to make positive changes and do things to help myself. I can’t just write off an entire month because it makes me sad. So ultimately, he was right, and his reality check and dose of hard love snapped me out of my funk. 

It seems like he expects me to be perfect and come without flaws and never do anything he doesn’t like. I am naturally a messy person and he has OCD. So, any time things aren’t 100% clean and organized he makes sure I know he’s not happy about it. But everyone has flaws, including him. However, I am the type of person that accepts people for who they are and try not to judge them or make them feel bad for it. Unless it’s hurting themselves or someone else, I tend to just let them be who they are in regards to little things and little personality traits. For example, he had a great job interview and slept through it a few times. Instead of making him feel worse, I offered suggestions on how to make it better and supportive comments like “as soon as they meet you they’ll forgive everything prior, they’ll fall in love with you right away and you will show them you’re a great addition to their team!” I just think being like this is more effective and productive towards everyone’s happiness. 

However, I still wish he would come from a kinder place and be more gentle in these situations. How can I teach him to do so? I don’t think this is something that is fatal for us. I think we can both work on certain things and be better together as the outcome. But, as much as I mostly have a handle on my mental illness, symptoms are bound to pop up every so often, and I need some understanding about it from him. He doesn’t struggle with any mental illness, and hasn’t ever really been depressed at all, so it’s hard for him to grasp I guess. 

Thanks in advance !",26Nov2020,1
353,"There are times when I feel like I’m on top of the world and that everything will be okay. There are also times when I feel defeated and spend days crying and moping over negative thoughts and memories. I close myself off and sleep as a way to cope. This happens every few months. 

It’s usually a small problem that triggers me to act this way. The most recurrent issue I’ve had is probably comparing myself to others. I am constantly doing so with almost everything, including colleges, appearance, grades, and personality and it always leaves me feeling like there’s no hope left for me to shine. It feels as if everyone else has at least one thing that makes them special, while I have nothing. I become too focused on my shortcomings that I become as uninteresting as possible when interacting with others.

Are there any suggestions on how to get over this and to stop thinking so negatively? I’m worried this will impact my career since I’ve had various people criticizing my personality. For example, someone has said that I’m not fit to become a nurse because I’m expressionless and she feels that I’m not compassionate. Hearing that really broke my heart especially because I never saw myself as what she described, which made me feel so misunderstood.",26Nov2020,1

355,"This is really long and I apologize for that, but I have to get it off my chest and out of my head...and maybe get some advice.

I feel like I need to get some feedback or advice about this situation I have found myself in.
I'm pretty sure that the person doesn't even know what Reddit is, but for the sake of idgaf about anonymity, let's call her Sherri bcuz that's her real name. 
Some background on me and then her and the situation.. 
I went to nursing school once upon a time so keep this in mind through this... When I was little, I watched my grandmother fight breast cancer twice and ovarian cancer once only to be taken by alzheimer's, my grandfather lost the fight to brain cancer and I watched my favorite 4 year old get sick, go through chemo like a rockstar and fight as hard as his little body could and be so strong for us only to lose the fight anyways. Ive watched friends get diagnosed and in the end, I lost more to it than have won. So I've had my heartbroken by cancer. Many times.
And I have to get this out of my head and existence before it drowns me bcuz I can't say anything irl to people that know her bcuz I'd be that bitch...
This chick sherri, who we were supposed to rent the house next door from but when it was time to move in, it wasn't ready so we moved into the back part of the house while it's slowly getting ready and have no other option at the moment, but I think she has been lying about absolutely everything from who she is to where she's from since the day I met her. And the biggest one I can't get past is that she claims she has cancer. When asked what kind, she says ""on my spine"" 
Now, remember that I have a soft spot for cancer patients and would like to think that nobody would lie about it.. but also remember that I did nursing school and see right through it.
First, we have been hanging out for almost 4 1/2 months and she has conveniently ""forgot"" about her chemo sessions or ""didn't feel like going"" for literally the last 16 weeks I have known her. She hasn't gone to a single one. Then when I started to question it to her last week she got shitty and then Monday, all the sudden out of the blue the doctor calls and wants her to come in the next day (yesterday) for a session. I waited to see how she was gonna play it off bcuz I actually went to school for the shit and watched friends and family go through chemo so i waited. 
Appt time comes and she leaves for a few hours (she drove) and sends a selfie to me with facemask on (just in case I doubted her) and when she gets home, she's weak and tired and sick and of course so everyone is doing everything they can for her while looking at me not doing anything with an attitude like why wasn't I helping her...
She plays them patient very well. This morning (afternoon really bcuz I slept in since I stayed up all night with an actual sick husband), she knocks on my door all chipper and bright and bushy bcuz she had been up since early helping the rewire the electric through the house and sanding floors. NOW! Before anyone says that chemo affects everyone different and maybe it was blah blah wtfever, I asked about her session and the meds they were using, she wasn't sure of the meds and said it went well. I asked about a port and she said she didn't have one. I asked what delivery method they were using and she said IV. I'll accept that except she had absolutely no bruising or marks on her whatsoever from an IV and the cannula they use will leave a bruise and tear your veins up. That's why they prefer to do a picc line. I asked how she felt if she was up sanding and rewiring electric and she said it only makes her feel bad for a day or so...I'd accept that except this is less than 13 hours after her ""appt"" and I was immediately pissed tf off bcuz I felt like she was cheapening and taking away from the strength that my grandparents and my baby brother had to have to fight through it and what it took for them just to put on a good face for me and my mom for days after chemo bcuz they felt so bad from it. And this bitch is rewiring a house and sanding floors 12 hours later?! 
And another thing that I learned from a friend I lost recently to this shit,  if you miss chemo sessions that many times, the doctor will usually drop you as a patient like hers did or make you start back over with lab work and radiology and testing again...not call you the day before to ""fit you in bcuz they have an opening"" after you haven't been in for labs, tests, biopsies, radiology or any appt at all in 4 months. It does not work that way. In fact, when someone questioned her about it bcuz they recently lost their mom to cancer, she flipped out and started telling everyone about how she has her doctors letter saying she has cancer and her last chemo bill and blah blah and when I said I'd be interested in seeing it bcuz I know of a place that will help pay for part of half of the bill with proof she all the sudden ""couldn't find it."" 
But she has everyone so convinced bcuz they only see what she lets them see. 
I truly feel like she is making my grandparents and my baby brothers fight look like it wasn't as hard as it was and the way she talks I almost take offense like THEY were the ones faking how sick it made them. And I wish they were and they'd still be here... But they weren't and I'm without them. 
  I don't want to throw all this at her bcuz she literally attacked the last chick that did and since HIPPA is a thing and I have no way of proving what I know, I'll just be that bitch accusing someone of faking cancer even though I know she is. 
I don't know what to do about this. I am working on getting enough proof that she is lying about everything else she is telling everyone and I hope when she is confronted with it she will just fess up to everything but I'm pretty sure that I'll end up the bad guy either way. 
Guess I'm the asshole either way.",26Nov2020,1

364,"My mom is consistently kind of doing things that are rude. I just feel like I’m checking her on stuff all day. It’s so weird sometimes it’s likes she’ll just say rude stuff but she literally doesn’t realize she’s even being rude I’m starting to understand. It’s like no one ever taught her how not to be rude and I’m now starting to understand why I have some of the tendencies I do. 

But last night my mom was making fun of my dad to my brothers girlfriend who we have met twice, about how my dad talks to himself really bad. And I mean really bad, he argues loudly with other people. His issue seems private to me because he doesn’t even address it with us, why would you make fun of him and then mimic him doing it to a stranger? That’s your husband. 

So I said something to her and I noticed the rest of the night she got sad. Her bubbly personality went from loud to quiet. I can tell she just felt like she can’t never  get anything right, because I usually feel like that.

However, recently I've found I haven't enjoyed making art as much, if at all. I know it's normal for artists to be unhappy with their art and want to improve it, but that's just not the case for me. Its not that I'm unsatisfied with the end result, but rather that I no longer derive joy from the process. I've tried drastically changing my style for a new change of pace to keep things interesting. I've tried just working on things that I feel comfortable with and not force myself to improve for once. Regardless, it seems I'm only further losing interest in my art. I just feel like I am unable to express my emotions or ideas through art and it feels awful. I really don't want to learn a new medium because trying new things is overwhelming and the frustration destroys my already fragile self esteem.

My whole life my dad has been overweight and he has tried to lose weight multiple times with support from my family but has never made it past the first two week point.

378,"I started working at a small office this summer.
I’m supposed to be mentored in my new role but my manager is extremely busy. So I’m left at my desk with nothing to do for 95% of the time. 
I was going stir-crazy! Weeks upon weeks with no tasks to do. At times, the boss of my boss would have mercy and give me a task. He’d often find me at my desk with nothing to do.

I happen to be a native English speaker, though I speak the local language well. My job and my company has nothing remotely to do with language learning.

So, as a creative solution to my problem, and with my boss’s approval, I offered my two colleagues to have 30-35 minute English conversation lessons with me.

We did them three times a week for 10 weeks, for over 30 lessons. We went through all the (work-appropriate) topics I could find. By late October I wanted to stop, and COVID started surging again.

We’re going to start working from home through to the end of the year. “Problem solved!”, I thought, but nope.
My manager said we can continue the lessons remotely from home. My two colleagues were happy, but I felt apprehensive.

So, I continued as a personal favor to my colleagues, but I kept thinking how it was against the whole point of the exchange: They got free lessons at work and I got a brief reprieve from soul-crushing boredom at my desk. I’m no longer at my desk. 

If there’s no work to do, I can take advantage of being home to get stuff done. 
Did I mention that I stay in a city during the week for this job? Four hour train ride each way. Not like I can go home after work; I stay until the weekend. I depend on my partner’s sacrifice of taking care of everything at home for us, even though we both work:

So, I sent a message a week ago saying how we’ve finished the course! Yay!! I was trying for a smooth end to this situation. After 30+ lessons, you’d think they’d respond with a simple thank you, and that’s that.

My two colleagues responded saying how they’d really like continue; one offered to do them only once a week, another said they’ll bring the conversational topics. 
I really don’t want to, but if all I have to do is show up once a week...I accepted, and we all agreed. They’re very nice and I liked them well enough. It’s a pandemic and maybe it helps them with anxiety? I don’t fucking know.

So yesterday, we start this ‘new’ format. I was chatting (in English) with one colleague (Daria) while waiting for the other (Clara) to arrive. 
Mind, these lessons are only intended to be 30 minutes long with 5 minutes after for questions and comments. Clara soon shows up and we chat for about 5 minutes before I ask what conversation topics they’ve prepared. Daria tells Clara to go first.

Clara starts up a friggen power-point presentation that she made about a work project. It was 30 minutes long. This is not a conversation, this is a mock presentation. Jesus Christ. Was it not clear that this is English conversation?

We sat through it. She apologized about the length, and we all said that’s alright. I gave my corrections and comments. By then we were at 45 minutes. So I said, “Any questions or comments before we conclude?”

Clara says that Daria didn’t get a chance to ‘go’ (I’m thinking, “Oh lord, another presentation?”). I said not to worry, that we’ll let her have her turn next week. Plus, we had chatted a bit before and after the presentation. Daria also said it’s no problem. 

So I repeat my final question again, and only Daria says “No questions, all good”, while Clara is making a weird face. Clara says, “So the next lesson is next week, and Daria didn’t have a turn.” So Daria and I once again repeat, “Its no problem don’t worry about it”. Things start to feel awkward.
So I say “Ok - Goodbye, see you next week!”. Daria is also normal and saying goodbye, waving, expressing her thanks. Meanwhile, Clara is silent, not smiling with a weird, stilted expression. I keep this awkward scene going, still saying bye and waving, waiting for Clara. She finally gives an unenthusiastic  ‘bye’, with no thank you. I then closed the call, thinking “What the fuck?”.

I’m not stupid. I understand she’s trying to say. But we have always done 35 minute lessons, and we finished at 47. For her. These are free lessons that I’m still doing, NOT for me, but entirely for them. What the hell is wrong with this person?

In this country they say that if you give someone a hand they’ll take your whole arm. 
I’ve never lived such a weird scene before. Now I really want to stop doing these lessons but I figured, at least for Daria, to try another next week. But the experience left a very bitter taste.

If Clara is normal next time, I’m willing to do lessons until Christmas break. But at some point, I figure that I will have to call them individually and explain why I can’t continue. I refuse to continue this into the new year.

Plus, no one else is obligated to give me tutoring in the local language. Or guitar or piano lessons, or anything people normally get paid for outside of work.

TLDR:
A gesture I offered to colleagues at the office has become a burden that has followed me home. I wish to put an end to it. How do I best get out of this situation with our rapport intact?",26Nov2020,1
379,"Yesterday my fiancé was in a horrible accident and was lucky to survive. someone found him in his crushed car and took him to the ER then called us to go to him. He couldn't talk well, and every 5 mins he would ask if anyone was with him and if they're alright (luckily he was alone, the passenger seat was crushed) . Then we took him to a few more hospitals and they said his maxilla was fractured but it'll heal alone, and that he needs to go to an ophthalmologist bcs his eye was super swollen and they need to give him stitches there. So we took him but they said to bring him back tomorrow for a surgery for some reason. Anyway ... during the whole ordeal he was in soo much pain, only mumbling words about when he could go rest or that he needed the bathroom, unable to stand up or walk on his own....

He couldn't eat either , only had a bit of water , says he will throw up. His lip has a wound like an opening in the middle. He can't be comfortable in bed cause everything hurts so much he said. and I feel like my heart is being ripped out of my chest, he's like family to me we spent 5 years together. I'm extremely  thankful that he is alive and not in a very bad state but I want to help him feel more comfortable . How can I do that ?????? He asks me to stay near him so I do. Also he is so much taller and heavier than me and needs help getting up going to the bathroom. His family can help for now but what about tomorrow or one week from now ?????? how can i help him ?????

380," I have ocd. My ocd has to do with promises to God or Gods. The reason of the promises were to force myself to stop do an ocd compulsion.

 For example, if my ocd is telling me to do a compulsion, I make the promise about not doing the compulsion and a punishment/curse was being asked in order to use the fear of the punishment/curse to force myself not to do the compulsion.

 One time, I told God that I would mean a promise only if I validated it by doing the cross sign 3 times because I think I was telling Him that I do not mean those promises and I make them because of my ocd. One time, I tried to validate a promise but I think, I stopped validating by stoping to the second time of the cross sign. The reason of the validation was because ocd kept giving me worries and just by thinkiing the promise did not work. Anyway, I think I stopped at second time and canceled the promise.

 I am not sure if the promise was canceled. now, I have some other fears and worries too.

1) what if the promises/deals were accepted by other Gods in case Christian God is not real?

2) what if there are promises/deals that I do not remember?

3) my mind has intrusive thoughts about making new deals/promises to Gods and almost, every 1 minute or 30 seconds I pray compulsively in my head to explain that I do not make promises.

 I feel depressed. I cant be free. Whenever I am in my computer, I am worrying that I will see something or say something that will break a promise or an hypothetical promise.

 When I am not in my computer, my mind is having intrusive thoughts. I get so tired and anxious sometimes that probably, makes my system not work properly. I get prostate pain and my bowels probably, do not work properply. Sometimes, I lose my sleepy mood because of it.

 I pay much attention to this ocd issue, because 2,5 years ago, I started witnessing some coincidences that I connected them as a bad sign from Christian God.

 Can these be considered as negative signs from Christan God or other Gods? I used to believe in Jesus but now, I am lost. I am writing some coincidences that happened in the past.

1) I was in my bed, 2 years ago. I asked from God a specific sign to happen, if in case, lets say, my ocd is right. I asked something like if my ocd is right, to hear a door opening/closing in the building that I used to live, then. The sound in order to be considered as a sign, should be heard til 5 seconds pass, since I ask it. If the sound happens after 6 or more seconds, it wont be considered as a sign. I asked for that sign and even though, I changed my opion about it due to a possible coincidence, I heard someone unlocking his/her door apartment. it was before the 5-second rule. Since, then, I would find myself between sleep and awake, and I would have the very first thought of the day. Randomly, with my eyes still closed from sleep, I was having random thoughts like "" door sound, i will hear a door"" etc. And after some 5-10 seconds, I would hear a door. That happened more than 5 times, I guess. It was as if my mind was predicting that i will hear a door. It was not a dream. I suppose, my subconscious was scared by the door coincidence, and in my sleep, I would hear sounds that are similar to door. For example, even calling the elevator would sound as a heavy door closing. If someone unlocks his/her door aparment and then, closes the door, I would hear it in my sleep and get the random thought ""door sound, door sound"" then, I would hear the man/woman calling the elevator which sounds like a door closing with force, so, I guess that created the misunderstanding that I was predicting a door sound, every morning.

​

​

2) I was praying and had my eyes closed. In the blackness, I was thinking about my ocd fear and that, created an image. That image was a japanese monster that I watched, randomly, on internet days ago. I opened my eyes, and started looking random stuff in facebook. After 5-10 minutes, I saw an article about that monster that it popped in my mind while I was praying. it was the first time, that I saw it on facebook.

​

​

3) I was watching a video. the guy was talking about a symbol. I heard him saying the word sign, but was not sure. I decided to close the video because my mind started thinking stuff like "" I will hear it again and it will be a bad, scary coincidence, i better close it"" I wa ready to close the site but my new thoughts stopped me. I was thinking "" what if when i close the video, I will hear the guy saying the word ""sign"" as the last word before closing the video? that would be scary"" I just wanted to close the video because I did not want to hear the word ""sign"" and when I tried to close it, i stopped because I feared that I would hear the word ""sign"" as the last word before closing it. So, I waited some seconds in order for the guy to somehow, change the subject and when I felt that it was the right moment to close it, I closed it, very fast, and uninentionally, without knowing that he will say the word ""sign"" I closed it with him saying the word ""sign"" as the last word. It was so unlikely to happen. The guy was speaking fast. If I had closed the video 1 second earlier, I would never have heard it. But I was so unlucky that I closed it randomly, when he was saying the word ""sign"" I know he said that word because I op How my mind predicted that I would hear the word ""sign"" as the last word before closing the video? I checked it and the guy indeed was saying the word ""sign"" and I am worried because if I have closed the video 1 second earlier or later, this scary coincidence would never happen. how you explain that?

​

​

4) A coincidence happened in youtube, with a video game character from Mortal Kombat, known as Scorpion. He transformed to a scorpion and i do not remember, exactly but that generated a random thought like "" I guess, Scorpion will give me some worries about my whole ocd-coincidence case"" I was playing Mortal Kombat 4 after a very long time, and the first opponent was Scorpion. I lost the match, and it the moment that Scorpion was to give me the finishing strike. I got a random thought like "" i hope he wont transform to a scorpion"" and he did! first match and he transformed to a scorpion. i was playing against the computer. there are many other moves that could computer use in order to finish me, and the computer choose to transform to a scorpion. that is not so common when playing against a computer. I fought him again and lost again. I was thinking "" I hope he does not transform to a scorpion 2 times in a row because that would be very rare"" and yes, he transformed to a scorpion again. 2 times in a row! I was watching a youtube video with a collection of all mortal kombat finishing moves. It was about 1 or 2 hours. I randomly, clicked the timeline in a random second. It was the second that the Scorpion character was transforming to a scorpion! That was about 7 seconds. So, from all 60-120 minutes of the video, I randomly, clicked on the 7-second scene of scorpion?

​

​

5) My ocd fear is about asking punishment from God so i was thinking about a similar example. I was thinking that if someone would have asked from God to lose his arm in an accident, that would never happen. that calmed me down but 1 minute later, I saw someone in the street with one arm only. was that a sign from God to tell me that I should be afraid of what my ocd says?

​

​

6) I ended up having random sound coincidences with other daily sounds, similar to the door sound. Like car alarms and dog barking. I would be thinking about my ocd and then, I would have random thoughts like "" i hope i wont hear a door or a dog or a car alarm"" and yes, i would hear one of these things. many times. I would be writing about the door coincidence in the internet and I would get a random thought like ""I hope i wont hear a door sound, now tha i am writing the word ""door"" because that would be a scary"" and yes, i was hearing a door sound.

​

7) I was having a scary thought for many days. i was thinking ""what if one day, I hear these 3 sounds (dog,alarm,door) together? that would be super scary"" One day, i was thinking about my ocd and randomly, a dog barked. I thought "" just a dog, i would be scared only if it was the 3 sounds together"" the dog kept barking for a minute and suddenly, I hear a car alarm ringing the same time with the elevator sound. The elevator sound, sounds like a heavy door closing so, it can be considered as the 3 sounds happening together. I was in a different neighborhood, and I heard a car alarm the same time with a door opening/closing in the building. i remembered the 3-sound coincidence and I was like "" the only thing we miss now is a dog"" and a dog started barking.

​

8) I was writing many times, on internet, about these coincidences. One afternoon, a friend that knows nothing of my problem, send me a spam message. he wanted to complain that I always cancel when we arrange something. the message was like

"" Coincidences are good but is it a coincidence that I agree? everytime we arrange to go out, you cancel it, is that a coincidence""

I freaked! why he randomly, used the word ""coincidence""

​

9) An internet user, suggested me 3 books related to my ocd problem, somehow. I was not interested in these books and as I was ready to close the site, i got a thought like ""what if there is a sign hidden in these books? choose one of them"" I randomly, searched one of the three books, for its summary in wikipedia. The ending was almost, 80% my ocd fear and the summary was using words-phrases that I used to describe my ocd fear. was that a coincidence? my mind predicted that I would find something there and then, indeed I found something related to my ocd fear so much?

​

10) A friend of mine was speaking about the thiefs that steal wallets from random people. I was thinking about my ocd fear and got a random thought like "" Perhaps, we are cursed from God"" and at that moment, I hear my friend saying "" the thief curses when he steals a wallet that it is empty due to the economy crisis"" was that a coincidence?

​

11) I read the word ""curse"" on internet and I hear from the tv, which was playing a scooby-doo episode, saying something like "" he was cursed"" i freaked and the tv kept saying "" his worst nightmare came true""

​

12) I entered the room in which the tv was open. It was a show about mythology. The narrator was saying a story. When I walked in the room, I heard the narrator saying "" She cursed herself and the sea and asked from God to be transformed to stone and God granted her wish"" That was my ocd fear! asking a punishment from God. I was writing about that coincidence on the internet and as I was thinking to write "" Was that a coincidence or not"" I hear my grandma saying to my father something like '' these are signs"" was that a coincidence again?

​

13) I was staying in an airbnb apartment. I was looking the bookcase that had a few books. after some time, I looked it again, and had a book with the title ""THE SIGN OF GOD"" i did not freak because it was a time that I started ignoring my ocd and was thinking less about the whole coincidence-thing. But still, why i did not saw that book when I checked for the first time?

14) I was writing about an ocd worry on internet and as I was ready to write the word ""movement"" in greek, I heard an ad saying something like "" bla bla bla bla.... movement"" I got worried and I was wondering if it was a coincidence. At that moment, I heard from the tv, probably, from the next ad, saying something like "" psoriasis signs"" and I freaked because I heard the word signs.

15) I was thinking about my ocd worry and heard a door sound the same time with a dog barking. that reminded me of the dog-door-alarm coincidence, and at that moment, I noticed that I coucld hear the sound of a van sensor/alarm or something similar to that. I do not know if it started when I heard the door/dog or it started earlier. Anyway, I probably, heard the 3 sounds together again.

16) I ended up connecting as a bad sign, a butterfly. While I was thinking about a small coincidence with a butterfly that I saw in a series episode, I randomly, looked the toilet paper and saw butterflies printed on it.

​

can someone explain to me, what he/she thinks of these coincidences one by one. These coincidences are the reason that I cant just ignore my ocd that easily. Because coincidences happen that perhaps, tell me that my ocd is right and I should worry about it.",26Nov2020,1
381," my coworker (42 F) has me (21F) braid extensions into her hair every so often and she offered to pay me $20 each time I do it because it takes some time and skill. i don't do hair professionally or anything, we work at a grocery store. I've done it about 10 times now and she's paid me every time. i've been wondering lately if $20 is a fair price and if i should ask her for more (and if so, how much). i'm hoping someone who knows more about hairstyling and stuff like that can give me an idea of how much money my service is worth. she's kind of a dramatic person and i don't want her to be offended or upset by me asking for more. 

i think it's worth noting that she's white and has shoulder-length hair, so it's not incredibly difficult or time consuming to do, it takes me about an hour to do (if i don't mess up and have to redo it) so when you think about it like that $20 for an hour of work is not bad. she bought the extensions herself and i acknowledge that she's making that investment into this service herself. i basically do two dutch braids and feed the extension in as i go and then her hair (or the fake hair rather) goes down to her shoulder blade. i put rubber bands up the braids so they stay in place. she says she sleeps in them and they could last her a week, but she does take them out after about 3 days sometimes. she always is so grateful for the braids and tells me how many complements she gets. she's obsessed with this hair yall 

she is very difficult to make an ""appointment"" with. when i work with her she tells me she'll come over later in the night and i sit around waiting for her at my house and she never shows up. she tells me she'll show up at 7pm and isn't at my house until 9pm. twice now she's told me she'll meet me at my house at 8am so i wake up (3 hours earlier than i normally would) to do it and she doesn't show; i didn't get a ""sorry"" text until 9pm in the day. when she comes over for me to do it she doesn't just sit in my chair and let me work for an hour, she dilly dallys, makes herself a drink, comments on my room decor, and tries to show me videos on how she wants me to do her hair this time (even though i do it the same way every time and she says she ""loves it""). One time she got to my house at 7pm and because she was so chatty and unfocused she didn't leave until 10pm. i wish she would just get in and get out. she was talking so loud one night i straight up told her to shut up so she didn't wake my roommate and she still makes fun of me for that. today even, she asked to come over, i told her if she wasn't going to be here at 7pm sharp then don't bother coming, she goes ""you got it"". i was going to leave tonight to visit my mom for thanksgiving (4 hour drive) but because my coworker wanted me to do her braids i told my mom i wouldn't leave until tomorrow morning. i get a text from my coworker at 6:45pm: ""won't be able to make it tonight"". 

I feel like my time and space isn't being respect here. this would not fly at a professional salon. i'm not sure if the actual braiding i do is worth more than $20, but i want her to pay me more so the uncertainty and stress she puts me under is worth it. i've been having beef with her when it comes to work stuff, so i'm trying to not let that influence my frustration here. i appreciate the extra money but i don't know how i can justify to her that i want more money if she thinks $20 is fair. let me add too that she can afford a little extra. she tells me she works ""just for fun"". she walks around with a $2500 handbag. a few months ago she bought a $40,000 car. i wouldn't charge someone an unfair price just because they're rich, but that extra money in my pocket and not having my nights wasted is valuable to me (more so than it hurts her pocketbook)",26Nov2020,1

389,"Basically, I'm a mess. Well let's just wrap up all my childhood trauma from the age of 6 to 19 in a bow by saying I was and am mentally ill. I am not dumb but I am severely crippled by the fact I have been on ADD medication my entire life off and on. I didn't graduate high school, but got my GED. 
I had been secluded in California mountains smoking meth with whomever I could and I think I quite literally lost my mind because I decided to slam it one time and it scared the living fuck out of me. I decided to quite the ADD meds (Adderall) and never touched meth again. I did get severely severely depressed and I think this is all an accumulation of a severe life of undiagnosed PTSD, possibly Asperger's, and definitely have lasting effects of a stimulant addiction.

I am now 25 years old, sober other than anti depressants. I left California to get away from all my triggers. I have no family except my best friend whom I currently live with in Texas.
I drove to Texas with enough money to find an apartment with my friend and her boyfriend and I succeeded. 

I am not doing well. I am supposed to find a job. My car has broken down. I don't know how to fix it. I have to pay rent soon and my unemployment is running out.

 I have a really small bedroom and half of it is an ugly cheap wardrobe from the 80's. This bedroom was my mother's before and even when she had one, my grandparent put the new ugly wardrobe instead, which my mother hated.
We've  talked with her countless times, but she doesn't give up, even when it's really old and crunchy. I know this isn't a real problem, in fact, it's more just like a first world problem, but for me would be life changing. We had a big fight and know we don't talk about it anymore.

He litteraly stays up all night until it dies, which, on some occasions, have been up to 5:30 am. It has completely ruined his sleep routine, which is critical for growing toddlers to have.

He never goes a day without having at least 3 hours of screen time, not including when he takes it to bed. I would like some advice on this issue.

396,"I've been with my partner for 2 and a half years now. Every aspect is great, I love her dearly and we've spoken about plans to marry and have kids, move into a bigger house together etc. She's funny, we get on really well and everything is lovely.

The sex life is worrying me though. I'm on anti-depressants, mainly for my OCD (intrusive thoughts), but general anxiety as well. This affects my sex drive some what. Since we moved in around 8 months ago, we've had sex maybe once or twice a week (that's always been what we did before i moved in).

 It seems that lately its becoming less frequent, to the point of no sex in the last 2-3 weeks. We had a chat about it last night and she said it feels like at the moment there's not a lot of romance, we've started taking each other for granted - finish work (both at home), eat dinner together, watch TV and go to bed. We don't do a lot of activities, which in part is down to a national lockdown.

I'm a massive worrier anyway, and i've got into this really weird loop where I want to have sex, and I worry every day that passes when we don't have sex, but then when it comes to it, it's late at night and I just don't want to do it. It's nothing against her, I love her and i'm attracted to her, but it's almost turning into a fear of doing it.

Her concern that she shared with me is that it's turning into this thing of us saying we'll have sex purely because we should do, as its been so long, rather than we want to. I think in that sense it almost feels like a chore when we get to bed.

I don't know what to do. I'm really worrying about it because that's what I do anyway, I worry. But everything about our relationship is amazing except that. I've had relationships previously where after a couple of years the sex just dried up fully and after about 6 years we broke up because we'd just become friends. I'm terrified of this happening again and I worry that it's my fault.",26Nov2020,1
397,"NOTE: This is my second time posting this, because I felt that my initial title was unsuitable. I'm transgender and I mentioned that in the title previously; Upon reconsideration, I don't think that should be in the title because I believe that aside from possible health-related issues (Which I am taking into consideration, thank you to the previous commenter who mentioned it), me being trans is not very relevant to the issue at hand. 

Sorry about the trouble. 

BACKGROUND 

- My partner and I are both from a relatively misogynistic and regressive Islamic developing country. 

- She comes from a poor, abusive family. She is highly intelligent, constructive, positive and entrepreneurial but has difficulty fitting in with others. 

- I am a male-to-female transgender person, and I come from a more-well-off, somewhat-less-abusive family. My family was entirely unsupportive of my transition save for my late mother, who eventually came to be supportive of me and who gave/willed me a sum of money for the express purpose of going overseas for my own safety. 

As a person, I'm good at superficial social interaction, but I'm unintelligent, lazy, narcissistic, exploitative and a compulsive liar. 

Despite being ridden with gender dysphoria issues for my entire my life, I hadn't considered transitioning until I met my partner. She suggested it and basically helped train me to blend in. 

- We met online about 6 years ago.Both of us were unaware of my problems at the time. After hitting it off, we moved in together to escape her abusive family ASAP. We also got married (Legally-speaking I'm male).

- My life partner and I have been trying to build a life together for 6 years now. The goal has been to build a business and/or career/s together and leave this country to move to Japan.



THE PROBLEM

I keep performing constant and dangerous acts of sabotage on her:


- My logic is consistently faulty in a way that leads me to keep doing things that waste our resources or even potentially put us in legal/financial trouble. 

I have answered bank/insurance phone calls and even made a bank visit pretending to be her. I actually thought this was acceptable simply because no one would notice. Just last week I almost called the tax office pretending to be her. 


- I regularly interpret her requests and instructions in the most malicious way possible. 

The aforementioned tax office call happened because she told me to call and find out how to get MY taxpayer number and explain the process to her. 

I literally remembered it as ""Call, PRETENDING TO BE HER and ask for HER taxpayer number"".


- I keep instinctively lying and defending myself without reason when speaking to her. Every instinct I have seems bent towards playing the victim and painting her as evil. 

She can literally be showing me info on a screen asking me about a discrepancy in my work, and I'll just keep mumbling things like ""Oh, that's weird, I don't remember there being a discrepancy..."" whilst NOT ACTUALLY LOOKING at the screen. 


- I keep blanking out and ignoring or mishearing (Maliciously, as-described above) important information from her. I just subconsciously seem to have no respect for her. 


- When she entrusts me with an important task, I will regularly perform it normally for a while, then subconsciously stop doing it or alter how I do it so that it's somehow harmful. 


- I'm not sure whether I truly ever knew how to take criticism, but after years of this, now whenever she criticizes my behaviour, my brain slows to a crawl and all I can think of is either trying to justify myself or a stream of ""Oh...Yeah, okay, I agree...I'm sorry...I'll try and do what you say..."" which feels off to both of us and even I have zero confidence in, because every time I apologize or resolve to do better next time, I just go and do the exact same thing again. 


I have been constantly doing all of these things for 6 years, it is getting worse and I even constantly forget that I do these things in the first place until reminded. 

My only subconscious takeaway from these 6 years seems to be that my partner is ""verbally abusive"" and constantly ""misjudges"" me due to my track record. I keep defaulting to assuming I'm doomed to being wrongly accused by her all the time. 

I really, really want to stop. Consciously, I want nothing more than to be the supportive partner to her that we both expected me to be, but it is not going well. 

We have spent tens of thousands of hours (Literally 6-12 hours frequently, even daily at times) discussing how I can stop being like this, but I just keep unconsciously slipping back into the same pattern. I even drag on our discussions for hours longer-than-necessary with drama, repetiton, derailment and gaslighting. 

Worse-still, my memory is failing and I find myself spacing out/floating away more and more often, even when alone. I literally feel as if I'm losing grip of myself mentally. 


OUR CURRENT STATE

-  Her planned business has been unable to start until now because of my behaviour. 

- We are currently trying to limit my interactions with her, but I'm still getting worse anyway.

- We've taken me off handling anything important (Bank stuff etc).

- We've concluded that in my current state, I am a liability to the business and should not work in it. 

We've determined that because I'm basically bilingual in English and Japanese (Several years living experience in Japan, Japanese Associate Degree), have a knack for languages and like talking to people, I can and should contribute by becoming a translator. 

This way, I can earn a decent income to help fund her business and get us to Japan.


CONCLUSION

The massive problem with this plan is that my partner DOESN'T SPEAK JAPANESE. 

We want to make this work, but considering my ongoing horrendous issues, it hardly seems safe for us to go to a country where she can't speak the language and will be forced to rely on me MORE for important stuff.

Yet, if we don't do this, we're essentially stuck in our regressive, misogynistic home country with no real opportunities (Both of us have no meaningful work experience or connections here).

In the end, my partner and I have both decided that I should go and ask for advice anonymously (We have no close friends to talk to about this).

What, if-anything, can I do to fix this situation?",26Nov2020,1
398,"This time 2 years ago, I had an incredibly bad mental fall out. Couldn't sleep, couldn't get out of bed, couldn't work. I spent a year thinking I was going to die before the year was up and it took me dragging myself out of it by my teeth to start working again. The job I got, however, is part time and with covid my hours have been terrible. It isn't sustainable. 

My sister's family was gracious enough to allow me to stay in the apartment under hers for a little over a year, since her MIL owned the house I didn't have to pay rent. However the MIL moved and is understandably not keeping the house when my sister and her family moves. This could be anywhere in the given time frame, and I should expect to leave around the time they do.

I am still working towards recovery. I'm trying different medications, I've started therapy, and over all I HAVE been improving. But I'm afraid it won't be quick enough, and if I handle it badly or I rush, I'm just going to fall out again. The place I was is not where I want to go again.

I don't have a degree, I don't have a lot of family out of state, and there are no other family members who could make room for me, and I agree it's been time enough that I should be able to provide for myself, but I just don't know how to do it.

I don't know what decent paying jobs are available to a mostly retail based background. And most retail places don't hire full time out the gate, even though I have a few years of manager experience.

I think I would be okay moving out of state, or atleast out of the area. 

I guess Im posting because I just need life advice. My credit is terrible, my options are poor, and while I want to succeed and do better by myself, I just don't know how. I'm a mess and I'll take any advice that's out there. I wish I could just hand over the remote control and let someone else deal with it.",26Nov2020,1

She gives me unsolicited advice on how to do better in my life with my aspergers and it irritates me so much, I was diagnosed when I was 7 and I’ve had plenty of time to learn how to live successfully with a disability. I don’t need an abled person to save me. 

She also makes comments about my sexual orientation, I have a boyfriend and when I mentioned him she said “ Ohhhhh you’re gay!” I said something like “I prefer not to label myself” and she got very flustered and went on a rant about all of her gay friends. 

She expects me to keep her updated on the happenings of my personal life but I don’t feel comfortable doing that, she crossed a major boundary the other day when she touched me while I was trying to go to work.

In many ways this year i failed. I started multiple businesses, all failed. I invested in stocks, ended up losing thousands of dollars. My health took a turn for the worst too and i dislocated my shoulder 4 times this year and many more partial dislocations. the amount of pain i have felt this year is more than i have felt in any other year. I have been depressed since i was 16 and somehow i am better off this year than i was any of the other years.

I have come to the conclusion that nothing other than myself, money and my family matter to me. I have had lost of problems with keeping friends and making new friends.  of course i am still a virgin at 20 but i am beyond the point of caring anymore. 

being fat i have always been bullied for being myself and have always reserved myself to appeal to others but that never worked. I have been broken so much i am numb, i no longer care about anyone, i have started to rebuild my personality and build my health up again.

Its now close to the last month of the year, i am beaten &amp; broken, but i am stronger than ever. The rest of 2020 i will be working on myself to build a better future and take care of myself.

405,"Hi Reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

Roughly a month ago my grandma who is the most important person in my life had a stroke at the age of 89 soon to be 90. I am originally from one of the shite eastern european countries and my family always made sure and did their best to make us leave the country and settle somewhere else. All my siblings and I did just that. My sister and brother moved to different countries and now have a family with kids and mortgages and all the responsibilities that come with it. I am the youngest of the three and in my late twenties and I got fuck all. I have been studying and living in the UK for the past eight odd years with some gaps due to family emergencies. I have permanent residence thought it has some conditions in the UK and I was on track to apply for it at the end of the coming March. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back home my mom and dad look after my grandma and I have also asked them to set up laptops with teamviewer so I can monitor my grandma when they are at work. I do this religiously everyday. The problem that my grandma faces after a stroke is that she can lose consciousness at any moment and I have seen through camera how she falls on the floor and hits her head. This happened on a couple of occasions so far because she forgets and tries to move around. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I heard that she had a stroke I wanted to purchase a ticket and help out my mom since I can still work remotely for a few months until my contract is up. However, afterward, I won't be able to find a proper job back home due to the economy. My siblings told me to calm my arse down and stay put. I listened like a complete belend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lockdown hit - no planes though I assume there are ways to still make it across the channel. Now the next problem hit - one of my flatmates in a shared house of six got tested positive for covid. I used the same communal areas for over a week now and tried not to interact with anyone. But flatmates are wild and still carry on partying as nothing happened. I try to keep to myself. I still have not experienced any symptoms and my quarantine is due to end on the 2nd of December. Well, that would be two weeks since she told everyone she has corona. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a clause in getting UK citizenship that you can be 90 days abroad in the year before you apply for it. I have 75 days left and I planned to go back home from mid-December to at least mid-January and then again for some time in march on account of my grandma's birthday. This was planned all before the wave of fuckery hit everyone. I have the green light from my employer to work from abroad until the end of the contract and help my grandma and mom. However, then I will lose my citizenship for which I have spent many of these years in the UK depressed, suicidal, drunk... Let's just say it was tough to be completely alone and in isolation on account that I have horrible social anxiety and I am generally fucked in the head. So every job after uni in tech was very difficult when it came to communication skills. I could say bye-bye to the UK and move back to the shithole to help my parents until the dreadful day comes. I would love to be near my grandma in her final moments but I have seen that it will not be pretty and I am ready for that.

&amp;#x200B;

If I don't complete a year in the UK I won't be able to apply. Nonetheless, I have 5 years after being given settles status to come back without any restrictions. Although, if I come back after 2 years I have to pay £600 for some reason but that's the least of my concerns. 

&amp;#x200B;

The bottom line is my siblings said fuck off we all build our own lives. I have no life, never had, and always said that as soon as my parents go I go because I have never enjoyed anything in life. Even after trying all kinds of mental services and subsequent self-medication. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the question is do I go back home and stay there or come and go using the remaining 75 days and still get the citizenship? And what about the possibility of killing my old folks with corona even if I am asymptomatic or something like that? How long do I wait to be sure I am carrying the virus and can travel? Frankly my head is spinning and I asked for advice from my family and nobody can tell me anything concrete. I understand them - they don't want to take responsibility for a major step that would significantly affect my life. I already know that I will massively regret not getting citizenship after doing my time here. However, I probably won't be able to live with myself if I don't spend the final moments with my grandma. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some random variables that screw with my head are that I am tired of UK but it's the only place I truly know how to operate in because I have spent all of my adult life here and it would be much easier to just live out my shitty life here. I had some grandiose plans to move somewhere else in europe or something but I am in software dev and I am really shit at it and generally lazy and have no passion towards anything except getting some money for my family every now and then so I don't piss it away on alcohol, takeaway and other miserable shite. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do apologise for this mess of a story. Please could someone help me figure out what to do or point me in the right direction? Personally, I think using these 75 days until I can apply would be the best choice but then again this sounds incredibly selfish..",26Nov2020,1

I'm a female from a South Asian country so mental health isn't really that talked about here even though it is getting better. I don't want to self diagnose myself but at the same time I have no way of getting clinically diagnosed either. Anyways the point is I *think* I have anxiety...I have a very silly example but I feel like this small inconvenience describes my situation the best.
  So I have to make tea for mum at around 4pm usually but I get SO much anxiety from like an hour ago about my tea making procedure??? It's very stupid I know!! But I procrastinate making tea till the last moment and I can't focus on any task and keep thinking about how I still have to make tea....it makes me almost cry and my family thinks I'm being lazy, not that I've told them exactly why I am acting this way....not only that if my mum tells me to do something unprompted which requires longer then 10 minutes (such as making dinner when she is tired) I just can't do it and I have a breakdown before I force myself to work. This all sounds so stupid but I don't know where else to go. 
Lastly, please don't tell me to just talk to my parents because I know they will understand but first of all my family can't afford therapy and secondly I don't express emotions in front of my family at all. The last time they saw me cry about something serious was 10 years ago😂 so thinking about talking to them will kill me.

409,"I’ve been in love with one of my best friends for more than 3 years now, but never had the courage to tell her until a year ago. she told me she doesn’t have feelings back. unfortunately I can’t follow the standard textbook recommendation to spend time apart from her because we’re part of a really tight friend group. And this friend group is both of our main social group. We actually tried to cut contact with each other, but because of our large number of mutual friends, we end up being invited to same social events. So trying to cut off contact didn’t work at all. 

How can I move on when I have to continue seeing her. I initially thought that if I just tell her how I feel, and get rejected, then I can start moving on. But for the past year, I’ve made no progress at all. I also always have to pretend that I am not hurting in front of her to alleviate the tension. I just don’t know what to do anymore. Also recently i feel like she’s gotten much colder to me, I know that part of it is because she feels this pressure too when I am around, and she’s had enough. So I try to not take it too personally. but being able to rationalize it doesn’t make me feel better.  It’s a tough situation for both of us.. :/

415,"To start, I (18f) would like to point out that I have an okay relationship with my parents. There are certain things I would tell them and certain things I wouldn't. One of them being my relationships. My parents are quite conservative. Hence, they don't really like certain things I do; like wear certain clothes or they always try to discourage me on not having any romantic relationship. This is sometimes by talking shit when my cousins (around my age) have relationships or even questioning me everytime they see me with a boy.

For two months now, I have been dating this guy that I met from a school club. I have been trying to make it quiet and subtle as possible just in case if there are rumors going around about us that would get to my parents. Unfortunately, it is not subtle enough as my dad saw me hanging out with him sometimes when he is picking me up.  A few hours ago, my mother asked me if I had a boyfriend, and to which I said no. But she kept lecturing me on how I should stop as it may affect my studies and I'm only in my first years of uni. I understand that she is looking out for me but I had feeling it's a warning. Because last time I told them I was going on a date(my first date), they were FREAKING out. My mum told me to play hard to get (which also translates to: don't be a whore) and a bunch of other things and even encouraged my dad to come sit with us on the date (thankfully he didn't, I bribed him out of it). On my way to the date, my dad, however, told me not to be cheap. Which truly did affected me for a while and I confronted them abt it a few weeks later. They never really apologized for it but they did say they were just looking out for me. 

And back to my situation right now, I just don't know what to do because my mother is technically saying I should stop and focus on my studies instead. Although, I think it's just a way of me not having a relationship. I truly don't know what they expect from me, if I stop this relationship, what about the next one? And I just feel trapped and I don't know what to do. If I were to continue it, I may lose my parents respect and I do not want that. In my culture, children should never disobey our parents as it may bring bad karma to our lives and I honestly believe this but at the same, I understand that this lowkey kinda toxic.

420,"I have ocd. My ocd has to do with promises to God or Gods. The reason of the promises were to force myself to stop do an ocd compulsion.

For example, if my ocd is telling me to do a compulsion, I make the promise about not doing the compulsion and a punishment/curse was being asked in order to use the fear of the punishment/curse to force myself not to do the compulsion.

One time, I told God that I would mean a promise only if I validated it by doing the cross sign 3 times because I think I was telling Him that I do not mean those promises and I make them because of my ocd. One time, I tried to validate a promise but I think, I stopped validating by stoping to the second time of the cross sign. The reason of the validation was because ocd kept giving me worries and just by thinkiing the promise did not work. Anyway, I think I stopped at second time and canceled the promise.

I am not sure if the promise was canceled. now, I have some other fears and worries too.

1) what if the promises/deals were accepted by other Gods in case Christian God is not real?

2) what if there are promises/deals that I do not remember?

3) my mind has intrusive thoughts about making new deals/promises to Gods and almost, every 1 minute or 30 seconds I pray compulsively in my head to explain that I do not make promises.

I feel depressed. I cant be free. Whenever I am in my computer, I am worrying that I will see something or say something that will break a promise or an hypothetical promise.

I can't say 100% the dog was attacking the pug as bushes were in the way to block that viewing angle but was enough to see him punching the GS in the ribs then walking away with the pug in his arms whilst being jumped at by the GS.

426,"She cheated, robbed him, and fucked him over all those years ago all while he was helping her raise a child with autism. We were in bed 3 weeks ago just talking and I asked him if he would get back with her and he replied 'I wouldn't touch her with a 10 ft pole' then 3 weeks later they are officially fb confirmed couple.

Im very close to his family, specially his mother since I've known them for 10 years now and his family is beyond livid and disappointed in his decision to be with her again, claiming he fucked me over and he should apologize, and to never bring her over the house, ESPECIALLY on Thanksgiving. 

I don't know what I should do, in the sense of reaching out for him for closure, or to let sleeping dogs lie... I feel like he wants to continue our friendship of 10 years, but after all the lying, I can't seem to forgive him. His family tells me to not try to communicate, but I would like to know what happened, because I am so hurt right now, I haven't slept in days.

What should I do?",26Nov2020,1
427,"Basically yesterday my bf blamed me for something and told me certain thing I said wasn't okay with him and blocked me. Basically it wasn't big argument. he seemed annoyed but on the other hand I think it was his fault He hasn't blocked me for the first time. But the time gap is 15 hrs already. He hasn't blocked me on mail I believe if that matters.

Idk what's up. I think even if I was the one wrong he should just say it

428,"Sorry for this long one. TL;DR: Whenever I confide in my boyfriend about my insecurities and why I've been feeling down, he brings up a new celebrity crush who doesn't look like me soon after and it's really out of character for him.

I (F19) have been with my boyfriend (M19) for over a year now.

I should mention that I'm on the asexual spectrum so I don't get crushes on people.

Recently, I opened up about all my insecurities and how much negative thoughts about my appearance consume my life. I told him why I don't like compliments and where I think the problems stem from. He was very understanding and said he would be more sensitive about the topic.

Two days later, we were talking about reactivating my Instagram, being more confident and how I might start working out while eating full meals again (I've been fasting every other day to lose weight) when I started talking about Scarlett Johansen and how so many guys had a crush on her. He said he doesn't because he's not into blue eyes. I didn't ask whether he did because he told me he never really had crushes besides Chloe Grace Moretz ""for her funny personality not really looks"" when she was younger.

As I start talking about something else, he then says ""actually the only female celebrity that has caught my eye is Lily James. I really like her,"". It threw me off a little so I just pointed out that we both have wide noses (I'm insecure about mine so seeing her look good with it made me feel a little better). He then said ""yeah I guess but look at her beautiful brown eyes"" I agreed and then manage to steer the conversation onto something else but now all I can think about is how much he likes Lilly James.

I've noticed a pattern that whenever I open up about my insecurities, he manages to bring up a new celebrity crush on the same day or a little after as this has happened repeatedly. Another time it happened was, he had hurt me and tried to make it up by coming to see me in a coffee shop. when I finally started feeling better, he randomly pulls up this girl on Instagram and says that he has a crush on her. I didn't really know what to say and he must have noticed my awkwardness so he then said we kinda have the same hair colour. It was a stretch so I just said no and moved on to a different topic.

It feels so out of character for him because he normally tells me that no girl catches his eye because he's too focused on work and school and always goes on and on about how beautiful he thinks I am and how much he loves me and which features he loves the most (no exaggeration. I have to tell him it's too much and getting annoying for him to stop) but I'm beginning to feel like it's all fake when he keeps showing me celebrity crushes that don't look like me.

He says he loves that I'm in shape with curves but his crushes are all skinny.

He says he loves my big lips but all his crushes have small lips.

He says he loves my light blonde curly hair but all his crushes have dark/dirty blonde or brownish straight hair.

He says he loves my green and hazel eyes but all his crushees have brown eyes.

His crushes have square-ish or prominent jawlines, I have a soft small v-shaped jawline.

He knows I'm this obsessive over my own and other girls facial features to the point where I have contacted plastic surgeons and started saving up for the procedures I want. So I don't know why he keeps telling me about his celebrity crushes when I don't ask and clearly don't want to know.

The most recent one hurt more than I expected when I realised that on our first date I asked what he would have thought about if he saw me walking down the street (I have a unique appearance that got me bullied in school but now makes strangers ask where I'm from, if my hair is natural etc) and he said ""nothing"" because no one catches his eye but now he goes on and on about how Lilly James caught his eye.

We have had a lot of small issues in our relationship, so add those to my low self-esteem and now I'm beginning to think I would be happier single.

What do I do next? Say that I don't want to know about his crushes (which I have said once jokingly before) ? Please help",26Nov2020,1

430,"I've been awake for pretty much a full 24 hours, so I'm sorry if this sounds confusing.

Back in June I got my own apartment after moving back home to help with my mom when covid first hit. It's a 2 bedroom and after a few months a friend (the one in the title, ""Jeff"") of mine I have known for nearly 8 years decided to move out of his small town to live here. He isn't on the lease or anything, he just pays me his share of rent and utilities. This was in September. 

A few weeks after, a friend (21M, ""Ian"") of mine from a couple states away (who I've only known since January), decided to come move here as well. Until October we shared my futon as a bed in the living room because I didn't have any other beds. Ian and I were really close, we shared a lot of similar family background &amp; related on us both being trans. 

While this was happening, Jeff slowly started to take over the master bedroom. I was unhappy with this because this whole place was mine originally and he never talked to me about it. But his stuff started to overwhelm my stuff in the room and his cat was always in there (I'm allergic, but not deathly) because it was closest to the bathroom where he put the open litter box.

It became regular that I never really saw Jeff because he was working a bunch and when he'd get back he'd go straight to his room. He never talks with me and when he does it's always a tense and bland situation. I told him often about how he needed to keep the litter box clean and even got a small closed trash can in the bathroom so he can clean it up every time he goes in there to use the restroom. He's been really bad about this and there are times I go into the bathroom and my nose and eyes hurt. Taking showers is sometimes gruesome because all the fumes just permeate the air.

He's become very difficult to talk to and especially difficult to ask to do things. Since the litter is open box, his cat flicks litter all over the floor and he never cleans it. It's disgusting to take a shower then step on a bath mat sprinkled in litter. I had to literally hand him my vacuum and tell him to clean it - to which he only cleaned up the loose litter and not the wet litter that needs to be scrubbed off the floor. Not to mention he didn't even empty the fucking vacuum afterwards. 

Moving forward to October, I got two beds for Ian and I (Ian didn't have a job so I was paying for everything of his, but he took care of cooking and a good portion of cleaning) so we set them up in the second bedroom.

I talked with Jeff finally about him paying a higher portion of rent for having the master bedroom since Ian and I had to share, &amp; Ian began working at Jeff's work so he could start chipping in. Ian's deal was that he'd pay a set amount every month which would go towards utilities first, then any leftover would be split between John and I (which we would put towards rent). Since he only just recently started, this never actually came to fruition. 

This is where it gets confusing and stressful. I woke up today and went to work, ended up working a longer day than usual. I spoke with Ian a few times throughout my shift, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I called him when I was on my way home, which is usual, and he didn't reply. I texted a few times, no response. When he isn't working he's always on his phone and always quick to respond. It wasn't like him at all. I called Jeff and asked him if Ian was home to which he said ""he's probably sleeping"". I told Jeff I was worried and asked him to tell Tony I've been trying to reach him. He said he would. I hung up and continued home.

I came home around 11pm &amp; Ian was gone. All of his stuff. All of his belongings he brought with him, completely cleared out. I message him and when I couldn't get ahold of him through text I started worrying. I tried to reach him through social media but he blocked me on literally every single platform.

I was panicking. I asked Jeff if he saw him. Jeff never even went to go check on him after our call. I was livid and also hyperventilating. I asked Jeff if he could call him and was telling him all of Ian's stuff was gone. Jeff was so apathetic to the whole situation it was infuriating. He got mad at me when I asked him to call. While he was calling, I tried asking mutual friends of Ian if they had heard from him. After a half hour Jeff didn't even bother to leave his room to tell me if he had reached him or not &amp; when I asked him about it he was angry and curt with me saying ""idk it went to voicemail"". I asked him if he knew anything or when the last time he saw Ian was and it was like I was talking to a wall. He was upset with me interrupting his game. 

At this point I felt sick. I had no idea what was happening and I started to get nauseous thinking if Ian did something bad to himself. I ended up calling the police to file a report because it's so out of character for him to do something like this.

I've been sick to my stomach and Jeff's response to all of this has me absolutely out of my mind mad. After all of the subtle shitty roommate things he's done, this is the absolute shit cherry on top. I can't even stand the sight of him right now. I've been debating on asking him to leave, but now I am certain. Everything feels so chaotic, but I want him gone. I can give him one month, but no more. 

How do I approach telling him he needs to go without just blowing up like I feel I want to right now? What should I say? and most importantly, how do I cope with my friend just disappearing? 

Sorry for the long read. I'm still so baffled.

tldr; My roommate Ian blocked me on all social media and just disappeared. My other roommate Jeff has been a pain in the ass and his apathy and misguided anger at me has made it abundantly clear I want him out of the house. How do I approach this without seething / crying?",26Nov2020,1
431,"I used to be a childish and selfish person a few years ago. I paid a lot for my actions. After I moved to a new school, I thought that everything would be over. But I was wrong. 

I secretly liked this guy in our school for a long time. I never became friends with him because of my social anxiety, but I was happy how it was. When my best friend from my old school came, I thought that I could trust her so I spilled this out.

 As time went by, I realized that my best friend wasn't that close to me anymore. She had her social group, and I had mine. Then one friend told me that my old friend actually didn't like me. 

My old friend told everyone about my dark history, my crush.

 Everyone in her social group, including my crush.

 Why did she do it? Because she didn't like me. She did it for revenge on some of the silly things I did to her in the past. I thought that it was all over. I thought that she didn't care about the stupid jokes I made. I thought we were good friends. I was so shocked and depressed,  I went to the bathroom and had a meltdown. I started to tremble and I don't even know why.

I still have many great friends and stuff, but the thought of my crush and my old friend makes me feel sad and afraid. How should I face my old friend in the future? How should I face my crush? How can I live a happy school life without being haunted by the thought of people talking about my past mistakes? Or, how can I dgaf about everything that happened?

433,"Hi all,

I just need some advice as my friend recently discussed with me her finances, they worry me a lot. She’s in over £2,000 worth of debt, that i know of. Which is probably a lot more now. I have countlessly tried to help her sort this out, as she is only a student she doesn’t get much income apart from her student loan. 

I tried to work out an affordable payment plan for her using her student loan, as that’s all the money she has to pay monthly for it. She’s frozen her CC and only pays interest on it, so she isn’t actually even paying it off, she doesn’t really even seem bothered about it either. She’s just bought a brand new laptop for £700. She just doesn’t listen and even with the affordable plan I made, she still says she wants money for herself pretty much (even though she pays literally no bills, which should be used to her advantage!) she is constantly spending money on clothes and things she doesn’t need more of. 

Not sure what I can do anymore.. it’s concerning because she’s only 21, has barely any money and her family can’t really help her either. Does anyone know any websites I can send to her to maybe help her deal with these debts? or just anything I can do to help?

So I was a manager of a toy store for just under two years, I had 8 staff in total, 6 of which I had hired in 2019 as Christmas casuals. One of them was a personal friend of my boyfriends who needed a job and I offered to help him out.   
I took pride in the store and running it, I loved my job and in the new year the business did not survive through COVID and they went into administration, the business shut down in February and everyone including myself lost their job. I was lucky enough to have transitioned into a new job in December last year and was running the store part time.   
Over the weekend the girlfriend of the guy I had helped out (boyfriends friend) told me that before he left he stole an expensive pair of binoculars (talking $700)  I was mortified. He stole it while I was still the full time manager there too! After I did him a favour of hiring him.  
Today I was scrolling Instagram and came across one of the girls I hired as a Christmas casual, posing with two others workers claiming ""post stealing over $1,000 worth of product"" and were celebrating at an expensive restaurant.   
They took advantage of the fact the store was going into administration and stole product!  I had the opportunity to steal sure but morally I never would. I'm just so disgusted at the fact they are all almost bragging?   
What would you do?  The business has closed so I doubt there would be any legal action but I've very tempted to contact the previous head of retail just to inform him and make sure he doesn't provide any references.

446,"Forewarning: This will be quite long

My bf(17m) and I(18f) have been together for a year and a half now. When I first met him I was still quite immature and naive. We met through snapchat, and although I wasn’t particularly interested in him we got into a LDR thinking it would be just “for fun and experience”. 

Fast forward 6 months later and the relationship started to get serious. I didn’t plan on it getting serious, especially because we are so young, we were polar opposites and I wasn’t really into his personality. But he turned out to be the sweetest boy I’ve ever met. He was nothing but good to me, he was understanding and accepted my flaws, he even changed himself for the better, just for the sake of our relationship.

1 year into the relationship and we already deeply loved each other. But then the problems started to roll in. Being polar opposites didn’t help, the arguments started to happen and with each one the incompatibility started to show itself. He was reserved and hid his emotions, I was deeply emotional and showed it. He had very few interests and hobbies, I had many. He was apathetic of intellectual topics, I really enjoyed them. Over time he started to seem... boring to me. We shared very few interests and the compatibility was really lacking. 

Now a year and a half later and we choose to ignore our differences even though it affects us fairly often. My love for him has grown so much stronger but now I’ve come to realize that I don’t have much of a romantic interest in him. I feel sexually attracted to him but not so much emotionally. My love for him is starting to feel more like a best friend rather than a lover. And honestly, sometimes I hate myself for not having strong romantic feelings for him.

I think about breaking up with him a lot but when I actually plan to do it I get really sad and feel like I will severely regret it. What if I leave him and never find someone as good as him?? What if I realize later on that I want to be with him despite our extreme differences?? Can I somehow force myself to have stronger romantic feelings for him?? Cuz if I could... I sure as hell would. 

I feel so guilty for continuing this relationship when I know he’s way more interested in me than I am in him. I know I would hurt him SO much if I left him and it would hurt me too. But it just feels like something is missing in our relationship. Although, he’s oblivious to it so I think I’m the only one having these feelings. 

People keep telling me that maybe it’s just the distance. We’ve only met once before in person and I felt a small emotional connection but it wasn’t much. I’ve been told that “I should just go with the flow” and meet him a few more times in person to see if I develop a stronger romantic interest in him. The only problem is that he has oral herpes. I’m totally fine with that as long as I know for sure I want to be with him. Otherwise, I don’t want to get it if I’m just going to end up leaving him. That will only make dating harder for me. 

I could always tell him I don’t want to kiss him while I’m visiting him but I know he’d be really hurt about that and ask why I’m even in a relationship with him if I’m doubting it. And how the hell am I supposed to develop a stronger romantic interest in him if I can’t even kiss him?

I’m just so confused about what to do. I’m willing to try so hard to make this relationship work but I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to develop stronger romantic feelings for him. Should I just settle for him? At least I know he’ll never hurt me and always treat me like a princess but at the same time I just wanna be with someone who treats me good AND that I’ll have a strong romantic interest in. I just don’t know if I’ll ever find that if I leave him.

 I think it’s also important to let y’all know that I’m terrified of being alone. I just need clarity. Any advice would be very helpful. Thanks :)",26Nov2020,1

So it's been many years since I actually held any spiritual sentiments.

448,"So, as self-pitying as it sounds, I feel like my life has been complete garbage. First of all, I hate my body. Apparently, a lot of my female classmates have crushes on me, boys I know are incredibly envious of my height, and people always tell me that I have good facial hair. Yet, I absolutely despise every aspect of my body.

I hate how tall I am. I hate how big my hands are. I hate how my skull is huge and my face is small. I hate my facial hair and body hair. I hate my skin color, which looks like a combination of British, Hispanic, Eastern European, and Sephardic Jewish. I wish I had Korean skin. I wish I had a vagina, breasts, and plump butt.

I wish I could wear girly clothes. I wish I could wear leggings, Converse shoes, Vans, boots, skinny jeans, denim shorts, crop tops, sweaters, tutus, dresses, overalls, makeup, jewelry, etc. I wish I had long, black hair partially dyed pink to put in buns and ponytails.

And to be honest, I don't feel like I received a proper childhood. Because of, and again, apologies for sounding pompous, my intellectual abilities and interests in world history, anatomy, physiology, philosophy, economics, theology, and geopolitics, I have had overwhelming expectations placed on my shoulders all the time.

I remember, back in September, I couldn't attend school for a few days because I was pretty sick, and when I returned to school, my science teacher was visibly relieved. He told me that without my presence in the class, the class was collapsing and hardly functioning, as I was one of two students regularly giving accurate answers in class, and the only one giving ""brilliant"" and ""insightful"" answers.

As a biological child, I was never allowed to just feel normal, an issue that has increased in severity since the end of my fifth-grade experience. I've always been dubbed an Einstein-esque child/teenage genius, and any time I try to just feel normal and have fun, I'm looked upon with disgust by adults and my peers, who think I need to be reading a dissertation by a Harvard professor on the history of the Serbian nation, or some absurd bullshit.

Everyone I know expects me to become a scientist, philosopher, or historian, but that's not what I want at all. My desires are very different, precisely because of the events of my childhood.

My plans for my life following are as such: Sometime before the end of 2020, I plan on opening a bank account. After the pandemic (so April/May/June 2021 time frame), I plan on getting a job at AMC Theatres, as they hire 14-year-olds, and beginning to save up money. After graduating from high school in 2025, I plan on studying education, microbiology, atomic physics, philosophy, and world history at my local community college for two years.

Upon graduating, I want to get a job at my local school district as a history teacher for 3 years, until I'm 24. Then, likely in the early summer of 2030, I plan on buying a home in and moving to Massachusetts, as it's a very Liberal state that I feel would accept me.

Then, once I move to Massachusetts, I'm going to use skin bleaching cream to look Korean, and finally transition into the body I want. Additionally, I plan on molding my home into a Neverland-esque paradise to recreate the childhood I never got to enjoy.

I'm just imagining it. Inside the relatively small, split level home would be a living room decorated in posters for Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and We Bare Bears. Every day after work I lay down in big, soft bean bags resembling Snorlax and Wailord, surrounded by comfy leather couches I lounge in to enjoy colorful episodes of Adventure Time and Infinity Train, and whatever other good cartoons are out in the early 2030s.

In the kitchen would be a pink cotton candy maker and a tall gumball machine. There would be a playroom filled with toys like slinkies, [Gogos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gogo%27s_Crazy_Bones), bottles of slime, knobby balls, and video games. My bed would be covered in plushies and colorful, fluffy blankets.

As much as I love the idea of being able to recreate the childhood I lost, at times I wonder if these desires are healthy or realistic. Any input in appreciated.",26Nov2020,1

451,"Title basically says it all. I have a couple reproductive issues that basically left me with a 0.5% chance of getting pregnant, and even less of a chance to carry to full term, according to doctors. I found out about this when I was 15 and I was pretty heartbroken about it, all I’ve ever wanted is to have kids, but I’m 19 now and I’ve accepted that there are other options and frankly, I’m excited to adopt or even foster. 

Well the last couple days, I’ve had this extreme loss of appetite and I am now 10 days late for my period, which isn’t unusual for me but the appetite thing caused me to take a test. Actually, to be more specific, three tests. All positive within a minute. To say I was shocked is.... a bit of an understatement. 

My partner doesn’t care what decision I make but I know that I cannot support a child right now. And even more than that, I am not mentally healthy, or prepared, enough to raise a child right now. Abortion is an easy choice for me, and it’s legal and accessible where I live. 

But there is one part of me that I cannot keep down, and that’s the part that’s telling me that this might be my only chance. I have no female friends to discuss this with and my family are judgemental to say the least. 

I’m scared that I’ll regret this. And I’m terrified that it’ll get my hopes up. What can I do to convince myself otherwise or at least help? Please.",26Nov2020,1
452,"Hi,

This just happened and I can't seem to get it off my mind.
I've been in a job about 6 months and have done quite well up until now. We are incredibly short staffed and it just me going to site until recently when a colleague returned.

 One of my trips to a site I worked on I forgot to update the database to show that I had attended and completed the service work. 4 months later my colleague goes to the site, I realise that I had forgotten to update the sheet and immediately call him to say I completed the work at that location, I apologise and put my hands up to recognise my mistake. 

He doesn't take it well and starts cursing on the phone and talking down towards me. He's not my supervisor or manager, other than him being older than me he's in no way above me. I know I was in the wrong and the mistake won't happen again, I apologised and just let him go on but it bothers me how he talked to me.

Should I call him and say that the way he reacted was too over the top? There hasn't been any mistake I've made until now and at most it's caused a lost hour.

What should I do?",26Nov2020,1

454,"My grandpa (dad’s father) has had Parkinson’s disease for a really long time now and slowly but surely, it’s been killing him. By “I’ve just realized it” I don’t mean I didn’t know, my grandparents live in another state but regardless my parents have been telling me “it could happen whenever” for years now. I just mean it really hit me today I guess, we’re visiting them for the first time in a year and a half and he looks horrible. He’s confined to a wheelchair, they’ve had to hire two men to get him out of bed in the morning, he has a full time caretaker and he can’t say a word. On top of his literal suffering the reason I feel so awful is because I’ve been repressing memories of him to make it easier, telling myself I didn’t even remember how he was before he was sick and that death is a huge part of life. Which is true, but I was being so selfish. I didn’t appreciate those moments with him where he could actually talk and smile before his disease took that from him even though I knew he was dying. Today I was in my dad’s childhood bedroom and I was looking at a picture collage on the wall of him, his brother and his parents all throughout his childhood, teenage years and then early adulthood and I guess it just really hit me that that’s his father. That’s the man who held him when he was born and watched him take his first steps and clapped at his graduations and he’s had to watch him deteriorate to the point where he’s motionless and immobile. I had the nerve to brush all that off and think “well, that’s life” just because I was scared to deal. My dad had such a wonderful relationship with both his parents, and like I said I know death is a huge part of life but it really doesn’t make it any easier. I guess my advice question is how can I deal with the grief of losing him on top of this bone crushing guilt that I have for almost dehumanizing him and wasting the little time I had left with my actual grandfather? I know I’m still a child and I shouldn’t be overly harsh on myself, or maybe I should be. I’m so ashamed. My dad has so obviously been afraid of losing his dad and I ignored it because I couldn’t handle it. My grandma is heartbroken and terrified of life without him and I barely even considered her feelings until I saw her squeezing his hand and bawling her eyes out when she thought no one was looking. I’m sorry this post is so long, I’m sobbing as I finish writing and I think I really just needed to get all that out. Thank you for taking the time to read it, please help if you can.",26Nov2020,1
457,"This actually happened today. As I was going to present the Holocaust in my history lesson, I made a presentation that proved, undeniably, that the Holocaust was a Jewish lie to establish the New World Order with Jews dictating everything. I showed them that Jews brought Hitler to power to fight communism, but also to compel Eruopean Jews to emigrate to Israel, so that they could have a base in Middle East for the New World Order. Key to New World Order was eliminating the White race, Christianity, and Islam, so building the state of Israel was also a step in the right direction to them in destroying Islam. They've already captivated the Vatican and other European countries to accept Jewish superiority and now all of them are servants of the Freemasons. They're ruining Christian values with feminism and other liberal values in the mainstream Jewish media, so there Christianity is also targeted in Europe. In the Americas too, in fact: The United States is no exception.

After saying these facts, the entire class didn't seem to be so oppositional but the brainwashed teacher told me that I would be suspended for hate speech. I don't get it: I was just revealing the truth about international Jewry's evil plan and that she would be extremely naïve to think that this was a lie. Before we got into a heated debate, she kicked me out of the classroom and I was suspended in the headteacher's office.

I am furious right now at the Jews for this evil power they have in our Christian country. I was literally suspended for speaking the gospel. Fuck this shit. I'm angry.

TL;DR: I revealed the Jewish conspiracy that the Jews started the Holocaust to build a case for their world domination, but was suspended by my satanist school. I'm furious.",26Nov2020,1

460,"I know the pandemic is affecting everyone and my problem is nowhere near unique, but I at least want to get it off my chest and talk to someone.

I'm currently a senior in high school and I've been accepted at the university I want to go to, so I have a lot going for me right now. However, I'm struggling to stay motivated to put effort into my classes and maintain the good future I have right in front of me. Because of this, I keep locking myself into a painful cycle of procrastination and cramming all my work in a short amount of time. As a result, the time I spend not working is never relaxing because I feel like I could be spending the time better and then when I do work, it all feels extremely rushed and poorly put together.

I've always struggled with procrastination, but now that everything is online due to the pandemic, it feels like I don't get any of the gratification I got before from doing well in school. School is effectively just a laundry list of homework assignments that restarts every day with none of the social interactions to keep it interesting or engaging in any way. The only thing really keeping me somewhat motivated anymore is not wanting to disappoint my parents, and that feels so much worse than being motivated by potential success.

With a combination of consistent procrastination and the pandemic, it feels like nothing I do is enjoyable anymore, including the things I truly love doing. It seems like there's a lot for me to lose with the way I currently feel and I want to change that, but I have no idea where to begin. I don't want fear to be my motivator anymore. 

My current disposition seems like it could be incredibly damaging if it persists for an extended period of time and I think a different approach to things would be incredibly beneficial. If anyone has any suggestions, they would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

TL;DR: I only feel motivated to give an effort in school because I'm afraid of losing good opportunities and especially disappointing my parents, and I think my current disposition could be extremely damaging.",26Nov2020,1

463,"My brothers are 11 and 9 and they stopped believing in Santa about a year back so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal for me to just ask them what they want or if there is a specific theme they would like their gifts to fall into. I know that our mother is planning on getting them a PS5 for Christmas but honestly I do not think this will happen due to issues surrounding stock and also it's really expensive and I feel like it would make more sense to spend that money evenly between all 4 of my siblings (my third brother who is 18 and my sister who is 13) rather than spending all that on something only 11 and 9 y/o brothers will use. Either way I told all this to my mother and told her not to get their hopes up for a PS5 because it will be very hard to get hold of one especially near Christmas.

Anyway when I asked my brothers what they wanted all they said was 'PS5 games' and because I still do not think a PS5 is a definite possibility for Christmas I do not want to buy them something they can't use so I asked what I can get them instead if I can't get PS5 games and they say 'PS4 games' 😑

I don't want to buy them videogames for many reasons; they already own a lot and I do not know specifically what they DO and DON'T already have and I don't want to buy something they already own and in the past I have bought them videogames just for them to play once and never pick up again because they didn't like them or something. My mother said 'then just buy them PSN giftcards and they can choose their own games to buy' but then that means on Christmas day I'm gonna be handing my 18 y/o brother a guitar, my sister a skateboard and then just giving two tiny slips of paper to my 11 and 9 y/o brothers. I don't want to give them giftcards wtf.

Anyway I'm having a really hard time now with getting them stuff because they literally like NOTHING except videogames and gaming-related stuff. So far I have only bought an inflatable Playstation-themed chair for them to share (I think they will like it) but I literally cannot think of anything. Last time I checked their favourite games were Spelunky, Among Us and Minecraft but their favourite games are constantly changing and I don't wanna buy something related to a game they don't even care about anymore (not to mention that out of these games only Minecraft has an actual range of merchandise). I'm only 20 but when I was their age I still liked stuff other than videogames (give me those PixelChix and fruit-scented colouring pens ya know what I mean?) and honestly it kind of frustrates me.

We are both 17. 

Anyway, I talked to my boyfriend about how these needs werent being met and I was feeling kind of neglected. I said that it always felt like he was looking forward to anything else but talking to me. 

When I started talking about this, he was smiling? Like it looked like he was about to laugh and I was really hurt. He said he was sorry but I told him I didnt want a sorry I wanted a solution for us. So he suggested we talk every Sunday, I said that's great and I would love that and think it would meet my needs, however after he stated this, he said I need to find something else to do so I dont think negativily like this, this felt like he was saying I dont have a life. But the way I see it, is I'm just trying to talk to my boyfriend because... we are in a relationship. I dont see how doing something else is going to take away the fact that we never talk and our relationship isnt a priority to him.

sarah and i share a lunch period so we just eat together. the thing is, her lunches are like a bottle of water and a tiny bag of peanuts, the size you’d get on a plane. just really small stuff. i only met her this year, but she’s lost weight since we met in august, and she was already tiny then. she’s starting to get the sunken eyes of someone in the throes of starvation. 

i’ve brought it up to her, calmly and nicely, and as gentle as one can be about such a thing, but she just laughs and tells me i’m being silly. i’m not, my cousin had to be hospitalized because of her disorder, i know what these look like. i know i’m not overreacting just because of that, as a mutual friend of ours talked to me about it too and we are both seriously worried about sarah. 

i read through some stuff like this, and most of them said to stage an intervention. that’s great, but she just moved here from across the country and she has basically three friends here. i don’t know anything about her family, so that’s a bust too.

I am a very emotional and forgiving person. He pleaded a lot and I was like cool, whatever.

Dude followed up continuously until I received package and sent me stuff above what he promised totalling worth $200 which is a lot of money in my country. All original and brand new.

He seemed to be genuine and decent. Earlier he pleaded that if I take any legal action it could put a mark on his profile and impact his career. I didn't want to do that so I settled the case.

My inner conscience did not allow me to accept free stuff from him so I mailed him again asking for his details so I send him money. I cannot benefit at someone else's loss. He called and said he cannot accept money and this one was on him. He said everyone learns from their mistake (something which I mentioned in the email while settling the case). We spoke on personal level and added each other on Linkedin too.

Now, I really don't know whether it was him or someone else and the fact that someone tried to goof up is also true. However, this guy seems to be a nice person and I don't want him to be at loss.

488,"I lost a big client, this client is also sort of a friend. We went to college together and had some good times. We lost touch once he graduated and once I got this awesome job selling bugs, we were reconnected as he turned out to be a grower for a greenhouse that ended up being a client of mine. Things were great until end of October.

I got a call from my friend grower and we discussed how his temperatures are too low now so we should stop bringing in bugs. All fine, because I dont want to be wasting his money. This was end of October. 

The beginning of this week, I reached out to see what's happening in their greenhouse. The grower (my friend) failed to mention only half of their greenhouse is set for cooler temperatures and the other half is set warm enough for bugs. He then mentions that he stepped down in August from his position and now deals with just the bugs, but doesnt have the authority to purchase them. He must work together with the new grower. The new grower has his own friend that works for our competitor and has completely moved their sales over to them, the competitors also gave them way better costs for the exact same products we sell. My friend will not disclose the cost they are getting their bugs act.

I had tried to pitch my friend a couple ideas for their issues in the warm section that would work better, but even he refused to listen and was skeptical now. I am diving my head into research to prove I am not just talking out of my ass here and that there is research to prove my points.

I have worked for my boss for a year now. I am over loaded with other clients and work, literally doing a 2 person job. I am so overwhelmed by this task and feel like a big failure already.

My boss is also not the best. I know for a fact if I bring this up to him he will repeatedly tell me I am not doing enough and i need to do better. Hell I might even lose my job over this, although I cannot see how he could afford to lose me as there is only 1 other girl on the team in our region (another is on maternity leave currently). My colleague and I both feel overwhelmed with work as were always asked to do side jobs that results in us falling behind our actual jobs. This company is well under staffed in all departments. 

 I simply want to ask my boss for a strategy we can use to get them back as our client, but I dont know how to bring it up to a boss that is so negative and ready to beat you down with harsh words. after a year of working my ass off and bringing in the 3rd highest sales in my department this year, he will most likely forget all the great things I did ever happened. I've had this happen to me with smaller issues I brought up to him before.

I have a lot of mental issues not to mention I'm also autistic and he is not aware of this because I know for a fact he would look at me and treat me differently. I work about 30 minutes away from the office. I've been stuck on either calling him or doing this in person.

They call me Logan Paul, dickhead, shout “waaayyy”, and hurl a seemingly limitless supply of eggs at me. I’ve only been hit once so their aim is dreadful, and I’m not too concerned about the consequences of being struck by an egg but my girlfriend is vegan and doesn’t like it. I also don’t want to have to change my usual route home from university to avoid walking past a gang of children. One time the little shits even threw eggs at a bus i was on and rode alongside on a scooter screaming and putting the finger up to me. I genuinely can’t walk two minutes to Sainsburys without fear of them throwing projeggtiles.

I realise it’s only a mild inconvenience but they know where my girlfriend’s flat is after seeing us walk in once and I’m actually  kinda concerned to leave after 3:30pm since they will be out of school and lurking around. Im thinking about buying my own arsenal of eggs for self defence but I also don’t wanna be “the guy who got caught throwing eggs at kids” or “the guy with eggy pockets”. What should I do about this whole situation?",26Nov2020,1
492,"i will be honest. i am cornered. years of depression, anxiety and ptsd fucked me up. i won't disclose much personal information, but i will say that things decline to a point where, after many attempts of recovery, i see either two choices: suicide or leaving everything behind and starting again, from scratch. 

i am not looking for counseling. to be fair, my mind is set, my plan is complete and any arguments would fall on deaf years, so please don't waste your breaths, i am too tired of this kind of discussion. i intend to kms in a few days. and although i've been pondering on the matter for more than a years, new doubts inevitably always find their way to my mind. 

i can only see myself reconsidering this decision if i leave everything behind. college, family, friends and city. i can't handle the social pressure people, society and my own mind of course have enforced on me through the years. therapy and medication didn't do me any good. 

i am 21. female. don't own a passport. have no experience whatsoever with work. roughly own 500 dollars. am in the middle of med school. don't drive. own no possessions. what would I need to leave everything and just travel around without a purpose or destination? how likely am i to succeed? i would know where to start if i choose this option. i am okay with waiting a few months because of covid and all, but I'd quit college either way. what would I need to do in the mean time to prepare myself? how could I survive if i took this path?

please, i only seek advice regarding ""my escape"", not looking for counseling. i just mentioned suicide so i can provide proper background regarding my currently situation. 

thanks.",26Nov2020,1
493,"Okay-so my brother M(24) is dating his partner F(22) and have been together for a little over a year. He stayed with me for a good 4 months with her at my apartment before he moved out. I had seen this girl at my high school but never talked to her. She immediately wanted, I guess, my “approval” so she was kissing my ass. She bought me expensive stuff for my birthday, always told my brother she wanted us to go do our nails together, inviting me to the movies, etc etc. Anyways-well one day she wakes up and HATES me. I’m talking about hatred. She doesn’t talk to me, she’s talking crap about me to her friends and tried to expose me. I had never had anything against this girl AT ALL. I never did anything foul to her. So this came as a shock to me, I told my brother about it and tried getting him to maybe talk to her about it. He tried and tried. She just never gave a solid answer on what I did. Throughout the relationship, she does nothing but constantly keep my brother from us, he can’t even talk to my pops, can’t have any females on his Facebook/social media. She checks his every movement. He can’t even watch porn in peace man. She spends her entire day on Facebook speaking horribly of my family and myself. 

she’s cheated on him about 3 times, hits him, calls the cops on him for no reason, emotionally abuses him, gas lights him, manipulates him, and everything else that comes with a toxic relationship. He has bad panic attacks and has already had more than a few while being with her. I was present with one of them and i was helping him calm down and pace his breathing, while I was doing that, his girlfriend was blowing up my phone saying she was stealing his money he had saved and is taking the car. I advised her of his situation and she didn’t care, just hung up. He suffers with depression and doesn’t really have no one but her and myself.

So Reddit, have y’all ever had a toxic relationship with your siblings SO? I have tried to get to him with everything, but I don’t want my brother ending his life over a female like this.",26Nov2020,1
494,"So backstory on me (f21) - I got anger issues which Ive been working on for years and have gotten pretty good at managing but it does come out when I feel attacked or unfairly treated so I am not good at distinguishing whether Im rightfully angry or if its just my anger flaring up for no particular reason. For the most part I dont let resentment grow or problems arise because I tend to want to communicate things before they become problems because as mentioned before once I get angry I get really bad at dealing with the issue.

Now for the conflict - I was out for a walk with two friends (one Lives alone, the other with her family and we only see each other every once in a while because of the pandemic but we dont see anyone else) when I said to one of them that she (Anna, f21) had ""the nervous energy of a chihuahua"" to which she responded that she resented that comparison ""because most people dont like chihuahuas and I dont wanna be the kind of Person most people dislike"" which I understood cause Anna had crippling social anxiety so I dropped it. But the other friend (Gina, f22) took offense with what Anna said.

Its important to mention here that Gina had a Chihuahua who died due to a faulty piece of furniture a few months after she got her.

I did not notice that she took offense with it because she did not sound angry nor looked the part (and she does this thing regularly which we have talked about on multiple occasions where she will passive aggressively smile and in a joking way remark about what was being said without really getting into it so that most people miss that shes mad about it and isnt just joking around) so I assumed that what was happening was banter. And Gina then accused Anna of hating Chihuahuas to which Anna replies that she likes Chihuahuas but other people dont. Gina replied with ""thats like people who say Im not racist but"" which I found to be ridiculous so I told her that that was a false equation and that she shouldnt use such a heavy Argument to make such a ridiculous point.

Gina then said that she was done talking to us and put in headphones and walked ahead of us. We had planner to walk to the River. When Gina hadnt spoken to us for about 6 or 7 Minutes we tried to approach her again because at that point we did not assume that she was actually mad at us. But she said to leave her alone. So I said to Anna that I thought it wa ridiculous that she was expecting us to follow her while she ignored us. So I texted her to take her time and that Anna and I hadnt come out to be put in such an uncomfortable position and that we would wait at the place where we had started out when she was ready to Talk.

She texted half an hour later to meet her by a different place where we met her, I tapped her leg lightly with my shoe which is something I always do (like a little love tap) which she later referred to as me kicking her in the shin.

I asked her to Talk she said that she did not want to and I said that I wished to Talk about it. I couldn't even finish a sentence before she snapped at me that I was talking down to her because she was sitting and I was standing which was just because she was already sitting on a bench and I thought it was more awkward to sit next to each other rather than face each other while talking this through. Then Gina said that Anna was being silent cause she was feeling awkward because of the way I was conducting myself. I informed Gina of the fact that Anna wasnt speaking because she didn't know how to approach this situation which she told me beforehand. Gina then said I should stop shouting at her and ran away. I turned to Anna who looked confused and for a moment I doubted whether I had gotten loud for a moment but Anna informed me that I had not gotten loud once during the interaction.

Anna is a very reliable and sweet and emotionally mature person she does not see the point in taking sides. So her perspective is actually the only one I trust between the three of us.

Anyway Anna reached out to Gina via text while we were sitting together. Gina only turned it down, accused me in the messages to her of trying to turn Anna against her and said that I was ""simply impossible"" and ""acting erratic and ridiculous"".

The point when she said she did not want to talk was the first moment that kindled my anger. The accusing me of shouting and running away made me mad. But the fact that she was trashing me in the messages towards Anna really enraged me.

I reached out to Gina a few days later to which she replied in a very condescending manner, saying she is ""so glad that I finally see what Anna wasnt getting"" and Anna told me that Gina had reached out to her the day before and had said she would only talk to me if I apologised.

Now I dont see a reason to apologise here tbh because I think that I was not doing anything wrong up until this point.

Now the point where my bullshit comes in was right after she answered me cause I said I wanna collect my things at her place right now. She asked me whether that was necessary and I said yes.
I rang the bell and was let in. I walked towards her room where I expected her to be cause nobody was in the hallway. But she wasnt there and stepped into the room about 2 seconds after me and got mad that I ""just walked into her room"" and that I had no right to do so which is actually more of a misunderstanding cause as it turned out it was her mom who had opened up and not her, for which I apologised later.

She gave me my things and I walked out. She followed it up with a bunch of passive aggressive messages which failed to get a rise out of me up until the point when she said ""trying to justify yourself is a real ugly color on you"" to which I replied that acting crazy was a real ugly color on her and apologised about 20 minutes later cause I realised that that was unnecessarily cruel.

Now we might have another conversation on this but I dont know how to approach this properly and whether I might be acting like the asshole actually.",26Nov2020,1
495,"So since the start of this year I have put on a couple of stone and gone from a reasonable weight to overweight. It bothers me particularly because at the start of this year I had no stretch marks, but now both my entire thighs are completely covered with them - literally.

But what is the point of getting in shape? My partner doesn’t care about me gaining weight and still likes me just as much and will probably like me even if I gain a few more stone, so I don’t feel a need to improve myself for him. 

I’ve always hated my body and I expected myself to continue to hate it no matter what weight I was, so this new found hate is nothing new to motivate me.

I’ve had depression and other mental illnesses for a long time, so most days I struggle to see a point in getting out of bed - so what’s the point in trying to lose weight?

Other people already judge me for everything else about myself - the things I like, my face, my sexuality, my gender - so it doesn’t motivate me to exercise for other peoples opinion.

I don’t care that being overweight might kill me. I already want to die and have tried to kill myself a number of times, so my own declining health won’t motivate me.

But I know that I do care. I cry when I see my legs in the shower. I cry every time I eat - though I still eat shit anyway. I want things to change, but this is just one more shit things in an endless list of things that are shit and have always been shit. I know I’m complaining and I know that I have to be the one to make things change, but it’s too much and it’s too hard and I’m a whiny bitch.

There’s a lot of things in my life that are shit and most of them I genuinely cannot do anything about - but my weight was one of the few things I had control over and now I’ve lost it.

So what I’m kind of asking is, if you have ever been in ‘the pits’ like this as my therapist likes to describe it - what was it that helped you pull yourself out? And what advice would you give me to making the first steps toward pulling myself together? Tough love or even just yelling at me would actually be helpful.",26Nov2020,1
496,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

498,"It's just me and my dog today. Positive is, there's a virus and I'll be doing my part in not spreading it. I still can't help but feel lonely. My pregnant ex is ignoring me even after all she's done (If you want to know that back story, feel free to read my posts). I did exactly what you guys told me not to do. I bought her flowers and took her to dinner. I have the baby's best interest in mind and just want to see if I'm missing something there I could do different. I have no back up as far as her family goes, as far as I know. 

It made me think about my mother a lot. If I'd get into arguments with my other ex's she'd sit us both down and hear both sides. She knew me so well and of course wouldn't always take my side. I hated it at the time but it made me a better and more understanding man. I didn't know it at the time but maybe she seen my biological father in me and knew how to deal with it. Long story short, after my mother passed I found out my current father wasn't my biological father. 

My current ex's mother didn't have guardianship over her. Every time we were around her she reminded her in some fashion. Every time she did it, it made me feel awkward. Because she's a nice person and even reminded me of my grandmother a bit. The problem now is, I've noticed she takes her side and enables her hard core. She knows my ex owes the IRS 5k and will owe 5k more this tax season. She is making a purchase of 8k now on something she doesn't need and said she doesn't see the issue with it. Aside from that the ""purchase"" is an exotic animal that will need a lot of care. Yet, she still doesn't say anything. This made my ex feel so justified. She shoved the phone in my face after I asked her to get her mothers advice and she said ""see even my mom thinks I should do it"".

I wish my mom was here to tell me what to do. I try not to think of her because the last time I seen her was something I wouldn't like to remember. I realized I blocked it out if my mind for a couple of years until recent when I thought about her more. I imagine her last seconds and forgot that I even went through that. I just know my mother would tell me something that would just make sense. 

So I'm asking you guys, what should I do, to maybe better myself. She's 3 months pregnant and I feel that before she can work on herself, I can work on myself to help her. I believe she's pushing me away and saying horrible things to me because she's just not addressing her past. I work out because I have Crohns and need to stay healthy and plan on going to therapy. But what am I missing?",26Nov2020,1
499,"Hold on! Before you scroll down thinking this post to be just another piece of garbage trying to garner up-votes and comments, stop scrolling and start reading further. Still here? Good. Because I'm in serious trouble. At least I think I am. As you can see that this is a spam account created solely to ask for advice on this matter of mine, as I'm too ashamed to post this on my main. 

I'm a boy(17 M), will soon be 18 in December. Got myself into MIT, parents were proud(I guess they still are), and life was perfect until now. Elisabet(17 F) has been my best friend for 9 years now, and Emilia(17 F) has been her sibling for 17 years. I am not that close to Emilia the way I am close to Lis. So I've been a socially awkward person for the majority of my life. I have Asperger's Syndrome. It means that no matter how good I am at cracking jokes or making witty banter in the virtual world, I will always struggle with interacting and assimilating with people where it truly matters. It narrows down my focus to an impressive extent though. The fact that Lis and I hit it off so good is nothing short of a miracle.

Lis has always been trying to get me out of my shell, and I feel thankful towards her for it. 31st October, 2020, Emilia was invited to a ""party"". Lis encouraged me to go with her sister, as she wanted Emilia and me to bond. I was to serve as her chaperone as Emilia has always been a handful. Despite my initial reluctance, and failed attempts at convincing Lis to go in my stead, I got pumped up enough for this entire ordeal, as I had never been to any sort of a party before. Emilia was excited to go with me too. If I had only known why.

So, when we arrived at the ""Spook-Tober Party"", I was overwhelmed. However, as time passed, I adapted. Jumping straight to the point, there were drinks at the party. Beer, Wine, Vodka, and whatnot. I know I'm 17, not 21, and therefore not legally old enough to drink. But guess what, I was feeling rebellious that night and thought, ""Why not ?"". Technically it takes only a 0.04% concentration of saturated alcohol in your bloodstream to start making you feel tipsy. Like a more relaxed demeanor, combined with a slight loss in grip over your body balance and rational thoughts in mind. And I downed three bottles that night under an hour. God, what was I thinking? Or maybe the fact that I wasn't thinking at all. Things moved pretty fast, and that's when all hell broke loose.

I don't remember how it all started, just remember that it did happen. Emilia and I, to be speaking bluntly, were having unprotected sex in the bathroom. And to be honest, it felt really good and liberating, which makes me feel even more horrible about the entire incident(accident). And there was also a lot of puking. I lost my sobriety and virginity of 17 years all in one night. I walked all the way back home very early in the next morning, and received the biggest scolding of my life from my parents. I deserved that. All of this would have been of, relatively speaking, lesser consequence had there not been another disaster.

No, there was no video made of us two, nor have there been any rumors. I miraculously came out quite clean in this matter. The thing is Elisabet asked me out yesterday. She has confessed that she likes me. Like, ""likes me likes me"". I told her to give me some time to think about it. And now I'm really nervous. I would really like to be with her, but given the circumstances we are under, she totally deserves to know the truth. I think I should come clean to her and then let her decide whether she really wants this between us. I'm scared. Of telling her the truth. Of it's consequences. And the fact that it might dissolve our friendship. Not to forget to mention that things will get real awkward among the three of us. And I don't want to be that ""guy"", over whom those two might fight. A person like me doesn't have the right to get that level of attention, bluntly stating. In fact, no one does. No stranger is worth fighting over if it strains your relationship with your family.

I know that there are no easy answers, and that I have to tell her the truth of the matter, even if I get or don't get to be with her. I'm truly impressed that you have bore with this post this long till now, and I understand if all of this sounds quite like a cliche, and lies to you. But if you really think that I'm a genuine case, then please do help. I'll need as much as I can of it. If I could just get some pointers on what I should do with the least amount of collateral damage possible, then I'd be super grateful.

I was dating a boy for 10 months until one day he blocked me and said he needed a break. He came back after a month but then broke up with me, we still talk and sometimes he’s cold towards me and sometimes he’s not. I don’t understand he went from telling me that he loves me to ignoring me when he would never do anything like that in the relationship. 
He told me that he’s confused about his feelings, the day he came back he told me that I’m important to him and he enjoyed talking to me. The next day he texted me and we talked again but the day after that he started ignoring me. I don’t know what he wants he’s just confusing me. Last night he wanted to FaceTime and we were texting when I was finally ready he ignored my message and never texted back. I was asking him questions  over text about our relationship to understand what happened. I told him that I can just ask him the questions on ft but he told me “no after  you ask the questions we can ft” I don’t get it, he won’t even talk to me about the situation over FaceTime. He seems so different now I don’t know if he’s going through things but I know that he did not have such a great life when he was younger.

They’re like 9 and 12 I think, (Family estranged) and I haven’t met my sister or them in like 10 years.

The falling out was regarding my sis marrying into not much wealth so it’s a sensitive matter. I don’t know much about her family since this happened when I was like 8-9, I thought they’d be middle class but with reconnecting it seems more they live in a fancy Aussie suburb.

I got my 13 yr old brother an iPad and was thinking of getting them the same, but then a friend of mine advised me to reconsider because of my sister’s fights with parents regarding them trying to control with their money/show off and stuff along those lines.

I’m not sure what budget I should go for or what I should get them. Any advise would be appreciated, I’m afraid to offend them by bringing super expensive gifts. Is it good to go with them or if anyone suggests something else or a price range it would be super helpful!",26Nov2020,1
512,"For some background, I’ll try to quickly explain what led up to it. My mom (42F) got into a messy situation where she took a job from her childhood best friend and by extension my sister (17F) and I (19F) were also given jobs months after my mom started working. We moved states and we knew absolutely nobody aside from her. I got fired at the end of May and wasn’t told until late July (kept on schedule so I couldn’t collect unemployment because she needed a loan for her business). My sister put in her 2 weeks ago because my mom’s friend told her she would never do anything with her life while at work. My mom got into an argument over a different thing, but my mom brought up her treatment of my sister and myself. She then cut my sister’s remaining hours from 30 to 6. My mom then made a snarky comment how she would never treat her kids like that. 

And then my mom woke up to start cooking our Thanksgiving and received a text saying she was fired. She asked why and wasn’t given a response. I am panicking because I know I should have told my mom not to defend me and now it’s cost her her job. I’m worried she isn’t going to find a job as stable as the one she took. I’m worried we won’t be able recover from this situation. I’m worried about anything and everything right now. I can’t help but think this is my fault.

I'm very shy, so I don't talk to people a lot to begin with and sometimes friendships just end without me knowing the reason behind it, or by just having no contact in a long time. I then wake up all sad (I'm usually sad to begin with lol) and I keep thinking about them for like at least a week.

And sometimes I don't even have any contact info to communicate with them irl. Also, I technically have 3 friends who I talk to and my boyfriend. So I get lonely a lot (I can't bother my bf with everything that's on my mind 24/7, it really is A LOT, and even if I do, sharing this with someone else who doesn't have this problem doesn't solve it either because he doesn't know what to do)

516,"After 8 years of dating, I married my girlfriend.  A year later we had a baby and she started suffering from post partum depression.  Her mom and I encouraged therapy, but she refused.  She became increasingly angry and strangely forgetful, often genuinely misremembering small things.  Over time the anger worsen and she started to go to therapy.  She also started having problems with cluster headaches.  She was convinced to go to a neurologist who after doing an MRI asked if she ever had a head injury like from a car accident.  She doesn't remember one and neither does her family.  But the doctor was sure there was some sinus damage indicative of a head injury.  Fast forward two years and the anger and misremembering caused many fights and she decided to leave.  I was fed up too, and didn't fight it.  Because of covid she hasn't moved out, but has become increasingly paranoid, even more angry, and even more misremembering of things.

Long story:
My boyfriend is in a tight spot lately financially. I don't expect him to give me anything fancy but at least a handwritten card or something would have been nice. I have made and given him many gifts(many of which cost $0) and besides that thought up and Googled many free fun dates. He came over last night and today we made a plan that each of us would plan we spent some time sharing our favorite comics and leaving sticky notes for others at parts that were meaningful to us.

The next day, when he was supposed to have something planned, he simply asked what I wanted to do. We ended up going on a walk in my favorite park but only by my suggestion.

520,"TW: mention of pregnancy/termination


/
/
/
/


I recently found out that I am pregnant to a partner of only two months (officially). I don’t want a baby, nor have I ever really wanted a baby. 

Partner does not live locally to me (40 minute drive away) and lives at home with parents, whereas I live on my own and pay rent. He has a job wherein they are usually only offering him 10 hours per week - this is not a stable job. He is aware that I’ve got a late period, and told his mother of the situation. 

I am leaning towards potentially getting a termination because I cannot see how having a baby at this time in my life is viable, or a good option for my current circumstances. I often end the month with no spare money at all, and will often scrimp and scrape to get by. 

I don’t know if I should tell him. I am worried that he will try to convince me to not get a termination, however, I feel as though that is probably the best option for me. As his family are also aware, I’m concerned they will also try to influence/alter any decisions made. 

I also don’t know whether I should tell my friends or family of the situation. Again, I am worried that people will judge me or try to change my mind. 

Please don’t write anything negative regarding opinions on termination of pregnancy, that isn’t what I want to discuss here.",26Nov2020,1

522,"A guy friend and I (F) were texting on messenger and I reacted with a raised brow emoji to something that he said because I was a bit confused as to what he meant and didn't know how to respond. 

He later clarified what he meant and said that he found the emoji kinda weird/funny-looking. Then, in the spur of the moment, I said ""no it looks better on apple HAHAHA, the android/fb emoji version looks sus af"". (emojis show up differently on apple and android phones btw and he uses an android phone). He then said ""wym it looks pre legit"" with a screenshot of the chat so I could see. And I said ""wait you're right, thought it looked different for some reason"" (In reality though, when I said better I meant it did a better job of conveying what I meant and when I said sus I was referring to the facial expression on the emoji, not android emojis in general, though I didn't clarify this). He didn't open my text after this and has left me on delivered for three days (he always used to open texts and respond within a few hours). 

For a bit of context, we met each other online and have only known each other for 8 months but have been texting pretty much every day up until recently. He's a nice guy from what I know and leaving a friend on delivered for a lengthy period of time doesn't seem like something he'll do. I was wondering if what I said could have potentially been interpreted by him as being offensive and if I should apologize to him?

524,"So I (18f) recently started working at a new job. Sometimes I have to go in the back of the kitchen to clean something and I often see a cute guy there that works at the cafe that is connected to the building I work in. I was taken by surprise one day because as I was cleaning something in the kitchen he came up to me and asked me a random question that seemed irrelevant and like he just wanted to start a convo with me. What’s even more surprising is he called my name and pronounced it correctly. I have a name that is hard to pronounce so I was so taken aback that he said it right and it was odd because I was turned away so I didn’t know he could see my nametag. I answered the question and he walked away. Later that day my manager told me some guys from the cafe wanted to know who the new girl was, meaning me, and she told them my name. So now it makes sense why he knows my name and how to pronounce it, so that makes me wonder if he was the once who asked who I was? And maybe he asked a question just to talk to me? Which makes me think he thinks I’m cute and wants to get to know me? How should I approach him next time I see him, or should I let him approach me? I am really awkward and have social anxiety so I don’t want to mess this up. I feel like he was trying to start a convo with me and I messed it up by answering his question literally and maybe he thinks I’m not interested now? I don’t know, I just need some advice.

I just got back from college and was not aware what we would be doing for Thanksgiving I originally thought we would be doing nothing since you know there’s a deadly virus going around. My brothers who understand the severity of this virus are still going to the party regardless.

However, if both of my brothers go and contract it when they come home they are just going to spread it to me. We use the same shower, sink, and everything so if they get it at the party it will definitely transfer to me. There is no way I can talk them out of it since they are both much older than me and I am young and know nothing.

549,"Hello! I'm on a throwaway account as I do have a feeling that some people IRL may know I have reddit so to keep myself anonymous, I'll be using this. I apologise if I seem vague with some things, I struggle to explain things well too. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm 17 and go to college (2nd year now  and doing a different course to what I had done last year) and recently I had taken up an IT course as I want to become an IT technician in the future. That ain't really relevant to the story. But anyway, most people on my course are males and all know and play some videogames, such as League of Legends and some other in that area. 

FYI, I and my friend are the only females on the course. 

This is my 3rd month on the course and I had managed to make two friends but thanks to some past experiences, I am really bloody anxious about communicating with them without feeling like I'm bothering them or making myself seem annoying as hell. 

The first experience I had was with a toxic friend who was mentally and physically abusive, they'd constantly criticise EVERYTHING I done, hit me and be a dickhead in general. She would be hella controlling and would never take no as an answer. My dad hates her right now as recently she got me to come over to her house (DESPITE TELLING ME NOBODY WAS SICK) and what do I find out? Someone was sick. Luckily it wasn't COVID, but I was hella pissed off with her. 

The reason why I didn't ditch her was because I suck at making friends and the moment I make friends, I get really attached. I find it really hard to let go off people especially if they've helped me a lot over the years. 

The second experience was basically my fault but did leave some trauma from it. This is kinda the main reason why I am afraid to speak to guys. So I met this one person online in 2018 and basically we had became good friends at first, we'd speak to each other almost daily, call every weekend to record a youtube video and there wasn't many isssues going on.

So that almost ruined this friendship was my anxiety. I kept overthinking so much to the point I began venting to my friend almost every day. It started messing up their mental helath (they're okay now) and my mental health too was getting worse as I literally had nowhere else to go to. People at school at that point were shit with mental health things and I had too much family shit to deal with so the only outlets I had to talk to were my best friend and the guy. 

Didn't help that I kinda had a crush on them. But that soon stopped. &gt;-&lt;

I basically depended on them for help. 

Anyway, that aside, we ended up getting into an argument a couple of months later because I kept complaining a lot. And I did deserve it as I needed to get actual help. I started talking to Childline and Kooth (two crisis helplines I use to use and they helped a lot). After talking with them, me and the guy slowly stopped talking until a few months later where we both apologised for our behaviour and promise to be more honest with each other and seek proper help.

The third experience is kinda combined as these two people fall into the same category, but two assholes decided to use me and make me their personal therapist. Before anyone says anything, I do know how to say no to people and tell them to back off, dw. I've learnt a lot from this. 

Every week I'd message them asking if they're okay and they'd never listen to my advice. They'd constantly weigh their issues on me. This severely affected my mental health a lot as I knew they were faking it and so many others knew too. I did manage to cut them off too.

Thanks to these experiences, I became a lot quieter and never helped myself. I never voiced my own opinions and never had been listened to. I became afraid to talk about my own issues in fear I wouldn't be understood or get the usual ""I don't know how to help"" response and get blanked.

So history lesson over and time for present day.

After talking to these two new friends, I had started to feel more confident and heard. They were so god damn nice to me. One of witch taught me how to play one of the games they play! \^-\^

However... there is one problem.

I feel really uncomfortable and awkward to talk about this so... please be easy on me. But I do like one of them. Despite knowing him for like 3 months, I have started talking to him a little bit but not as much as usual people would. I don't have much knowledge on games or things he may be interested in. This is usually the point when whenever I'm in class, I sometimes engage in convo, but always go quiet a few moments later after the convo started as I have no idea what to say.

He's seen my art lately and has requested a few drawings, which I have done, and I feel like I may be making things a bit weird. 

I feel like I should slowly stop talking to him a little bit just to back away as I'm usually the person who sometimes engages in conversation, but lately he has been doing it irl but not really on snapchat. (Only way we talk unless it's on discord to play Among us or another game.)

Whenever I see him in a voice channel on discord, I'm usually a bit afraid to join the call in case I'm annoying him. Despite him saying (after I asked if I could join a few days ago) that I don't need to ask and that I was always welcome. 

I do want to ask to call him to explain a few things, but I'm just... scared.  
There are times I have messaged and got no response. Which makes me needing to go to snapchat to get a response. He does talk a lot and is deffo an extravert but I don't know... 

I don't know what to do. 

Should I slowly stop talking to him? Should I try and find new things to talk to him about? Like I have no trouble speaking to my female friend, but when it comes to talkign to him I legit just go so fucking quiet and forget how to communicate lmao.

I feel like im giving up everything I know, everything I have, all my friends, experiences, I cant leave them behind because I feel like i should still be in them. Im lucky to have a life like this and I dont want to have to start over by myself. 

whats making it worse is that I have absolutely no idea what I want to do in my life. Dont know what job. Dont even know which college. Dont know where in the world I want to live. Dont rlly have specific goals yet. And I have an anxiety disorder! Im worried Ill have no friends in the future, I worry about things like getting trafficked/raped, I worry about things like having kids and my kid has cancer or something. I cant deal with all the possibilities. I worry daily about my future and Im turning to substances to try and cope/forget because im also getting su*c*dal thots(but no intention to act on them) maybe i should see a therapist but i dont want the truth to come out because then everyone will know.

Any advice is helpful.",26Nov2020,1
555," 2.5 years ago, ocd was telling me to return home in order to get paper napkins. I did not want to do it so, I tried to make a promise to Chrirstian God about not returning home to get paper napkins. I made the promise in order to force myself not do the compulsion. I tried to cancel the promise but I am not sure if it was canceled. What if other Gods accepted it in case Christian God is not real?

 Today, I was going home after going for a walk. I was worrying not to think about napkins because I was worrying what if it looks like as if I am breaking the promise just, because the thought of napkins are popping up in my head without my will? 

 While i was entering home, I tried not to think the napkins and tried to change the thoughts by thinking something else. For a half second, due to worry, the thought about napkins popped up strongly in my head.

 did I broke the promise? what if it looked like as if I returned home to get napkins just, because when I was entering my home, the thought napkin popped up strongly for a half second? what if just by thinking about it for a half second, even accidenatally, broke the promise?

 the promise was about not returning home to get paper napkins.

 and I went home in order to stay and continue my night but due to ocd, accidentally, the thought of napkins popped up as I was entering the house. Is it broken?",26Nov2020,1
556,"Context: I’m a college student living in an off campus apartment. My father gave me money “so I don’t have to work, and can focus fully on school”

I want to work part time, not only for grocery money but for fuck you money. I game, so I feel bad about using his cash for my own hobbies, but the man literally doesn’t want me to work. He constantly says that he wants me to focus entirely on school, which I appreciate, but he doesn’t understand that a ton of students work part time.

Another issue is that he has a problem with my budgeting. My father gave me a lump sum of cash before I left and I ran out right before this holiday. The thing is I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN. He doesn’t understand that I don’t only have groceries to buy. I’m in college and I have a social life so a portion of my money goes to food and fun. Not only that but books and park ran my pockets this year as well.

The reason I’m so frustrated by the situation is that this would not be an issue at all if he simply let me work. I could’ve earned 2x the money he gave me if he let me work, and I wouldn’t have to argue with him about the way I’d be using my own cash. It’s to the point now where I want to just tell him I’m going to work next semester regardless of his opinion. I’m a grown ass man and I’m sick of being under his dollar when I never even asked for any money. He literally forced his money on me. I didn’t ask for this, and I think I’m going to put an end to it tonight. 

What do y’all think I should do? Am I justified to be upset? I know this sounds super privileged but that’s just the reality of the situation. I’m very thankful that he gave me the cash but he’s causing me more worries than helping.",26Nov2020,1
557,"**Backstory:** 

A little over a year ago my best friend passed away after being in a car accident. Shortly after his passing we discovered that the woman he was (casually-ish) seeing was pregnant. The woman, being at the start of her career and decently young had no interest/desire to be a parent. Given the fact that she ''didn't believe in abortion'' (her words, not mine) adoption was the only option. I understood and respected that, until I discovered that she had no desire to put any effort towards finding a suitable family, she was planning on ''just handing her over to the system and let them figure it out''. I couldn't in good conscience allow an innocent baby be handed over to a horrible system, especially not the baby my best friend dreamt about having for as long as I can remember, all he wanted was to be a dad. So, I decided to foster the baby and find a suitable adoptive family myself. 

Towards the end of her pregnancy (at this point the paperwork was drafted but not signed) the biological mother changed her mind and decided that she would keep the baby. I respected this decision and said that given the fact that her dad (my best friend) couldn't be around, I would gladly step up and help where needed. Fast forward to the baby being born, she was born healthy , everything was great. On day 4 the biological mother called me asking if I could mind the baby for a couple of hours so she could catch up on some sleep. Having had kids myself I understood that she was having a rough time and happily obliged. She left the little girl at my house with enough formula for 1 bottle and roughly 3 diapers and a couple of hours turned in to a couple of days. I was relentless in trying to reach her but no one knew where she was, so eventually I got police involved, they tracked her down at which point she signed her daughter over to me. After a couple of weeks I realised that I could never hand this little girl over to another family and finalised the adoption myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Current ''problem''**

Very recently the biological mother contacted me, asking me to be involved in my daughters life on a regular basis. Now, I'm unsure on what to do. 

Given how she acted during her pregnancy (not caring about where she ended up) and how she acted ''abandoning'' her like that, I don't believe she would be the most stable person in her life, let along be a positive addition. That leaves me inclined to decline this request. I am conflicted, and this is why; 

Who am I to refuse a ''biological'' mother acces to her child. Would I be harming my daughter by declining her biomom acces? Before adopting I told myself that when my daughter is old enough to want to meet her biomom and decide she wants to do so, I would do anything in my power to make that happen, but it's not like I can discuss this with my daughter right now. 

But, above is directly countered by the fact that I am, in every way but the biological way, her mother. My daughter isn't lacking or wanting for a family,  she has one. I am also very doubtful of the fact that her biomum is here to stay or will add to her life in any way. When I asked her as to why she's contacting me now, almost a year later, she said ''because it's my kid and I get to decide whatever I want whenever I want'', on top of that she threatened to have the adoption ''annulled'' if I didn't oblige. (Obviously, legally speaking she doesn't have a leg to stand on). 

So, do I allow her biological mom regular visitations so they can ''bond'' as the baby grows up, assuming the biomom keeps showing up or do I stick to my original plan and let my daughter decide on when/how/if she wants to meet her biological mother when she is ready? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR, biomom wants to meet my daughter after being irresponsible during pregnancy/after birth, is threatening me if I don't oblige.",26Nov2020,1

562,"2 sides to every story, right? Here’s my side. 

Been dating for 3 years. I asked her to move in 1.5 years ago in a 2 BR apartment. I fully acknowledge and admit that the relationship, while not terrible, lacked any real meaning; I should have ended this relationship a long time ago. As this year stressed everyone out, I lost 20 lbs, built a PC, and designed my 1st game. All of which was resented by her. She doesn’t do a lot at home other than FB and coloring on a tablet. 

She’s not what you call a smart woman. I say this not in a mean way, she’s just.. different. It’s why I took to her; not vindictive, not mean, just simple to please. Convenient. 

But in 3 years, I realized I’ve never had a real, actual conversation with her. I finally grew some balls and decided to rip this band aid off. Again, this is MY fault I’m in this mess. 

That said, I carefully prepared a statement and expected to crush her. I did. She was devastated 3.5 weeks ago when I told her I just want to be friends. I didn’t want to do anything rash, no one has to move out (her 12-year old also lives here 50% of the time). 

So devastated, that she was downright crazy. After wailing (by definition, she ugly cried for almost an hour straight), she started randomly storming through the house, yelling, pushing things around, and slamming. She tells her kid “we gotta find a place to live now!” (See above, I said the opposite), and forced me to leave the apartment so the cops don’t show up. She blocked the way out, not wanting me to leave, despite screaming.

She filled both my regular phone and work phones voicemails; over *sixty* 20-30 seconds long apiece the first night. 

When I returned the next day after work, she denies that the voicemails are a mistake; it’s my fault for not answering. 

She refuses to let me sleep on the couch without the door between us being WIDE OPEN. Simultaneously, she complains about noise I make. 

She instigates countless minor confrontations, yet denies the reason why.

She denies all wrongdoing for anything, and asks why I hate her. When I explain the reasons why I break up, she asks what the reasons are. It’s maddening! 

Now before you finish this picture of a abusive partner that is gaslighting: Please understand, she’s.. different. 

She is not a vindictive person. She is being petty, SO petty, to lash out at her frustrations, but she doesn’t know *why*. 

During our arguments she wanted to get her photos out of my computer monitor. I said the photos are in my computer. She angrily points at my old monitor: “The photos are in THAT thing”. 

Now, everyone makes mistakes, right? I don’t judge people on things like that. What I DO judge, is woeful ignorance. She won’t take my word on anything, including on where her photos are. She’s convinced I’m seeing someone at all times, when I flat out state I don’t want to be in a relationship anymore. 

I’ve tried explaining things: I’m 38, she’s 39. Did that surprise you? Yeah; not my first breakup. For her? I don’t think she’s ever been loved by anyone. 

While this is terribly sad, I can’t overstate how stressed and frustrating living here is. I can’t move out on a dime, so I’m trying to set boundaries to live together for a while. But she does not respect ANY of them. She instigates, I get more and more direct, and she starts crying, and doing random angry things, like a child. She then forgets anything that was said, and denies all wrongdoing. 

Oh, and she’s suddenly now a Covid denier. She went out to the bars to get drunk, and texted me 42 times when she came back to an empty apartment. Our State is on the news for most new cases. 

I know this has been rambling a bit. It’s a lot to explain. I don’t know what I’m truly dealing with here: She just sits around and waits to comment on something I’m doing; I feel pressured at ALL times at home. I can’t wait to get the fuck out of here and sleep in my own bed again. But as for advice? I could really use some for how to deal with this mentality.. Maybe someone else has dealt with this.",26Nov2020,1
563,"I'm a senior in high school and my teacher gives us these weekly google form surveys where they check up on us. Basically just a Q&amp;A on distance learning and a homework assignment where they assign us to make food. We do have some freedom in the sense we can choose what we make but it has to fit in the topic they chose us, like next week we're expected to make a Thanksgiving dish and a picture of us making it and the dish itself on the assignment. I'm aware they assign these for us to have fun, but frankly I just can't seem to fathom why we're having homework assignments where we make food for an English class. If the activity were to help us better understand whatever we're learning in class, I would most definitely do it without complaints. But it really doesn't and in the end it takes more time than my work from other classes and it even costs me money since whatever she assigns us to make, we don't eat in our household, so we have to go out and buy ingredients for a dish my family nor I will finish eating. I've already sent an email before asking if she could choose a different fun activity like drawing, that wouldn't cost money or too much time out of the weekend, she replied nicely but didn't hear my suggestions. I've once asked her if I could opt out and instead write a page of research about a certain dish, and she didn't reply to my email until I gave and replied back to my original email stating I'd just do it. 
I want to email her and firmly state why I think this assignment is unfair for the reasons I stated above but I'm not sure if its rude. If she can't do that, I'd be happy to compromise and maybe make a system where if a student does do it they get extra points or just assigning us anything else other than cooking.",26Nov2020,1

Lately, things haven’t really been looking good for my mum’s job. It didn’t pay much to begin with, but with covid it pays even less and even though the government said they’d pay 70% of it she’s only gotten payed that once.
She might get laid off, or the company itself might just crumble and fall. We don’t know. She’s contacted a job recruiter and he told her she’s has a really good chance to get a job (she wants a job in Ireland or Germany, since Spain, where we live, only has full time jobs that pay 700-800 monthly and most of them are split times, like 8:00-12:00 and 16:00-20:00.)

I grew up looking after my younger cousins but i had to leave for university. Ive returned early and im studying remotely because theres divorce and abuse happening in my family and i want to be here to help.

My younger cousin has always kept to himself due to his autism,, this also makes him impressionable sadly. He's been bullied alot and im concerned that the bullying alongside his parents divorcing has allowed people with bad intentions to indoctrinate him. I've been away for 2.5 years studying so sadly im not as close to him as i once was, but i know he has a good heart and i dont want to see my aunt have to take on the idea her kid might have fascist beliefs and also get rid of her abusive husband. So i want to try and approach him about this.

My reasons for believing it arent the most solid but they still worry me. So far its:

\- A discord profile picture of Oswald Mosley (A british fascist) alongside a british flag emoji and the number 37 as roman numerals as his description.

\-part of a group on steam dedicated to Theodore j. kaczynski (the unabomber)

\-a steam info that reads ""shoutout to mfed the ni\*\*a a real homie innit fam. The industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life expectancy of those of us who live in ""advanced"" countries, but they have destabilised society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities."" (it continues but you get the point)

\-Lastly, most worryingly he went on a trip to see Auschwitz with his class a few months ago. I asked my aunt about it and she said ""oh he enjoyed it but he expressed some very,,,, interesting,,, views when we talked about it"" .. she refused to talk about it further.

I dont know what to do with all this, i dont know if its just him being an edgy zoomer and its all a joke. I'm seeing on his discord he's listening to god save the queen on a loop for fucks sake???? thats not normal for a teen right?

I met a guy(there’s always a guy ha ha :)) we became really close freinds he was dating someone at the time and broke up a lil later. our friendship became closer as a result and boundaries may have shifted (kissing and exchange of I love yous) but there was no proper label. It was kind of in the beginning stages and then later I find out he slept with someone else so I decided we should just remain freinds and not anything more. He pursued me for a while wanting to properly date, I refused because I couldn’t trust him. It’s been a year now and we’ve been a habitual friendship. I say habitual because it feels like a daily habit. We call each other everyday in the morning, sometimes he calls, sometimes I do. A lot of times our conversations are about nothing and sometimes they’re engaging. 

I’ve been getting frustrated lately because he will call me but then seems distracted during the call when he’s the one who called. And today he told me he’s starting to talk to someone and has been going out on a few dates just getting to know her. I don’t feel jealous romantically, but I feel like a freind that’s just been kept aside for the time being and it’s not a nice feeling I guess. I’ve lost a few childhood friends before and I guess maybe it’s that? But I also see him as my favourite person so I may be too attached as well. 

I’ve been feeling extremely anxious throughout the day and sometimes also feel really low. He doesn’t text me or call me as often and I guess I just need to get used to it but it’s really hard to transition. 

I’d love any advice on what I should do so I can still be a great friend without being fake. I want to genuinely feel happy for him and be happy for myself and love life without feeling anxious or depressed or lonely.

In 8th grade I got a crush on her. And I got really anxious talking to her. I once asked her something about a class test and it was awkward I tell you. This crush passed away for some time.

Then in 9th grade I found her pretty attractive and it evolved into a crush again. I asked her via snapchat on a date. She said no. After that my crush on her kind of passed away again.

So now in 10th grade I see all the beautiful girls. But somehow I have a crush on that girl again. The difference is that I got very confident and productive. I don't know if I am right, but I sense a bit of attraction of her to me. I don't know if I am wrong and I don't want to embarrass myself.

I started leaving her on delivered, she never did that to me and I looked at her snaps all at once. Now after doing that for some time, she started leaving me on delivered.

585,"Someone has got in touch with me on my main Reddit account to buy a limited edition plushie. I'm in the UK and they're in the US, so we can't meet in person to exchange the goods and money. 

At first, I wanted to charge USD 25 plus shipping, but they were having difficulty saving up for the full amount, so I decided not to charge them for shipping.

Now, they wanted to pay half as a deposit and pay the other half when the parcel has arrived. Normally, the buyer pays for the full amount first before the seller ships the goods, especially since it's not too expensive.

I asked them if they have the full amount in hand and they said that they haven't had it yet. I suggested that they come back to me when they have the full amount in hand, and they agreed.

This may be unrelated, but the buyer's account was temporarily banned for some reason, but there's nothing too controversial on their profile. Should I be wary that they're a scammer?

599,"We’re both 21.
I got in contact with her over tinder and she seemed like an angel. We met on sunday, landed in the bed together but didn’t have sex, because it would be my first time.
She was honest about her lifestyle since the beginning, and I’m not that type of guy, but this girl is just different.
She‘s honest about everything, is independent, has the same humor as i have, we both have russian familys, but live in germany.
She‘s doing ballet for 13 years now and is planning to go to bigger places to work there. If there wasn’t the coronavirus, she would be working in London now, but got a 2 year contract at a theater in the town i live in.
She was moving from city to city several times because of the dancing schools and her work places, which lead to long-distance relationships and they broke apart everytime. This was the reason she decided to forget about relationships and chose this lifestyle.
The reason why i don‘t just end this and move on is her character. I was searching for a relationship since my last break up, which is 1,5 years ago, on Tinder, partys, bars and so on, but i have high expectations about how the girl i‘m giving all my affection should be, and i think i found *the* girl for me.
I know i‘m still young and my expectations will change and i will probably meet other girls that are maybe more fitting, but she just seems too perfect to not try to get her.
I stayed at her place the last two nights now, we had sex and stayed up for several hours just to get to know each other better and laugh about many things. We also met two more times just to walk through the city and spend time together.
She thinks, just as me, that we would be a perfect couple, and being with me is different than with the other guys she’s dating, because i actually don’t only want to fuck and leave, and i i think i give her ""love"" and affection, not just my dick. For example, she had her birthday yesterday and she didn’t want anything, but i bought her a few small things that (i don‘t want to praise myself) were pretty cute and showed that i was thinking about what would make her happy.
But she likes her current lifestyle to get more experience with men and sex and she‘s afraid, that she‘ll leave my town after 2 years and the relationship will break. I work as a programmer, so i could move to any place and work from there, but this wasn‘t really convincing for her.
I decided to have f+ with her for now, because i want to know her better, even if it‘s not going to be a relationship. I want to know this person more, like i would like to with a funny/interesting friend, because those people are very rare and i don’t want to loose her, just like i don’t want to loose a good friend.
Do you guys have any advice for me? If so, please give valid reasons and not just ""stop this she will hurt you anyway“. I know that this is possible, but i want to know if the risk is worth it, because at the moment, it feels like it is.

The text got really messy, because i inserted thoughts here and there to explain my thoughts and the situation better, but thank you for reading this, it‘s relieving to just let this out.
And i want to apologize for mistakes in the text if there are any.",26Nov2020,1

# What should I do about my crush?

I know my crush for a long time. She is in my class since 5th grade. I am now in 10th grade.

In 8th grade I got a crush on her. And I got really anxious talking to her. I once asked her something about a class test and it was awkward I tell you. This crush passed away for some time.

Then in 9th grade I found her pretty attractive and it evolved into a crush again. I asked her via snapchat on a date. She said no. After that my crush on her kind of passed away again.

So now in 10th grade I see all the beautiful girls. But somehow I have a crush on that girl again. The difference is that I got very confident and productive. I don't know if I am right, but I sense a bit of attraction of her to me. I don't know if I am wrong and I don't want to embarrass myself.

I started leaving her on delivered, she never did that to me and I looked at her snaps all at once. Now after doing that for some time, she started leaving me on delivered. This made it kind of a competition for me to get her as my girlfriend. I have a deep desire of reaching my goal, that is also important to mention. I can feel that deep desire of reaching my goal of being with her, when I think about her.

Do you have tips that make girls more attracted to you (without changing your character) or makes them want to ""chase"" you? I am 16 in a few months

So now what should I do? What would you do in my situation?",26Nov2020,1

605,"Context: My dog got out of the house because someone with our house keys opened the gate without noticing that our dog ran out. She is still missing as of this writing.

The house in front of mine has CCTV and we were able to get footage of when my dog was last seen. I didn’t ask when my dog was let out since I didn’t really want to see who opened the gate. I didn’t want to get into the blame game and I felt that I was also responsible for why this happened in the first place. 

Awhile ago, my neighbor messaged me saying that he had time to look through the cctv footage that night and happened to see the person who opened the gate and let my dog out. I didn’t really want to know but he already sent the video so I watched it.

It disgusted me.

Although the person’s back was to the camera, I could clearly see the build and frame of the person. I immediately knew who it was. He was walking towards our gate and was in front of it for awhile. He was like fiddling with the keys and after a few seconds, he finally got the gate open but stopped short of opening it. He stood in front of the gate for a good 10 seconds, and THEN stepped back, where my dog zoomed past him. He then entered the house and then left after a few seconds. Then the video stopped.

I wanted to cry. I could remember that time. The person who entered didn’t even make a sound nor did he let me know that my dog got out. He didn’t even call out to me that he entered. It was clearly intentional that he let that happen. 

His identity? My aunt’s husband.

I want to seek reparations for what he has done. If he didn’t do it intentionally, that would have been fine. I wouldn’t be posting this right now. But the footage clearly shows that he had every intention of neglecting to tell me that my dog got out.

I’m asking for advice on how to approach this situation. I say this because my aunt is the breadwinner of their family and if ever I would ask for payment or replacement for my dog, she would be the one to shoulder the expenses. But I also don’t want to say the wrong thing that could hurt her feelings. I love my aunt and she’s very sensitive when it comes to her husband because him and I don’t get along well.

I could also ask my mom to talk to them for me. My aunt and my mom are really close so I think that could help soften the blow?

Just a bit of info, we’re a very close family and live just a few houses from each other. They have keys to the gate of my house because they sometimes park their cars in my garage since I don’t use it.

My aunt and her husband also have a strained relationship but are still together because they have a kid and separation is a no-no because of our culture. I fear that this issue will cause more tension but I cannot let this issue past. I would understand if it was an accident but it clearly was not.",26Nov2020,1

Then, one day out of the blue, I just start thinking of another girl. I’ve known this girl forever and never had any romantic thoughts about her. But all of a sudden it’s all I want, it’s what I need. 

I try to not think about it for a while, and my anxiety skyrockets, I break up with my girlfriend, and my anxiety leads me to an even worse state of self-loathing. My confidence is at an all-time low. Months later, ex and I reconnect, and the love is still there. We start dating again. The relationship is better than it was before.  

Problem is, something still feels missing. I still think about this girl, and it fucks with me because it’s leaking into other areas of my life and I’m not as confident or as happy as I once was. Something is missing. I want to feel happier and more confident. I love my girlfriend. I don’t want to lose her again and she’s very supportive of me.

609,"My husband's brother is a really messed up person, and his parents are pretty messed up too. He doesn't have a super close relationship with them, though he tries to and tries to be supportive when he can, but they are just a hot mess. Some facts about the brother:

* Up and down with drugs 
* Never finished High School, been trying to get his GED for like 15 years but never does because ""everyone is against him""
* Went to jail for assaulting their dad
* Wasn't supposed to live with the parents ever again (by judges order during probation) but after probation ended, moved right back in and is a loafer
* Violent when angry

The brother and parents have a very toxic co-dependent relationship, and no matter what we have tried over the years, we can't help them get out of it.

The brother has a messed up girlfriend that he's been and out of relationship with for years too. I guess in the last few months, she's been living with them too and the two of them just lay around all day. Now apparently she is pregnant. We are trying to convince them all that she should get an abortion (which apparently she's done 3 times before already) but no one wants to face reality. Some relevant facts about the girlfriend:

* She already has a 10 year old who is being raised by the grandma
* She is collecting the child support for daughter she already has but keeps it all none of it is used for the kid
* She has tried to get the brother sent to jail before when they had fights

It's such a huge mess. I know we cannot force someone to get an abortion, but I didn't know if I talk to someone at like Dept of Children and Families if they could help, or the fact that she's basically stealing the child support could get her into trouble, that might make her think this isn't a good idea.

We are 100% sure his parents are gonna end up taking care of the kid, which would be a really bad situation. I'm afraid this kid is gonna end up like Caylee Anthony or like hit by a car or something, at the very least, is gonna be pretty messed up themselves.

610,"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years.  I’ve always gotten along well with his family, despite their near constant arguing amongst themselves.  Two years ago they(my boyfriends mom, dad, and sister) moved down south about 10 hours away and since they moved we’ve come down 3-4 times per year. 

EVERY singular time we come, there is an explosive argument.  Screaming, night ruined, everyone goes to bed angry and never talks about it again.  I’m the type to avoid conflict and I’ve always managed to stay out of it since it doesn’t concern me.  Until yesterday.  

Yesterday I lost my patience.  My Bf(28) his sister(23) and I(28) had made plans to go to an outdoor bar and get drunk as hell, a classic pre-thanksgiving tradition for many.  Sparing the monotonous details, his sister is very negative and self obsessed I would even call her a narcissist based on her total lack of empathy.  We spent a day driving and getting rained on and the whole day (6/7 hours) listening to his sister complain endlessly about her problems, and if you tried to offer solutions she would get nasty and defensive.  If you tried to change the subject she would change it back to her.  

So after an entire day of this, she keeps repeating how she wishes that she was staying overnight with the guy that she finagled a meet up with on our family day trip to Atlanta, weird right? I was so fed up.  I said I think it’s really fucking rude that we have had plans in place for tonight and all you can talk about is how you’d much rather be somewhere else.  

ERUPTION OF CHAOS...his sister screaming  and making excuses 

Ended with my boyfriends mother saying that I should stop and be respectful because she’s driving and payed for my 7 dollar sandwich at lunch and she doesn’t want to hear it.  Ok. 

Back at the house his sister starts back up, my boyfriend starts going back and forth with her.  I try to ask her to talk one on one because she was accusing us of ganging up on her.  Her and her mom both say no and act like I shot the goddamn dog.  His mother then tells me my actions have been totally in appropriate and I should know my place.  I explained to her that when someone hurts my feelings, it is my place to tell them and try to have a conversation about it.  Her response was that when someone hurts her feelings she lets it go because it’s respectful, and when she’s staying in someone else’s house she knows her place.  

Tons of more back and forth, closed door screaming with his sister, manuscripts of nasty texts, night finally ends. 

This morning is Thanksgiving.  BF says to his mom, I think we need to talk about what happened yesterday, but today is a holiday, can we all try to enjoy it and agree to talk about it tomorrow.  His moms response is that IF she feels like talking about it tomorrow we will and if she doesn’t we won’t.  And then proceeds to dump her side of the story on us.  I don’t say a word because I was told multiple times the night before to know my place.  My BF listens and tries to explain his side and his mom keeps shutting him down.

613,"Hello, I used to feel normally emotions and work through them by letting them flow, accept them, and then move on. I did that even on the big bad stuff of life.

Now it happened last summer that I had a couple of losses that looks minor but were hard on me. I had handed an item over to an institution that I thought would cherish it and then when I went to retrieve it they had lost it, and I was devastated because it was an item that had accompanied me since early childhood and I wanted it to accompany me all my life, full of meaning as it was. They had no displeasure, no empathy, no particular bother about what happened, for them it was just an item. I received solidarity by loved ones, but in the end they seemed to think that it is an object and the meaning and memories stay with me. I'm not convinced really, and I really would love to do everything to undo the mistake of parting from that item, even if I know it's all over.

Then a baby plant died. It was a kind of spotted aloe and I was very much in love with it, raising it from very small, but I overwatered it and didn't understood it before it was too late. I was very much in sorrow but no one understood, I've been even told ""no one has time to be sorry for someone else's plants"", but that one really had a lot of emotional investment from me.

And finally I did a big stupid thing this year too, I decluttered clothes that were very important for me. I just wanted to ""throw away, reset and start over"" but ended up with just cheap anonymous meaningless clothes instead of those (2 sweaters, 5 shirts, 3 trousers) that I had carefully selected and kept well through the years and were absolutely wearable. I just stupidly thought that they weren't working in changing my life so I should detach and move on, but I regret it completely. I cannot even understand why I was so misguided.

Now of course everything leaves me numb. I find it unbearable the pain about the first item, but it is after the plant that I just shut down. I used to cry about abandoned puppies now even an article about sheltered animals put down or that mink massive culling make me just be numb. I want my feelings back, and gain closure for those losses, what can I do?",26Nov2020,1

616,"My house is on the corner where the bus stop for the local high school is. One of the kid’s parents chain a bike to the stop sign in my yard twice a week.

They live over a mile away so I’m ok with it. 

However, sometimes the kid must not take the bus home, and the bike gets left for up to a week. 

I’m not really overjoyed by looking at the janky bike that isn’t even mine.

What should I do? 

I’d approach the parents but they are like ninjas and take off before I can stop them. 

The lock is easily hackable, but that seems petty, and they could probably just bring a new janky bike next week.

618,"I never understood the meaning of life. I struggle with it often. 

Why do we all put ourselves through the agony of waking up everyday, just to go and wish that things were different. Or that we were in a different position. More money, more sex, more attractive. We are greedy creatures who are never truly satisfied, and become depressed and upset at the slightest inclination that there is something more for us out in the world. Suicide is shameful, and depression isn't real, right? I think that our heads place us in a state of constant distress, because they are always whirring, clicking, and keeping up with all the things that happen around us. Does it even matter in the end. Who we are with, and how we feel inside. Sometimes I think it would be better to just keep it all bottled up and release it with drugs, or alcohol, or sex. The nicotine wasn't enough to make me feel alright anymore. I have ADHD medication that makes me not eat, but thank god it keeps my head quiet. I would sacrifice any weight gains I have made to have some quiet in my mind for once. But it always slips through. And I figured I would jot down what runs through my head when it does. I probably need to talk to someone, but I don't have anyone to talk to anymore since I left my wife. And I truly believe that no one really cares at the end of the day. In one ear and out the other as they say. I only have one person who I truly consider a friend. I have never been one to associate with large groups of people. It isn't like I am not attractive, or social. In fact, I can carry on a conversation with you and have you think I am probably one of the nicest people you have ever met. If you're a female, I can almost guarantee you would find me at least slightly appealing visually. I am tall, with a slim but tight build. Have a fashion sense that many would admire, whether it be on the street or in the office. But it doesn't matter. The person who loves me unconditionally, supposedly, is no longer who I am in love with. I am not sure she ever was. I checked out for years, and one day I woke up and realized that I was absolutely not happy. The money and financial security was not what I really wanted. I want to feel loved. After years of this person putting me down, and me still trying to be okay with it, I left. I left my kids, I left the family she had, I left her. My family broke apart years ago over the custody of my younger brother. Have not talked to them since, and there has been no attempts aside from a meeting over drinks with my sister that ended with her expecting me to apologize for doing what I felt was right, and advocating for his father. I sit alone in an apartment now and I think I sometimes feel better. But at the same time the thoughts of how others feel about it destroys me inside. I just want to do something for myself for once. I haven't ever had the opportunity to do that. I had my first just months after turning 21. I have been supporting others ever since then. Putting myself last in my own head. Ignoring everything that made me feel like shit for the sake of everyone elses happiness. I think it has always been that way. I just try to do what is ""right"". What Jesus Would Do. And that probably stems back to the way I was raised with religion, the way my mom passed away early in my life, one of the only ways of me being able to honor her being to follow those teachings that I had in my life when she was a part of it. My father is an absolute deadbeat. Everything I have learned about fatherhood, I have taken upon myself to learn. Everything about manhood I have taken upon myself to learn. My life has not been particularly hard. I always had what I needed, and even most of what I wanted, really. So maybe in the back of my head, I always am telling myself that it could have been worse, and I should just be thankful that I am privileged in the ways that I have been. Anyways. I am a failed 27 year old, trying to once again figure out what the hell I am doing here on this spinning, beautiful mess of a planet.

She's bumbled around fandom communities and has made acquaintances, but nothing is really sticking. I've tried suggesting things but nothing has worked. She has had no luck, and with COVID it's a total shitshoot for anything physical, oh, **and she's currently 1000 miles away from me.**

Things like facing away or putting in our earbuds or even just focussing on work and not hearing her or maybe just talking to someone else and not switching our attention to her, this means that whenever we are in class or around other people it feels like I should put all of my attention on her and not think about anybody else, which is annoying but more than anything it hurts me to see her think that we hate her. She has even started to not bother to do work because she thinks she will fail anyway, I have anxiety and I used to think things like that so I know vaguely how she feels and I just want to help her, obviously we assure her all the time we don’t hate her but those sorts of anxious thoughts don’t work like that.

627,"I (24M) live with my housemate (25M) in a house in a small city, and my gf (23F) lives in her own flat nearby. All three of us have historically gotten on really well (my gf lived here for a time when her previous flat lease ended and the first lockdown came in as she was looking for new places). All of us were good friends before she and I got together, and have continued to be throughout our relationship. 

Anyway, the most recent lockdown has caused a bit of an issue. My gf takes the new rules extremely seriously, and will not see me, my housemate or enter our house unless she is the only one who does so (thereby complying with the current conditions around support bubbles). That would be fine, except the trouble is my housemate doesn't share this take, and wants to be able to see other people - principally his own gf, who lives with her parents. Obviously that's not strictly allowed according to the current rules, but he can't see that there's a huge risk to just her coming over occasionally, and truthfully I don't instinctively disagree or have much to say against this other than 'it's the rules'. 

Probably needless to say, this has made my gf very angry. She will now not speak to my housemate or his gf, being extraordinarily annoyed both at their disregard of the rules, and my own, insofar as I haven't 'put my foot down' and forced him to comply so that my gf may come round and vice versa without having to compromise her own position on said rules. I'm trying my best to make sure my gf isn't on her own as much as possible - seeing her outside every other day, going for walks etc and basically doing every social activity possible whilst remaining compliant - but I know it's not really enough. 

My options aren't great though. I really don't want to take this to the wire with my housemate - we're good friends, share pretty similar views on the situation and live together 24/7 with the current COVID conditions. I worry that 'putting my foot down' will basically create an imbalanced and/or poisoned atmosphere which will make our living situation together somewhat unpleasant, and my argument isn't brilliant either as it's basically me saying 'I want to see my gf so can you stop seeing yours'. I also have no right to 'pull rank' or any actual means of doing so - we pay equal rent - and am aware he could simply say 'no', leaving us at a brick wall. I worry that this course would also create a pretty hostile atmosphere in the house should I succeed and my gf eventually come over - not exactly a very 'supportive' bubble.

630," \[SERIOUS\]

Dear reader,

It is a long read to the end of this post, but I hope you can help me. I'm not sure where to begin with this story, so I'll just dive in. Fair warning that this post is indeed NSFW.

I have been accused of sexual assault and while I am almost certain that I am innocent of said accusation, the accusation is the only reason I am lacking complete confidence of having done no harm. I feel that the situation has been a complete mindfuck of reality for me and could use some help in determining what really happened from people that are unbiased with the information presented. All thoughts are welcome, but I'd be most curious to hear from women what they think about the post due to the nature of it. 

I shall call the girl in question 'Katie' for her privacy. May the moderators know that Katie is of course not her actual name and I have carefully taken away some details that serve to protect the privacy of the incident and those involved but the important details of the event are exact. She is 22 and I am 24. We were both students at a church-sponsored university in Utah. She is Mormon and I am technically a member of their church but am not one to practice the faith very much. I do feel that this context is important to the rest of the story. In the second week of October of this year, on a Friday night; I went on a date with Katie from Tinder. What I like to do is keep dialogue going with women I match with, work up to calling them and even an online face-to-face virtual date before meeting them in person. This is more for the women I go on dates with than for me. I just want to put them at ease and ensure they’re comfortable with me. I just enjoy having something fun to look forward to in between the long hours of studying for my STEM degree. I prefer cooking dates for the first date in-person and like when I have enough time to plan a group date. As long as we are in a public place for the first date, I’m fine. After she had worked enough of her homework in her calculus class, she insisted we grab a hot chocolate from a nearby location I hadn’t been to but was familiar enough with. She also asked if I had a car. I told her I did and before I knew it, I was making my way to her apartment complex to pick her up. She was much taller and heavier than I initially anticipated for the lack of information she provided on her profile. I stand no taller than 6’0 (wearing shoes) and am of decent build due to taking care of myself – visiting the gym often. This girl had to be 6’2 maybe even 6’3 and twice my weight. She didn’t really lie on her profile; she just wasn’t very open about her characteristics, but she was cute, and I really hadn’t set expectations that evening to be high and was just glad to be out of my apartment. From the get-go she and I hit things off well and we had plenty to talk about. She was kind and I knew that it would be a fun outing. We drove the few blocks in the center of town to get our hot chocolate at the place and parked nearby to enjoy them. It wasn’t quite the temperature to be enjoying hot chocolate, but it was *cool* that evening and the beverages were very yummy.

We talked of many things; the horrors of terrible physics instructors and the triumphs of calculus with this one prolific instructor who actually gave a damn about her students. We hadn’t had any classes together, but our degrees were similar enough to where we had similar coursework. I soon steered the conversation away from what I had been escaping. We began talking about our hobbies and from there, time really got away from us. 9:30pm turned to after midnight and I was thinking about taking her home. I had the odd urge to ask her if I could kiss her and she agreed but instead of the usual kiss, I received a very passionate one and many signals to accompany it. I asked if she’d like to go for a drive and she excitedly said “yeah, sure”. Without much thinking going on, I drove to the edge of town until I pulled up to a spot that is known to be where underclassmen go to makeout (and other things). It hadn’t occurred to me that this is the direction that I was taking things that evening. I felt like the moment I put the car in park, the last 7 months of COVID-induced loneliness resurfaced in my gut and I decided I was going to follow her lead and pursue things as far as she was comfortable. I guess I thought, “fuck it”. I resumed kissing her and she grinned during the kiss as it was probably just as long since she had kissed someone. I asked if she’d like to get in the back of the car and she agreed, and we quickly jumped in the back of my car to resume kissing. I do feel that there are a few quick details worth mentioning. Number one, I rarely even kiss on a first date. Number two, we attend a university where even setting foot the opposite sex’s apartment bedroom for any reason whatsoever is grounds for disciplinary action by the school as seen fit. I would much rather be doing this in my own bedroom, but the car is a cultural compromise in our religion, as juvenile as it may seem SMH. Alright, back to the story. We are in the back of my car at night. At this point, I become more relaxed believing my intentions have been made clear. I begin caressing her skin. After a few minutes of this and kissing, I begin to take her shirt off. She tells me she doesn’t want clothes to come off. I back off. I began to think that things may not go in the direction I hoped for but continued back to the things we were doing before. Nothing too heavy yet, just kissing her face and caressing her shoulders, neck, and back between bra-line and waistline. I make a bold move and slide my hand over her breast and hear nothing on her end and figure I’m good. She begins to become more aggressive in her kissing and begins to breathe heavily. She begins biting my lip and I bite hers gently. Tongue kissing ensues. I begin groping her along her clit on the outside of her pants and she seems to be enjoying it. I then attempt to take off her shirt and am successful in doing this. I am carefully moving along because I’m breaking a HUGE rule of mine: NOT.ON.THE.FIRST.DATE. These thoughts weren’t circling through my mind at the time because I was present in the moment and figured all was well, but it pains me now looking back on events knowing that I would chance a girl that I didn’t even know.

I begin taking off her bra. It wasn’t one that I was used to and the last couple of hooks seemed to be caught on the fabric and she helped me unhook them. Her breasts are exposed now. They are the best I’ve ever seen in person and I expressed that to her, and she smiled. I begin caressing her breasts, especially on the nipples. It seemed that the hormones were racing through her head because she began to really enjoy herself – more than I had anticipated, given my experience from previous women I had been with. She really enjoyed her breasts being stimulated. I decided I’d work more with that and began sucking on her tits. She was beginning to caress my back as I did this as well as my hair. After some time, I began taking off her jeans and because she had long ass legs, she had to help me take them off after she took her boots off. I began rubbing along her groin area and she was very wet. She seemed to like this, and I didn’t hear her say anything against me doing this, so I took her panties off and she was fully unclothed. I then completely undressed myself and we continued. After continuing to go back and forth between kissing and me sucking on her breasts, I then insert my finger in her vagina with another stimulating her clit. I later sit back in the seat behind the driver’s seat and retrieve a condom where I thought I’d have at least one leftover from earlier this year. May the reader keep in mind that one must always take very special care with a condom while putting it on. It doesn’t happen in two seconds. While I’m not in the Magnum category, it can be a process for me to get even a good size match on not too snug and comfortable on my end. This usually takes a good minute or so. Meanwhile, the woman sitting next to me says NOTHING. After the condom is on and I’m all set, I slowly make my way over to her and she extends her arm against my chest and says, “I don’t want to do that”. My brain goes STOP! I say “okay, no problem.” I sit back in my seat behind the driver’s seat and take the condom off. I’m reminding myself that *yeah, this sucks, but there WILL be other, better opportunities in the future.* We briefly go back to the same things from earlier.

After a little bit of time, I realized she wasn’t reciprocating anything and I stopped to address this with her. There was a brief pause. I said, “I don’t mean to be rude, but it’s a bit unusual that you’re not reciprocating anything and I’m just wondering if everything is alright.” She continues to add that she’s afraid of the male anatomy. At this point, I realize that I’m likely dealing with a girl that has never had a sexual experience and I begin to stop and shut everything down. At this point, too many red flags have been waved and I wish that I had never decided to drive off on this stupid adventure for the sake of poon. I ease up a lot and begin to just enjoy her company. We talked about similar things from earlier as I scratched her legs, tickling her feet at one point, causing her to laugh and kick. I was starving for human interaction and so I suggested we play a game where I scratch her back and she guess what I drew. If she guessed wrong, it was my turn. After going back and forth with this, I realize that she wasn’t as energetic as she was earlier. and I asked her about this and she just said she was tired. I looked at the clock and it read 3:15am. HOLY SHIT, I thought. I suggested I take her home and she agreed. We both get dressed. We both step out and I say “hold on a sec” I made my way over to her side of the car and compared our sizes. She was the first girl I’ve gone on a date with that was *taller* than me. It was beyond fascinating to me and I hugged her and told her “thanks for being my tallest date”. We get in the driver’s and passenger’s seats and begin to drive back to campus. I awkwardly pass her the hand sanitizer and we both get a generous amount to lather between our gross hands. I begin to continue being my original self, making jokes and whatnot and I look over to her side to see someone that is solemn in spirits. Once we hit a red light back in town, I ask her what’s up in a very kind and endearing tone. She doesn’t say much that is reassuring but I figured that she was just tired, so I eased off and kept to myself. AWKWARD. We pulled up to her apartment building that looked more like a hotel than an apartment building for college students. I explained to her that I really enjoyed her company and she agreed she also enjoyed getting out. I told her that I could tell that she was unsure about mixed emotions that she was having about the latter-portion of the evening together. I told her that she’s more than welcome to talk to her ecclesiastical leader about things if she has a guilty conscience (knowing what that is like) but if she could leave my name out of it. She agreed. She then told me, “it’s just this has been happening to me a lot lately.” I felt terrible hearing this, because it seemed that she was under the impression I only ever wanted to ‘hit-n-quit’ her but that was just not true, but I said nothing because I could not find the words to articulate this. I reassured her that she was awesome and that I thought highly of her. I also said a few words explaining that she would eventually find her ‘one and only’ if she just continued to look for Mr. Right. I thought I had let her go with higher spirits when she eventually stepped outside my car, shut the door with the sufficient force needed and returned to her apartment. I drove off and back to my much less-expensive apartment feeling a little down about the whole ordeal but assumed I’d just sleep it off. The next night, I reconnected with a different woman that had decided not to marry this first-ballot, hall of fame asshole and I was able to cook her a nice meal and we had great sex, at her apartment, in a bed, like adults do. That felt *right*. While we lay there staring at her ceiling lined with color-changing lights, I brought up the story of my most awkward date the other night and she only laughed at it and told me that there was nothing to worry about. I trusted the reassuring voice of a woman who had 11 more years of life experience than me, being 35. I had no idea what was coming my way.

Wednesday of that next week seemed as normal as any other. However, I got a phone call from an unknown number from Arizona. I answer it half expecting it to be another scammer for me to fuck with about renewing the warranty of a Honda Civic that I don’t own. Instead, I hear the voice of a woman on the other line. She says, “hey”. I reply with a hello and proceed to ask with whom I am speaking. She tells me it is Katie and that she wanted me to tell her what I thought about the other night. I decide I might want to keep the conversation private and ask if I may call her back once I get to my car which has a Bluetooth phone dock. Once in my car, I proceed to ask her about her day, and she says she’s doing okay. I ask her “so what’s up?” She then proceeds to ask me why I would take her shirt off when she told me she didn’t want clothes to come off. At this point, my heart sank down to my stomach and I couldn’t believe what direction the conversation was going. I was searching for the right words, knowing I needed to be very careful of what I said next. “I’m confused,” was all I could say. She continued to try to get me to say all sorts of things by setting up various ‘traps’ and I could only assume that she was recording the conversation to use as arsenal against me. She told me that I sexually assaulted her, and I said, “what part of that night makes you feel that I sexually assaulted you?” she said when I took her clothes off. She proceeded to ask me why I put my fingers inside her - forcefully, and against her wishes. I told her that I was going to hang up if she continued to say these things that were absolute lies. Most of what she was saying was just twisting the facts, but there were small parts of that night she was just flat-out lying about. Such things include me being on top of her, when I never was. That she repeatedly told me “no” when such never left her mouth at any point aside from her initially saying clothes did not want to come off and that she did not want to have intercourse. The only thing I could see myself guilty of was clothes coming off but there was much that led up to that and I do not believe that at any point throughout that night she felt like she was being attacked and manhandled by me. This is the way she was presenting the events and I hung up, blocked her on every single app including my phone. A month later, I am asked about the events by a representative of the school and I think immediately that I am fucked. It’s not the police or the Title IX office, as they claimed they had insufficient evidence that such abuse had occurred. It is a very unique branch of our school called the Student Honor Code Office. A name that gives pretty much all students anxiety because they hold the rights to suspend anyone for any reason as per the contract that we sign. It’s a sub-office of the school that pursues anyone that is suspected of breaking the school’s honor code: no drinking, smoking, drugs, sexual abstinence (in every conceivable way), and regular attendance of church – YUCK! I still don’t know why I decided to go to that school other than the dirt-cheap tuition cost. In the end, the dickhead working at SHO kept information from me and had a full police report from this girl and a recording of the entire hour-long conversation I had with her over the phone where I basically admitted to having sexual contact with someone. Within a week, ¾ of a semester became meaningless as I was withdrawn from all of my courses, my registration for the next semester’s courses were dropped, and I was expelled from the school and all of their church-sponsored affiliates for the reason of unsolicited sexual misconduct and lying in the investigation AGAINST ME. Of course I lied that anything happened that night. If she was going to lie right through her teeth, I was going to as well. I was already halfway through my very promising undergraduate degree in a STEM field. I wasn’t even in town when I received this news. I was home with my family and a terminally ill friend for the holidays. When I received this news, I ended the Zoom call with the SHO guy and drank almost an entire bottle of very strong liquor. I have since been plagued with the bitterest of regret, shame and an all-encompassing sorrow – a deep depression. A depression I have not seen since my teenage years. I maintain that I am not a sexual predator. I’d actually say of myself that I can be a great guy and that I’ve been with several women over the years and this is the only one that has given me this sort of reaction. I am deeply confused by the incident. 

Despite my best efforts, I’m not a great student. I cannot continue to carry my family name with great dishonor of others believing that I am a sexual predator; a creep. I just can’t live with that much weighing me down and I’m not sure anyone will take me in at another university, given my track record. My aspiration of becoming a medical doctor was the only thing that made me want to live and I fear that for more than one reason, this is a dream that will never become a reality. I apologize for coming across as overly dramatic at this end. This has been a very traumatic experience for me. 

I now ask the reader, am I innocent of the claims or am I a sexual predator that deserves to be gone and out of this world?

Ever since February of 2020 I’ve been going through a very difficult time. I was so happy with life and loving it so much when I was still in high school finishing the classes I needed to take to go into the university program I wanted to. I finished those classes got my exam and final mark back and then I was like okay now I have time until September to relax because that’s when my engineering program started. Thing is though I relaxed wayyyyy to hard, got into smoking weed and tobacco a lot and because of covid I didn’t work full time and so I spent a lot of my days just getting high, working out and watching YouTube and Netflix a lot. It was extremely comfortable because all I was doing was consuming entertainment but it also got me used to that type of lifestyle. On top of that I had a gf that I spent some time with but not a lot because for some reason I was feeling really bad at about myself. In hindsight it was that I wasn’t doing anything to help myself or progress myself into the future I was only consuming and so because of the hedonic treadmill whenever I had to stress it was much harder to do than if I was doing it extremely often. 

So now here I am in a different city with the option to take classes second semester at this school but I’m honestly really unsure if I want to because I don’t exactly love my living situation and I’m thinking of going into a different program that might be easier for myself and in a different city next year. 

I’m working full time so atleast I’m making money right now but I feel really ashamed of myself for not progressing forward or missing the opportunity to be further into my future just because I made this stupid decision to relax during quarantine. I really want to get on with my life but in some ways I feel incapable of doing anything right now especially with online learning and the pandemic. I feel worthless and that I’m always going to be behind everyone in life and that I’m never going to find or do something I’ll actually enjoy.

Can someone give me some words of advice, roast me, or give me some motivation to get out of the mindset that I can’t do anything with my life because right now I feel quite worthless.",26Nov2020,1
633,"If you're expecting some big drama I'm sorry but the reality is that this isn't that deep. But, I was talking to my boyfriend about it and he seemed to think it wasn't a big deal so now I'm just curious about what others think.

I (22F) moved into my current house at the end of June and I have been living with another couple (23F &amp; 27F). Now, in all fairness, we have not all hangout THAT much. Since they are a couple I have always found it a bit awkward to go sit with them in the living room as I am a lodger so this is their house in actuality. I have social anxiety so I don't know if that's why I'm too shy or if this sounds like a normal thing to feel a bit awkward about. Either way, I never sit with them in the living room ever. But, we have talked in the kitchen when cooking and usually have some conversations when I'm home. We went up a mountain for a walk one time and have had dinner together once when I moved in. They aren't the type of people to go out drinking and often are just home in their pyjamas watching TV (I think covid-19 has contributed to this as well), so I've felt a bit awkward to ask them to go out also.

Well, about a month ago a new girl moved into the spare room, let's call her Amy (27F), and she has immediately just hung out with them in the living room every night and they've all made dinner together and watch movies and stuff. I'm fine with this as I accept that I am shy and was never planning to stay for very long in this house anyway. But, before the 2nd lockdown this month, all of us started hanging out a bit. We had dinner together once, and played card games together a few nights. It's not like we became best friends, but we spent some time together and shared laughs.

Well, right before lockdown happened Amy posted a photo on her Instagram story of 3 mugs with their initials on each one and just captioned it something like ""Flatmate mugs!"". This is what I'm feeling like was a bit rude. Now, don't get me wrong, they haven't done anything evil, and I completely understand that they all hang out way more and I don't see them as often, however we have all hung out and we at least have a little chat almost every time I'm home. It's not a huge deal, I'm not hurt by it, but I'm just thinking if it was me and I was close friends with 2 of my flatmates but not as close with the other 1, I would feel a bit rude to get matching mugs (or whatever) with the flatmates I like and leave the other one out. AGAIN, I'm not mad at them and I'm not hurt by it, but I am personally a very thoughtful, empathic person so I always think about how other people feel, so to me this just seemed a bit rude? Or maybe not rude, but just a bit insensitive/inconsiderate in a way I guess? I feel like due to my empathic natural I sometimes am offended by things or expect too much from people so wanna know if I'm justified in my thinking or if it really isn't anything at all?

TL;DR My 3 flatmates are closer to each other than to me, however we have all hung out before and do chat when I'm home. Recently, they all got matching mugs with their initials on them and I thought this was a bit rude to not include me, even though it's true that they hangout every single night whereas I have only hung out with them like 4-5 times.

634,Currently my father is in the hospital on life support and me and him have a rocky relationship to be honest. He has always been a do not bring back to life. If I die; I die kinda guy. Currently my mother wants to keep him there but seeing him myself. I honestly do not think he would want this or anything. I'm just struggling with not only how to feel but how to deal with this.

635,"
My mother has had a pretty sad life and, in my opinion, has not learned how to accept disappointments or that the world can be different than she sees it. She alienated everyone who at some point disagreed with her and she pretty much doesn’t have friends and is jobless. 

Her only meaning in life, according to her, is God, and to her it is self-evident that there is no other alternative - you are either a Christian or you’ve been taken over by satan. 

I have lied to her since I was a child about everything: praying, fasting, not having sex, not dating, etc. At times I feel conflicted about that, especially when we meet (luckily we live far away from each other) and she insists that I participate in rituals that I don’t believe in.

When distant family or random people disagree with her, she gets incredibly aggressive and abusive, and then people just leave and never talk to her again.

Should I come out to her as an atheist? I am afraid it will crash her to find out that us, her children, don’t endorse “the meaning of her life”. Is it more ethical and kind in this case to just play along and make excuses whenever I don’t want to go to church with her, etc.?",26Nov2020,1

I always thought that someday I would have this magical epiphany of what I should do for my career, but I'm still lost. In movies the ""right"" career path seems obvious as characters always seem to have a specific interest or skill. I feel.. mediocre? Things interest me, but I don't feel capable of any specific job. My current job is .. just a job. I don't make crap, but I am also not making anything that feels like an overall secure amount for my family. I am currently facing some pressure and what feels like harassment from management at work and since I feel like I have nowhere further to go in my current job I am struggling with what to do now. I have known for a very long time that I want to do something else, but what - I don't know. I started university courses when I was 20, but after a year and a half I dropped out mostly due to anxiety and feeling as though I was incapable in my studies.

(at this point im just standing waiting on the water to boil, yknow minding my business) and she goes ""well {my name} is four foot nothing and weighs three stone and she can still fill the kettle"" and i kinda died a little bit. all she talks about is my weight. she brings it up all the time whether its saying ive 'mended' as if anything was wrong with me in the first place or that she thinks ive lost weight again. i ve told her not to bring it up but she doesnt seem to care that it (clearly) bothers me. it just makes me really uncomfortable. i simply responded ""thats offensive"" half as a joke but then she whips around and goes off on me about how it was 'a figure of speech' and that i take things too seriously and thats its my fault it bothered me. she then says loudly **and suddenly shes in one of her overdramatic half faked bad moods, like an act she puts on** - ""funny how nobody asked me about my sore knee today"" i sooo wanted to say i dont care but my dad tries to pipe up. i say ""theres no way youre so pissy because no one asked you about your knee"" and she slaps her knife down on the counter and goes ""no ACTUALLY im mad at how YOU reacted to ME saying that, it was a joke and you've put me in a bad mood now"". like,, what? huh? where? there was a little bit more but now i am crying 😃 . shes such an attention seeker always with the ""ohhh pity me and my leg im gonna talk about it all the time and make loud owwie noises a the time and be genuinely mad that no one cares or paid attention to me "". i have chronic pain. i never say anything about it. you can manage without it being everyones business. am i too soft or is she being a cunt? shes always been manipulative way more on me than my brother. i see her do it to my dad too but hes clearly blind to it. but i dont know what other people would call that. she never acts like she was in the wrong and gets really incredulous when you accuse her.

The main reason being I want to see if anyone has good taste and if so start a conversation with them and hopefully become friends because to be honest i don’t have too many because I have never really tried to because I am shy and introverted but recently I realised I do kind of want to meet new people.

643,"I (18M) am gay, very deep in the closet. So deep that nobody who knows me will suspect I'm gay. My bestfriend (M) is someone I've known for 3 years now. I don't know, seems like I'm developing feelings for him. He's straight, he's not homophobic but he's definitely not interested in the same-sex. I know that I have zero chance with him, so I don't think it's worth coming out of the closet just yet. It scares me, it feels like everything will change when I do come out.  


Anyway, sometimes during casual talks he mentions how he has feelings for this girl. And it hurt me. It made me very uncomfortable with the subject. I didn't even know I'd feel that way. I've been close friends with other males and I don't react this way when they tell me about crushes. But when my bestfriend tells me about it, it stings. I don't know why, it seems to me that I am aware that a.) We're only bestfriends and not SOs and b.) I have no chance of being in a romantic relationship with him. I think I am aware of these two points but I still get sad about it.   


I don't know how to put it in words, ""jealous"" seems to be the closest one I can think of. I can't tell him about it, I can't do anything about it. It feels really nice that he's sharing this information with me, it kinda validates our relationship as bestfriends because I know he trusts me. These past 3 years we have supported each others backs when we have our own problems (just not my gay problems, those I don't tell), we helped each other out in everything. This one is no different. I keep trying to be supportive, I've even went as far as trying to give him tips how to ask the girl out, but it pains me deep inside.

648,"So story time I guess. There's this friend of ours, let's call her Anna, and she keeps coming over to our apartment. I live with my two roommates who are also my best friends. Let's call them John and Daniel. John is the closest to Anna so she's often in his room. But that's the problem. Daniel and I love John, we're all super close. We want to hang out with him and do stuff together but it's like we just CAN'T because SHE'S ALWAYS FUCKIN THERE. She stays at our place for like DAYS at a time and just KEEPS SLEEPING OVER. I would be fine with it if she wasn't so negative all the time. It's obvious she has her own problems; I get it. I was there too. But god does she project her feelings. When she's in a bad mood, everyone can tell. And she's such a downer that it's come to the point where I just don't wanna hang around her sometimes. Every single time she comes over, she mopes around and gets sad for the stupidest reasons. I remember one time I told her that she says she's hungry a lot, because she says it... a lot... and I just thought it was interesting so I pointed it out. It wasn't a lie and it didn't come out in a negative way, it was just facts. She says it a lot. that's it. then she got hurt. She went silent and stared at the ground like she usually does. We, especially John I'm sure, have to keep tip toeing around her feelings and it's like I can't be comfortable in my own fuckin home. if she's so fuckin sad being here then why the fuck does she come over???????? Not to mention... John and Anna had a thing for a bit. Anna likes him and wants a relationship. John doesn't. And Anna knows this. But she just... keeps.. coming over.... she might as well pay rent at this point. Even Daniel, the nicest person we all know, got to the point where he feels the same way I do. Probably not to the same extent but he definitely has noticed that she comes over all the time and just gets sad every single time. She complains a lot and never does anything about any of her situations. She complains about her financial state, then doesn't even apply to get a job. You have to make sure you don't hurt her feelings. It's always about her. She's making it about her without even realizing. The whole friend group literally is walking on ice all the time because of her. She's great, ESPECIALLY when she's happy and having a good time. But nothing has changed since I met her. She is the same. She keeps coming over. and keeps bringing everyone down. I really don't know what to do. I've told John a bunch of times about this and how other people feel the same as well, but John is just... so nice and so positive. He's the most selfless person I know so I'm sure he's just trying to fix her and help her. Often when we want to hang out, we just walk into his room and Anna is just going through one of her episodes again and John is consoling her. When in reality her problem is like... the same things over and over again. And it's usually all in her head. Then we have to leave the room and then they talk for hours. So, the stuff we wanted to do that day just ends up not being done because of her. If you want change so bad then do something about it. I feel so bad for John. I don't think he knows the negative effect she has on plenty other people. Don't get me wrong, I was exactly where she was. I handled my problems a different way at the time, but now I'm trying to fix myself and I'd say I'm doing a decent job at it. I love John will all my heart and so does Daniel so we kinda have to just... sit here. And let it happen. I've told Anna before that she's overstaying her welcome. Even her roommates acknowledge that she's overstaying her welcome. And apparently, according to her roommates, she doesn't want to overstay her welcome. THEN WHY TF DOES SHE KEEP COMING OVER MAN. I'm losing my mind in my own home. I might be in the wrong. I might be the mean one here. I'm trying my absolute hardest to be nice to her but if she keeps doing what she's doing I might jump out of my window bruh  


TLDR; girl keeps overstaying her welcome at our house but I can't do anything about it cause my best friend (also roommate) wants her to stay and hang out with him. my other best friend (also roommate) feels the same way I do. so it's just not just me. she won't leave.

Keep in mind I literally did nothing to this guy. I was driving the speed limit. I’m a fairly new driver so it’s really irritating and slightly intimidating for this to happen. 

I flipped him off as he was passing me because he was pissing me off. He then went in front of me and was taunting me and trying to get me to meet him at the light. I was keeping distance from him and he was signalling me to get close to him. When he was at a red light he would slam his brakes in front of me. 

We went almost the same way the whole time with him in front of me, probably starring at me thought his mirror. Eventually I got near my work and he went straight when I turned. I was super confused because I literally did nothing to provoke him in the first place. I shouldn’t have gave him the finger, but still this guy is a grown man.

My boss (65M) keeps making jokes and it’s hurting my feelings to be honest. We work in a beauty retail company and I was talking about a special offer another business is doing on tanning products and he said “I’d say you buy a lot of that. You’re changing color by the looks of it”. I’m not going to say anything but should I stop wearing tan?? I feel so insecure being pale.,26Nov2020,1
657,"Weird post I know. At my old university the provost (who is also a prof but never taught me) was an unlikely ally for me during my first degree. She seemed to like me a lot and at graduation stopped me on the stage to wish me luck. I am really wanting to go back to school in a totally different field and have been trying to study and learn the required things to do it, and have been going in circles directionless. I have so much work to do before I can even apply but I am really unsure how to do those things, I am not sure if I am crazy for even wanting to pursue this degree but its a dream, what can you do? I could really use help and direction. It's been about 3 years since I graduated from first degree, would it be weird to reach out to this person and explain what I am trying to do and ask for their advice, direction, help?",26Nov2020,1
658,"My boyfriend (25M) and I just became official about two months ago. He is a super sweet, caring and funny guy. We get along really well and he's basically what I've always wanted in a boyfriend. The only issue is that we are currently long distance (about a 4-5 hour drive), but we've already discussed our long-term goals with one another and we are both on the same page, and are willing to make the drive at least once a month to visit each other (well, given COVID it may not be every month but you get the point!).

Basically what i'm trying to say is that I have finally found someone that is on the same page as me, and that I truly get along with. In my past relationships, one of my exes couldn't see a future with me but dragged our relationship on out of (I'm assuming) comfort and fear of being alone. I, too, have been on this opposite end and I dragged a relationship on with someone despite not seeing a future with them.

I think the fact that I've experienced both sides of this type of relationship has caused me to build up a ton of walls, and with my new boyfriend, I'm scared of letting myself be vulnerable since I'm scared of potentially feeling that pain again (especially because this is both of our first LDR and we don't know what to expect).

Another thing that has been nagging at me recently is that I can't stop thinking about his past relationships! We don't talk about our past (and I'd prefer we didn't because if I know more details, I KNOW I will overthink everything), but for some reason, I frequently find myself subconsciously comparing myself to them or just thinking of them. For example, we'd be on FaceTime or he's texting me and I will think to myself ""oh, I wonder what him and X talked about/I wonder if he told her about this"" etc. I'd like to add that he's never compared me to his exes and has rarely brought them up, unless it was relevant to a topic we were discussing or whatnot. I also know what two of them look like and they're gorgeous! But I feel like I'm not as pretty as them and so I feel like deep down I might be insecure about that (I know, it's dumb but I can't help it!!)

Anyways, how do I get myself to stop being so pessimistic/emotionally closed off so I can truly let myself fall for him? And how do I get these stupid nagging thoughts out of my head?!

Also, if any of you have tips for LDRs I would GREATLY appreciate it! I really like him and I want to make this work.

TL;DR: Scared of getting hurt/letting myself be emotionally vulnerable in my new relationship, also have random subconscious thoughts about his ex-girlfriends that keep nagging at me for no particular reason.",26Nov2020,1
659,"We have a drain next to the water heater (I'm guessing to drain any water if the water heater bursts?) Anyway my room is next to the water heater room. So I guess there was a clog on the way to the septic tank and a bunch of shower water (I hope just shower water) came up from the drain and flooded into the carpet into my room through the wall. It doesn't smell bad (smells like shampoo). I'm grossed out cause the plumber said (most companies would say you need to replace the carpet contaminated by fecal matter but honestly just clean it). So we hired a carpet steaming company to steam it. I am worried of me or my gf getting an infection in our feet from e coli or something. My parents don't want to replace the carpet because they want to replace with laminate later (maybe years). So I don't have the resources really or the authority to rip it out.

662,"This is kind of a long story so I'm going to break it down into parts:

**The problem:**

I spend the holidays alone by choice because it's better for my mental health than going to my family's holiday parties. The problem is when I see all the people happy with their great families I get envious and super depressed. Of course, all my friends, roommates, and boyfriend are all busy spending time with their families so I can't ask any of them to spend the holidays with me. (For context my bf is Korean American so I can't go with him to holiday dinners unless we are married)

**Why I don't go to my families house:**

My family *LOVES* drama and both sides are part of **extreme** Christian groups.(Half of them are Pentecostal and the others are Mormon) There's nothing wrong with being religious but my family took it to extreme lengths when I was growing up like; I couldn't cut my hair, wore very long skirts, long sleeves, etc. Needless to say when I come home as a university-educated, liberal-minded, cut and dyed hair(I dyed it brown for context), wearing normal clothes, unmarried, and pansexual, I get a lot of snarky comments. 

Some examples of things I've overheard:

*""She's going to hell. She's going to bring demons into the house dressed like that."" -*My aunt(For context I was wearing blue jeans)

*""I heard she's been with her boyfriend for 2 years and they aren't married. Of course, no one would want to marry her. She dresses like a slut.""* \-My other aunt (this time I was wearing a cute Christmas sweater and a below the knee length skirt)

**What I want advice on:**

How can I deal with the envy, loneliness, and depression that come along with being alone during the holidays?",26Nov2020,1
664,"So I went over this boys house to hang out and I told him before I went that I didn’t really wanna have sex and he respected that but we did end up teasing each other. Which I loved 😍As always with teasing leads to him getting erect so I gave him a hand job and he was quivering and shaking, I made him cum in less than 4 minutes. I think he’s really embarrassed by that by the way he was acting afterwards. Idk it’s because he just came and wanted me to just leave. But I haven’t heard from him in a 3 days and he hasn’t hit it so there’s no reason for him to quit it yet lol should I text him or just wait it out?    

Also I really like this guy and want him to be my sexual partner but i feel as if I’m going to get attached (I already can’t stop thinking about the last time we hung out) and want him all the time, and I’m scared if I let him hit that I’m just never going to hear back.

It’s frustrating, because she’s a great person and we have a lot of fun sometimes, but then something happens and she’ll start complaining about it more. Should I bring it up to her?

I’m the only person in the store with my job so I can’t compare exactly (I ’m an ops manager at a restaurant) basically there’s only two people above me.

I also saw that another of the chefs  (who I would class as a lower position) is also getting paid more than me but at an hourly rate.

670,"Hey Reddit!

Lately in my close personal relationships, I feel highly taken for granted. I consider myself an emotionally supportive person to those around me, and any help I try to extend is getting left on read lately.

Both my boyfriend and my best friend are going through difficulties in their professional and personal lives. It feels like no matter what I say, not only does it not help them, they don’t even seem to acknowledge or appreciate it. 

It’s hard for me, because I’m not in the best of moods myself these days either. Despite my own emotions, I push them aside to support the two most important people in my life. I don’t feel the same support. I don’t know how to bring this up to them without feeling too demanding or holier than thou. They both have so much on their plates and I don’t want to add to it.

672,"Hi there,

I don't know if this is the best place to post this, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and worst case scenario, I get told to post it elsewhere/don't get a lot of answers...if anybody has any suggestions for cross-posting, let me know, please!

My job recently switched me to overnights, and they've already told me that they'll be switching me back to days shortly, probably by mid-December/end of year.

I tried to slowly/gradually adjust my sleeping schedule over the course of four days, getting up 2-3 hours earlier every day, but my first shift was still absolutely horrible, and about a week in, I'm still struggling to stay awake/fighting fatigue by 4AM, and I'm still unable to stay awake all night on my days off.

I'm less worried about switching back, as I'm certainly accustomed to sleeping at night/being awake during the day (all my previous jobs were 6AM to 3PM, 10AM to 7PM, 9AM to 6PM, etc.), and staying up all day is definitely easier for me personally than staying up all night is.

I mostly need advice on how to get through these next few weeks in a safe/healthy/comfortable manner as I'm tired of constantly feeling tired/worn out, struggling to stay awake during work, then struggling to fall asleep during the day/waking up multiple times way too early.

If it helps, here's my current daily routine:

\- TRY to wake up no later than 8:30PM/9PM (although I tend to either struggle to wake up at this time/snooze alarms multiple times/consider calling in or wake up much much earlier, like 5PM/6PM, for no reason, then be unable to fall back asleep)  
\- get ready slowly/casually (I hate being rushed in the ""morning"" and I shower in the middle of the day/before bed so all I have to do is get dressed, do my hair/makeup, eat something/drink coffee, and leave on time)  
\- force myself to eat something (usually a protein bar, or something else equally full of calories/vitamins/protein, in a desperate but usually failing attempt to avoid being hungry immediately into my shift) \[why is this?!?\]  
\- chug a tall glass of iced coffee  
\- take a multi-vitamin/pre-natal vitamin (for hair growth/due to a diet that's extremely lacking in vitamins/nutrients due to being broke and not having the time/interest in cooking, not because I'm pregnant) and take a B12 pill (for energy)  
\- get to work at 10PM  
\- snack/eat small meals on breaks throughout my shift (I'm always starving, no matter how much/how often I eat, and I can't figure out why)  
\- chug another coffee around 3AM (which is when I usually start to seriously crash)  
\- move like a zombie/struggle to keep my eyes open until I get off work at 6:30AM (I work in retail and I'm always physically active/under extreme time constraints and I usually walk 20,000-30,000 steps daily)  
\- take my dog to the dog park/on a walk, because, no matter how tired I am, I feel absolutely horrible if I don't do this, plus he's extremely hyper as he's only six months old...reply to family/friends who messaged me yesterday, relax, do chores, do homework, eat again, take a shower...try to enjoy my ""free"" time even though I'm absolutely exhausted/worn out/feel kind of sick, I normally have a headache, my back/feet hurt beyond belief, and I'm stressing out about/dreading going into work again tonight  
\- TRY to be in bed no later than 1PM/2PM (although I tend to either crash around 10AM/11AM or not be able to fall asleep until 4PM/5PM)

&amp;#x200B;

Anything I should change? Anything I'm ""doing wrong?"" Any ways to make my ""days"" easier on myself while still getting an adequate amount of sleep, having a decent amount of energy throughout my shift/in the morning, and not falling into the ""all I do is work and sleep"" slump?

I've been very angry the last 24hours because my boyfriend called me a slut. He learned of some things I did before we got together and he says he can't even look at me the same.

What he is really mad about is that I didn't tell him about it and he had to find out from a friend. The reason I didn't tell him before is I knew he would act like this if I told him and he never asked. 

He is very jealous type person when I get any attention from guys. He blames me for being too flirty with them when I'm literally just being friendly. He honestly makes me second guess myself and feel bad about it. I find myself being mean to people in public because I'm worried what he will think. I stopped posting anything online of me and I even cover myself more because it makes him uncomfortable if guys look at me.

683,"Hi. From December 1st face masks are mandatory where I live. I've tried wearing one many times and I get sick from it every single time: dizzy, nauseous and with stomach pain. Last time was a week ago when I had to go to the hospital with my mother in law for a check up and had to wear it for about 3h. The entire evening I felt miserable, nauseous, dizzy af, couldn't eat anything and after a good night's sleep, I was okay again. So far at my work, I've been wearing one of those face shield ones and everything was okay because I was able to breath better and wasn't getting sick from it. The problem is that starting from December I have to use a normal face mask which stresses the shit out of me because I don't wanna feel sick every day or have to go home sick/miss work because of this. 
Please don't be harsh with me: I totally understand the utility of a normal face mask, I agree with it, I want to protect others and myself of the virus, I do believe in covid and have been taking all the measures so far as best as I can. If I go in a supermarket, I wear a normal face mask but I'm quick, no longer than 20 min in the store. Same as for a pharmacy. Haven't been to other places, I try doing my shopping online most of the time so except work and supermarkets, there aren't other places where I have to wear a face mask. 
Do you guys have any suggestions for me? My doctor can't give me any paper stating that I can't wear a normal face mask because I don't have a serious condition...so I'm pretty much screwed. I'm at work 12h every day except the weekends...how can I work if I'm feeling sick like that every damn time?

691,"So, I (30f) have made friends with my neighbor (70m), Frank, during the past months because we have a common smoking spot outside (several people gather here regularly, not just me and him). 
Anyways, we shoot the shit and drink and smoke, it was nice to have people to talk to every once in a while. 
The only downside is that Frank has some shitty character flaws (racist, misogynistic, homophobic) that show from time to time when he gets a bit too sauced. 
I have continued to chat with him over the past months when we’re all outside, despite the inappropriate comments he spouts recklessly. I always tell him the things he’s saying is inappropriate when he says some ignorant bullshit. I want to be clear where I stand on topics. I’m bisexual, atheist, liberal, and I support BLM. 
I questioned hanging around the smoke spot because of all this, but continued to cuz I’m lonely.

Fast forward to recent... it’s cold outside and so the neighbors all started to hangout inside Franks place instead of the outside smoke spot. There were four of us chillin in the livingroom drinking and chatting about nothing particular when Frank through a hard N-word into the conversation. 
He’s never done this before. 
He must have felt that in his home it was safe to say. 
[INFO: he is white and so are the other people in the room]

I immediately said that he shouldn’t say that. 
We got into a drunken argument about why it’s not okay for him to say that and he was defending that he can say it. During the argument he must’ve said n***** with the hard-R about 20 times just to prove a point. 
While trying to talk over his dumb drunk racist rambling, I got pissed off and smacked him on the cheek and said “YOU’RE. NOT. LISTENING.” 
I do regret escalating to that, but what’s done is done. He got pissed and yelled at me to get out of his house and if I ever “struck him again”, he’d kill me. 
Knowing that hitting someone is wrong, I agreed immediately to leave. I was more than happy leave!

That happened about 10 days ago.

It's me or the drug addict - Who calls out once a week and fucks us over, could kill a patient, and is making us look bad.
GREAT technician when she isn't fucked up. She was a head technician at a bigger clinic for like 10 years, but I can tell, even since January when she started at my practice, she's gone downhill.

I talked with my boss doors closed, and he had no response for me. So I left my 2 weeks on his desk and walked out of the office to finish up my last 30 minutes of the day. I'm off until Tuesday. I now have the ""office manager"" texting me saying he pulled her in to the office to discuss what I talked to him about. She said he's leaning towards firing the other girl, so I stay but .... it shouldn't have gotten to this point, in my opinion. I've spoken to him 4 times about the druggie and nothing has happened. So I'm just kind of fed up.


There are many other issues with this clinic, besides this point I've brought to you. My office manager texted me last night asking if I'd leave even if they did get rid of the druggie and I told her I'm not sure.

It honestly felt nice to put my 2 weeks in and think about other opportunities and new environments!

I'm here asking advice on what I should do. We are in the middle of a pandemic, but I get paid barely above minimum.

Should I go looking for other opportunities? Or should I stay in this semi toxic environment until I'm completely burnt out?
Help please. All of my family members are saying I'm dumb and should have stayed quiet and kept my head down, but I'm not that type of person.",26Nov2020,1

She then screen recorded and didn't answer. She seemed really nice when i talked to her.

Do you think she is gonna show to her class and say: this is the wierd guy who added me etc.?

I never talked to her before, but i kind of followed her until she was alone to ask for her snap. Maybe she thinks im a creep because of that.

Not like stalker mode, just wanted not to ask in front of her friends.

I’m going back to public school after christmas meaning I’ll be in the 2nd semester of grade 10. I got out of public school (due to my social anxiety) in 7th grade but my therapist and I both agree that now is a good time to go back (where I am the covid situation is pretty good, so public schools are open).

I was very creeped/grossed out. When I mentioned it to them, they said that what they write about in no way is an indicator of their real life actions. I've stop speaking with them.

700,"Hey guys, so my mom and dad have a terrible history. I’m now 28F and when I was born my parents split up and had a shaky relationship. They both loved me heavily, but they were crazy kids, they had me when they were 18. When I was 4 my mom basically ran off across the country with me and I didn’t know my dad until I moved back and met him when I was 20. He never called the police because he didn’t want my mom to go to jail and have me grow up without a mother, because I was a girl he felt I needed her to understand myself. Anyways fast forward my dad and I have created a great relationship and I now have a 4yr old son who LOVES his grandpa more than anything. My dad is moving to another state in January and we haven’t spent a Christmas together yet, so I really want to invite him to our house to have at least one Christmas together before he leaves. However, my mom has been having the worst year of her life and is very lonely and if I don’t include her in Christmas this year I have a feeling she will be horribly distraught. 

The two of them have a lot of resentment towards eachother, and having them both together will be uncomfortable for both of them and everyone around, and it will defeat the purpose of Christmas. I don’t want the first and only Christmas with my dad to have that sort of energy and memory. 

I have no idea what to do and I really need some help. I have a little sister (13) from my mom and a little brother (17) from my dad, and I don’t want to exclude either of them. 

Does anyone have any ideas? I know I could have them come at different times, but that means only one of them would be able to experience the present opening with my son, and I don’t want that either.",26Nov2020,1

703,"about 3-4 years ago I was like way younger in middle school and I was getting out of class and my hand accidentally grased right under her bum like upper leg ig. She turned around and said hey and I said sorry Bc It was of course an accident and I just left didn’t think much of it. The next day I got called in to the office and they made me sit in the back without telling me why I’m there for 6 hours and they called me from the back to go to the front where the principal office was and I saw my dad was there. I was scared thinking it might be Bc I cheated on a test or something. I came in and I saw 2 female officers and then I was just thinking wth did I do? When I sat down they told me that girls mum called and said I “grabbed” her ass and that’s sexual assault but they don’t want to press charges. I kept saying it was a misunderstanding and I never grabbed anything but they kept denying me the chance to talk and they straight up said I’m suspended pending expulsion. My dad was rly mad at first but when he started listneing to me and I was telling my mum as well they believed me. I had a little bit of depression before and this was making it worst. While I was suspended pending expulsion i wasn’t allowed to go near my school instead they told us to come to a different school so they could talk to us. When I was talking to them my dad asked what’s happening with the girl and they said nothing she’s in class. So my dad asked if what she says is true can u prove it and they said no so my dad said if there’s no proof then how can u say my son did anything. She didn’t scream no one on the class or the teacher saw what happened so how is this possible? My dad kept giving them questions and they couldn’t really respond to any of them obviously. So about 4-5 days later we get a call saying that I can come back to school. I was relieved instantly because I didn’t do anything wrong and it made me look rly bad and feel sad. When I came to school my vice principal asked me one thing and to this day I’m still upset about it. He asked me did I like her or ask her out on a date or something and I responded truthfully, no I do not nor did I ask her out. He then said that she told everyone that I liked her and asked her out and she rejected me. :/ I never understood why she did that? Maybe she liked me and found out that I liked someone else?? But it still would make sense on why someone would make such a big lie and destroy someone’s life. Regardless she got to keep her classes and I had to switch any class that I had that she was in. I also got a formal letter sent to my parents from the school board apologizing. Now u might be thinking this is unfortunate that this happened but at least everything went smooth at the end and that’s what I thought until an hour ago. My best friends sister told me that a girl was saying stuff about me like I’m not a good person and stuff like that ( I didn’t ask for details Bc I didn’t want this drama again but it was just bad mouthing and probably slander comments about me) and when I asked the name she said the girls name. And it was the girl that said and did all that^^^ to me for no reason. I haven’t rly told anyone for all these years Bc when stuff like this happens idk why but no one rly cares but ppl need to understand that guys can get depression and it rly hurts when something like this happens especially when u didn’t do it. I still to this day feel sorry for her and sometimes I wonder why she did it and do pray for her to Mby like get better or whatever she’s dealing with in life she goes through it but regardless I just need to say this somewhere Bc it’s been killing me for years. Anyways hope everyone’s doing good in this covid thing and wish everyone the best.",26Nov2020,1

705,"Hi everyone! I’m needing some advice on something that’s been bothering me for while now. I recently just got out of a long term relationship with my ex earlier this year. (We are both women- mentioning this for clarification) It was hard for the first couple months seeing as we became friends at first then we finally broke off all communication. To make things even more confusing, we are coworkers at a small business. We work together at least 3 days a week. This makes it extremely difficult to move on with my life. I want to search for another job, but during this pandemic it makes things even more difficult. And on top of that, I  just got a raise. 

What makes it worse is that my best friend of 8 years is my ex’s roommate. They moved in together right after we broke things off. I am struggling to get past how much this bothers me when I talk/hang out with my friend. I will say she isn’t insensitive about it, she doesn’t bring her up around me or tell me if she’s doing anything with her. While I greatly appreciate that, I also am bothered that she is close to someone who hurt me so much. Am I selfish to think this way? 

I lived with my ex and her family for around 4 years and they have said hurtful things about me as well. They have all cut me out of their lives like I was nothing to them over an argument. At that time I was not meant to be in that relationship- I had been trying  to break away for at least a year but felt so much guilt about ending things that I just stuck through it.

Whenever I mentioned the possibility of us taking a break she would get extremely defensive. Or when I would ask what we would do about our shared items if we were ever to call it quits she would say “well that’s never going to happen so why bother asking that?” I was having a lot of mental breakdowns and I smoked a LOT. Whether it be marijuana or vaping I was desperately trying to escape the pain and anxiety I was feeling. 

Anyway, I am much better now being single and focusing on myself at the moment. No more smoking of any kind and no breakdowns. But what I am struggling to handle is my best friend being so okay with being friends with someone and their family who has hurt me so deeply. It also seems as though at work my ex likes to think she has some sort of advantage so to speak about living with my friend. It bothers me so much, does anybody have any advice on how to cope with feeling this way? Should I just say screw it and leave my job and distance myself from my friend?",26Nov2020,1
706,"I’ am broke. 

Like 5 years ago I got my first job, and I had never gotten my own money before, so I started buying stuff, and getting debts. 

5 years later and this is me still paying. I have a good enough salary in my country to be able to afford at least a car and a house, and I have none of those because of the debts. 

Last year I made a baby with my girlfriend, it wasn’t planned, but it happened. I was really scarred because all of what a baby means. I don’t believe in god, I will be clear about this. But this baby has been blessed, every time that somehow we are low on something for him, out of nowhere a friend or family appears giving us that exact something, so he has always had what he needs. We don’t live together, I cannot afford it. My gf lives with her parents and I live very far away from them because of work. 

Until last year I never thought of really saving or making any big changes on what did I spent my money into, I just thought that at some point my debts would end, but because of my baby I had to make big changes. I still have like 6 years more of paying debts. This year has been harder, the little extra money that I earned and I tried to save I had to use it to give it to my parents and to my gf. I’m 28yo, and now thanks to my baby I realized that living like this is not worth. 

I am at a point where because of these debts I have no idea what to do. I work between 9:30 and 10 hours a day and I am not earning enough money. I’ve cut almost everything that I needed to, and still life keeps getting more expensive. I simply don’t know what to do, what to change. I want to get a new job, but I can’t, I don’t have any studies of any kind, the only thing that I have is what I’ve learned while working, which is mostly useless since it is related to each current job (I’ve always worked in service desks). 

I don’t want to give up because of my baby, but I just don’t know what to do. 

Any advises on places where I could study, were could I learn something new would be greatly appreciated. And as well, any advises on what could I change or do in order to save some more money.",26Nov2020,1

709,"So I've recently started an integrated masters marine biology degree, something that everyone ive ever met has expected me to do since I was about 10. I've now realised its really not for me, and I really should have listened to myself when I had doubts just after alevel when I grew to love psychology. Ive thought about this long and hard, and I'm now certain that I want to pursue psychology. It suits me better, im excited about the prospect of learning it and when I think of myself coming home of an evening and talking about my day to my family I know ill feel much more fulfilled in a psychology role. 

However, having exchanged emails with parties concerned, it turns out I cant change this year, I'd have to wait until next year to go into first year again. And thats not a massive deal, a small sacrifice to change my life for the better. But what the heck do I do for the rest of this academic year. Do I quit uni for now and find work experience?

 my couch. I woke up at 1am to find a man in my 

house. He was kneeling on the flooring front of the 

ottoman where my feet were propped up. In my 

sleep haze I thought it was my teenage son, and 

asked initially what the heck he was doing before the 

fog cleared from my head and I realized my son was 

at his dad's house for the night. I then began to inch 

forward while screaming for the person to get out of 

my house and kicked them in the head while the 

continued to kneel motionless and silent.

They then spun and ran into my kitchen and jumped 

out of my kitchen window. I followed and closed and 

locked my window before heading back to the living 

room to grab my phone and call for help. While on 

the phone with 911, I noticed that a dirty pair of my

realized that my sock had been cut open and my 

toes were exposed. (I think I woke up to this person

statement and pictures of my house, belongings, 

socks/feet.

When my sister lived with us, she was also parentified into raising us two. My parents both have stable jobs and when they come home they go out with their friends for the rest of the day or watch tv. 

They hardly talk to us, and they have a history or abusing us verbally, emotionally and physically. If my brother messes up somehow, I get punished for it ""because I'm responsible for him"". its been like this for the past 4 years ever since my sister moved out. Its been really hard and I think I might go insane at this point. 

I am my parents' golden child who has quite a few things (and hobbies) that I'm good at. My brother on the other hand is the ""failure"". He doesnt have any hobbies other than playing video games and has bad grades, but never in his life has he ever been hit because my dad is misogynistic. 

My parents told me that if he doesnt get a hobby, they'll take my phone away (which I bought myself with my own hard earned money, since we don't get allowance). I've been trying to get my brother into many different things to see what he can stick to for the past 3 months, but he doesnt seem interested in anything at all. I ended up taking away his electronics but im not sure if it'll help. Also, standing up to my parents isn't an option, my sister and I have tried before and it never ended well.

Or if I am writting a character from another race, who's niece has experienced racist comments in schools and she kind of says that certain people are more priviliged than others and it is annoying how they can't experience nice things too, and she kind of generalizes because she feels hurt and ashamed because certain people told her that people with certain colour do not fit the attractive standart.

718," So context (it will be a bit big) I and this person met online about a few months back around May to June I can't remember correctly as my memory around there is a wee bit blurry, and around early September our friendship ended. So you may be asking ""Well UPR if you want to become friends with them again why are you asking here?"" and to answer that, it's because of how we ended the friendship and the stuff we did to stagnate it. So during the friendship, she introduced me to her friend group and it was pretty nice, then after a while, I started to notice they started to shift from being to unctuously nice to me or just gave little attention, then after a little, they just flat out ghosted and ignored me; but I did say some things and almost did something that hurt them so I would have seen it as fair, until while I and that friend ended the friendship they tell me they only introduced me to those people cause they felt that I was very lonely and ""maybe you just didn't fit into this group."" Now the way we ended the friendship was that I had to do it, they didn't do it and they just ignored me like their group. When I ended it I acknowledged the things that hurt the friendship and that I was sorry that I did those things, and instead of saying the same they just reiterated what I said and didn't acknowledge the things they did to me. After that I removed them from anything we were friended on and I went into a but of a mini depression state, but I got over it with the help of a friend or two, but like a drug I seem to be tempted to try again with this friend. I don't really know of I should or shouldn't try again, but I would rather ask for advice on this, so if you got anything I am all ears",26Nov2020,1
719,"I'm a 24 year old woman and my mom has been commenting on my weight since I started puberty and I am so sick of it. I was very tall and lanky as a teenager and my mom used to always tell me I was too thin. I was about 145lbs and 6ft tall. In retrospect, I was somewhat athletic and I grew fast so it wasn't strange that I was thin, but I did have disordered eating because I was depressed and would often skip meals. I was also a chubby kid. I HATED when she would comment on my body because it was never constructive and always sounded judegmental.

Now that I'm an adult, I have gained a significant amount of weight because of the medication I was on. I am definitely overweight now (about 200lbs and 6 feet tall) but she knows why and I have told her I am unhappy. Today I posted some food I ordered from a friend who runs a business. This is the conversation over text I had with my mom:
Her: what are the calories like in those?
Me: I think the flavours are different but this one is 670 so I usually eat half and save half for later lol
Her: Looks soooo yummy!!! Ya that’s a lot of calories for one meal. Good you eat it twice to split it up 😘

I am so fucking triggered from this conversation. And when I talked to my partner about it, I realized that what I ordered is literally the caloric equivalent to 1/3 of 2000 calories (which is a normal amount of food). I haven't replied to my mom yet and I am hoping for ideas on how to handle this situation. For background, my mom has had disordered eating her entire life which has definitely contributed to my own issues, but I think I now have a way more balanced diet than she ever did. 

Can anyone relate to this experience and how did you handle it? I want my mom to stop making these comments and I am extremely angry but I want to have a reasonable reply lol.",26Nov2020,1

Here we go again back on my throwaway account. 

So I was on discord for a little bit and still felt that anxiety I was feeling earlier about feeling like I was being a burden, and I need help on what to do next. I believe I may have screwed up with a friend.

So as I said, I went onto discord and decided to join the group call that was going on (someone asked me to join which wasn't the friend I mentioned in the post above), and so I did for a little bit. However I felt rather awkward so I left and messaged the person saying I'm sorry but I couldn't stay in the call for a bit. 

Anyway, so I explained to the person what I said in my post about previous friends being toxic and how I felt like a burden to some people on my course. They told my college friend and pulled them into a private call to show them what I said (With permission) and they said my friend said something along the lines of ""Oh... uhm. Thats..."" something like that and I know for a fact when someone comes out with that, something is wrong. 

I've had one online friendship where I fucked it all over (read previous post for more) because of anxiety. I had only known that person for 4 months or something before I screwed it all over by telling them some shit that was happening IRL. I had depended on that person online for months to talk about shit and I definitely seemed like a manipulative person. 

But with that still in my mind from 2 years ago, I had learnt a lot from that year and now looking at my current situation, I do feel like the person didn't seem that close as I have only know them for 3 months so far. I think I went a bit too far? 

The thing with me is that I've already told him one thing (something similar to what I said in the previous post) and he didn't comment on it. Which either meant, he didn't want to speak about the topic or that I maybe screwed up again. 

I have a feeling that I should leave him alone for the next few days and then message him about what my friend told him. What's the best way to approach it? My friend probably has issues of their own and I maybe made them uncomfortable. Or that we weren't really friends in the first place and they were only talking to me to just be nice.

If you want further notes, I do sometimes message him on snapchat, but I do think I probably message a bit too much? I usually message like 4 times a week? So maybe I should cut it down for a bit?

God I just feel so bad. I didn't expect the person to tell my college friend what I said.

So please... could you help me figure out what to say to them?

It’s really messed up. I’m 20 and i should be out doing all these fun things other people my age are doing, but my anxiety has gotten so bad this year i can barely even leave my house. I can barely talk to people, i get panic attacks regularly and i am basically a nervous mess right now. 

A month ago i decided that i needed to do something, because i was starting to feel a little suicidal or at least have those thoughts.  I started going to a therapist 2 weeks ago, and when i went there for the first time i had a really bad anxiety attack at the cashier (you have to pay and give them info in the cashier before going in) and i basically had to run into the bathroom crying after now... so today i had to go there for the second time and i made my mom come with me to pay. It’s really embarrassing, i’m happy to have such a supporting mom but i just feel so bad about not even being able to talk to the cashier without panicking (just to be clear i have no problem paying in the cashier usually but since i had a panic attack there the last time i am now terrified of that happening there again. I also feel really anxious talking to my therapist, because i am afraid to shake in front of her or something like that. 

I just feel like i will never be able to become a normal person again. I am so incredibly tired, and i feel hopeless. My life has been full of pain ever since my anxiety issues started at 12, and now it’s so bad i can barely even go outside. I haven’t had a real friend since i was 14 and i lost all of my friends two years ago. I should be out there having fun, i have so many good things in my life but i have never lived a day in my life without fear since my anxiety started.

726," I'm 15 and turn 16 in about 2-3 months. My goal is to become a professional soccer player but I feel as this goal is unrealistic and I am not sure I can even accomplish it. I am fearful that it may be too late for me to try to go pro as currently I do not play for an academy or team. And I grew up pretty poor so I never played in an academy or professional training camp or a travel team, as I could not afford it, But I have played and practiced by myself and in free teams and clinics since I was 7. But I do not have much team experience.  Also, I am not an amazing player. I'm good but not amazing and I am rusty due to being home all year because of Covid. I had a lot of time this year to practice but covid was in my way and everything was closed. Is there any way I can make up for this time? I would hate for all if it to go wasted.  So, I also need time to get back in shape and get to that level of talent. And I don’t know if I have this amount of time since it may be too late. Also, I do not know the process of how one goes pro. I live in the U.S so I would like to play for the MLS. What are the direct steps I need to take to get really good and join a team in the MLS, and what is the best way of doing this? Joining an academy? Joining through college soccer? Trying out? I have no clue. Is this even possible or should I quit my dream? And is it too late to start my journey now? I am willing to train hours a day and do whatever it takes but I am fearful my goal is unrealistic and will never happen and I also don’t want to waste my time and end up not going pro and I do not know how one goes pro and how it all works and that I am not that naturally talented and I need to train to become that good But I do not know if I have that amount of time or if it’s possible.

On my final year of high school is where it started. On that year I became the opposite of my former self, I skipped classes regularly and I never did anything on time. I didn't fail that year due to the school system in the Netherlands and because I got the minimum grades needed to pass.
Then came university. At the start of the year I didn't do much wrong, but eventually I fell into my old habits. The only reason I passed that year was because the (BSA) the minimum (school points) quota of that year was dropped. Now I'm mine second year and I still haven't improved, I already failed some subjects and I know its impossible the pass this year because I have to pass this year and my previous Year. I have lied to them till today and I still am.

I got frustrated that I did the ritual and deleted the comments. I want to repost the comment on the page again. However, If I do repost the comment, I made an excuse saying I reposted the comment due to me accidently deleting the comment.

Or I was thinking of posting the comment, and then make another comment saying I had to repost due to me deleting the comment by accident. The thing is, I wanted to  post the two comments, because I feel I could get triggered in the post, if I post one comment saying the original comment, and adding I had to repost. If I see that comment in the future it could remind me of my ocd, and what caused it. (I feel my ocd came from childhood abuse I experienced in the past) it could make me think of the abuse and the unhappy memories.

752,"Some context:
I used to play only single player games and was really passionate about them, was always pulled into the story, just feeling the game. 
Then, in may, my good friend and lab partner got me into playing League of Legends with him, which is the first online multiplayer game I've ever really played. So I shifted from playing for myself and enjoying the pieces of art to just play LoL with him, which is honestly really fun, I really enjoy it, that's what I still do. And that is not my problem. The thing is, I continued to purchase games I'm interested in like I used to, stuff like Pathologic 2 (story focused, horror), Othercide (turn based, strategy), NieR:Automata (story focused, action jrpg), Control (action, haven't played it much yet). 
So I sit here with bunch of unfinished games which I can't get myself into really playing them. It's not like I'm not trying, each time I launch one of these and play a bit, it feels so, slow.., and especially when I die and have to replay parts of it, it just feels so tedious, so I just shut it down again because continuing would be a waste of time. 
Is this because I am too much invested and used to the feeling of this moba? 
Or could this of other reason? Before Corona came I used to enjoy these more relaxing single player games a lot after an exhausting day of university and lab training. But since everything's shut down uni life has become more chill itself so I don't need to rest and might rather enjoy some focus requirering games?
What do you think? Any advice?

753,"As the years pass by I have noticed my decrease in productiveness and all-around will to do things, most notable study. While I was attending elementary school my mom usually helped me with my homework and made sure I studied. Even then I wasn't really happy to do so but she gave me the push that I needed to do so. I passed all 4 grades with all As (European system). When I entered middle school I got a few new subjects, new teachers, and didn't study as much as my mom wasn't anywhere near as involved as she used to. I thought that I would pass this grade with a B but miraculously passed with an A(barely but I did). That trend would continue to now(I'm a sophomore in high school). I would say the change in productivity became obvious to me in 7th grade. I did study but not the amount that I should have to reach a place without worry of not passing the grade with an A. Things got to the point where I now can't tell you the number of times when I studied more than 10 minutes if there was not a test tomorrow(and even then I would need to push myself to do that for even an hour). The good thing is that I still have a sense of responsibility and fear of angry professors so I do all my assignments and homework. So that got me thinking. Did I get to this because I somehow managed to pass grades with an A each year even though I was positive that I wouldn't be able to and now I subconsciously think that I don't need to put much effort and still achieve what I could in the previous years.

756,"I’m not sure how to approach this but I am sixteen; I have thick hair down to my waist and it’s unintelligible in colour. It’s meant to be blonde but the roots are an ashy grey and the rest of it looks like a botched brown/blonde ombré with a last ditch bleach dip dye attempt at the ends which are all split and tangled. Also, it is incredibly greasy all over.

I do take care of my hair, I shower daily if I can and wash my hair four times a week with vegan shampoo and conditioner, then spend on average about forty minutes brushing and drying it thoroughly but for some reason it dries into a greasy, limp state. I’ve tried everything I can think of: cleaned my brushes, showered for more/less time, showered with colder/hotter water, changed up my products, used less/more products, I’ve even tried straightening my already rail straight hair yet nothing changes.

The only other thing I can do for it is to cut it but due to the pandemic and me being a young person I can’t get it done since the hairdressers are either shut or I simply can’t afford to have it done (I live in the UK and I’m aware that my parents are struggling financially.) 

I’ve given up at this point, I wasn’t too great at looking after myself due to my mental health so how much I loved my hair was my only motivator and now it’s gone completely off the rails for no reason. Where do I go from here? Do I just suck it up and cut it at home and risk ruining it even more or is there another solution? Keep in mind I’m only recently sixteen and I’m not too smart, thank you :((",26Nov2020,1

About 2-3 years ago I started getting really picky when it came to finding hair in anything. I would refuse to eat my meal if I found even one hair.

But in the last year or so its gotten much worse. I yell at people if they come near me while I’m eating, and will throw my food out if they don’t listen (even if I don’t see any hair in it), I won’t cook when other people are around, and won’t eat meals cooked by others either anymore. 

Even the thought of hair in anything I’m consuming instantly makes me disgusted to the point that I get nauseous and just feel completely gross.

Okay so basically I had been going to school and he piping exploded in the washrooms. So I had decided to create a small study group in nearby library so all the other students and I could possibly get some work done during the day hence it was around 1o am when this occurred. There was around 8 of who decided to go and study and then my ex had invited herself along We had gotten to the library and we had started to study uninterrupted, when my ex had started and arguement with me like she normally does when we are together (which is why we are no longer together) and had been trying to prove an invalid point (about big cats. Yes big cats... idk why she decided that but she did)which was distracting the other students who just wanted to get some work done( this had gone on got maybe 15 to 25 mins). The arguement came to an abrupt end when I had put my phone down and tried to change the subject to no avail. I had then stepped out side with four others for a smoke break due to the stress I also left my things up stairs in the library. We had gotten to talking about us going to a different place to study.  I had then gone back up grabs my things and left with out saying a word due to fear of starting another arguement. 
 
I'm not asking for anyone to start taking side I just want to know if I was in the wrong or being childish for doing so... and I have lost a few friends due to this... and I dont know what to do or say...

I’m essentially stuck at the minute living with my ex partner (33M). I’m not financially dependant on him but due to financial difficulty have basically depleted all of my savings and am looking to move. The main problem is that I’m uncomfortable living here any longer but have a dog to care for and work a minimum wage job. Due to having a dog I cannot work anymore hours than I already am and am also unable to move in with family members as they have dog reactive dogs.
Basically every single house is out of budget near me, and any council owned properties will not go to me as I have no children, am not pregnant and I’m technically not high priority.
I can’t afford to long term board my dog, but I’m not willing to rehome him as I’d more than likely be dead without him due to mental health issues. I don’t know where to go and I feel so trapped and defeated in the position I’m in.

This, for whatever reason made me feel extremely upset so I stood up and sat on a different table and continued to paint. But after a while, I left quickly in the direction of the toilet, closed the toilet cubicle  and Sat down forcing myself to cry. When no tears would come out anymore, I washed my makeup off to get rid of tear streaked stains and went back to class.

The lecturer came up to me and asked me if anything was alright. I told him about argument and he said she was probably upset and to apologise to her. So I did. I went up to her and asked her if she can talk to me outside since I didn’t want to everyone to overhear the conversation. She said she didn’t want to talk and didn’t even look at me as she said so. This pissed me off, so without rational thought I stormed off, kicking the bin on my way out. I went home and took the next day off.

I like fantasy and action types of things, angst, fluff whatever. Sometimes when something bad happens to me like for instance, a pet animal dying, idk if it’s actually sadness I feel by myself or it’s myself that thinks something in a movie/anime or whatever will happen. 
I used to be an attention seeker and I guess that has also been the problem right now. 
I’m sort of an attention right now as well but I don’t like too much attention. So I guess it’s a side effect from the past?? I’m not sure, I’m just really questioning myself whether if I actually am feeling that emotion or not. 
It also happens when one person I know is in bad mental state of mind. They tell me their problems and I be there for them, they say I’m worrying about them but it doesn’t feel like it, like I don’t have a fear for them. 

I haven’t told a single person this before, I have only had myself to find the answers but I might as well find advice on here.

I'm so mentally exhausted trying to get myself to care enough to do something, anything! But I won't. Why? Because people in effort for the things they value, and don't value myself one bit.

For context, his older brother (17m) is a local delinquent (kicked out of school, etc) and he’s not even living with their parents anymore, but with relatives down the street because their parents won’t take him back anymore.

Anyways, I asked what he was up to over there, and he texted that his brother had just “forced” him to get high, and that was all I got. It’s been silence from him so far, but it’s thanksgiving so he might be spending the rest of the day there I guess.

But still, should I be worried? I don’t know what kind of “high” it is, whether it’s soft stuff or stuff that I should actually be concerned about. And when he says “forced”, I don’t necessarily think he was pinned down and had drugs shoved down his throat. Being the younger brother who doesn’t see his older brother often, he might’ve just been pressured to try stuff he wouldn’t think he would usually try. But then again, his oldest brother has often used violence on my friend to get what he wants before, even AFTER he was kicked out of the house.

801,"hi! i have a small group of two other friends, and i want to show them that i’ve changed as a person.

back when we first met, i was so meek i could barely speak. through constant efforts to become a better person, i’ve changed so much and have become so much more outgoing. it sounds narcissistic, but i’m really proud of myself.

my only problem is that my friends don’t seem to acknowledge that i’ve changed; they still baby me in ways, and always ask when we go out together if i want them to order for me and stuff.. everyone else can see that i’ve changed, but is there any way for me to prove it to them too?",26Nov2020,1

803,"Throughout our whole year and a half relationship we've always argued about stupid unimportant things. He's so stubborn and I can be too because I dont like to let him walk all over me. Our relationship goes from one extreme to the next, when we're good anyone would think we're perfect together, but when we're bad its extremely toxic and he belittles me like nothing ive ever experienced before (and ive had some VERY toxic friendships).

His dad was physically and verbally abusive to him as a child and other experiences he went through led to him having a severe lack of trust issues, which has caused extreme paranoia and jealousy issues. But these deep rooted issues have always had an impact on our relationship - he'd blame the way he is on his past and say 'thats just how I am', but he's too proud to get any help. Anyway, for context, here's a few examples of some of the horrible things he's said and done to me only in the past month:

\- He caused an argument that lasted non-stop 9 hours (no exaggeration there), the day after my dog ive had since I was 10 passed away. The reason: I didnt appreciate him enough for buying us a TGI Fridays and Chinese takeaway that week.

\- He constantly tells me im pathetic, a cunt, childish, little girl, ungrateful, bitch, rat, nasty, horrible person, brat.. which are a few among many. He always reminds me that im far from perfect (which ive necver claimed to be), and how I shouldn't think that I should be treated like a queen. His justification for saying these things during arguments is because of his childhood or his anger issues.

\- (This isn't in the past month but I feel like its an honourable mention) Last year I went on my absolute dream holiday to Barbados with my parents that I had been waiting for 2 years for, and the ENTIRE time he made me feel guilty for being there and most days accused me of cheating on him there (which was pulled out of absolute thin air). I was on holiday with my parents, was sleeping in the room next to them, and was with them the whole time. As well as that, we were staying in a private condo at the very end of season so its not like there were loads of people or tourists around. Also, its not like I could go out and do my own thing either, I was 19 at the time and Barbados can be a very dangerous place for a young 5ft white girl tourist to just go and wander about lol. He completely ruined my dream holiday, there were multiple times where I was sat on the beach or out and about and I would be trying to cancel the fact that I was crying behind my sunglasses because of some of the things he said to me. He's done this way over 50 times before, accusing me of cheating on him as if he knows that its facts and he knows the truth. I want to add that I never have and never would cheat on someone, I couldn't ever hurt someone like that.

\- He never has anything nice to say about any of my friends either. He used to hardcore bitch about my best friend calling her a slut, scumbag, tramp etc. In hindsight, im realising how he actively tried to ruin my relationship with her because he had formed an opinion of her without actually getting to know. Same with other friendships ive had too.

\- He bitches about my family in a way that is subtle enough to not notice.

\- He gets angry at me when I dont reply to him properly when I'm at uni studying for 6- 8 hours at a time. I'm in my final year of uni and he knows how important it is for me and me to get a 1st class honours, but whenever I study he makes me feel guilty for it and like I ""dont want to spend time with him"" or ""trying to ignore him"". He has the most unmotivated and 'cant be bothered' mindset, that he makes me feel wrong for going on campus to study, when I could stay at home with him and study at home (which a lot of people struggle to do, myself included).

\-He'd have paranoid dreams where I'd be cheating on him or having threesomes with other couples that I'm friends with. When he'd tell me about them in the morning he'd tell me in a way that would make me feel guilty and be in a blunt mood with me all day as if id actually done it. At one point, because it was 3 nights in a row he had these dreams, he made me feel so guilty about it and didnt talk to me properly for days... to a point where I started to question myself and I felt like I had actually cheated on him when I knew in my heart that I hadn't. Honestly the amount of guilt he made me feel for cheating on him in his dreams is actually outrageous looking back on it.

I could go on for absolute hours, this is only a few examples of some of the names and arguments we've had this month, let alone the entire year and a half relationship... imagine that, we never even had a honeymoon period, it was just always argument after argument.

After talking to a supportive friend and hearing her outsiders view, she's made me realise that I deserve so much better, im such a caring, appreciative, kind person and I wouldn't hurt a fly, I'm starting ton realise now that I'm none of the words he described me as, but I believed I was at the time.

**This is where you guys come in:**

I have quite an emotional soul, and I feel guilty over the smallest things and naturally that guilt will be on repeat for weeks/months on end. I hate hurting people and although he is verbally abusive and doesn't appreciate me, I know for an absolute **fact** that he's head over heels in love with me and wouldn't take this breakup well AT ALL. Im so in love with him too though, our relationship genuinely can be the most special thing ever and we merge so well when we're both in good moods and a similar headspace. It honestly breaks my heart to have to break up with him, I feel like although he's brought so much upset in my life, he's balanced it out with all the happiness he's brought me too. Im really struggling with following through with this for that reason and because I dont want to break his and my heart, but I know it needs to be done. Im going to write him a letter outlining how I feel, and hand it to him tomorrow or Saturday.

If anyone can please send me support or advice, tips for writing the letter, even just sending me strength through your energy... please I would appreciate it so much and I know it would really make a difference when I go to write the letter tomorrow.... you have no idea how much your support will help me 🧡🧡🧡 Thanks in advance 🧡🧡🧡

809,"My story is an interesting one. I have always been a TERRIBLE student, usually just barely passing most classes. And I always HATED school. The amount of illness I felt in my bone marrow every time I had to go to school was indescribable. I hated it beyond all things. But somehow I managed to graduate an entire year early from high school. I cheated my way through online classes between the summer of 10th and 11th grade, and managed to get all my credits in time to graduate at the end of 11th grade. I'm sure many of my teachers were flabbergasted that I was graduating from high school at all, let alone an entire year early.

Now when it came to college, I had always, since I was 13, wanted to go to college in Italy. I had been to Italy 4 times before I graduated from HS and acquired dual Italian citizenship by descent along with my mother. The only problem was that Italian universities won't accept US high school graduates unless they've completely supplementary work, either 3 APs related to what they want to study or have done 2 years of community college. The only AP class I took in high school was AP Italian (and it was the only class I did not cheat in). I forgot to mention that I had been teaching myself Italian since I was 13 and taught it to myself well enough to test into AP Italian. I had never taken a formal Italian class before. AP Italian was the only class I ever got an A in in my entire school career.

So at the beginning of 11th grade I found out I was going to be able to graduate and tried and tried to find a way to get into an Italian university. I probably emailed over 100 universities in Italy and I would get up in the morning early at 5 am due to the time difference and call universities in italy to ask them if they could make an exception to the rules regarding US high school graduates because I have itailan citizenship. (They all said no).

But eventually I found out about a one year long course called a foundation year (basically a general studies course taught in italian) that a few universities in Italy have for people just in my case. Namely, foreigners who have completed their secondary schooling in their country but it is not sufficient to admittance to Italian universities (this also includes Russian diplomas, and most South American diplomas) The course was also for those who wanted to improve their italian language skills before enrolling in a degree course. those who successfully completed the course, passing all the exams, would be guaranteed a spot at the university for the next year as a degree seeking student. The course was open enrollment, as long as you got your high school diploma, you could get in.

So I enrolled in that course and moved to italy weeks after graduating high school in August of 2019 to attend this course. Low and behold, I didn't like it. It wasn't nearly as bad as high school but I still didn't enjoy it. Now don't get me wrong. I LOVE being in Italy, but I didn't really enjoy the whole school part. I didn't really get on with my classmates, and the only other American in my class didn't like me either, so I had like no one. I didn't enjoy the Italian classes (Which actually surprised me because I'm good at Italian and spoke it better than all the other students). The course had two parts to it, italian language courses, and general studies courses taught in Italian. I did really bad in the general studies courses. It was like I was back in high school, but I was struggling worse than I was in high school. I would score so low on tests and assignments. But the language wasn't the issues. I spoke Italian better than all three of my class mates in the general studies classess (there were only like 10 students total in this program), I'm just not good at academics. A combination of my ADHD and boredom have made it impossible for me to do well academically throughout my entire school career.

So basically in February when Covid came to italy the course went on Zoom and I stayed in my apartment that my parents rent for me and attended the lessons on zoom. (they rent me a 1,000 euro a month apartment in the center of the city because I didn't want to live in student housing, I'm very spoiled) In March I decided to just stop attending the zoom classes and I ghosted them. The people at the university tried to reach out to me like twice I think but I didn't respond. To this day they probably have no idea if I'm even alive or if I died of coven. I didn't want to keep spending 5 hours a day attending these zoom classes if I was just going to fail in the end anyway. So I didn't really flunk how as the title says, but I would have had I not decided to just stop attending classes.

So then I tried to figure out what I was going to do. Somehow I convinced myself that I could become a big time YouTuber and make a living from youtube and not have to go to college or have a real job. So from march to September I put all my time and effort into making youtube videos, and low and behold it hasn't gotten me anywhere and at the rate my channel is growing I'd never be able to make a living off of it.

I went on a huge trip around Europe this summer and visited a bunch of countries then came back to italy. I told my parents that I just didn't want to continue at that university and thought it would be better to get an American degree (they don't know I didn't complete my one year course). I told them that I wanted to take online classes from our local community college for two year and stay in italy while I did it and then transfer those credits to a degree in the us. So that's what I'm doing now. I've already daily two of the 4 classes I was taking, and I'll likely fail another one. I passed one only because I cheated.

So basically I'm not sure what to do. I don't believe that I am college material. I am not academically inclined. But I know that there's no way I could continue living as I am, traveling all the time, etc. unless I get a big time job like my mom, which requires a degree. I'm not sure what to do. Should I just keep wasting my parents money on these online CC classes that I keep failing until my mom retires and then go back to the US and work at mcdonalds for the rest of my life? I really don't see any viable way I will ever be successful. If I keep trying these CC classes I'll keep failing. If I try to go back to university in person I'll just fail. I have no motivation, and I've just been feeling depressed.",26Nov2020,1

I live in sober living recovering from drug addiction so the time being  I am stuck with him.

Basically this guy is using the F word and N word all the time to describe people of color he doesn't like or people he suspects to be gay.

But it goes deeper, it seems everyday he has some new theory on why gay people are inherently offensive or why black people are dangerous or less intelligent. He has hate pouring out of him, and when i have tried explaining to him that he is a hateful person he claims he is not at all or is just joking.

We just got into an argument where he said this football player dances around like a F\*\*\*\*\*. I asked him what's wrong with being gay. To which he tried to describe how gay sex is gross and not the same thing as having anal sex with a girl. He was trying to get me to say that gay sex offending to me. After he kept pressing i basically called him out for being a racist homophobic person that is making me feel uncomfortable. He claimed he is not being prejudice in any way. and laughed it off.

He is also saying how the one black person who lives here is bringing the whole house down because of the way black people behave in general.

Happy Thanksgiving, maybe I shouldn’t be making this post on a family day but my family has been tearing my mental stability apart for this reason:


They have different views, I’m ok with that. To each their own opinion. But recently my mother had to be put into quarantine cause her coworker came in close contact with someone who had covid. My mother isn’t a native speaker for English so I was trying to explain how she can sign up for a covid test to make sure she didn’t get it. Then she tells me that she doesn’t want to take a covid test and at that point, this was one of those things I didn’t understand. She’s putting the whole family at risk and we don’t know if she has it because she refuses to take the test. She’s also leaving the house too and literally my sister and I r trying to explain why you should at least take the test. 

But all of a sudden she starts inserting topics that don’t even relate to this situation. She starts screaming about how our political beliefs are stupid and goes on to list why we are horrible people because of who we voted for. It had nothing to do with the actual topic we were talking about and she kept basically bullying my sister and I and shaming us for who we voted for and then she shames me for being a lesbian and shames my sister’s boyfriend while my father just stands there doing nothing.

I have no car and my bike has been my only means of transportation so far. I am able to leave my son with a friend that I pay to take care of him while I’m off to work but thats that. So far financially it’s been tight, my first paycheck averaging about 700-800 will be for food and necessities while my second paycheck of the month goes completely to bills which all works out. I know 700-800 sounds like a lot but I slowly get drained of it due to having to have someone else take care of my son and buying everything necessary to take care of him. He is my first priority and whatever is left of the money I have I usually make it work for myself in terms of food but it’s usually tight to the point where I’m always waiting for the next check to come in earlier. I’m trying to look for another side job I could possibly do at home to earn some extra income because I only see myself stuck in this constant cycle of living paycheck to paycheck with no means of extra money to have to save for a car. It’s been really shitty to the point where I think that there’s no more point to even trying if you catch my drift but I still try regardless. I know I won’t be getting a car in the following months any time soon but I wanna at least try to get out of this pit that im stuck in. For now I’m just happy that I have just enough but when it’s to the point where if anything bad happens such as being laid off, fired, something with corona happens, and I miss a check then it’s literally the end of me. Overall I just want financial security and extra money at the end of the month to eventually get a car but I don’t know any options.",26Nov2020,1
835,"how do i improve myself. i am freshman in high school and i have a few pounds i want to shed off but nowhere to do it. I am not very popular and I want to be less socially anxious because I basically have to script every word i say or else it will come out weird. I also want to get better grades, even though I already get good grades, I want to push myself to be even better. I also want to find a style that fits me. I feel weird only wearing the same 5 outfits every week. Also, I need to be more confident and stop comparing myself to other people.  lastly, I want to be able to find someone that I can share my thoughts and issues with, I can never trust people to keep them a secret and I know my friends will make fun of some of the things I need help with.",26Nov2020,1

837,"So on Sunday I asked my (17m) girlfriend (18f) if she was free the following weekend to spend time together. She told me that she would let me know throughout the week. Then on Monday I texted her and we chatted for a bit about our day. Then I didn’t hear from her at all until today. On her story she tagged people who she was thankful for, and on the last slide she included a picture of us and said she was thankful for me. Of course I responded and wished her a happy thanksgiving and such. My only question is should I now ask if she figured out her schedule for us to get together?",26Nov2020,1
838,"I (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been dating for 6 years. We recently moved in together 5 months ago and my relationship has gotten worse. We don’t go out on dates, we don’t have any meaningful conversations, my bf is a borderline alcoholic, and I find myself enjoying time spent by myself or without him wherever I am. He doesn’t like people at all. I just don’t think we are compatible anymore. I’m just not sure if this is a “hump” in our relationship or if we’ve grown apart. I’m scared to break it off because we’ve both invested so much and I’m scared I’m letting the love of my life go.",26Nov2020,1

840,"And it's not just a photo, it's a screen recording I made of a snapchat she send me where she was showing how her ass looks while wearing no bra so I could see the boobs through the shirt.

What the F is wrong with me? I keep getting horny and screen record snapchats so I can jerk off to them later... How do I stop doing it? I can't tell her because she would be totally freakes out... 

I delete them sometimes when I realise what a creep I am, but then she sends another picture which makes me horny and it starts all over again...",26Nov2020,1
