1,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a few years now. At first, my relationship with his parents were great and they loved me, but now it is strained. I believe that there is no repair.

The reason our relationship is so strained is because my boyfriend has told his mother about every single one of our fights. He also would over exaggerate the fights. He would sometimes go to his moms house and sleep there for the night and talk to her about how terrible I was pretty much.

His mom has told my boyfriend to break up with me several time. She tells him that I’m crazy and not worth it.

Now I know that I’ll probably get a lot of “leave him” “red flag” comments BUT trust me I thought about it and almost did. But before leaving I decided to talk to him about it first. I talked to him and he understood what he had done to the relationship between me and his mother. I explained that I wasn’t trying to take away his communication from his mother. I just didn’t want him to talk about me badly anymore. 

As weird as it sounds, he’s actually not close to his family at all. He never visits them or talks to them UNLESS we are arguing and he wants to rant about me. I told him that to be honest he shouldn’t ever really talk to his family members about our fights. If he wants to rant about me in the heat of the moment, he can do it with his friends.

He ended up having a talk with his mom. He told her that he overreacted a lot. He said that usually we argued about small things like chores and it was never really serious but he always made it seem serious.

He was very apologetic toward me and ever since he had this talk with his mother, he has never ran to her about our problems again - this was almost a year ago.

The problem is that my relationship with his mom is not the same and it never will be. Every time I try to talk to her she doesn’t engage in the conversation. She doesn’t make eye contact with me. We don’t laugh and joke like we did when I first met her.

I tried telling her how I felt about our relationship. I felt like she didn’t want me around her family anymore. She said “That’s not true. I don’t hate you.”

So Reddit what do I do???",26May2020,1

3,"Ok so I (21 f) think I might have a crush on my STEP cousin (23 f), despite already being in a year-long relationship (with a 21f). I know it’s weird and gross but I know I’m not gonna act on it. She knows I’m into girls and my stepmom said she has a feeling that my step-cousin is into girls as well but like I said, I know there is no chance of anything happening. We were all in vacation this weekend and it really brought this thought to the surface. Am I gross for feeling this way? Is it more/less weird considering we aren’t blood related? What does this mean for my relationship? How do I get over this? Is this even a crush, or just a weird infatuation?",26May2020,1
4,"Using a throwaway for this one.

Her boyfriend has done the weirdest shit. He'd hit her, cut her while she sleeps (like, cutting initials into a tree), and so on. She generally has extremely low self-esteem so she usually ends up blaming herself for every single thing that happens to her, even the ones outside of anyone's control.

We've been drinking, and she had an absolute meltdown. Another friend and I tried our best to calm her down while we brought her home. During the meltdown she told me that she is anxious about every contact she has made, how she can't trust anyone. She'd even go as far as saying she had turned that ex bf from perfect to abusive. Like, as if she was responsible for some dick head's actions. She usually had friends who treated her like shit, and her previous boyfriends were utter abusive pieces of shit. There also is a serious history of self harm including a suicide attempt, among other things. She also has a hard time cutting out the people in her life that damage her (as in, she knows the people are bad, but always goes back to them after a while). 

She's going to therapy, but it seems obvious that this alone isn't helping her enough, especially since she is afraid of opening up to her therapist, and because her low self esteem make her think she doesn't deserve help or anything good at all.

Now, is there a way for me and my other friend to properly watch out? We currently just do regular check ups on how she's doing or what she is up to, occasionally just do stuff with her when she's feeling bad so she can talk about it or at least take off her mind for a while.

I don't want to be a guy who becomes overprotective and ends up damaging her although I had good intentions. Since she also gets easily attached I'm trying to avoid that she suddenly gets a wrong impression of me.

If anyone has ever dealt with similar issues, can you maybe share a couple things that could help someone who's in the same spot? We'd like to help her, because she definitely can't go through life functionally with these problems and although we've only known her for about a year, she seems to be a genuinely nice person.",26May2020,1
5,"I (f21) feel insecure when my bf (22m) watches porn. I've talked to hime about it before but he doesn't understand where I'm coming from. He cums ever time whenever we have sex so why does he feel the need to look at other women and pleasure himself. More often than not I feel whenever we have sex he will prematurely ejaculate leaving me unsatisfied. He says that he feels pressured and bad whenever this happens. And that when he is jacking off he feels no pressure and trys to work on his stamina. I dont notice any difference, and dont see why he can work on his stamina while having sex with me. I feel hurt whenever he looks at porn and I dont know why. I also read somewhere that when men watch porn they imagine having swx with that person rather than watching the sceene for what is. I dont want to restrict him but I don't know how to deal with my problems. It hurts me to the point that I dont have a sex drive. But I'd rather have sex with my bf when I'm not in the mood than him jerk off to another woman. Am I the problem? I just want to forget about how I feel towards all of this.",26May2020,1
6,"The past week or so I’ve been super sad. I couldn’t exactly pin point what was triggering it, but I think now know that it’s my constant feeling of loneliness especially due to quarantine. Last year I graduated high school and was really excited for the future. I had a great summer, got my first job, and even dated a guy who I thought was great at the time. Although my life is still good, and I have a lot to be grateful for, I feel like I don’t have anyone left besides my mom and occasionally my brother. I just feel kind of hopeless and can’t see past my current sad emotions. Will this go away? How can I cope with this? I find it hard to do every day tasks. I haven’t been eating much the past few days and I hate to be around my family because I don’t want them to think I’m being a whiny bitch. My birthday is tomorrow which also isn’t helping. Normally this is a happy time of year for me but I just feel so off this time. I just want to sleep for a few months and get to a better time, where i feel like I have people who care about me and things to accomplish in the world.",26May2020,1
7,"(By cancel it I mean still get married, but alone, in a courthouse)

I was originally planning to get married this summer, but with the current pandemic things have been delayed. I’ve been anxious about the social and financial components of the wedding since the very beginning, and now my fiancee and I are wondering if we should just get married with no guests, just the two of us. Honestly, I would prefer to have our 10 closest friends there (no family). That’s the kind of wedding I could actually get excited about. But she feels that if we include them we HAVE to invite our families. I suggested the idea of lying to the families and saying it was just the 2 of us, but she didn’t like that.

Here’s the thing, I’m more or less fine with having my dad, stepmom, siblings, and all her family there, but I really do not want my mom there. She’s not abusive or anything, I just don’t like her that much. She has been enough of a crazy b**** that I just don’t get a long with her (and I don’t give family special treatment). I don’t feel comfortable with her around. But she is super obsessed with me and and would be devastated if she were excluded, at least if other family was included.

For reference, I have another distant friend who has been a part of creating some negative drama in my life. I still like certain things about his personality, and I still talk to him casually sometimes, but I don’t trust him, and I definitely don’t want him there on my wedding day. That’s how it is with my mom: she’s still in my life, and that’s fine, but I don’t to have to put up with her on what’s supposed to be a day celebrating mine and my parter’s love.

People always say “It’s your wedding, it’s not about other people. Do what makes you happy.” but I think that’s because people always assume that what makes you happy will be including family members who aren’t abusive.",26May2020,1
8,"I'm a 24 yr old male and I had to go live with my parents again after getting a serious illness. Fortunately, by God's grace I'm healthy again and ready to go back into the world. I don't want to go into much detail but my parents have been extremely mentally abusive and were strict helicopter parents when I was a teen. When I moved back in I was met with more abuse. Now after graduating high school I went to community college for 2 years then went to university. The reason I still haven't graduated is because my illness made it difficult to complete my studies. I was living in college apartments for 3yrs but during those 3 years I didn't feel like I was fully off of my parents' leash. I had a job, I paid for rent, but I still needed to borrow money from them sometimes. The way I see it, If you have to borrow money from your parents a lot you're not fully off their leash. You're not fully independent until you're able to consistently pay for your living expenses. 

I want to graduate college, but it would take another year to graduate. I have a bigger desire to move out and be fully independent and off of their leash for good.  I'd rather graduate after the fact. 

How can I become fully financially independent? I have absolutely no clue how, no one really taught me. I understand getting a well paying job will be a solution, but without a degree it'd be somewhat difficult. Should I get a decent paying job and save up enough money to move out or should I try to apply for more student loans and go back to college? Whichever will make me financially independent faster is what i'm most interested in. If I go back in graduate college it's possible that I will have to move back in again to find a job, since most college students move back in temporary. Also my credit is probably horrible due to student loans and medical bills. Should I try to get a credit card anyway?

I didn’t know how to respond then and just kind of nervously giggled. How do you guys cope when you randomly get these negative memories in your head?

I’m always told you know that person is irrelevant, that I’m more successful, or that they’re jealous, and to know my worth.

2 years later, my current job isn't what I wanted it to be, so I desperately want to go back to school and work toward my dream job again.

14,"For some backstory both my parents are conspiracy theorists. Not like Earth is flat, even worse. They believe some shit like they're cloning fruits and putting LED's in the sky to control the weather or whatever. But around in December/January they bought about 30 acres of land in Arizona, and the reason I have an issue with the move is a couple different reasons is because I know out they're trying to isolate me and my brother and my future sibling from civilization. They believe school is meant to ""dumb down"" and ""indoctrinate"" us into their slave society. Which further means I won't have an education that goes further than the 7th grade. My brother currently is 4 years old and turns 5 in august.

But here's where my real issue comes in about it, is one night when my mom, my brother and I were at my aunts house visiting for her birthday I had told my aunt that I talked to my great aunt out in Iowa about my education and she said if my parents let me I was allowed to stay with her to finish my education. Now a little argument sparked up between my mom and aunt about parental disagreements and her concern for my little brother about his education when he becomes of age.

During the argument my aunt must've told my mom that I talked to my great aunt in Iowa about my concern for my future and when I grow up, and on the car ride back home that night. Along with her screaming and ranting about stuff which I can't really remember off the top of my head I specifically remember when she brought up about me talking to my great aunt, she said ""If you wanna go live somewhere else that's fine"" now with that I had a spark of hope that I could talk to my mom and dad about me going out and staying with my aunt in Iowa instead of going to Arizona and living on the farm, but I'm having a strange issue with my confidence to go and talk to my mom. My mom always said I was able to talk to her about just about anything but for some reason I've built up this ""image"" of her in the back of my mind picturing that she's gonna flip out about it and take away my phone and computer and never let me see the light of day ever again or something like that.

I really do need help with this and overcoming this image of my mom and dad I've kinda built up over time.

One day we decided to go to go get drinks which my friend answered: « Hey no sorry, I’m not rich like you guys soooo nah bye ».
 One time we were talking about clothes and I told her that clothes from [insert the shop’s name] were def not my taste and that I find them ugly in general.
-« Welp that’s where you go when you’re broke I guess »
-«  Umm no? There are some stores that are in the same price range but with better clothes...? »

-« I’m not rich and my parents refuse me to buy clothes most of the time »

19,"So I haven't been outside of my house ever since this whole covid thing happened, other than to walk my dog. I literally haven't been further than 100/150 meters from my house. Now, my country will start opening up restaurants, cinemas, cafés etc starting June 1st. So I was invited to go to the cinema June 1st, and I accepted since it's my favorite movie but I'm still very hesitant to be in a cinema, watching a movie with a bunch of strangers during these times.

Even more pressing, I'm supposed to go on holiday the 13th of July, and I'll be going by airplane. But that scares me even more, since I'll literally be breathing in recycled oxygen for 3 hours.

So on the one hand, I don't want to be inside my house 24/7 since I guess my country thinks its responsible to go outside, seeing as they are opening up everything. But I'm still quite worried about actually going through with it and going into public places.

22,"I just need to vent my feelings and get some advice on how to handle this situation and my emotions better. 

Background: my parents had me very young. They were both addicted to crack cocaine when I was a child so I lived with my grandma till I was about 8. My mom was worst off and came in and out a lot. My dad was young, but not as addicted as my mom. He still seen me and was in my life. Fast forward, my parents had my little brother. My mom completely changed her life. As of this Wednesday, my mom will be clean of 18 years. Growing up, my dad and me were very close. My mom and me have had a strained relationship. She always felt like more of an older sister than anything. My brother is 18, I am 22, my mom is 38 and my father is 41.

In 2017, my dad started using drugs again. He was 20 years sober when he relapsed. He lost multiple jobs, stolen from our family, drained our savings, been homeless, etc. When this all started, my mom lost her job because she was taking time off to take him to and from rehabs, etc. Due to this, our family ended up having our home foreclosed. My mom was the only one working and wasn’t able to afford it. When our house foreclosed, my dad was in rehab. I moved in with my uncle because the situation was causing me so much distress. I was extremely depressed, anxiety, etc. My mom, brother, and dad moved into an apartment not too far from me. My dad moved with them because he was out of rehab and begged my mom for another chance. They were going to church, meetings, really giving it a try. We’re in 2020 going on year 3 of my dads addiction. My parents relationship had became even more toxic including psychical fights. So much has happened that is extremely painful and hurtful. My dad smokes crack in the house all day even though my mother is an ex addict. His drug dealers have my moms apartment address (he doesn’t pay them- so that caused many issues). She works 3 jobs to pay all the bills in there apartment. He works 2 side jobs (cash- very scummy people so they don’t care he’s an addict) and he smokes it all up. I’m talking 1000$ in a laps of 1-2 days between him and his drug addict friends. He goes on binges for weeks, we think he’s dead half the time. Finally, my mom has had enough. She wants a divorce. She wants to leave. I recently got a 2 bedroom apartment and invited my mom wit me. We will be moving in this week. I have made it very clear to her that he isn’t allowed in my house. He isn’t even allowed to know where I live. My new place has security cameras that I will be monitoring, etc. 1) I don’t want to open up my heart to this relationship fully until I know he’s clean 2) I work very hard for what I have. I don’t want it stole from me. 3) they psychically fight and I don’t need the drama in my new place. My brother is going to stay with my uncle. My dad convinced the current landlord to resign his lease come July (he had the rent for June but smoked 1200$ in 1 day, now he has about 2 weeks to come up with this money or he prob. wont resign him but that’s another story). 

Today me and my mom went to pick up a coffee table for our place. On the drive, she started to tell me how my dad broke down to her. He began crying telling her that he’s so sorry for everything. He knows he ruined our lives and his. He knows he tore our family apart. He wants to change but his addiction is stronger than he is. He feels that nobody cares about him and we’re all leaving. This really hurt me. I love my father. I have morned my father for 3 years now. He’s alive but the father I knew and had is gone. Our family is gone. Every time my dad try’s to get clean, I go to the rehab to support him. He has been to 9 rehabs in the last 3 years and I have showed my face to every single one of them. I don’t have contact with him when I know he is doing drugs... I’ll be respectful if I see him “hi” and “bye” but I won’t help him get to work, I don’t continue conversations, etc. I do that to protect myself from the pain that letting him in causes me. I was in such a horrible place when this all started. I pushed away so many people with my anger and depression. I’m still not anywhere near 100%, but it has gotten easier to live my life. I just don’t know what to do. I feel so much pain thinking he’s really going to be alone. I feel so much fear thinking he is going to die from an overdose or hanging around the wrong people. We’ve gotten calls from the police multiple times saying they picked him up sleeping on park benches, stealing, etc. He has been doing what he wants, but has always had my mom as a security blanket to come back to- if nothing else for a hot meal and place to sleep. This time will be 100% different. I know this is what’s best for us (my mom, my brother, and me) because the whole environment is toxic, but I don’t know if there is anything I should do other than suck up this hurt and keep moving.",26May2020,1

As the title describes I was basically working at my first job when it was legal to get a government job in my state (14+). I want to know if my parents were correct about how they raised me.

I was homeschooled my entire school career I guess. My parents made me think that the whole world was terrible. It’s kind of weird thinking about how I had such a different upbringing than the majority of the population. They essentially taught me to be afraid of everything and or basically any person. 

So I grew up thinking their personal thoughts were always correct and mimicking their beliefs. I.e. “Gay people don’t deserve to be married, everyone is always trying to stab you in the back, people always want the worst for you.” Ect...
And being so impressionable and young growing up with having no friends for your entire life must be such a foreign concept to a lot of people. 
But thankfully I made a friend neighbor at at 13 because my parents forced me to be friends with her and associate with her. (We originally did NOT like eachother).
She then later expressed her opinions about how my parents were and exposed me to smoking weed and it lowkey really opened my eyes.

I am the eldest child of 4 and we have all been homeschooled our entire lives. I could go more into detail about how my parents and siblings are crazy in their own ways but I don’t want to bore you with the details.

So Ive been extremely depressed and very anxious my entire life. I suppose it stems from my parents because they are similar especially my mom. My mom never invested any time into my education after I was in 7th grade. They bought me all of the materials for each grade after than and she expected me to teach myself and correct my work there on out. Sometimes I cheated but I tried not to because I thought it as weird so I tried my best because around my teens I was intent on leaving asap. 

So today I posted two pics of me in my bikinis on Snapchat and my manager from my first summer job from ages (14-18) *I didn’t even know he had my snap “ said: “Wow pretty substantial change since I’ve seen you ”
I’m not sure how to interpret this.

29,"So I have a friend of mine who I have known for roughly 7 years and ever since we graduated, we became even closer friends, and we started sharing our failed dating experiences particularly through apps.This one day when we were together, he talked about how one of her school friends (who's 21, and i'm 26) has been sort of desperately finding someone particularly from my country of origin, and as he mentioned about her, I told him about the mutual friend of ours (and not about myself) who we can talk to about, but today, he called me saying he has some good news, which is he has found a *potential* girlfriend for me (obviously exaggerating at this point), but he goes on to say how he talked to that girl's sister about me and *praised* me in all possible ways and how perfect I could be for her. (I am that kind of a person who doesn't like this boasting about other and not really a fan of doing this stuff), and as he was explaining, I thought to myself as to what did I get myself into, especially when there are more parties involved now. I said this after looking at her photo, and also she's in the other part of the world and not sure if I'm okay with long distance.

Now they will create a group where they'll add me and her and kick things off from there. I am kind of clueless at this point. I am partly certain this wouldn't be happening but I said I have no problem talking to her and see how things go. But what if I don't find a legit reason to opt-out? How do I play it safe?",26May2020,1

32,"For context, me and my family decided to go up to Oregon for the weekend. I'm a little young to be on this website (13) and my brother is 15. His kids are 6 and 8. After a fun weekend, we decided to drive back home to the Bay Area.

He's always been nice to us, maybe a little pushy and bossy, but he's never made me scared do much before this. We were driving alone the road (Alongside it was the river from that Birdbox scene where they raft down the rapids). I had lost my mask and since his kid, who we'll call Cocoa, (his nickname) had the same mask, I thought he had took it. I asked Cocoa to give it back. He said it's his. I said I don't think it is, since my mask was bigger and that was a big mask. At this point, Asshole Stepdad (AS from here on out) turned around and told me to ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" and pulled over. My mom immediately got pissed and yelled at him. He ordered us all out and told us to empty our pockets. I did. Everyone else did.

I'll take credit for not looking. They found it under the seat, in a little spot that it kinda blended in. But AS started yelling, telling me that I was a piece of shit and saying if I wanted to fight him, he'd hit me. I said nothing, but my mom did. She told him to get away from me. He turned around and pushed her against the car, crushing her fingers. She punched at him, but he grabbed her, took her over to the ledge, and told her that ""I will push you off if you don't shut the fuck up."" I got out, told him to stop.

He grabbed me, and swung me around, dragging me against the floor. Eventually though, we all got back in, and we drove in silence. About 20 minutes later, he got pulled over. This is the following dialogue, paraphrased;

Cop 1: Hey, we got a call that something was going on. Mind stepping out of the vehicle?

Cop 2: Miss, you too. (Gesturing for my mom to come out)

After a while, they told me to come out as well.

 Cop 2: Hey, you're OP, right?

Me: Y-yes..

Cop 2: Mind if we get a statement?

Me: Yeah, um okay..

I told him everything that happened. He asked me if I had been hurt, and for my name and date of birth. I got back in.

Cop 2, leaning in through the door: I know this is a scary situation, everyone. I need to give these to you guys, and Miss, here are some numbers to call if this happens again.

He gave us some cheap teddy bears and went back to the car where AS was. They gave him a warning and he got back in. I was scared, I didn't like the thought of him driving. He could drive off and kill us all. For a while, there was silence. Eventually, Mom took over as driver.

Mom: Hey, do you have OP's Brother's wallet, it means alot to him and he wants it ba-

AS: I don't. Did he look?

Mom: Yes, but you took everything in his pockets and that was in it-

AS: Your kids are fucking liars and don't look for shit. Tell him to look more, Mom.

He was yelling at this point, and Mom was talking in a calm voice, carefully hesitant.

Mom: You should look too, his dad gave it to him-

AS: I don't care! If he lost it, and I find it, It's mine! Shut up and leave me alone!

Mom, obviously mad: STOP FUCKING INTERRUPTING!  GIVE HIM BACK HIS WALLET!

AS told her to fuck off, grabbed the wheel, and turned it. Mom barely avoided crashing.

AS: You wanna fucking die?!

Mom: Tell me when you're close enough, you're never going back into my fucking house.

That was the end of it. For now, at least. There's four more hours til we're back home. What should I do? (I'll update as soon as I can. If I don't, assume I'm dead.)",26May2020,1
33,I think I have these things called closed comedones. So I did my research and found a few products to help me with my problem. I’ve found in the past that I waste my money due to products not really helping me solve my problem and my skin is not worst compared to many so I shouldn’t complain. But this time I’m sure I found the right products or should I just go to the dermatologist?,26May2020,1
34," So I'm done with my senior year. So you all know the drill. FIND.A.JOB. 
 I know what I've been wanting to do since I was a in middle school was to be a welder. I've taken all the manufacturing classes I can get. Including all of the welding classes. I even went to a special trade center through my high school. I'm sorry I don't remember the term. But it went over everything besides electrical work on machines. So have half of the credits to get my first degree in multicraft.
 
 Many local businesseses have came into my high school and said they needed workers. They would always take a full hour of our class period preventing us to work and get experience. Even good as far as saying if we like you we will pay for your education to be certified. We aren't even looking certified people. We'll do an apprenticeship whatever we need to do to get you to work for us.

 I wish I was twisting the story,but I'm not before anyone goes you're just using that for ""is it because I'm a fill in the blank"" excuse. I've never been that way.  I've never been a feminist type. 
 My friends have landed jobs at these local businesses same age as me 18, and they're guys that have taken the same classes exactly. They're getting jobs and their schooling paid for by these local businesses. In class they would do the bare minimum; in fact, I would even do their shop work for them because ""they didn't know how to do it"" and I always got done before them so I could help them. 

 I started applying at these jobs that have been open for years on their sites. I've been applying since my school shut down in March and I haven't received anything back. My shop teacher has the hook up on jobs. He knows I went above and beyond to make my dream I've since 8th of becoming a welder/worker in the manufacturing place come true. I even lifted in the weight room to lift what the guys can lift so I could kept up with the physical aspect of it. I can lift just as much as them. I'd stay in the shop during study hall instead of doing other homework even when I was done with my projects to get better. 

 My shop hs shop teacher has told me they've contacted him about me. In his words I've talked helluva a lot better for you than anyone I ever have before. I've even had him see if I filled in my apps right. I know with covid going around it can affect it. They'd rather give the job to someone who's lost a job. I've called back to them too be told they're not hiring. When their site says they are. I know they could be getting more experienced people, or giving a single parent a job who lost theirs to covid.
 
 I just need to know if this is something I should give up on before, I commit to college and spend all this money on getting the fancy paper that says ""I can do it."" I don't have a very good home life I want out. So I need to know if I should just give up so I can move out sooner and look for a shitty minimum wage job save up and get my own place. 
 
 I need to face the reality of the situation if that's the case. I need to know if I've wasted so much time on this. I don't want to waste more time and money. When was at home working on the homework I didn't do in school because I was in the shop and not in study hall. 
 
 I could've been out hanging with friends and not staying up late working until the last minute to get stuff in on time. I could've been watching Netflix instead of watching YouTube videos of how to get better at a certain task. I could've been spending my money I got on whatever else I wanted instead of tools to practice at home in my free time . I just need to know if I should give up now and maybe try again later. I just need to know if all that stress that could've been avoided was for nothing and if I wasted the last half of my childhood on some stupid dream that came from seeing Rosie The Riveter and a couple YouTube videos of homemade projects was for nothing. As well as the I bet you're a lesbian talk that made me scared to come out for the longest time.

35,"Ok I know that no one can tell me “what to do with my life” and that “only I know what is best” but i’m so lost. I’m hitting a new low that I haven’t hit before. I don’t care about anything at this point because I feel so deep in this pit. I’m 19(f) I dropped out of college after my first semester due to depression/confusion on what my life even means (i’m basically having a prolonged existential crisis that won’t go away) I moved back in with my family (my family is extremely toxic) my home is so messy, chaotic , loud, and I can’t function here. My parents are like children they did not plan for my siblings or I and our futures so after high school I just have to “figure it out”. I’m not trying to complain and I know my life could be so much worse but I feel like crap. In high school I was really involved in music I started to learn guitar my junior year (i’m still learning) and i’ve been singing for as long as I can remember nothing live just in school extracurricular like choir, theater, or on social media. I was so delusional i’m high school and thought ok i’ll go to community college for basics then transfer to save money but when I started taking these basic classes I lost interest and was like “why am I spending my money on this bs” I don’t mean to bash higher education but Idk if it’s right for me. I did AP and made all A’s in high school but I hated every second of it. Anyways back to the present moment I don’t know what to do. I want to move out so bad but i’m so scared I don’t know how to do much like if I could even afford an apartment (i’ve been a barista for two years in my home town and saving) I don’t have much probably $5,000 to my name and luckily no student debt because I earned a scholarship for last semester of college. But I don’t want to go back to college unless it’s for music which is an associates program for production or music business at the community college. the community college I attended and this program is in the city near me but unfortunately my parents live far from I only went to this school last semester because I stayed at my grandmothers (I can’t do this again because she has mental issues and it’s too much pressure on me it’s very complicated and I made the decision to not go back there because it almost cause me to relive trauma I experienced last semester living there). I just want to be creative I need to express myself I know this post is all over the place and if you have read this far you’re probably so confused on what i’m even trying to get an answer on and I really don’t know I need advice or ideas. I feel so stupid like my brain says “music is a bad idea you started too late and it’s too competitive” and then my brain says “you’ll never be able to have a real career in anything you like your stuck” it goes on and on. I just want to run away and start over. I want to be successful so bad I don’t even care about money I really want to make a difference in some way I know it sounds cliche but I mean it. I feel like what else is the point of my existence I know this isn’t all for nothing but I don’t know what my “why” is yet. I know i s till young and naive but I’m just so directionless. thanks for reading all of this if you have it really means a lot to me.",26May2020,1
36,"So this situation isn’t mine, but rather that of a friend. So for a little backstory here, my friend was never given much free will growing up. She didn’t have any say in what she ate, what she wore, what she owned, what she studied, or who she spent time with. She was given 2 hours of free time a week which she could use for stuff other than studying or chores. She wasn’t really allowed to spend time with friends and was constantly expected to be perfect in everything she did.

Well, eventually my friend went off to college (one of the 2 schools her parents let her choose between) and began studying what they wanted her to. It was in college that the two of us met and became friends. Well, fast forward a few years later and my friend is feeling massive burnout from studying for her PhD (again, not her choice) and realized that she wanted to master out and actually get a job.

This has caused a ton of tensing between her and her family, but with some help from her therapist, my friend finally decided that she was going to go through with it despite what her parents thought.

This has lead to them freaking out at her and calling her ungrateful (they paid for her undergraduate education and now are acting like they wasted the money. They are also mad about the expenses of raising her since she’s not obeying them). 

Well, my friend now wants to cut contact with her parents. At this point she is financially independent, has her own apartment, and is searching for a job in her industry (she currently has a tutoring side job). The only problem is her sister.

My friend’s sister is autistic and her parents haven’t given her the help she has needed to grow properly. That has left her unable to attend to most basic life skills and without any personal contact methods. If my friend wants to keep her sister in her life, she has to do it through her parents.

And her parents won’t let them talk until my friend talks to them and listens to their lectures and insults first. Today they also intercepted her calls to her grandfather to wish him and happy birthday and prevented my friend from talking to him.

So now my friend isn’t sure what to do. She wants to cut her parents out of her life, but she doesn’t want to lose contact with the rest of her family. Especially her sister who wouldn’t understand what was happening and would think my friend just abandoned her. My friend’s parents are already telling the sister that my friend doesn’t care about her and it’s causing the sister to get really upset.

So now my friend isn’t sure to do and I’m not sure what the best advice is here, so I figured I would ask. Thanks in advance!

TLDR: my friend wants to cut her abusive parents out of her life, but if she does she will lose contact with other relatives, including her autistic sister who wouldn’t understand why she isn’t contacting her anymore.",26May2020,1
37,"I've decided the time has come to leave my employment. I've been working there 10 years. 

Things haven't been going excellently the last few months and overall I'm quite bored and frustrated, and I need a change - I've been wanting out for well over 2 years now. It's certainly not about money, although I will be giving up a good salary that may be hard to recover in the short-term. I'm going to hand in my notice in a few weeks. The team and office isn't what it was. There's no one in my age bracket anymore. Lots of problems!

How do I leave in a respectful way and maintain good relationships on the way out? How honest should I be? Do I criticise anything on the way out or just make it all about positive change for myself?

I don't have a new job to go to right now, I'm just taking some time out for myself for a while, with my girlfriend. So, I don't have a great story about why I am leaving the role. I essentially just need to change in a role that has become stagnant.

39,"Hello all. Let me tell you about my situation. About 2 years ago, I had lasik eye surgery. My vision was perfect for the first year. Regrettably, a combination of me not properly taking care of my eyes and staring at a computer screen all day has given me some eye problems. 

I have quite a bit of floaters. They are fairly invasive and become much more obvious when there's bright light. If I'm wearing shades it's usually like they're not even there. 

I have very light sensitive eyes now. Being inside anywhere where there is fluorescent lighting makes me have to squint and sometimes even look at the floor. 

Like I said, with sunglasses my eyes don't strain, and my floaters calm down quite a bit. What I'm worried about is looking like a total douche. There's a stereotype everywhere that wearing sunglasses indoors means you're trying way too hard; Like you're trying to make a fashion statement everywhere you go. I hate the idea of it, and I'd rather not have people judging me for wearing them, or giving me weird looks.

Do you think it would be acceptable for me to wear sunglasses indoors and outdoors anytime I go out? Should I just deal with it?

I love my best friend to bits but we drifted apart after he moved to the other side of the country and our relationship deteriorated. That is no excuse for what I have done and I feel guilty as hell for it still. But this girl is special. She is so special and I know for a fact that I would not have done this if this girl wasn't so amazing. We talked all the time, flirted with each other and just were really into each other I guess. 

Things went bad though. My ex-girlfriend and I met up one day and she noticed Tammy popping up on my phone. She confronted me about it and told my friend. This resulted in him threatening to murder me. He calmed down eventually but said if I carried on he would kill me.  Whilst him and Tammy were together they were very serious and their relationship lasted around 3 years. 

After this incident things were not the same between us, we messaged a little after that but replies were getting lazier and things were just not like they were before it.

59,"My (17F) parents split when I was in 6th grade. I live in Wisconsin with my dad and sister, neither of whom I like. Occasionally I get along with my sister for a couple hours, but she frequently does things that make me extremely angry. My dad yells at both of us a few times per week and doesn’t exactly show any love. I don’t always feel safe around my dad and sister (although my dad has never hit me) which only makes my anxiety worse. 

My ren (short for parent; they’re agender) left for Arizona on the day the suddenly split up. My sister and I visit them for a month in the summer. I actually like them! We have a lot in common and get along well. I think I would feel a LOT more cared for living with them.

As a 17-year-old, I believe I have the right to decide which parent I live with, and I believe my dad will let me (my ren would prefer we live with them). If I decided to move, my sister would probably want to follow me. I’m not sure whether my dad would let her or not. I would rather get away from her, but even just being able to get away from my dad would be nice. There are three big things stopping me from deciding to move, though.

1. School. I go to a project-based learning charter school, and we earn credit in smaller chunks than the typical half credit per class. These chunks don’t get officially transcripted until we reach a half credit in that class. Because of this, I have a lot of incomplete credit scattered in different classes rather than complete credits. I recently asked my teacher about this, and she said that with what I currently have, she could probably compile them into enough complete credits that I would still be able to graduate after one more year of normal high school classes. This isn’t a 100% guarantee, though.

2. Friends. I have social anxiety, so approaching people and making new friends is really scary to me, especially when there’s nothing actively requiring us to talk to each other (group projects, mutual friends, etc.). I’m very afraid that I would have a hard time making new friends if I leave behind all of my old ones and start in a new school halfway across the country. 

3. Making a big decision and leaving almost everything I know behind. On that fateful day in 6th grade, I decided to stay here, and that’s what I’ve continued to decide since. Staying here is a lot easier than moving. Staying here isn’t even a choice to make, it’s the default option. Big decisions scare me. There are so many things that could be bad about this. I would also be living in a completely different environment. I love the forests and trees Wisconsin has to offer; Arizona is completely different. From what I’ve seen, it’s not necessarily awful, but I love leafy green plants and would be sad to leave them behind. 

Other, smaller pros and cons of leaving include but are not limited to: house size (con), wifi access (pro), financial stability (probably con?) 

I only have one year left of high school, and I’ve toughed it out with my dad this long. Honestly, before I started thinking about it today, I had never been this tempted to leave. I have no idea where I want to go to college yet, so that’s not an issue. The idea of actually deciding to move sounds terrifying and kind of impossible, but living with a parent who actually shows that they care about me sounds really, really nice.

67,"Hi all, 
So I bought my condo almost a year ago. When I moved in my neighbors dogs didn't excessively bark. I think this was because her roommate had a different work schedule than she does so someone was always there. Unfortunately, her roommate decided to move out about three months after I moved in. This is when the barking problems started. 

I should preface this next part with the fact that I think my neighbor is a lovely person but I honestly don't think she should have dogs. As a dog person myself, I also understand that dogs will bark and I'm okay with a normal amount of barking.

After the roommate moved out her dogs barking slowly got worse and worse. When she is not home her dogs bark for hours. I've even timed their barking a couple of times. The first time it was four hours before they stopped barking. It was after this occurrence that I tried to talk to her about the barking.

The problem was that she is almost never at her condo. I believe that around the time her roommate moved out she started dating her boyfriend. She stays at his house most of the time. I feel bad for her two dogs because somedays she's only home for 5 to 10 minutes.

I attempted to talk to her face to face on multiple occasions. I knocked on her door multiple times when her car was in the parking lot and she would never answer. After another multiple hour barking spree I was finally fed up enough to leave a note on her door. This may make me a horrible person, but if the note hadn't worked my next step would have been to make a noise complaint. Luckly, it didn't come to that. She knocked on my door the next day saying that she had bought a device that was supposed to cause her dogs to bark less. 

For the next couple of months her dogs barked much, much less. She was also home more often. I think her boyfriend may have moved in with her. I was just relieved that I didn't have to get the authorities involved. 

Sadly, at the start of my states stay at home order her dogs started barking for hours at a time agian. The first couple of days I thought it was a fluke so I waited it out but after a week I started to try to contact her agian. Knocked on her door on multiple occasions and nothing. So, I ended up leaving another note on her door. When nothing improved and she didn't come talk to me I knocked on her door agian. Her boyfriend answered and started chewing me out for leaving the note on the door. He didn't believe that they were barking and wouldn't let me get a word in. As he was ranting to me I started to play the six hour long recording I have of her dogs barking during the day.

He shut up and I told him that I don't care if the bark for ten or twenty or even thirty minutes but that the recording is six hours long and the dogs never took a break longer than three minutes that whole time.  

Finally, my neighbor made it to the door and we talked civilly. We ended up exchanging numbers so I could let her know when her dogs are being excessive barkers so that she can check that the bark box didn't run out of batteries. The barking was better for two weeks. 

Now, in this two week span she broke up with her boyfriend and met another guy. The amount of time she spent at her condo dropped agian and the dogs started barking for hours at a time. (I honestly suspect that one of her dogs has separation anxiety) The problem now is that her dogs have taken up to barking past 11pm and sometimes they bark until 3 or 4am. My work starts at 7am and I am a light sleeper so this often keeps me up. I've texted her several times past midnight about them barking and nothing has changed. I don't want to have to either make a noise complaint to the cops or the COA mostly because I'm afraid she or her new boyfriend will vandalize my car, condo door or balcony if I do. I feel like at this point its my only option. Anyone have any suggestions to avoid this?",26May2020,1

69,"Hey everyone, I am 19 y/o (M), and I currently have the opportunity to become a dispatcher in my small hometown/county. I currently work at a burger hut, also in my hometown. I usually average about 25-30 hours a week here working part-time, however, with me going into my second year of college this coming fall I am going to need something that pays better, with more hours. Dispatching would provide almost double in $/hr, and would be 40 hours a week. Dispatching also includes benefits. The schedule is likely to be four 10hr days or five 8hr days a week.

I would really love to apply for the dispatching job, except I'm struggling to convince myself to quit my current job of 3 years where they heavily rely on me. I know the dispatching job is a much better option due to the increase in pay but I feel guilty for wanting to leave my current job.

Also, I'm worried that when school starts up again, (my school hours are 8am to 11am with a 1-hour drive to and from) I will be overwhelmed with the long shifts and school-work.

Dispatching would make paying for school and my car much easier, and hopefully will allow me to move out in the near future. I'm just struggling to go through with such a drastic change in my life.

Can I get some advice?

72,"Hello! 4 days ago, my family began hunting for a yellow lab female puppy (a very young one) that's $1200 or less. For almost 3 days, my mom spent either half or full of these days examining hundreds of websites, searching for a puppy. I recently joined her, because she stayed up all last night and all of today trying to find a puppy, found a deal, and we realized that we were about to get scammed (my half-sister told my dad about her friend getting scammed by the same people). Since it's quarantine times, many saw the situation as an opportunity to steal money from others. We quit the adoption just before it couldn't be quitted. Now my mom is tired and upset, (she hasn't slept in 34 hours for this) who expected a puppy to come in 48 hours for only $500, which seemed too good to be true - because it was.

75,"i hope this is the right place to post this and ask for help! this is gonna be a long one because it has a lot of backstory. 

i’m 18, almost 19, and i live with my parents. i have a boyfriend who i’m in a very serious relationship with and who i want to live with eventually, but it isn’t happening immediately. that’s only a little important to this situation but still some info to consider! i’m a second year college student going for my masters degree within 5 years. i’m struggling more than i ever have with money right now. i’m in a lot of debt just from my first year of college which is weighing on me too. 

i moved into a dorm last year and was there until i had to leave very suddenly because of miss covid, and i felt the difference as soon as i moved back in with my parents. i have ALWAYS been independent. i have a very “f it, i’ll do it myself” attitude about life. i loved being on my own and i was honestly heartbroken when i had to leave. i don’t mind living with my parents but even small amounts of time away like dog sitting with my boyfriend or spending the night at a friends house show me how much stress and emptiness i feel when i’m home. i’m always the leader and the decision maker in my life but in this case, i’m completely lost. 

my parents want to move out to the “country” near where my dads friends from work live. they want secluded, fields, backroads, nothing else for miles type of living. i am not that girl. i thrive in the city. i need action and movement and modern architecture. it might sound stupid but being in city-like areas makes me the happiest and it’s part of why i got so attached to my dorm. i was right on campus in a city i love. while my relationship with my parents is alright, i really don’t want to move with them. 

i don’t want to sound entitled but i also want to be honest. i don’t want to live in the country. i know that i will be miserable. it is every living condition that i despise. i don’t like living with my parents because i don’t feel free or independent, and we’re so different from one another that i’m not happy living this way. i know i sound like the biggest brat in the world but it’s part of why i want to live somewhere else. i just want to be on my own and have a space that’s entirely my own that my boyfriend can eventually join me in and that we can make ours. 

i’m a full-time student, and an overachiever meaning just full-time isn’t enough and i like to add on a few extra credit hours, and i have a part-time job that doesn’t pay very good but that i love and that i’ll be changing my school schedule for so i can work more. it’s not a career by any means but i love my job and my coworkers and plan to stay there until i qualify for jobs that align with my major. 

i have a few options that i’m considering: 

1. suck it up and live with my parents. whether it’s until i can better afford my own place, until i graduate and get a better job, until my boyfriend and i move in together, or something else. i’d save a lot of money this way but i’d have to drive ~2 hrs every day for school and get a different job. 

2. take classes entirely online, switch to working full-time, and get an apartment. something that isn’t outrageous but that also isn’t in a bad part of the city or in bad shape. i’d prefer not to take classes entirely online because i don’t do as well in online classes, but if it means working more and supporting myself then i absolutely will. i already work my ass off in school so doing so to succeed in online classes is doable. 

3. buy a house. id also pick up more hours at work if i did this but it wouldn’t be as much drastic as if i get an apartment, and i could still take some classes in person. there are a lot of cheap houses in my area and in the city near my university. they would cost less monthly than an apartment, even after paying for utilities. i’ve found a handful that i like and that, from pictures, look nice and live-able. of course they’d have to be toured and inspected but they’re in the running and i’m considering them! this is the option i know the least about. i’m entirely ignorant to home ownership. 

the thing is, i’ve never lived alone besides living in my dorm which is still very different from having an apartment or buying a house. i want to live with my boyfriend eventually and he’d be joining me wherever i live if i don’t stay with my parents. i want so badly to be independent and on my own and live the life i wanna live. it won’t be easy and i think i’ll always struggle with money, but it’s worth it to me and it’s a risk i want to take to be independent and progress in my life. 

i honestly know nothing about homeownership and how it could effect me in the long run or what a smart choice is. i appreciate any responses to this and any advice! if you need more info about the situation please let me know!!! thank you for your time and for reading this!! and if you’re able to educate me whatsoever please do, i know i’m a stupid kid and know nothing about what i’m talking about lol.",26May2020,1

77,"I'm Kyle, a 17 year old student from the North of England.

Before I begin there are a few things I feel I should get off my chest.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly I am NOT happy. I constantly feel like all my problems are being suppressed by my loneliness. By that I mean I can't talk to anyone as I have literally no-one aside from my Mother. No brothers, sisters or best friends. I never have anyone to talk too about my feelings.

My Dad left at an early age. He was very abusive. When I was around 11 another man was introduced into our lives. He was good for about a year until he went both physically and verbally abusive. I have family that live a few hours away but they all fell out 

with my mother. Aunties, uncles, cousins and grandparents.

We moved to my current location (Cumbria) when I hit 12. This meant me moving away from all my current friends that I lived near and went to school with. This is when shit really hit the fan. I'm not an awkward person and found it very easy to fit into my new school. I made loads of new friends but none of them felt like friends. They were just friends at school. We never met outside of school and I never really had one friend that I could turn too with my problems. We just all hung out together because that's all we could do.

Since I was about 9 I had a burning passion about moving too America or Canada. We've visited before  and I know that it's 100% a place I would love to spend the rest of my life living in.

Obviously asking my mum to just move countries is ridiculous. Especially with corona virus going on. But I know that I live in a VERY bad environment. There are times where I have turned to drugs and self harm. If I don't change how I live I will do something stupid. I've not shared that information with anyone ever, not even my mum. Thoughts of suicide are always lurking and edging me on. Now I must say I am a pretty normal guy. I like gaming, I have two motorbikes (motocross and a super sports bike) I play the guitar and I also skate. But my life seems to be overwhelming. I have all these problems and I can't let them out by talking to people because no one will take me seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a plan on how to go:

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I would sell my gaming PC and my two motorbikes. This would get me at least £3500. If I sold my other belongings as well I could be looking at up to £4000. It sounds bad but my mum wouldn't mind if I took a couple of hundred as long as she knew I was safe. I will always pay her back and she knows that. So let's say I have around 4000 GBP which is around 4800 dollars. This can pay for my plane ticket. I will go there as a tourist and drive a few states away then stay as an immigrant.

&amp;#x200B;

I was also thinking of vlogging the whole experience. I have done vlogs before when I went travelling to India. I think it would be interesting to watch it all back and hopefully post it all. Perhaps that could be a dope series, however, that's just a thought. Back to the main point:

&amp;#x200B;

If I find a cash in hand job I can find a flat to live in where I can rent. 4800 dollars is plenty to keep me going whilst I find a job and will leave me some left over. Now that I'm in the USA/Canada I can work on getting a citizenship. Of course there are many ways to do this but one of the easier ways to do it is by marrying somebody. There are other ways but that will be something to figure out closer to the time. After this point I find a good old job and live out my life in a country of my dreams. When I turn around 20 my mother will definitely move to my location. She has always wanted to move to Canada but she doesn't want to risk losing everything in the process. She has a good job and a house etc.

&amp;#x200B;

She has all these problems, I'm just 17. I don't want to live like that.

What do I have to lose? I'm thinking of just sending it but I'd like some opinions first.

Thanks,

Kyle",26May2020,1
78,"this is my first post please go easy on me tehe
i don’t think anyone will see this anyway but if you do it’s long and i’m very sorry!!
so before october 2019 my (f19) life was good and i was grateful, but it stopped after. it happened when my brother had a heart attack and my grandad had passed away. life was already tough for me at the time but i thought at least i had my friends
i was really really hurt in these times so i thought it would be best to talk it out with my friends, but they didn’t seem to care, and i felt as if i was a burden which hurt. i know they don’t owe me anything and they’re not my therapists but i’d gone above and beyond for them and i just wanted to talk about my situation, idk maybe i’m just being dramatic???
but when i would sit on our table with my friends i would really feel like i was going to burst into tears so i told them i think it’s be best for me to sit in a different area for a while just to distract me, which they COMPLETELY understood
over the course of three weeks i’d sit in a different area while trying to maintain my relationship with my friends but all of a sudden i felt like about 4 from the group suddenly didn’t like me so i sat back on the table to test what they’d do. these 4 were the ones i was closest with. 
they seemed to be off with me like i’d done something wrong especially this one girl who i’ll call A. 
after that lunch break i decided to speak to her, and she had told me she was upset at me because i never told her my grandad had passed away but someone who isn’t in the group knew before her which to me was so unfair but i didn’t want to cause anymore harm so i kept saying sorry and she ‘forgave’ me and i thought we were ok. this happened on a friday so we had a weekend where i thought everything was normal until i found out they had a groupchat without me which i won’t go into details about  
so i come into school and it feels like everything is worse! i sit on the table and A and the three other girls keep rushing off to the toilets and giggling
it hurt that i knew i was the reason why especially since we were supposed to be the closest
this was start of december and this is where the bullying started. A would be so mean to me to the point where i didn’t want to come to school which was hard because my home life wasn’t good either which she knew so did the others and they joined in 
she would purposely tell all the girls she loved them and then leave me out, she would shout at me if i sat in the wrong seat she spread a lie to another friend that i said that friend was ‘annoying’ every time i was talking to someone she would barge in and steer them away from me, she would say to everyone i was ‘fake’
i left the group in early january. but the bullying carried on and then the three other girls joined in. 
this got to the point where i self harmed. the three girls stopped when they found at 
i would always wear my friends jumper at pe to cover them because my shirt had short sleeves, when A found out she asked said friend for the jumper just so i couldn’t wear it. so everyone saw what i did and it was the most embarrassing thing. 
anyways the three girls stopped after they saw and found out which was in March. 
MARCH!!!!!
i became civil with them 
there was another day in pe where i was put in a group with them to play dodgeball. A was mad at this and joined our team and they got really mad at her for it. she said she was ‘just trying to protect them from the corona disease’ which i personally thought was silly because it’s a virus!!!
again i never said anything and i let her say it but they didn’t they shouted at her and i don’t think they like her very much now which i don’t care for i’d never trust them again
now i tell this because of this i have no friends. well i have friends but this really opened my eyes. i’ve always been there for people who wouldn’t do the same and i was too stupid to realise it. everyone has their group their someone and i have nobody and i feel as though i never will
i self harmed again last week
my relationship with my family is bad i don’t really like talking to them, they’re all controversial but i live with them so it’s awkward
my brother is now in a vegetative state and his brain is almost completely damaged 
i just don’t know what to do, i’m just alone now 
i’m mad at everything constantly everything irks me 
i just want one genuine friend 
and it’s annoying when i say this and everyone says ‘i’m your friend’ and act offended, but they’ve never done anything to prove to me they really are so why are they so shocked by what i said?
my question is is how do i get happy again, my life wasn’t exactly perfect before this either but i only cried like once a month and now cry almost every day lmao
like what do i do????? sorry this was long stay safe &lt;3",26May2020,1

80,"I added a link to a more in depth post at the end of this post; but I feel some context is appropriate. 

I’ve been friends with my “bestie” for 14 years. Our friendship has had its ups and downs, but I think I’ve finally reached my breaking point. About two weeks ago I asked her to be my maid of honor and she gleefully accepted and made a huge deal about it on social media. Since then, we’ve had some other issues and then last week got into a big fight. I explained after our fight that a lot of what she said was wildly inappropriate and said I needed some time to think. Two days later, I sent her a long message apologizing for the fight and saying I stood by some of the things I was upset about but offered several ways that we could both contribute to fostering better dynamics in our friendship, and that she’s still my maid of honor as long as she can put in the work. I also added that I’m open to anything else she has to say or constructive criticism she wanted to share. 

She’s ignored me for several days now. This is exactly the kind of petty, childish shit that led us down the road we’re currently on. After 14 years, I’m sick of this. With every day that passes, I’m more sure that I’ll be telling her that she is no longer going to be my MOH. At this point I’m not even sure I want her to be my friend at all anymore, but I don’t want to be overly cold or rude. 

How best do I approach this subject? I want to be firm in that she won’t be changing my mind on this, but I don’t want to be hurtful as she doesn’t have a lot of friends other than me.

She has a weird kind of obsession/possession over them and constantly seems to be competing with me? I tried to become her friend too at first but pretty much from the get go it was clear how hard she was trying to make sure I'm not included.(Buying shots at a bar for everyone but me, snide comments at my expense, etc.) This happened for months and I brought it up with the people I live with but they excused it all saying i was overthinking. Over time they eventually noticed and said it themselves but they continued to invite her with no effort to include me even though i've expressed how it hurts my feelings when they do that. Makes me feel like im on the back burner ya know? Well anyways, this would be easier to get over if she didnt recently disrespect me and invite herself over on the day my best friend died(we were thick as thieves from the age 2-21years old) I told my boyfriend and roommate i'd be uncomfortable with their friend coming over the day i found out(i had been bawling all day) their friend kept asking to come over and i witnessed their texts saying my friend died and it wasn't a good time but then 15minutes later, who shows up at our doorstep saying ""don't worry, i knew you guys would need my support"" and then blatantly ignored me all night and comforted them? You guessed it. I've been growing a massive hatred for her after this and i realize its associated with my anger at the world but even after telling my boyfriend and roommate how i feel AGAIN, they continually invite her over.

I would honestly give anything to have things back the way they were, but I think it's for the best that things stay how they are despite how much it hurts. 
I'm feeling so much better than I was back then and I've moved on from how I was wronged by them, but despite how the end of our friendships went I still feel such heartache whenever I'm reminded of them. My best friend says I'm being silly and that it's not a big deal, but he doesn't understand just how much I'm hurting and he makes me feel a little stupid about it.

Yesterday I was talking about GTA glitches with my 17 year old friends and how I used a certain glitch to make a lot of money. I said I can give out the tutorials and stuff. My friend asked me if I can do it for him. I said no, I don’t have the time, but I can teach you how to do it. He then says I do have the time and if I can please do it. I said no I can’t , I can teach him. Then he escalates it and agressively that I have all the time in the world to do the glitch for myself (which I don’t) so I should do it for him. I, dumbfounded by this entitlement, declined the favor and repeated that I can teach him how to do it. Then he escalated it even more and said he’s going to leave the party then if I “don’t want to help him.” I said ok, and you can learn how to do the glitch. Keep in mind this is a friend I had for over 10 years and we keep in touch often, from biking to playing games together. He doesn’t want to talk to me because i don’t have time to do a favor for him even though I’m trying to help him do the favor. So stupid. And today he only invited my other friend to play instead of both of us, and he’s basically ignoring me. Who is he to act so entitled and cross my boundaries?

94,"I (30M) met my fiancé (27F) in a large southern city in 2017. She’s from coastal New England and had moved down there to get out of New England
and more importantly, to get away from her parents.  We had our son in 2018 and while I made decent money, my work schedule was unpredictable (on call) and extremely stressful. 

When I met her, I was living in an apartment with my younger brother and we were basically two beer drinking bachelors without a care in the world other than work and bills. Needless to say, I had to switch gears pretty quickly and make some hard choices. It was immediately clear that we couldn’t afford to live in this city and that if we did, we would be broke and living in a shitty apartment with a newborn. Her parents offered to let us stay with them. Against her wishes, I said we should move and we did. Needless to say, having a child at that stage of my life was a very foolish choice. 

Fast forward to today, May 25th. My fiancé desperately wants a home of our own, primarily to escape her parents. We’ve been hammering out the details of an FHA loan. We can’t afford the mortgage and the seller won’t budge on their counter offer. The payment would leave us with a $100/month margin of error which is financially disastrous and would put extreme stress on our relationship. My fiancé is in tears because she hates her parents because she thinks they hate her. We were literally discussing the details of the mortgage with her father and somehow the conversation got routed back to the death of her aunt many years ago which apparently caused a massive rift in the family that has never been healed. My fiancé thinks her mother blames her for her aunt’s death. It’s all so fucked up and I don’t know what to do other than keep saving money and waiting for a sensible home that we can afford. Meanwhile, my fiancé is spiraling into anxiety and depression because of the toxic relationship she has with her parents. She’s upstairs hiding in the bedroom. 

If anyone reads this and wishes to provide input, I will request that they be in their 30s and/or older. I see a lot of teenagers posting on this sub, and no disrespect to teens (I was one too), but these kinds of problems are things that older people have dealt with and can provide some perspective on.

I recently found out through the online sex offender registry and some further digging that someone that regularly attends my church was arrested for possession of child pornography. At first I didn’t believe it, but after more investigation everything began to line up: the name down to the middle initial, the exact age, the school district they were in, their face- everything. The offense happened about a decade ago, and nothing (as far as I know) has happened since. 

So... advice? What am I supposed to do with this information? I’m friends with one member of his family so I maybe could ask about it, but I don’t know if that’s my best option as I wouldn’t exactly feel comfortable doing that. Should I keep this information to myself? I’m still not 1000% sure that it’s true, but enough lines up that it makes me worried.

The classes I do in college are all male for the most part with the random female occasionally since they’re shop classes. I’ve tried all sorts of tactics on eight different girls so far. Most of the time you find out they actually have a boyfriend already. In one case she came out as lesbian after I asked her. It’s just so frustrating getting turned down this many times. Taking it crawling slow sometimes going fast at others and nothing honestly seems to work. That and I don’t really get many opportunities. Because as I said women are really rare in my life as most of the time it’s guys I’m talking too. Even at work. I’ve been single for a year and a half. The only reason I got one then was because I got hooked up. We never should have even dated because I lowered my standards and you should never do that. Also I will not online date I refuse.

I am seeing a therapist and I’m on medication for my behaviors. 

I’ve been dating my amazing bf for 4 years. He has so much patience with me. I have a lot of moods/triggers, and at this point, he is able to identify them. But I don’t think he knows why they happen. I’ve briefly mentioned before that I was in an abusive relationship, but that’s it. 

I want to talk to him about it, because it was quite a few years of my life, and it impacted me a lot. I would like to be able to have an actual reason behind some of my behaviors, because every time I do those things, I just feel like a crazy person and I know it makes zero sense to him. (Hiding my phone, flinching, avoiding him, are a few examples) 

Mainly, I get pretty irritable quickly and I tend to take my emotions out on him or I get scared by something he does (on accident) and he doesn’t understand why I go into panic mode. My therapist has helped me to cope with this, but I just feel weird hiding it.

My family is going on a 20-hour road trip for nearly 2 weeks in an RV (essentially a hell experience) over the 4th of July. I'm taking chemistry online this summer and the internet connection on this trip will be spotty but my dad insists on a hotspot or something. Also the idea of studying in that RV with my little brothers running around yelling is not appealing. My mom suggested I go and visit my boyfriend and his family instead (!!!) but my Dad was kinda upset that I wouldn't be on the trip.

But I also haven't seen my boyfriend in several months and his family sounds excited to meet me. This would be the first time I'd meet them.

120,"I went to an unplanned BBQ with my aunts/uncles by hearing from my dad about it just the day before (my dad does this a lot, he'll withhold info on social gatherings and then tell on the day of). So today I called my aunt about when it starts and had a tough time getting a hold of her to talk. Eventually she tells me the time of the event and either awkwardly/sarcastically lets out a ""yay"" and we hang up. 

Looking back on it I was never directly invited so I probably shouldn't have went but I live alone and was dying for human interaction! 😟 Most did try to talk and start a conversation but I felt awkward and out of place the whole time. 

When I initially got there my one aunt gave me a tour of my cousin's new house and she seemed overly excited (maybe even horny around me) because she'd follow me around and somewhat whisper near me. I grew a half erection in my shorts and was getting wet in my underwear. I tried walking away from her to hide it but it seemed like she or someone else knew.   Some time goes by and I notice that both of my aunts were away including my cousin. 

A little after that my other aunt tells me how she hasn't seen me in a while and had the vibe of her wanting me to leave... I left about a half hour after that because I felt unliked and unwelcomed. Now granted my one aunt is a very nice person and everything but I still felt off about it all. 

More interpersonal info: both of my brothers hold a jealous grudge against my cousin &amp; my father's side of the family because they don't see their kids or new home when they're rarely invited. 

Overall I'm taking a natural antidepressant called Ashwaghanda and seem to zone out more than normal and seem to not be present mentally when others are talking around me. 

All in all I felt like I wanted to cry because of that awkwardness and the feeling that all of them don't seem to know the ""true"" version of me. I felt like I didn't belong and probably shouldn't have been there but I missed socializing with someone during this Pandemic and I'm a loner. I feel awkward &amp; anxious right now.

A month went by and we decided to go to homecoming together “as friends” and she made it obvious that she still had feelings so we started dating again.

129,"Okay, so backstory here: I (23F) was in a very toxic relationship from May 2018- December 2018. Also, to shorten this a bit, I am an extremely romantic person, most of my goals and happiness centers around a relationship and the desire to find MY person ... I know we all need to find happiness within ourselves and I’ve worked on that a lot, but please just understand that romance and love is the epitome of who I am. So, toxic relationship ended December 2018. I was cheated on, manipulated, lied to, coerced into doing drugs, just a whole bunch of stuff. Let’s just say that I was in a very vulnerable place. January 2019, I was drinking a lot, basically getting blackout drunk 3-5 nights a week and crying all the time. I almost lost my job, I failed three semesters of college in a row, and ruined my credit. 

January 2019, due to the depression and general state of mind, I was still drinking and clubbing a lot. I got raped by a cop. It wasn’t brutal or anything and I have no issue talking about it now, but it still destroyed me a lot and made things worse. Drinking more, lots of casual sex to feel loved. From January 2019- August 2019 I slept with probably 30 or more men. 

August 2019: I had a male roommate that had lived with me for the past 3 years. He dated my childhood best friend of 10 years and they had broken up. Now, my childhood best friend and I had not been super close in some years. We never hung out or anything, but we saw each other at work and sometimes at home. Anyways, August 2019, my roommate and she had been broken up for a few months. I came home blackout drunk and my roommate and I had sex. I don’t remember a single thing except crying at some point. I woke up the next morning naked in his bed and he was nowhere to be found. He eventually came home and we talked about it and agreed that it was weird and we had no feelings for each other. However, we both got shitfaced again and had sex again the following night. I was definitely drunk and so was he, but I do remember bits and pieces. It didn’t last long and it was mostly just drunk fooling around. The next day, things were very awkward and he told me he had met another girl (not my childhood best friend aka his ex), and we agreed to terminate our lease at the end of the year. We didn’t communicate much after that but we were always friendly to one another. 

He and I agreed not to tell my friend because she’s a very sensitive person and I knew that she would take it as a personal attack. So, we never did. 

Fast forward to May 2020: he creates a Facebook group with two random people in it along with himself, me, and my friend. I just deleted it. But apparently it all came to light, and she texted me saying “I hate you. Don’t ever contact me again”.... I didn’t respond and don’t plan to. 

From August 2019- now, my whole life and persona has changed. I stopped drinking almost completely. I met a really nice guy, got back in school, got a better job, and have my own house now. My childhood friend and I only ever spoke maybe twice, but like I said before, she and I hadn’t been very close in a few years even with her ex boyfriend living with me. I felt bad about what happened, and I beat myself up about it for quite awhile. I know in order to fully forgive myself, I probably should have come clean to her. But by the time she and I caught up (February 2020), she had moved on and was doing really well. So, I let it go, even though I knew it would probably come out one day. 

I don’t really know what I’m asking here. She texted me that she hates me less than 24 hours ago. I feel it’s best to leave it alone and let her handle her emotions in her way, and for me to go about my life as well. I’m sure she is hurt and she has every right to be. I am not trying to diminish her feelings by saying that I am trying to forgive myself. But, I have hated myself for so many reasons and I am finally getting to a better place after therapy, lots of tears, and the help of God. I guess I’m just looking for some validation or for someone to say “you’re not a whole POS”... I have grown and changed. I am so much better than I have been the past few years. And I have had great help but I also helped myself. And she just wouldn’t believe that he and I having sex had NOTHING to do with her and EVERYTHING to do with something being broken inside of me.",26May2020,1
130,"I (M21) live a large house with a spare bedroom and offered my friend (F19) that she can stay at my place to get some mental and emotional breathing room from her parents. She was initially torn between staying or leaving, either continue to stay in her home while her parents continuely belittle her or leave and stay at my place. Tonight she just told me that shes had the last straw from her parents and is willing to escape, but considering that many other friends have left their home bc of abuse or negligence, I fear that for her situation her parents might overreact and call the cops or something drastic. Is it right or safe for either of us to do this? Would the police do something to put her back in her home? Is there anything that would place either one of us into any trouble?

133,"I'm starting college and everyone expects a lot from me, I'm considered intelligent but very lazy

The problem is, I live in a big house with a lot of people who just assume that they know me and make me feel like shit everytime, we can't afford therapy and I've hinted at talking to one before but my mom thinks it's not that bad

I get stress/anxiety marks and I've shown them to my mom but she said that we'll go to a doctor if ""it gets worse"" and it made me feel so small and shitty

I don't talk a lot about my problems to my parents, I'm not rebellious, I have high grades and people scold me all the time for being lazy even though I spent an entire afternoon cleaning shit up 

Basically, when I am productive, people don't fucking give me the recognition for it and still call me lazy, it makes me feel like they want a fucking maid or something (disappointed but not surprised), it happens a lot here, kids are expected to clean shit up and cook for everyone because they're kids and they ""need to learn"" and if you don't pass their standards, you're worthless

I didn't have a good relationship with my dad, he wasn't a very good one back then, he called me stuff like ""piece of shit"" or ""worthless"" and even going as far as wishing I wasn't born, I had to deal with all that in the early age of 5

I was the oldest so my dad would scold me if I played in the playground at 8 years old even though my classmates were also doing it, I was robbed of my childhood and was taught to be the perfect child which led to me having the golden child syndrome (not sure of the exact name, this is from what I can remember)

Went through bullying, got sexually assaulted in the school I didn't even want to go to (It was an elite school full of overachievers) and they don't know about it because the school would rather keep it a secret than broadcast that they're housing assaulters (They care more about grades than good attitude) BTW the guy didn't learn his lesson and assaulted someone again, he graduated there and gets to brag that he studied in an elite school while I got kicked out because my poor mental health was hindering my academic progress

Also, I had a sister who died at the age of 1 and for years I thought that it was my fault and would constantly blame myself, my father's degrading words weren't helping and I developed anxiety which I didn't learn that it was anxiety until like 5 years after, I rarely get it now though but my marks replaced the anxiety attacks

When I remember all the shit they gave me, I have this urge to punch something or someone because of how bottled up my feelings were, I have very low EQ, introverted and sometimes I just want to end it all

Fortunately, I'm very ambitious, I'm stuck in between succumbing to the temptation of eternal peace and being successful so they won't give me shit anymore

134,"A girl that I was friends with for a brief time in 2016 hates me. The reason is bc she had an episode where she slit her wrists and was threatening to stab herself and after that I was uncomfortable with her knowing my address. She got extremely mad at me and has been harassing me on and off since. I have not harassed or said anything rude back at all. She’s been blocked on all social media for years.

Well about two years ago she was making Facebook statuses calling my daughter retarded.

Now she is making full on videos about me saying that I do drugs and have orgies while my children watch. She says that she hopes me and my children die.

This is where the advice is needed. I am obviously extremely upset about this but am sadly not surprised by her behavior as she is very toxic and always attacking others. What I am bothered by is that some of my friends continue to be friends with her despite how she has abused me. I won’t lie, part of me is ready to block anyone who continues to communicate with her.

136,"(Posted this to the r/Offmychest subreddit)


Before I start, I really don’t want to sound like some pity party, or someone who feels like the world revolves around them, but I just feel so hopeless man. 

Long story short, I’ve stuck with the same 3 best friends that I’ve had since middle school. They’re all amazing guys, two of them play varsity sports and one of them is a very good student and hard worker, and in all honesty, I don’t deserve to be a part of their group regardless of how well we get along and how long we’ve known each other. 

It’s just that all three of them are better than me at everything. I suck at school, I never stick with sports, I have horrible social skills, and I’m always the losing end in video games when we play. I try to find light to it and grow from my failures and tell myself that I can be just like them, but I’m always the shadow. They’re all growing and succeeding at life and here I am self loathing and writing on subreddits. I don’t have many skills, and the saying “show me your friends and I’ll show you your future” really stuck with me, because I felt like hanging around them, I could become a better person, but I’ve just felt like the weak link to a chain. 

I don’t deserve them man, I love those three like brothers, but even so I feel such a resentment. They surpass me in everything, and I’m happy for them because I grew up with them and watched them grow, but it just sucks so bad. Anybody got any advice?

I require some advice on how to spend wisely when I am hanging out with my family members, girlfriend or cousins...majorly people I care and love.

Whenever we go out I do have a certain budget that I fix that I want to spend on when I am with my loved members.

But sometimes things go a bit off, and I do require to pay a bit extra than my normal budget. So I am not sure what a typical budget should be. Sometimes, my girlfriend or cousins want to do something/ buy something very expensive but that I can afford but rather would not knowing how they play out at those circumstances. 

However, I am terrified what would be the consequences if I objected on their opinion. I dislike quarrels and mess. Something I do not want to indulge myself in for small reasons such as showing my affection by taking them out or buying them something.

They all (my family member) has done something important to me, that’s why I cannot repay them. But I hope someday I will. This is a good way. But I really do not know how much I can give them. Or rather to what extent should I go for them and optimize my limits.

A couple nights ago, my brother came up with his friends. One of his friends was looking at my car because it's been running funny. Everyone was pressuring me to go for a ride in it with him, to see how it ran. I eventually gave in, and did. I didnt wear a mask, because I didn't want to seem like a tight ass. I looked away from him with the window open the entire time. I felt terrible, and swore to never do anything like that again. Anyway, today my sister visits. At one point she was walking through the garage, as I was working on my weed eater. I had to grab something in her direction, so I leaned over to grab it. At the time, it though we were probably atleast 6 feet from eatchother, but I kind of doubt it now. Maybe like 3 or 4 feet. If I didnt think I was far enough away, then I wouldn't have done it. Soon after that, my brother showed up. He was downstairs sitting on a chair, and I go to walk past him. Again, I felt like there was enough space, but now I feel like I might have gone too close. Might be because I think 6 feet is a little shorter then I think. I feel kind of terrible. Think its alright as long as it looks at least close to 6 feet?

Because of my occasional attraction to men, it feels wrong to call myself straight, but I don’t know if I can really call myself bi either.

147,"throwaway obviously // warning for suicidal stuff //  sorry if the post was long i dunno how to post good on reddit because i really only ever lurk

so i've been suicidal for about a year now? im not really sure. honestly it hasn't effected me too much. usually at night i just felt like life was hopeless and i wanted to die

well, now it's significantly worse. my life is okay, so i'm at the point where i fully recognize that my future could be happy and i simply just dont care. i have no desire to experience the happiness?? 

i just feel emotionless, like static covering my head with me imagining myself dying muffled underneath. sometimes it gets realy bad and it's all i can think of. my hands usually feel super weird and tense and i feel like i HAVE to tear or break something and i have endless pictures of ripping my skin open in my mind or other graphic stuff. 

now, i start having these feelings during the day, too. i scratch rlly hard at myself and pull my hair and i really just feel like i need to destroy something right at that moment, or that i need to die.

the thing is, actually attempting to die is completely off limits for me. i dont think i could ever bring myself to do it. the most i've done is strangle myself with a belt, and that was for self harm purposes.

on the other hand, i don't know how to get help. my parents are really unpredictable and kind of scary. my mom abuses me physically and emotionally and sometimes my dad emotionally, but at the same time they are nice to me occasionally. 

i dont know what to do because if i revealed this to them, they'd either want to help me, get super mad, claim i'm lying, or just laugh and say i have no reason to hate life. What's stopping me even more is the embarrassment. There's absolutely no way i can get help without my family knowing- and honestly i hate my family and i never want to reveal anything personal to them like that ever ever everrr

firstly, my mom would definitely blab about it to everyone she knew. she did it when my brother was acting particularly depressed one week, and she described everything in FULL DETAIL to like every contact on her phone. i know for sure this would be treated the same

i dont want everyone to look at me differently and treat me different. i feel like i'd rather endure it then experience these people i hate knowing this thing about me

when we go for checkups at the doctor, for teens they give us clipboards asking about our mental health. my one idea is to check in the box saying 'i have wanted to die' or something along those lines- but that would also reveal it to everyone else

one time i checked in that i felt a lot more sad then usual, and my mom was staring over my shoulder the whole time and was like ""No! you aren't sad, i've never seen you sad! it's just puberty!"" and she made me cross it out

so right now, i cant die, and i cant get help. im really lonely (ive sort of isolated from my online friends because i feel like im toxic and i shouldnt keep bringing them down with my own mental problems) and life just feels like some sort of purgatory

should i just deal with it for now? again sorry if this is bad",26May2020,1

How should I respond?",26May2020,1
156,"Ok. This happened a few hours ago.

So my dog passes away a few weeks ago and I had him cremated and the ashes returned to me in a lovely urn. My parents also loved my dog and were devistated to hear when he passed. They got their own urn and asked me for some of his ashes so part of him could be at their house (he loved going over to their house.) So I tearfully opened my own urn, and tried to CAREFULLY open the plastic bag stuffed inside that contained his ashes. 

Well, I misjudged quite how dusty it was going to be. The ashes immediately aerosolized and I inhaled a small amount. I stopped, quickly grabbed a face mask from another room, then continued the transfer without a problem. 

However, the ashes have caused some irritation in my throat. I've been coughing quite a bit. Cough drops help a little, but that's it. 

Im still working regularly, and my job will send people home for having a cough. I don't have PTO left right now (was extremely sick for 2 weeks earlier this year, plus took some time after I lost my dog.)

I feel like if I could explain theres a non-illness reason for my cough, I'd be fine (it's worked for other coworkers.) But I can't exactly say ""oh, it's fine, I just inhaled my dead dogs ashes!"" I've only been at this job for a few months, and I feel like that's not a great look. 

What should I do?",26May2020,1
157,"Okay, for a long while now I’ve been feeling really horrible about myself. I keep belittling myself, feel like I’m worthless, and often times think about killing myself. I struggle with social anxiety so going out is a big task for me and when I’m out in public I feel like everyone is judging me, talking bad about me, or staring at me which makes me want to just retreat home and never leave. I feel really sluggish and sad almost everyday if not sad I feel empty and don’t want to do anything but disappear. 

I do not like my self image I think a lot of my anxiety comes from heavy amounts of insecurity I have about myself. All my insecurities keep coming and going all the time which makes me feel horrible about myself and has convinced me I’m pretty much dying alone because I’m simply at a physical disadvantage in every way. I’m sure it’s also a reason being out in public is a challenge. 

I had a job but quit due to personal reasons and I’ve struggled to find a entry level job since. I’m not great with people or have great communication skills since I’m a shut in. I feel ashamed of myself and how left behind I feel at my age (23) I’m not a student or have a job at the moment. I know going to school or getting a job could be a big first step in helping me out of my shell but it’s not going well. It makes me feel horrible and I feel myself drifting further into this black hole. Every day I feel miserable and hate myself for not being able to have done anything right in my life.

Am I clearly avoiding help by not going to see a doctor? I’ve thought of it but being put on medication just doesn’t appeal to me. I keep telling myself I can beat this on my own but now I’m unsure if I can. I feel like I’m running out of time and options which stresses me out even more. I feel like there is no hope or anything left for me at this point. I really want to give up.",26May2020,1
158,"Basically, I have been living in a god-awful living situation for the past few years. My dad left my mom about a year ago, and does fuckall to help us. He acts as if I am not his child anymore. My sister seems to be fine as my father spoils her, and she has autism so she's mostly ignorant to what is going on around her. On top of that, there is my mom. I think she has undiagnosed mental issues (not trying to insult her, I genuinely think something is wrong with her). We've been living in financial hell for as long as I can remember, living off basically $0 a month (mortgage is $670, electricity is the rest ((i cant remember the last time we've paid our electricity bill in full))). We went a full year without running water. I had to carry 40 lbs water buckets from the neighbors house to ours, which really sucked because I had to carry about 15, one at a time, every time we needed water. My mom did absolutely nothing to help us fanancially. She procrastinates and focuses on other things the every time an opportinity for financial gain arrises. I had to make a GoFundMe and get help from my school to get our well fixed. They did it for free and we got to keep the $1800 I had raised. My mom was ""looking"" for a job at the time. All of a sudden she stopped. I had no idea where the money went ss she withdrew it from her bank account. She told me a few months later that she used it to pay bills, instead of taking care of other things (such as the washing machine sized hole in our roof, or the fact that we don't have a working oven or stove). Everything was fine for a few months. Now our circuit breaker is out. We have no electricity except for the extension cords we have coming from the garage. We dont have hot water or a dryer or anything with a special outlet. We can't have very many things on at once. This wouldn't be so bad if someone had a job, but not a single person in my family does. I want to try to get a job but I live outside of town. The only reason that is a problem is because we don't have a car. I've been really stressed out because I've been trapped with my autistic sister, and borderline abusive mom who fucks with my head and gaslights me constantly, no car, no income, microwave or toaster oven foods (no real fucking meals), a physically abuse crack smoking dad (i have to go to his house to take showers), no friends, (i dont even have tv or internet so i cant even fucking distract myself). We got our stimulus check (which my mom fucked up because she procrastinated ((which she does every time we could get our tax return)) and we only got $1200 instead of the $2200 we could have gotten because of the extra $500 you get per kid. I thought ""holy shit, we can get our car legal, or we can get our circuit breaker replaced"". She saved $540 to get our car legal and I was stoked. Then it happened. This fucking bitch buys a shampooer and a lawn mower. I can't take it anymore. It's like she is actively trying to fuck our situation even more. She litterally told me ""i dont care about all that, this house needs to get cleaned"" Are you fucking serious? We live miles outside of town, with no electricity (no hot water), a broken oven, no car, and no income other than the check my mom gets for takin care of my autistic sister and you buy a fucking lawn mower and shampooer? My dad comes by and mows our lawn sometimes so we don't even need one? Some carpet stains are fucking trivial compared to food, water, and the possibility of a job. I am litterally trying to get a job to help us and I swear to god she is actively trying to stop our situation from getting better. I have no escape, I wanna call CPS or something but then I'll either get put with my off the hinges crackhead dad, stay with my mom, or get put into foster care or some shit. Its a fucking nightmare. All 3 options are horrible. I've tried commiting suicide in the past but I fucked it ip. I'm at the point where I've lost all hope.

I turn 16 this year and was hoping that maybe I could get a job without being held back by child labor laws so I could actually provide for my family.

159,"I’ve been lying to my family and closest friends about having graduated college with an associates degree. Now, my story is that I’m completing this program to transfer to a university and go to grad school. I feel like my partner is on my heels and has a suspicion that I’m not being honest. I’m just too afraid to admit that I’ve been lying about this for close to 8 years. 

I’m in college, but I just completed my first two classes ever. I passed them both with A’s and I’m so proud of myself... I want them to be proud too. I attempted college two other times and I couldn’t get past the first semester due to mental health issues and a toxic relationship. What do I do??",26May2020,1
160,"Im a college student and I work in a pet store, and I absolutely love working with the animals, I feel lucky to have my first job be one I'm passionate about. However, since the beginning of working there, I have never felt like I belonged. No one ever put in any effort to get to know me, despite my efforts. They're all super close outside of work, and never invited me to anything. I figured, I'm still getting money and I love taking care of the animals, so who cares? So I was just always super nice to everyone and kinda just did my job, and never caused any trouble, and was good acquaintances with them,I thought. Recently, with the virus, I got a lot more hours, and was usually the most experienced employee for my shift, cause my managers worked later, and so I just stuck to taking care of the animals and cleaning during my shift, and would go up front to help with customers when needed. 
Today my managers told me to stay after with them. I thought it was going to be a good meeting since my boss had told me like 2 weeks ago that he was proud of me and was grateful for me stepping up, and that I was on my way to a raise. And then, my managers told me it was bad news. They prefaced the meeting by saying that they had so many complaints about me that they considered letting me go, just so they wouldnt have to deal with it. They said that so many of my coworkers had complained, saying they didnt want to work with me. This was so unexpected. They said a bunch of confusing different stories from other employees who mostly said that they felt like they had to pick up my load. However, I was never ONCE off task at work, I was always working while my coworkers chatted together. I'm sure there's more to the story, but their perspective wasn't really explained to me well. 
The part that really hurt me was when my manager was saying how I was just introverted, and said, ""[coworker] is so extroverted and just gets along with everyone and everyone loves being around him. You're like his polar opposite."" It killed me. 
They ended up saying that I needed to communicate more, and that we can fix this and for now I just will only work with my managers, none of my fellow employees. 
I think I wanna quit, maybe I just need some validation, idk. But also, I love my job and the animals, and I know that if I go they will go back to not being as well taken care of. The pay isnt bad, and I honestly love so many aspects of it. But also, I dont know if I can put up with feeling hated, but maybe if I do communicate more, maybe I wont feel hated anymore. Do you think it will get better and I should stick through it and see it through to the other side, or should I leave now before my feelings might get even more hurt?",26May2020,1

162,"I'm currently 16, just graduated from Highschool, and am trying to find a job in these trying times. I've come up with no luck so far but I gotta keep trying.

My home life isn't the best, I've hated living with my mom and sister more and more as the days gone by ever since my parents got divorced last year and we moved to a new place. Once I get a job, my primary thing I want to save up for is to be able to move out on my own.

I know its probably a bit premature to be thinking about this right now especially because I don't have a source of income yet but I'm trying to plan it out. I'm currently enrolled at the local Community College and am trying to pursue an Associates Degree and career in Cybersecurity.

I have some questions on what it is you need to have figured out before you move out and I was hoping maybe some of them can be answered.

1.How much money should you have saved up?(I know this is based entirely on how much the rent is and the down payment and all that but still)

2.How do you find a job that is in proximity to where you want to live? What if you can't?(The answer may be an obvious one but I'm just wondering)

3.What are some things to keep an eye on when you're trying to find yourself a place?(i.e things pertaining to the condition of the apartment, the landlord, or the neighborhood.

4. Should you move out of state or stay?(I definitely want to venture to a new state, maybe Denver one day, but I'm not sure if my first time moving out should be like that)


These are the main questions I have but if you could give any more information that could be useful that would be a huge help!

Also perhaps some of you could share how YOU moved out for the first time and how it went. I'm curious to see how different people handled it:)",26May2020,1
163,"Sit down because this one is a downward spiral.

So back in October of 2019, I (M) pulled a prank on one of my female friends (I put a plastic spider on her table). Me and this girl were friends for 5 years. The prank was harmless, but she got really mad and blocked me on social media. I didn't talk to her since then. But then, I heard from bunch of my other friends that she has accused me of stalking her and wanted to take legal actions. 

Now 6 months have passed. Not a word from her. It's all so strange. We live in a world that someone as popular as Johnny Depp gets destroyed over false accusations. What stopped her, a mere nobody, from destroying my life. She was so angry and furious when that stupid prank happened.

Another thing is he eats all the cat food. I give my cats one can of wet food each morning and night plus dry food on the side at all times, and the neighbour’s cat just comes in and absolutely cleans the dishes.

175,"So my fiancé is very used to observing body language in people and family who have previously viewed her as annoying and/or unwanted. She construes my body language sometimes as something negative and trusts herself and her instinct on what she thinks I am portraying through my body language vs. what I am actually portraying. 
For instance, in some disagreements we get into, she views me crossing my arms sometimes as me thinking I am annoyed/malicious with her thoughts and statements sometimes when in reality I’m just confused as to what she’s saying and or processing an answer for what she’s saying. 

Also, she almost always seems to not want to understand or be graceful to what I’m trying to say in conversation vs. how her mind portrays it at first. 
For example, I said that I never bring things up that she has done to hurt me, when in reality I meant that I would never hold anything AGAINST her regarding to what she’s done that has hurt me. She saw this as an opportunity to ramble on about how I am contradicting myself in conversation and that I should “Just try and make a change,” due to the fact that I brought up something that she has done to hurt me that I overlooked due to me knowing her character better than that. And this, again, was something that she saw as ammo to use against me to gain some sort of conversational upper hand.

She also does this thing to where she gets really calm after I’m obviously on the verge of tears because I feel like she’s purposefully not wanting to understand me or give grace to my side of things and how I feel and she almost looks like she has this “victory” complex when I can’t put my words on what I’m feeling because what she’s saying does make any sense. This sounds a lot like she is gaslighting me and if that’s so, then someone please confirm this.

Am I crazy for being frustrated at this? I posted something about her before here and I seriously do not want to leave her. She did not know what love felt like before me as her parents are very narcissistic and passive aggressive with her and I am the only one in her life that isn’t.

We live miles outside of town, with no electricity (no hot water), a broken oven, no car, and no income other than the check my mom gets for takin care of my autistic sister and you buy a fucking lawn mower and shampooer? My dad comes by and mows our lawn sometimes so we don't even need one? Some carpet stains are fucking trivial compared to food, water, and the possibility of a job. 

I am litterally trying to get a job to help us and I swear to god she is actively trying to stop our situation from getting better. I have no escape, I wanna call CPS or something but then I'll either get put with my off the hinges crackhead dad, stay with my mom, or get put into foster care or some shit. Its a fucking nightmare. All 3 options are horrible. I've tried commiting suicide in the past but I fucked it ip. I'm at the point where I've lost all hope. 

This post is very long and unstructured as fuck but thats because im losing my goddamned mind. I turn 16 this year and was hoping that maybe I could get a job without being held back by child labor laws so I could actually provide for my family. But my mom actively fucks up every chance we have. I am completely fucked and have no goddamned idea on what to do. I cannot take living $11,000 under the poverty line with a mom that seems to try to keep us there.",26May2020,1
180,"I've had this core group of friends since high school. We're all awkward quiet introverts but I'm the most extroverted of the group. As in I'm the one that's most comfortable with talking to strangers, going out to bars, making small talk with people, etc. Basically normal stuff. The rest of these people don't like to do stuff like that. I understand that some people just like to be left alone. However, when I would ask them to go out (which wasn't often in my opinion, maybe like once every few months) they didn't respond to my invitations. Most of them also still live at home with their families; I also understand that they don't want to come home at like 2AM smashed and have their parents see them like that. However, it's really getting to me. I realized recently that in our group chat, it's really only me and a few other people that carry on the conversation in the group. The rest read our messages and don't contribute much. I actually had one of these friends reach out to me a few days ago saying that they didn't feel like they were being a good friend. I responded saying that it's okay and it's just a byproduct of growing up and they responded with just ""no worries"". And nothing after that. We're all in our mid 20s now and I honestly can't stand how most of individuals still haven't really grown up. They haven't shown any initiative to move out or try for any kind of relationship and it's been worrying me. I haven't voiced these opinions to them because honestly, I feel like they won't change their ways. I want more friends who are more okay with going out but I also want to get to know more people who have the initiative to try to just 'grow up'.

185,"I know it seems like a very trivial issue, but recently I made the choice to be going to community college. And the big thing is that mostly everyone around me, close friends, classmates, are going to really good 4-year universities, some very prestigious. For almost all my life, especially during high school, I worked really hard and made the most of what I had, and had the dead-set mentality of going to a well-accredited and prestigious (I hate using that word) university to make my friends, teachers, and family proud. 

I come from a very disadvantaged neighborhood, under resourced high school, and am the first generation of my family to be going to college. 

And the thing is I did get into really great schools actually, but the thing is I can’t afford a single one without digging myself into at least $80k debt. 

I already made the decision to go to community college. But especially during quarantine, where I have so much time to think about my future, I can’t help but think how much of a disappointing decision I made to many, and failed expectations. Many saw me as getting into these great schools, alumni were excited to see me at their schools, many helped me in this journey. I felt tons of pressure from them. And I ultimately decided the debt wasn’t worth it and shattered everyone’s expectations. 

Now I can’t help but constantly think that everyone’s gonna think lesser of me, especially as all my friends go over to top universities, as my family saw me as the brightest one, and teachers and mentors saw potential in me. 

Please help me get over this “elitist” mindset. My mental health during quarantine isn’t the best.",26May2020,1
186,"So I go to a school where there are quite a lot of wealthy people, whereas me and my family compared to them are quite poor. 

I recently transferred over to this school in August 2019, and it was going alright, until the friends group I had kind of merged with another, until suddenly none of them listened to me anymore, and didn't really care about me, so I moved to a new friend group. 

I have been with them for a couple of months now and it's so hard to be friends. 

First of all, I feel like I have to work tirelessely to be noticed. They ignore things I say even after I ask multiple times. 

2. So idk if anyone here plays Roblox but there's this game called ”adopt me”. They play it everyday, and have tons of stuff in it because they have money for robux. I feel really excluded when they talk about it because I don't have anything compared to them.

3. I'm probably gonna get hate for this but they are from different places from me. Ik it shouldn't be a problem but I feel like the fact that they have such a different culture creates a barrier between us.

4. A few months ago a new girl arrived at my school and she was with one of my friends in her old school. She instantly joined our friend group and I feel like she was better friends with them in a day, than them being friends with me in months. 

5. I feel like I have to work to be their friend. It tires me out trying to get them to listen to me, help them with their problems, and joining in conversations.

I just want some nice friends but I feel like maybe they are actually toxic. I've had a long past with toxic friends and it hurts me to think about ditching these guys too. 

There is legit nobody after his to be friends with. They were my plan B, and if I leave them I will have nobody. 

Should I leave them now and be alone? Or should I stick it out until year 7 and ty to find some new people there, or even stick with them? I'm in desperate need of help!",26May2020,1

He died some months ago and while I miss him I'm  honestly glad he doesn't have to shoulder everything by himself anymore. Anyways, now that he's gone that wall has nothing holding it together and the slightest breeze sends bricks falling. After today it feels like it's almost entirely destroyed.

Hi reddit. This is a throwaway account because I don’t want this to be associated with my other account. I really would appreciate some help on this.

My dad was texting someone (“Jane” for a placeholder) on the couch after dinner tonight. I (17F) came over and was able to read a few texts over his shoulder. Some of his texts to Jane seem more than... just friendly. (“Hey Princess” and winky emojis) (Jane texted something about being ‘connected’ also with a wink emoji)
I wasn’t able to read much more than that. 

I also have noticed him texting Jane since around December but I never had the chance to read the texts, because he turns his phone away from me. Maybe I should see if he does this when he texts other people, but I’ve only noticed it with Jane. 

Here’s what I know about Jane:  
-Jane was my dad’s gym coach a few years back
-I think Jane and her husband divorced a couple years ago (We went to her house for a party, also a couple years ago)
-We may have had Jane over at some point for dinner (I don’t remember)

It’s possible that there’s some “arrangement” going on here with both my parents involved but I feel like that would be unlikely. I don’t have any evidence for this other than wanting to find a reason that’s not my dad outright cheating on my mom. :( 

I love my mom dearly, which is why I want to know if I would be an asshole if I didn’t tell her my thoughts. On one hand, I feel like I am betraying her by not telling, but part of my is screaming to just pretend I never saw anything. I don’t want our family to be torn up, but I’m not sure if I’m helping it by staying quiet. I haven’t seen any concrete evidence that anything is physically going on, so I don’t want to make a false accusation either. 

Am I an asshole if I keep my mouth shut? I need help on this, I’m not sure how I should process this. 

If you need more info let me know and I’ll do the best I can.",26May2020,1

195,"So I (23/F) had met this guy (24/M) on bumble and we really hit it off. We FaceTimed every night for like two weeks, the conversations were great. After a while our conversation topics got more intimate and I explained to him that I was a Virgin and I wasn’t very experienced when it came to being with guys. I told him that I’m super shy and used to be bullied because of my weight and now that I’ve lost 100lbs I’m still having some issues with my confidence. So he said he wanted to help me be more comfortable with him. 

Our conversations then got really intimate and we started snapping risky pictures and the texts got more sexual. After like a month of this we decided that since our state is opening back up that we’d meet up. 

I told him I was nervous and that I thought he was out of my league and he wouldn’t like me all that much. He kept reassuring me that he liked me and my body (I’m still a little cubby so I always think guys won’t like me). He kept saying this is more than just sex and that he likes me and he wants this to grow into something more. He also said that he liked that I’m innocent and haven’t been with any guys. 

So of course, me being gullible I met up with him. I was nervous and didn’t really know what to do. We made out, which I had never done before, and so I just felt awkward and like I was really bad. Long story short, we ended up having sex and it was amazing. 

After we finished, he said he didn’t want to have sex every time we hung out because he wants it to be special and that he’d like to cuddle and watch movies sometimes. I thought it was kinda weird for him to say that but I brushed it off.

After he left he kept texting me how amazing the night was and how he liked my body and what not. So the next morning I texting him and said I had a great time and I hope he did too. So he replied and said that he did and he’s glad I did. I responded and told him to let me know the next time he’s off work so we can hang out and then I haven’t gotten a reply. 

It’s been three days and no reply. He’s viewed my snap story and my Instagram story but he hasn’t texted or snapped me back. I feel like I got used for sex and it just really is eating at me. I feel so stupid that I lost my virginity to someone who just led me on to have sex. I’m just having a hard time getting over it and I don’t really know what to do.",26May2020,1

200,"So I'm a country kid at heart, always have been but, like most country kids I moved to the city to experience that lifestyle. 

I (22M) moved about 4 years ago now, and met my current partner (21F) about a year and a half ago. She's incredible, this really light and intensely compassionate woman. I've had pretty rotten luck with past partners, but she treats me like pure gold and always tries. It's been wonderful feeling like someone puts in as much effort as I do.

The only real issue I have is that lately I've been feeling more and more homesick. We live in the city, about 20 minutes out from the real city, in one of those kind of dodgy but charming neighbourhoods. 

My mother recently split up with her partner of 8 years, my dad's dogs have been dying and meanwhile I've been stuck here. More than that I've just missed country, being able to go for a walk and listen to the birds and make things with my hands. It's hard to explain the reason why I miss home so much, but if you know what it's like then I guess you get it. 

I also got an incredible job back home. It's location independent so I can work it from where I am, but it's another thing adding to all of this. Amazing work culture and team, I actually work at the same company as my father whom I only recently mended my relationship with. There's a lot pulling me there.

But my partner doesn't want to move. She keeps deferring uni - which is a relief because she's so miserable when she studies that it kind of freaks me out. But she's a bit younger than I am, in a lot of ways, and feels like there's nothing for her back home. It's a coastal area, lots of awesome independent businesses and art stuff going on but she's a city girl through and through. 

I don't really know what to do. I could wait it out for another 2 years until she finishes uni, and then we could both move, but it hurts thinking of waiting that long. Has anyone else been here before? What did you do? What should I do?",26May2020,1

209,"Title basically says it all. We've been together 7 years and engaged for 2. He was always a huge nerd, and about 4 years ago he joined the local 501st legion (a Star Wars cosplay group that's worldwide) and created a truly impressive biker scout.

Over the next few years he got more into the group and eventually made a Kylo Ren. He got more and more into it and eventually went to a large cosplay photoshoot, where he made more friends who were into cosplay and he joined a local Avengers cosplay group as Dr. Strange. 

Personally, I've never understood cosplay. I don't judge people who do it, but it just isn't my thing. I don't want to tell him not to do something that makes him so happy, but the amount of time and money he puts into it is frustrating. Plus, I've never met his friends who he does it with because he claims that we wouldn't get along because we don't have any common interests. 

Because I dont understand it, he's stopped trying to talk to me about it. I feel like an outsider for a huge part of his life and it makes me sad. We've been getting into more and more fights over this. I feel like cosplay is almost like a secret lover that I know exists. I ask him to tell me about it, and he drones on and on and bores me to tears. I don't ask him about it, and it feels like he's keeping something from me.

i parked in a small parking lot near the beach, on a road where there was a good amount of pedestrians and passing cars. we were there for around four to five hours. when my friends and i came back to my car to drive home, my passenger door was sitting wide open. i was obviously freaked out and ran to it to see if anyone was hiding in there/if anything was stolen. surprisingly, no one was there and nothing was gone.

one of my friend's backpacks was sitting on the floor of the passenger seat. it had thirty dollars in it. everything was still in her bag, including the money. my other friend's wallet was sitting in the middle of the backseat. it and all of her cards and cash were still there. my big bag of change in my center compartment was still there. literally nothing was missing or out of place.

now i'm scared someone messed with my car or put a tracker in it or something. however, my car drove home just fine and i still haven't noticed anything weird in it. my parents took it out earlier to get groceries and didn't mention any issues. i still don't know how my car door was opened, since my car locks automatically when i walk away from it with the keys. i think one of my friends may have accidentally left the door open when getting something from her bag, but i'm not sure.

211,"**Realised just how toxic my family is. I can't do anything for my younger sibling.**

The constant belittling and sarcasm, the anger and frustration, starting fights with a damn child for god's sake! 

That 6 year old isn't going to understand much of why her mother is ""not talking to her"". Which then turns into a whole other problem with said child ending up in tears over the confusion. 

Said child claims ""no one likes her"" -- she's 6 and she's saying this. Clearly something is wrong!

There's me being calm and rational with this 6 year old, telling her I love her and spending time with her. And then there's everyone else in the family with the constant arguing when she ""doesn't eat"" or is ""on technology all day"" -- whose fault is that? Not a damn 6 year old!

2. I’m pretty overweight and I am extremely self conscious about myself. I’m not morbidly obese but I’m far from healthy and getting bigger quickly.

3. I’ve been at a community college for 6 years already and I have no idea what I’m doing. I just take classes to not let my parents down, but I don’t feel like college is right for me.

There are many more reasons as to why I’m unhappy with myself and sad, but I wont name them all. Since 8 years old, I’ve struggled with chronic depression and suicidal thoughts. It got even worse when I went through middle school and high school. I was physically, verbally, and mentally abused for so long. All these years later, everything I went through still burdens and effects me. I still have flashbacks of being abused and every hurtful word I’ve been told runs through my mind constantly. These past few weeks have been very hard on me and I feel my sense of joy and positivity being stripped from me. I know everybody says this but... quarantine has really taken a toll on me. I was already a recluse which isn’t good for me, but having to stay inside and not going anywhere for weeks damages me even more. I’ve been feeling completely worthless because I’m already an adult and I have no real game-plan as to how I’m gonna get out of my parents house and be independent or pay my bills and fend for myself. Im also a musician and I have played in bands on stages for 12 years already. I always thought I’d be someone famous and who knows, maybe one day I will be. Maybe one day music will be my career and I wont have to worry about money ever again... but so far, I’ve found myself barely successful and afraid to create. I am also in a relationship and we argue a lot but today, she really went off on me and her words hurt extremely bad. Like I said, these past few weeks have been extremely hard and us arguing was what finally broke me. I had an extreme breakdown and I haven’t ate or gotten out of bed for pretty much the whole day already. And to be honest, ending my life has been an option that has been running through my mind more than usual. However, I will never EVER take my life or die by my own hands. I am a survivor of multiple suicide attempts and what makes this even more hypocritical of me is that I am an anti suicide motivational speaker. I have traveled to many places and helped others realize their potential and saved many lives with my story. I help a large number of people every day but in reality, I don’t have anyone I can turn to so I can be helped as well. I find myself alone and hurting 99% of the time and I don’t know how much more I can take. My heart is breaking more and more every day. I’m weak...I’m exhausted...and nobody seems to care. Any advice? What should I do? I feel so lost.",26May2020,1
213,"**Realised just how toxic my family is. I can't do anything for my younger sibling.**

The constant belittling and sarcasm, the anger and frustration -- all of what I went through. I won't let this happen to her.

That 6 year old isn't going to understand much of why her mother is ""not talking to her"". Which then turns into a whole other problem with said child ending up in tears over the confusion. 

Said child claims ""no one likes her"" -- she's 6 and she's saying this. Clearly something is wrong!

And I'm 19. I've been dealing and living with this same routine for years now. There's nothing I can do. Trust me, I want to move out ASAP but I can't do much for my sibling. I can't exactly take her with me when I do move (within the next couple years or so) and God knows I want to.

What can I do?
I'm not her parent.
She's not unsafe or God forbid ""abused"", she's happy, she just has these outbursts and my parents don't really know the right methods to calm her down, they end up being confrontational which makes it worse.

There's me being calm and rational with this 6 year old, telling her I love her and spending time with her. And then there's everyone else in the family with the constant arguing when she ""doesn't eat"" or is ""on technology all day"" -- whose fault is that? Not a damn 6 year old!

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm trying to stay strong. She's going to grow up anxious and confused like me.",26May2020,1

215,"Hey so I’m in a full leg cast that goes above my knee for a broken tibia. Today I was trying to get down to a small creek by my house. The banks were muddier than I thought and I tried to put my cast down but it slid down in the mud and mud got pushed up all underneath my foot and into the ankle part of my cast. My boyfriend cleaned my toes but we can’t get the mud out from underneath my foot. We feels super weird and itchy. We tried to use a plastic knife but not much dried mud came out. 

Any ideas on how to get the dried mud out of my cast? Also, would it hurt anything if we didn’t get it out (I need the cast for 7 more weeks)? Also, the outside of the cast is caked in mud from mid shin down. The cast is fiberglass so it’s all stuck down inside the texture of it. Any ideas on how to get that off?",26May2020,1
216," So, a friend comes to the rest of us, (a close group of 5 friends) and says he has an idea. He'd like to start up an article based website. He asked if we wanted to help write articles and produce other content for the branches. He asked if we would be okay with early, small levels of profits being re-invested into the business. When I pushed a little deeper, asked about what our roles would be, and whether we would be any form of shareholder, he said no. The business would be his, and we would only ever be employees. He also said he feels that he technically does not need our help, he can hire unpaid interns to write his content. Knowing that he feels he does not need us, and that he continually brings this up when I bring up having more equal roles, based on the fact that all of us would be contributing similar levels of content and effort during the start up phase, should I help him, or am I just being taken advantage on under the guise of being friends? Will I regret helping later down the line, in the event that it becomes something big?",26May2020,1
217,"   Months ago I moved in with a friend and his mom because of how chaotic things got in my own home. While I was living with them a lot of crazy shit went down that pretty much was the result of my roommates mom and himself being alcoholic. I witnessed drug use and was surrounded by sketchy people the mom was involved with, including a pimp who would bring his girls around. Eventually I left after witnessing my roommate physically attack his mom. The last time I came back was after his mom called me leaving many voicemails pleading for me to come. My friend also called me. He was emotional, intoxicated, and suicidal. I got there and ended up wrestling a rifle out of his hands. This was traumatic.
   Through all of this, my roommate and I had a mutual friend, Tim. Tim and I had been friends for years and would link up every once in a while. We opened up to each other about a lot. When I witnessed the suicide attempt it affected me. Tim was there for me. I had been attached to him since the beginning and I guess his support made me more attached.
   Our friend ended up going into treatment for his mental health issues. Other people who knew him were reaching out to me to ask about him. This was a stressful time for me because I wasn't comfortable talking about the situation or answering for anyone but myself. Nobody understood how much I wished I wasn't involved with what happened. Tim's attitude towards me changed. He never seemed to understand why I wasn't enthusiastic to discuss our mutual friend's business. I ended up deleting him off everything and we fell out.
   About 2 months passed. We started talking again. It meant a lot to me for whatever reason. His apology and the fact that he really seemed like he was happy I was in his life again just meant a lot to me. I missed him. I haven't gotten close to many people. He said he cares about my feelings and I took it to heart because I actually really struggle to believe anyone truly cares.
   We made plans to see each other again. I was hoping that this would be the start of having Tim as a person around in my life again. The way he switched up on me before hurt me. But I still loved and missed him. We were supposed to link at a certain time, but when the time came he was texting me very vaguely/cluelessly then didn't respond to me until hours later that night. I still agreed to link up.
   I was just hoping not to sink into his arms again. But not long after we met up I did. I missed his warmth and couldn't deny it. It felt so good to be close to him again. I started asking him if he was fucking around with anyone else. He kept telling me he's not that type of person.
   Eventually he told me that when he wasn't responding to me earlier he was at the movies with a friend, and totally forgot about the plans he made with me. I held his phone for a moment and saw a girls name had been calling and texting him the whole time him and I had been together that night. I put 2 and 2 together as it was obvious he blew me off to go hang out with this girl.
   After he dropped me off I followed her on instagram. This girl watched my story that he was on. Despite telling me she was just a friend checking up on him because he cried during the movie, shortly after I followed her he texted me. He was upset.

   I knew he was lying to me. He didn't know I knew. Or maybe he did and just sees me as that pathetic. It feels awful. He told me I was wrong for what I did. Like it isn't his own fault if he happened to mess something up with someone he actually gives a shit about by them finding out he was with me. But what feels like shit the most is the fact that I regret the fact that she found out he was with me too. Because even though it had been so long, when I was with him I felt at home. It was a beautiful feeling and I can't help but see him as a beautiful person. He's ambitious and funny and sweet. Even though he has proven already how little I'm worth to him.
   It just hurts a lot. I wish I knew how to value myself at all. I wish he would have just told me to my face what I really am to him and that he wants me to stay in my lane.

   I guess I need advice on how to stop feeling like shit. Thanks for reading",26May2020,1
218,"i haven’t felt good for a while. i haven’t ever been diagnosed with anything because i get incredibly uncomfortable talking about myself and my mental health, but i’ve just been struggling really hard lately. i don’t even know where to start. 
i feel like i feel things really hard. everything will be normal and then one thing could annoy me and it brings on this constant negativity in my head. and i get mad so easily, and i get sooo mad i feel like my head could explode. but after i’m finished being mad i can barely even remember what i was mad about, or how it felt to be mad. i feel like i’m relearning how things feel every single time i feel them, and then immediately after it’s over i forget. i try and write how i’m feeling down and rereading it doesn’t even really help me remember. 
and i just have this constant feeling like something is supposed to be happening, or i’m supposed to be doing something, and nothing ever does and i never do. 
i’m constantly talking to myself or saying things that don’t make sense out of habit just because it popped into my mind and simulating random conversations in my head. i feel crazy half the time but can’t bring myself to tell anyone because i dont want them to pity me or look at me like i’m something that doesn’t work right, or that they have to sensor themselves around me. i only feel comfortable feeling sad when i’m alone but after i feel it, it’s like a switch flips and i just stop. and it’s so frustrating because i try to feel it and it just feels so forced and makes me want to scream. 
i don’t know what to do with myself. i can’t imagine living the next 60 years feeling like this. it’s an endless cycle of me struggling with my own brain and existence in general. life is starting to feel like a prison and things are just constantly getting worse. i’m learning to hate myself and everyone else because i recognize negative traits and it’s ruining half of my relationships. i can’t bring myself to open up to anyone and most of my friends are starting to hate me because of it. i’m always yelling and in a bad mood because i can never stop thinking about how stupid and pointless this life i’m living is and how out of place i feel. i haven’t tried to kill myself but sometimes when i get really mad, or sad, it’s in the back of my mind. my emotions just get so overwhelming i just feel like i act completely different but i only notice the difference once i’m calmed down, and once i’m calmed down its mostly just straight self guilt and minor disbelief that i acted that way. i don’t feel completely in control of myself when i’m feeling emotions and i don’t know if one day i’m going to snap and really do it in the heat of the moment. 

honestly not sure why exactly i’m writing this, or what kind of advice i’m looking for. i guess i wanted someone to hear it and understand, just for the sake of there at least being someone, and maybe hope someone had something helpful haha",26May2020,1

Ok I started working at a particular Canadian fast food chain (that my be named after a hockey player) anyway I started working there this November and was made a supervisor about a month and a half ago. 

Anyway I was already getting really stressed with working full time and balancing school and stuff that when this whole covid thing hit it was kinda a blessing in disguise when I got quarantined and I could take a breather.

After about three weeks my manager called me back to work as a supervisor because the other supervisor flaked out on her. So she made me a supervisor with little to no training I was fine at first but now it really taking a toll on me mentally and I’m done. 

Tonight was the last straw I literally cried closing shop tonight and it just not worth being this stressed out and treated like shit for 14.75 and hour.

It may seem like a strange dream job but I would absolutely love to be a mechanic. I love cars and working on them fascinates me.  My only problem is getting my foot in the door.

I feel like it's too late to come clean because I denied any doubts they've had throughout the years, and now they've even told their families and this lie just grew. I wish I wasn't so swayed by opinions back then. The worst part is that when I meet new people that my friends are/will be in contact with, I'd have to lie to them as well and I don't want to do that anymore. I've even had thoughts about ditching them entirely and starting over but I can't, I love my friends. Having committed to this lie, throughout the years, I've been in a constant state of thinking this might be it, ""today might be the day they find out and then talk about it behind my back, they're gonna expose me"" that's how I think. It's way too late to take it all back since I firmly denied any doubts years ago.

I've never invited them to my house, made up an excuse about my mum being strict. I personally believe they'll never understand if they found out.

To just skip to the point I have had really bad depression the past few days. I mean it’s more than just that I have BPD, depression and anxiety. It’s just been really bad. I haven’t slept in days, I’m barely eating and I’ve just been crying all day long. I don’t know what is wrong but that isn’t the point of the story it’s just background. My fiancé who I love more than anything has been trying his best to be there for me at this really low point. He’s been trying harder than normal to help me stop crying, try to feel better and get food in me. He even dyed my hair for me today all by himself and helped me dye my pugs tail blue (it was pet safe dye I promise, just cause I can’t seem to take of myself right now doesn’t mean I won’t do anything for my two babies, also I don’t know how to pay pet tax because I don’t really know how to use imgur I’m sorry.. I’ll try..) 

Point to the story is if anyone reads this is that while he was dyeing my hair and pug, it happened to get on these sweatpants him mom got him for Christmas. He says they were a Christmas special but I literally cannot find them anywhere. He keeps saying it wasn’t a big deal to make me feel better but I just want to feel like I haven’t fucked up enough lately. I just want to make it up to him and I don’t know if just the sweatpants would be enough. I know I owe him the world.. but it’s the one thing i can do that would probably mean a lot to him.

228,"Hey Reddit, I've been having this problem for some time now. I'll give some context by adding in that I'm 16 and was completing both highschool and college finals and holding a job when these issues started arising. Basically, when my parents were always asking for me to help them out, I would help them out, and inevitably my school work would become lackluster because I wouldn't have enough time to complete assignments. I don't even go hang out with friends or go places because I'm always busy either doing school work or helping my parents at the house. I literally helped my whole family lose around 20 pounds of weight per person by making meals for them and giving them exercise routines, and I clean around the house whenever I get the opportunity. As of late, my parents have been telling me I'm selfish and I'm always thinking about myself and not others. A good example is from 2 days ago: My mom called me and asked me if I could drop some food off at my aunt's house. I said sure, I just needed to take a quick 5 minutes shower because I had just woken up. She told me to forget it because I'm ""obviously too selfish to do anything for anyone"". Anyways, I took the ribs because I was obviously trying to be helpful and they grounded me anyway. I want to talk issues through with them because I love them with all my heart, but sometimes I feel like they're too emotionally immature to ever see my side. If I can't help them when they want me to (because of my schedule), then it's obviously because I don't want to help and I'm lying to get out of work. Like I said, I want to start a healthy dialogue, but I just don't know how. It feels like they're metaphorically plugging their ears when I try to solve things.

Okay for the late bit: We have a grace period of 7 minutes, I was late ONCE in my 4 weeks of working there and it was for less than 5 minutes. 

And the derogatory comments? I have no clue, my Manager we'll call him Mark, said that the SM (Store Manager) had tried to get rid of me before, because I was late that one day, he backed me up and everything was fine, I was never late since.

I'm pretty sure she just got through to the store, because I transferred to another store after training and was able to get rid of me. It's not like I said a word to her even after the situation went down, I still smiled and was friendly.

Her cat will often scratch and howl at my bedroom door and our cats will try to fight eachother through the door. I asked my roommate If I could spray her cat with water when she howls at my door so that she stops and she said ""as long as you dont lay a finger on my cat.

It took me over a month to get access to the database, the different tools the team uses, etc. I tried reaching out to the team to setup 1:1s and figure out the lay of the land, no one was available to do so.

I get my first task which was going alright. I got stuck a few times since it’s a new and big codebase but reached out to specific people for answers. My boss gets back and the first thing he does is get on a call with me and berate me for taking so long to get this task complete. I get it took me longer than I wanted but I’m new and still learning. 

This week I have a different project that I’m hoping to complete by the end of the week and the product manager has been agressive during stand ups, one I even cried after because it’s taking me a couple extra weeks to architect and implement a new feature from scratch. Now they want me to demo this feature by the end of the week during a company wide demo, something I normally wouldn’t do but I was asked during the team stand up and felt weird pressure to say yes. 

I’ve only been working there 2 months and I’ve had 5 panic attacks since I’ve started, one so bad I thought I was having a heart attack and went to the ER. It feels like an immense pressure is being put on me to perform way above my level and I don’t think I can mentally take it anymore.

Is it feasible to quit and start another job search during covid? I can afford to job search for 3-4 months but I worry how long it’ll take with my lack of experience and no CS degree.",26May2020,1

243,"Hi guys, I need some advice. So for the past 3 months (maybe 4-ish? I don’t really know exactly how long) I’ve been talking to someone who’s become really close to me and someone I’ve kinda started to develop feelings for. We’ve been talking daily and saying good morning to each other and all that jazz for a while now and I plan to tell them how I feel soon because I have a pretty good feeling they feel the same(biased on how often we talk and their body language and actions toward me) But whenever I try to call them they come up with a reason not to talk. They stop responding for a while (usually because it’s pretty late and they’ve had a busy day) or tell me they have a headache and I always give them the benefit of the doubt because I believe it’s the right thing to do and headaches suck. But recently at the end of the day when I ask how their day went they’ll tell me about it etc. and tell me that they just got home and I’ll ask if they want to talk and then all of the sudden they’re not home anymore (this was after a 45 minute delay in response and it was 10:30 at night) I don’t know if I’m being paranoid and just jumping to conclusions but now I’m afraid this isn’t the first time they’ve lied to me. Maybe they just don’t want to talk? I don’t know what to feel about this because I have a lot of trust issues and I might just me jumping to conclusions. I just need some advice.

244,"So I (M 22) live with two other people. One of my roommates is legitimately scaring me. His behavior has gotten more bizarre the longer quarantine has gone on. It doesn’t help that he has been isolating himself this entire quarantine...like he doesn’t go outside at all. He literally makes these weird yappy (think small dog) noises whenever I enter a common area. I’m not joking. It’s like instead of using his words he makes aggressive sounds to make a point. It’s really odd. He’s also started saying “I’m gonna lose my mind” literally every day. He also makes jokes about how “we’re all going to kill each other” because of quarantine even when there is zero conflict in the house. When there is conflict he laughs and says he’s dealing with his anger issues really well. Oh, and he talks/complains about COVID nonstop and repeats the same things over and over.

250,"I apologize if this isn’t in the correct place but I’m not sure where else to post this. 

My son who is about to turn 6 had a botched circumcision right after he was born. I didn’t realize this (he was my first child) until his pediatrician literally gasped when he went in for his check up and said she had never seen so much skin taken off before and that “the doctor that did this surgery needs to be the one to check on it/make sure it’s healing okay.” 

Well I call the obgyn who did his surgery and she tells me, word for word, that “she doesn’t see the patients after she performs the surgeries” I tell her she’s looking at it anyway based on what his pediatrician said. She glances at it and says it’s “fine.” His pediatrician says otherwise. 

Fast forward and my sons had to have 2 corrective surgeries from a urologist. He has scarring on his penis and it basically looks like someone stuck it in a pencil sharpener. 

I had initially wanted to sue her because of her gross negligence and unwillingness to help or address what she had done. I was young (20) when I had him, wasn’t married, had no money and couldn’t afford any legal action so I was left to basically just wait and see what happens. 

Now that he’s 6, I can clearly see all the scar tissue and I’m beginning to see other issues arise... I also realize it’s been 6 years since this occurred and two other doctors have tried to correct this but I want to know if it’s too late to pursue anything. I know it’s a long shot but this has always been in the back of my mind and I just feel so guilty for not doing anything sooner when it would have mattered.

262,"Hey all,

So in high school I had two different friend groups. I ended up introducing them to each other and we became one big friend group. Then I left for college,  and so did some of the others in the group. Obviously we drifted due to the distance but always texted. I go to college out of state and met new friends there. But I got sent home early due to COVID, and ever since I got back, none of them have initiated conversation with me or asked me to hang out (my state has allowed group gatherings 10 people or fewer). I always initiate everything with them, yet I always see them with each other on social media (like tonight). When I was around one of them the other week, they let it slip they had a separate groupchat without me. 

Usually I don't let these things get to me, but with the quarantine and being back in my home state in my parents house again I feel so lonely and honestly lost. I've read some other posts with somewhat similar situations and they all say to ""focus on myself"", but thats all I've been doing these past months in quarantine and its driving me a little crazy. Its also hard (if not impossible) to meet new people during this pandemic, and I'm far away from my college friends

I'm feeling very lost and down. Has anyone been in a similar situation or have some advice for me? Whether it be about friends or improving myself.

I am super open about my struggles and always willingto talk to someone who is not doing so well. I also work in the neuroscience field so friends tend to share their mental health struggles with me. I try to be an open ear and share what I know. Ultimately, I am not a professional so I always tell them to seek help. Most of them don’t want to do that and prefer to work through it themselves. That worries me a lot. In addition, at least two of my friends have attempted suicide so I am always worried about them harming themselves. Despite my pleas they still don’t want to seek help or even call the hopeline. At some point, I thought money might be an issue so I offered to pay for everything (I will have to take out a personal loan but I am ok with that).

I find myself worrying about them constantly. I love them dearly and I am glad they are open with me but I can’t do much to help. I am also constantly worried about the possibly of suicide. If they don’t answer their phones, I am a nervous wreck.

I went to the kitchen to help her out and she was peeling boiled potatoes. I picked up 1 and was about to help her peel but she snapped it from my hands and went 'Don't eat it, look at your body you're too fat' I'm 165cm and 50kg. According to my doctor I'm healthy so I don't really force myself to go on extreme diets and I regularly exercise. I'm used to her saying things about my looks and weight but it's Eid and the way she said it and snatched it from my hands really made me pissed, I picked up another potato to help her cause I know if I don't help she will hold a grudge for 5 years and bring it up every time she can. Again she said look at yourself don't eat it and I said I'm just trying to help you peel. And she said you said you don't want to help (I DID NOT SAY THAT AT ALL) I got annoyed and just dropped the potato into the bowl and walked off which triggered her and she started saying all sorts of hurtful and mean statements about how I'm a terrible child.

At first I understood, because of social distancing you can't hang out with that much people so the gatherings were only between like 3 people (our group is made out of like 8 people) but now they've all got together and didn't invite me. I had asked my friend a couple of times to hang out but she always said she needed to study and all that. Then I saw on Instagram last weekend that she hung out with the rest of my friends. The next day she suggested to hang out but I was too hurt so I told her I had something else to do. Anyways, this getting excluded thing always happens to me on and off during periods of my life, and I used to try to talk about it before but it never got anywhere, and by that I mean I never got a straight answer to the question ""why didn't you invite me?"" it was always kind of like ""oh, it just happened and we forgot to tell you"" so I don't really know if that would be the right choice. I feel like I have 3 options: 

1. Confronting her, which on one hand may give me some clarity but on the other I will probably get no answer and I'll just feel annoying and intense.

2. Just walking away from the group completely, which I feel like would be the more ""self-respecting"" option but it will also be painful and sad and maybe too drastic. 

3. Actively try to include myself in activities and talk more with other friends from the group, but I feel pathetic chasing after people that didn't take me into consideration.

279,"Explanation:

I hate myself whenever I experience any conflicts with friends and family. I just keep seeing my flaws of being easily irritable, stubborn, defensive, and unable to resolve conflicts. I have been seeing a therapist for years, read many psychological self-help books and watched TONS of podcasts, and I admit that I have seen improvements. But, now I feel like I'm going mad where my emotional and rational sides of my brain are warring with each other.

 I really want to just give up because I hate that I have so many flaws and how I am such a burden. But then I tell myself rational thoughts that give me a ton of anxiety because I just can't switch off my self-defeating thoughts. My emotional self just doesn't want to hear the rational thoughts. For example, my logical mind tells me:

 \- Rather than wallowing in self-pity, I can put effort into learning and practicing ways to resolve conflict and stop letting people push my buttons. And, it takes two to form strong relationships so stop putting all the blame on me because my flaws are also an opportunity for others to be patient and kind with me. I'll be fine if relationships don't work out because there are people out there that are a better match for me. 

It's like when a more emotional feeler expresses their frustrations to a rational thinker. The feeler ends up more upset after talking with the thinker because the thinker goes straight into providing solutions. And, the thinker is frustrated because the feeler keeps struggling with the same problems instead of simply following the solutions.

I’m looking for a bit of advice. 

I had been planning on moving to Los Angeles from Orlando before the pandemic after my college graduation, and obviously that’s out of the picture. My degree is in Media Production and my dream is to work in creative development. 

I’m stuck in my home town living with my parents and I’m going crazy. I want to move, but I’m unsure if it’s the best move. I don’t know whether to suffer through my living situation (I currently live with my mother and step-dad and it’s... not great. My mom is a narcissist and my step-dad is on disability and just plays video games all day. My mom unloads her problems on to me because she’s frustrated at her husband and calls me “her little therapist” but I can’t take it anymore.), and save money, or just say screw it and move to a new city and hope for the best. I have about $11k in savings, which would keep me afloat for a bit. I’m just worried because the job prospects are essentially zero and I don’t know when or if I’d find a job. 

I was wondering if anyone could help me out figure out my situation? I don’t have many I can turn to, and I just want to know what the best course of action would be. It feels like this situation is never ending and I don’t know how much longer I can be here. I don’t particularly care where I move, since I have no attachments either way. Ideally I’d like to be on the West Coast, or at least out of the South in general. I just feel stuck and it’s really wearing down on my mental health. I suffer from Bipolar disorder along with major depression and anxiety, and I feel like I’d rather being broke in a city than save money and live at home while my mental stability declines. 

Thank you for listening to me, and I’d appreciate any help or advice you’d be willing to give.",26May2020,1

282,Well my best friend and I want to start a new life. My only form of communication with her besides face to face conversations is the Minecraft chat. We’re still in our teens  so we have 3 to 5 years to prepare. We just want to start a life together in a place that we choose and live our own life’s with out other people interfering. We still don’t know how we’re gonna get to the place we want to go and we both don’t have jobs. Could you guys tell me some names of towns in the USA with a small population size. I also don’t know how I’m gonna make a living and take care of her. So what’s a normal job that pays an amount that both me and her can live a comfortable life together. So what I’m basically asking is how to start over. If you can’t tell by my writing I’m just a kid. I personally don’t have good home  but I am a male so I have to suck it up. She’s lives a very conservative home but we’re both happy this is just and idea it’s not a clear plan but I’m not really sure what I’m asking for anymore. Well I guess I just want to start a new life in a new place. Could you guys help,26May2020,1

So I’m 16 and like to drink alcohol. I noticed I couldn’t keep skimming from my parents bottles I needed to find a way to get my own. So I came up with the idea of using my dads id. I figured with the mask, because of corona, I would be able to use it okay. Problem is I don’t really look a lot like my dad, his hair is short and straight and mine is longer and curly plus he’s old and has wrinkles. So I put on a hat to try and hide the height difference. With this plan worked out I snuck my dads id out of his wallet, changed clothes into jeans and a hoodie so they couldn’t really tell my age ,and walked to the liquor store down the street. When I got there I put on my mask out of view of the store and put on the hat to try and hide my hair. I walked in and looked around before grabbing a bottle of rum and going to pay, I was hoping the cashier wasn’t going to ask for my id because of the mask but she did. So I handed her the id and she looked at it for about 2 seconds before saying “Thats not you” I replied “What do you mean?” She said “This is not you.” So I took it back from her and lied “Oh damn I grabbed the wrong one from the table, this one is my dads, I’ll be back later.” And I left as quickly but as calmly as I could. I really really doubt she believed me and now im worried about what will happen. I rarely ever go there so I am not worried about being recognized there, but sometimes my dad goes there to get lottery. I’m worried the cashier might remember what the photo looks like from his id and might say something. But then again he would be wearing a mask, so is there really much chance of her remembering?",26May2020,1
284,"So i’m 21, just got a great job, and the perfect opportunity came up- my friends need a roomate in order to move to the city. I took them up on the offer and we are exploring sites for apartments, and planning on moving out on July 1. 

I feel like I knew this was coming, but didn’t think it would be so soon. I had plans to move out with my boyfriend of 4 years in the summer of 2021, and we have discussed it and we can still do so. The lease I would have with my friends would be 1 year. I just don’t feel ready, but I know that if I stay at home with my family any longer i’ll go crazy. I love my family, but I just can’t handle them sometimes. I think the reason for me being hesitant to leave is the family dog (we just got him in january after my other dog passed at 14 years old) and i feel so attached to him. I also feel attached to my room, my ways of living, and how I have everything now. I don’t feel ready but I know that if i don’t take advantage of this opportunity i’m going to regret it. 

The friends i’m moving out with i’m very close with, so it’s not a matter of me being uncomfortable with someone else, i guess it’s just the strangeness of living in a different place than I’ve been for the past 21 years of my life. I don’t know what to do. Has anyone had any similar situations and feelings of dread? How did you all handle it? Should I just suck it up and force myself to be comfortable with it instead of living with my family for another year?",26May2020,1
285,"I recently joined reddit, so hello to everyone! I don't know how to feel about this, so stick with me while I rant about it.

I recently found out my high school theatre program chose Bring It On: The Musical for next year's season. While I've already graduated, and am going into theatre in college, I think that this is a bad choice for many reasons.

It's a show about gymnastics, which is very hard to pull off, especially on stage. Theater magic can only do so much, but this show is complicated for professionals. To think that high schoolers will be doing it makes me really nervous, because without the proper training someone WILL get hurt. I just don't want that to happen.

Another, less serious reason - the director CONSTANTLY plays favorites. It's my suspicion that they chose this show specifically for an upcoming senior to play the lead. While she is very talented, I don't think that this show would be right for her. While this isn't a big deal, I still think that this show was a bad pick for this director to make.

Part of me wants to leave it alone, because I've graduated and for the most part moved on from the program. The other part of me wants to somehow stop it before they begin, like writing a petition or protesting or something. So what I'm asking is - what should I do?

(If you've made it this far, thanks for letting me get this out. I don't know why this affected me so strongly.)",26May2020,1
286,"I work for a small business that had to close to the public due to the VID, and as a result, the owners had to lay off all the staff and help the few remaining customers themselves.

While working there has been super rewarding and interesting, it isn't without its challenges. The work itself can be stressful, and the environment can be emotionally toxic, with customers that can be absolutely brutal and internal drama that would just put me in knots having to witness. I have tried to leave before, but I am a big softie and always ended up staying on board after tearful talks with the owner.

For weeks in isolation, I spent a huge part of my time agonizing over my job. I made the choice to quit due to the fact that, despite the hideous state of the world, I was feeling so much more physically and emotionally stable without having to go to work. It was an incredibly difficult decision to make because I understand that this is a really hard time to be a small business, and I respect the owners and all their hard work! Please don't tell me that quitting during a pandemic is a dick move, I have already ugly cried about it.

I recently recieved an email saying that my bosses need help, but none of my coworkers want to go back. I am willing to help my bosses get caught up, but after that I need to get out of there! How can I:

A- Make sure that I don't get trapped by my baby soft heart and end up staying at a job that is 100% wrong for me because I cannot refuse anybody that needs help?

B- Let my bosses know that I still care about them and their business, but I have to focus on myself and looking for new opportunities?

C- Not feel like a terrible person afterwards?

PS- I am a grown-ass adult! I know I should just pull up my grown-ass pants and take care of myself, but I can't help feeling guilty and overwhelmed whenever I consider not helping out at all.

288,"My roommate's boyfriend's parents have COVID-19 and have had it for over a month. They have yet to test negative but since she was feeling lonely, she invited her boyfriend over to our place after they both quarantined for three weeks. I was not comfortable with that and mentioned it and she agreed to not have him over anymore until his parents test negative and decided she was going to go home for a month. She then decided that that wasn't fair for her to go home as it is her right to be in the apartment as much as it is mine (I don't think so since I pay more).

However, she's been buying furniture and needing his help to get it our apartment which means he's been coming into the apartment after I asked her to not have him over. I have explained to her multiple times that she is putting not only my health at risk but the health of the customers and co-workers at her job, however, she just answers with ""I don't want to talk about it anymore"". Not only that but her birthday is coming up and she's inviting a few friends over and told me that irregardless of what I said they were going to come over. As if, the entire world did not go on lockdown for a reason.

Now I'm feeling stuck not knowing what to do as I can't go anywhere and she refuses to not be around her boyfriend or others. If anyone has any suggestions of what I could do please let me know :/",26May2020,1

He claims that he loves me, and I know he does bc he showers me in love, encourages me, spoils me, and always tells me how excited he is to have a future with me etc. From the beginning of our relationship he was 100% straight up about anyone and everyone he’s ever had sex with or hooked up with. Or at least, that’s what it seemed like. He had a hoe phase for a bit the year before he met me which is fine, and he has always exclaimed that he was lonely and depressed during that time in his life. With that said, over the past few months, I found out that there was another body and he claimed he genuinely forgot. I gave him that, but then he was showing me something funny w a friend the other day and in the old convo it showed that he had stated that he had yet ANOTHER body, something he had never brought up. Apparently he forgot that one too, it was some girl he met on tinder that he drove to have sex with once but he also forgot about her as it was during his time of depression. I tried to move on from it but when he went to take a nap, I looked on the key words of his text messages “piped” and found out about ANOTHER body he had and also found out that one girl he had told me about (that he said only gave him head) he apparently piped twice at the time. (He was telling his best friend). He one again apologized and claimed that he genuinely didn’t remember and the only reason I give him the benefit of the doubt is Bc 1. He’s never given me a reason to think he’s not loyal during our relationship, 2. We have each others social media, not for surveillance purposes but just because we’re that close, and he’s always been respectful, reports anything fishy to me, and has always been someone I could trust and has never cheated on me or flirted with anyone. I’m not saying I don’t trust him anymore, but I feel hurt and everytime I find out that there is one more person, it hurts. I feel this ache whenever I think about the fact that I didn’t know these things, and the possibility of him keeping it from me. I told him I wouldn’t judge him no matter the amount because the past is the past but he swears he would and he does but he doesn’t remember a lot of it. I want to cut him slack because I know depression CAN cause memory loss but, fuck. I don’t know if I get hurt because I’m not as experienced, and I don’t know if that whole depression thing is as sincere bc how could he forget he fucked that one girl TWICE, if he clearly remembered she gave him head?

299,"Ok, this is a throwaway count that I never thought I’d need, but I’m being extra careful for no reason.

For starters, like the title says- I’ve never dated anyone. Although more accurately, I’ve never been in an actual, serious relationship. I’ll start with some context because I feel like that is going to give me the best chance of getting something useful from this.

I’m a short dude, and gained a ton of weight the first two years of college, but I’m finally getting serious about losing it all and being healthy for once in my life. My appearance is a big factor into my anxiety, which we’ll get to in a little bit.

The girl I like is pretty much the opposite of me from what I know about her but we’ll get into that later as well. Our college created a Facebook group for our entire class when we were incoming freshman and a lot of us used that as a platform to get other students’ Snapchats and instagrams to ideally make friends. Well, we’ve had each other on just about every social media platform you’d expect for 2 years now and I’ve never had an actual conversation with her. I keep telling myself that I’ll do it eventually, and here I am. 

I have really bad social anxiety, and a good portion of it comes from my self image. My self esteem is generally somewhere between low and neutral. I’m an introvert, I have a few very defined hobbies that I stick to, and live a considerably quiet college life. This girl on the other hand, is very different. From what I know from what she’s posted since we’ve been in college: she’s in a sorority and she likes to party. This alone is very close to being enough to make me give up, and for a while it did. But now that I’m trying to get back in shape, I really want to shoot my shot. Scratch that, I don’t want to shoot my shot that’s terrifying, I want to talk to her and get to know her without all of the hard work of jumping anxiety hurdles. 

I’ve been crushing on her for a while, pretty much our entire college careers. I’m mostly worried that she is or would be completely disinterested in me, and my fear of rejection loves to use that as an excuse for me to keep putting off trying to talk to her. Realistically, I do think she’s out of my league, but more like kind of out of out of my ballpark. Like, I don’t like my chances, but I think they’re certainly better than some of my crushes from high school. 

I’m not sure because I feel like I want outside help in how to handle the situation, but also part of me thinks coming to Reddit for answers is already a testament to how low her standards would have to be for me to even have a chance. I don’t know. Writing this has been really weird because it’s almost therapeutic but also very anxiety inducing at the same time.

My biggest questions are: Do I wait until I’ve gotten into better shape to try and talk to her, or do I jump the gun and try now. Also, any ideas on how to start a conversation would be much appreciated.",26May2020,1

301,"So I'm a guy, and I've been close friends with this girl for a while now. Some context. We started off as lowkey friends, talking on social media but not much in real life. Soon, it became a platonic friendship, but then we started spending a lot of time together and opened up to each other a lot and long story short we're best friends now. 

Honestly, I have mad feels for this girl (cliche crush description time): she's pretty, has a lovely voice, great smile, beautiful hair, awesome sense of style, and wonderful personality, but there's just one problem: she's into girls, and has a girlfriend. But I still have feelings for her. I mean, sure I've crushed on other girls, but whenever I interact with them, I don't get the same butterflies in my stomach that I get when my friend hugs me or touches my hand? (pre quarantine ofc lol)

I'm NOT going to tell her how I feel because she's in a relationship, I know she does not feel the same way, and I don't want to make the friendship super awkward. I'll admit it, a part of me secretly wishes we were a couple, but I respect her sexual orientation and I'm totally cool with being friends. So I've decided the only way to solve the problem is to get over her. But the only problem is that...I can't? Even though I've tried to start liking other people, my friend is always in the back of my mind?

303,"Hi, my names Lucy, I'm in the 8th grade, approaching ninth. I have a close friend, who I'll just call J. Let me tell you a little bit about J. She is the same age as I am, same grade. She is very laid back, and pretty chill overall. But as of last summer, she has been acting sort of strange. Whenever I'd ask her to call, or hang out, she would say she's busy. And this wasn't a one time thing, this happened every time for the past year. When I asked her further, she wouldn't tell me.

And not only that, but she hasn't been getting any sleep whatsoever. She has been getting the bare minimum to survive. She goes days without sleep, because she ""doesn't have time to sleep"" and shes ""busy"" Some of the only sleep she gets is in school. The only clues I've gotten as to whats going on, but might not even be related, is some sort of combat training thing. She says it doesn't end until the people running it are done. I'm not sure if its related, but I know she spends a lot of time there.

One other thing I remember, is when I asked her how long this could be happening, she said she doesn't know. And that it could be happening for a long long time. And I know what your probably thinking, it's something illegal and sketch, but I'm just not so sure. I brought it up, and she said not to worry because it isn't illegal and she promises shes okay. Maybe she's lying to me? She is a very mature and logical person, and I don't feel like she would get caught up in that stuff willingly. 

If any of you know what could be happening, I would appreciate some direction. And if you need more details, i'll tell you all I know.",26May2020,1

I don’t even go to school with these people anymore. I went to an early college program and they’re at a regular highschool. And I don’t know them very well at all.
But I’ve been seeing this boy bully the crap out of a girl I used to sorta know. He has made a tik tok about her that had her first and last name, which compared her to a rat. And now he’s sending rat emojis to her on social media. Also I’ve heard about some other mean junk he’s done to her from a friend that goes to that school.

306,"I would really appreciate some gentle advice on this issue. Due to recent circumstances I am currently living with my dad - and yes, I am saving up to live on my own but it's not easy or something attainable in the very near future.

The problem is my dad makes me feel sick. Whenever I'm around him I feel physically nauseous. I'm not sure if it's anxiety or what but it's really awful and I feel unsafe. I can't say he's ever really ""acted inappropriate"" but he's definitely made me uncomfortable a lot. When I was a teenager he would ask for a ""kiss on the cheek"" before doing something for me (e.g. giving me a lift somewhere). I'm very strict with my boundaries now but he never really respected anyone's physical boundaries - that might be fine in some families but it always made me feel really creeped out. I also feel bad for feeling so creeped out as I ""shouldn't"".

He certainly used to make a lot of strange and uncomfortable comments when I was growing up, such telling me I should not ""ruin my life and get pregnant"" when going to my male friend's house for band practice, that I was ""actually very pretty"" the first time I wore makeup and a dress, mild comments about my body such as my legs being too skinny, etc. I think the biggest problem is that he raised me with the belief drilled into my head that any and every man would take advantage of me given the opportunity (mostly insinuated, with comments such as ""be careful around your uncles""). This attitude seriously damaged my view of men and ability to trust (I'm still working on it), and I think maybe that's why I feel so uncomfortable around him?

He also has a girlfriend half his age and only a few years older than me which makes me feel grossed out in all honesty. He's a uni tutor and asked her out, they've been going out for a few years now. She's in China and can't return currently to Covid, but I definitely want to move out before she comes back (I have nothing at all against her personally, but the relationship makes me so uncomfortable).

We talked every single day even outside of school but I started to distance myself once I realized I was growing feelings for him (mind you I didn’t tell him how I felt, I really didn’t see the point since he was in a relationship). We stopped talking near the end of last year around the time I started dating someone. He texted me out of the blue (after not talking for two months), and after talking for a few hours he casually dropped “if I were single when we became friends two years ago, I feel like we could have worked out”. This shook me, I ended things with the guy I was seeing since I realized I still had feelings for my friend. We stopped taking again, NOW post 7 months of not talking to each other , I do want to check up on him to see how he’s doing (he’s doesn’t have any social media). Should I text him or is it a bad idea ? What should I do?? Any tips on getting over someone ? Thanks (:",26May2020,1

He’s 46 I’m 20, ahhh right?!

Mmmk so I finally got out of a really bad domestic violence situation with him, took me a few years we have police interference bla bla. He’s been charged. Don’t wanna say much.

Anyway.

Cunt is guilt tripping me stalking my Spotify and emailing me. Like I asked for it by my Spotify playlist, cause he thinks it’s meant for him, as a communication. You can imagine; its both sad and aggressive.

Regardless It’s all hidden now now I have found out he is trying to use it against me. 

Thing is; I have a full avo have for about 2 years, there was a recent breach and he has assault charges going to court soon.  I feel guilty for putting those playlists public knowing he could find them, but they were for me not him. He’s going to try use that. I’ve reported everything. Fuck this asshole. He’s trying to pull at anything to loosen his sentence. Wants me to drop the sentence and he himself claims I’ll be in legal trouble for my Spotify because he thinks it’s directed to him are you kidding?...

I don’t even need advice, I just wanna promote how much of a cunt this wank stain is.

311,"Hi. I’m 14 years old. I’m in great physical shape, I play many sports, I have a good social life, and I successfully got into a prestigious high school. All this may seem like the marks of a good, healthy lifestyle, but that’s not at all how I feel.
I have no financial issues at all, none of the real problems other people face. And yet, I feel like I’m falling apart, and I have no direction. Yes, I’m doing things but I feel like there’s no purpose to any of the things I’m doing. I feel as though everything that can be done, has been done, so there’s no point in me even trying. If it wasn’t for the high expectations of my family, I’d probably lay in my bed till the end of time. I have no motivation, no reason for anything. I’m not suicidal, at least I don’t think I am. I don’t want to put my family through something like that, though the idea of eternal peace and quiet is...appealing. I just don’t know what to do anymore, or how to tell anyone how I feel. So here I am, on reddit of all things. Someone, please help me. I’m wasting away, and I’m afraid for my future. I just want advice and guidance, nothing more.",26May2020,1
312,"""Do something you love and you'll never work a day in your life"". A piece of advice I hear everywhere, basically saying that if your interest can make you a livable wage, then go for it and your life will be happy. It's a piece of advice that I genuinely intend on following... but it's not that simple.

Every time I've been asked what I want to do for a living has always been answered with a vague ""oh, I dunno... something"". Or when I do give answers, it's different every time. And that's just because my interests are constantly changing. Everything from being an actor or filmmaker, to being an author, to being a game deisnger, to being a YouTuber or Twitch Streamer. I've wanted to all of those things just in the last half year. Sometimes, I do try to follow these interests, but what ends up happening is I get the interest for like a week or two, then I lose the interest and thus the motivation to keep going with it, before moving on to something else. Now it's gotten to the point where I do get an interest, but lose the motivation to do that immediately, knowing I'll just abandon it before I get anywhere with it. This has been fine for the most part, as I've been a kid/teenager trying who doesn't have to worry about trying to complete these things or paying the bills, but I'm running out of time.

I'm now 17 and out of Highschool (not a graduate, but got my GED) and while the coronavirus situation has given me more time, that time is still limited and I'll have to come up with a decision eventually. And I really don't want to end up working 9 to 5 in an office wishing I'd done more with my life. So what do I do? How do I get myself to stay focused on one thing so I can get to the point where I can live a happy life doing what I enjoy for a living?",26May2020,1

315,"I feel burned out from working hard in high school, and I want to get my passion and drive back. 

When I was in high school I had a killer work ethic. I did 1000's of extra math problems after doing my homework, I memorized speeches for hours, I read textbooks multiple times through etc. I got straight A's, was top 5% in my class. I also wrestled and had a true drive to get better constantly. I was really disciplined and proud of my experience in high school. 

I feel burned out now. I go to a decent university and have almost a 4.0 and I am on the wrestling team. That must sound ridiculous, but college has been way easier than high school because I went to a very, very competitive high school. Anyways, I do not feel motivated to pursue my career goals, I am not challenging myself on the wrestling mat, and I feel like I'm not being purposeful with my actions. 

I reflect on my time in high school and I wish to be like that again. I was on a grind 24/7. I have forgotten what it's like to be truly, truly challenged. Senioritis hit me hard and now I am very complacent and even though I am doing well in school that is not because of work ethic, but because I developed good habits in high school. My worry is that I haven't been able to achieve my new goals, and really I haven't even tried to achieve them. 

Can anybody relate to this? I feel almost like a different person and I want to get back to my old form. I want to feel prideful again.",26May2020,1

318,For context: I am graduating with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Digital Marketing. I've no idea what the job opportunities are going to look like and I'm not sure what I can do to give myself a better shot when opportunities come.,26May2020,1
319,"I'm going to be vague with details like names, dates, and locations.

I lived a poor but happy life in the northern United States up until my 9th birthday. At that age, I didn't know what racism was, nor did I think it was unusual that there were people who had a skin color that was different from mine. I thought a different skin color was as normal as having different hair color. As far as I knew, there was no such thing as a minority. I thought that there was equal distribution among all ethnicities. I guess you could call it the innocence of being a child, but my parents also didn't raise me to judge people based on how they looked.

My family then moved down south to a border town that was 1% white and 99% Hispanic, so for the latter half of my childhood I was the only white person any where I went (excluding my family of course). That didn't really sink in until I started getting the impression from people that there was something wrong with my skin color. And mind you, the fact that I couldn't speak or understand the Spanish language only enabled those who had a problem with my skin color to openly discriminate against me.

I became very self conscious of my skin color. I felt like everyone was always staring at me and I could never be comfortable and relax. I never wanted anyone to see who my parents were because I thought that it would remind or inform whoever bothered to befriend me that I was in fact white; that's how messed up my logic was at that age because of how self conscious I had become.

I thought that there was something wrong with being white, I was ashamed of my skin color, which resulted in me having very low self esteem and almost no confidence. If someone didn't laugh at my joke, I didn't know if it was because I was white or because the joke just wasn't funny. If a girl turned me down, I didn't know if it was because I was white or they just weren't interested. I didn't know whether the problems in my life could be solved with self-improvement or be forever unresolved because the root cause was my whiteness which I couldn't change. This mindset was that of severe hopelessness and I never once talked about it with anyone growing up.

My self esteem, confidence, and shame for my parents isn't quite as bad as it was back in my childhood, but these negative thoughts are still very present. I love my parents with all my heart, they're my heroes for what they've sacrificed and how they've conducted themselves in the face of roads that would've been much easier but also immoral. I don't want to feel any ounce of shame for them, but I just can't seem to shake these feelings off my shoulders.

As far as romantic relationships go, I don't know if my own issues with being white has made me start discriminating against white women or just the number of white women who could relate to what I went through is so astronomically low that finding someone I connect with who happens to be white is simply an impossibility. All of my romantic relationships have been with black women, hopefully it's because we can more easily relate to one another and not because I've become racist against white women; though it's just my luck that the women I'm most compatible with is also one of the most tested kinds of relationships in America (white male, black female).

This is the very first time I've tried expressing my thoughts on this experience in my life, so if it comes across as a little too stream of consciousness, my apologies. If you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them, and if you have any advice for me, I'll be happy to listen. Thank you for reading my rather lengthy post.",26May2020,1
320,"So my friend has been with (and I use the term “with” *very* lightly) his girl for 6 years now, and she is the only girl he has ever been with. Sexually and relationship wise. And they broke up for the umpteenth time 3 weeks ago, He called me today with the same bogus story on how things are getting better and they’re talking again blah blah blah- you know how it goes. This is something that has happened for SO LONG and it’s a constant cycle of him being hurt and depressed, he started smoking weed pretty heavily to cope with the anxiety he has (which is 100% stemming from her) and is constantly beating himself up over how the relationship is going. The issue i’m having is he does NOT see ANY issue with the situation, and no matter what i say- he won’t listen. He just tells me i don’t understand their relationship and that i need to back off, even if he came to me for “advice”. I’m at the point where i genuinely don’t know what to do, and it hurts me really bad seeing him go through this shit, considering how he takes everything emotionally like i explained above. The thing is though, he’s genuinely such a good man, he has a great job- he has dreams and aspirations that he’s actively going after, he’s empathetic to everyone so much so to the point where he’ll self sacrifice for someone else’s wellbeing- and on top of that, he’s an amazing friend. He’s done things for me that i will never be able to repay him for, so it’s not something i can just cut him off over and wish him his wellbeing’s.

321,"As long as I can remember my father has never stood up for me. One of my earliest memories of this was when I was about 8 yrs old and I beat my stepbrother at swimming and he started to punch me and I ended up with bruises all over. My father made me apologize to my stepbrother for having won. This has gone on forever. Even after he divorced his ex-wife he kept her son in our lives. SB-stepbro, stole from me, humiliated me, and physically harmed me. My father always told me to l”let it go”. His ex-wife slapped me when I was 15yrs old because she made a comment about my mother and I defended my mother. After telling F-father, he told me that I should have kept my mouth shut and that’s just how ESM-Evil stepmom, was. 
Anyway, that was back when I was a teenager and I was able to move to my own place. But I still allowed my F in my life. When I was 27 my F divorced his 3rd wife (Im (36 female)the product of his first marriage and only legitimate and legal child) he came to live with me. It was pretty good between me and F for a few years, until he without my permission moved in SB into my apartment. It was so horrible because SB’s behavior was just the same. Add to that he’s also an alcoholic and drug (pills) addict. It got so bad that I eventually left and went to live with my mother. About a year later my F couldn’t keep up with the payments for my apartment so I decided to rent it out and have them move. 
Eventually we moved back to my apartment. (No SB) However in 2017 a hurricane destroyed my island and I was left without a job and my health declined. I was lucky if I got to eat one meal a day. My F asked his older brother who lives in USA if I could go stay with them. OU (older uncle) said yes and that I was welcomed to stay with him and his family as long as I needed as long as I found a job. As soon as the airpot opened I was off to the mainland. I got a job and offered to contribute to the bills and house expenses. My OU and his wife OA(old aunt) declined multiple times with the excuse that I should save money to move into my own place. Ohh how naive I was to believe they were doing this out of kindness. For more context my OU has his daughter and 3 grandkids living with him. However they have a big house with enough space for everyone. One of my cousins kids is autistic, but extremely high functioning autistic, he only has no filter and will say things that hurt your feelings. Something that they never correct. They also have this little dog that will bite at any given moment. My OU is very critical and morbidly obese. She would constantly criticize my weight (I’m not fat, in fact I lost weight during the time after the hurricane since there was hardly any food available I spent 2 months without electricity and the water was poisonous and in the first weeks after the hurricane 9 people had died from drinking the water. In total more than 4 thousand people died in the aftermath of the category 5 hurricane. We had also had another hurricane pass a few weeks before the most devastating hurricane in my islands history happened) She warned me that I shouldn’t date any black men, and that they would come after me since I look white but I’m latina, and that they love that combination. I rolled my eyes at that because my grandmother OA’s MIL is an Afro-latina. And OU and OA’s daughter is not white looking at all, down to the extremely curly hair she inherited from OA. I told my F this and all he said was “let it go”. So I did. OA and OU would constantly belittle me for my age (33 at the time) and that I was starting from zero. Completely ignoring the fact that I lost my business due to the hurricane. I still “let it go” as my F kept saying and concentrated on saving money to move out. During the summer of 2018 they went to our native land for a month to visit my grandfather. While they were there, their oldest grandson stole their car. They had their daughter call me to accuse me of stealing said car. I explained to her that it was physically impossible for me to do that since I was in fact sleeping and she had woken me up while the car was still missing. I told her to relax and that probably her son took the car. She screamed at me that her son wouldn’t be capable of doing something like that. My grandfather told my OA and OU that I would never do such a thing, and that he bets that I would rather walk to work. And a few hours later cousins son appeared with the car. I never got an apology from them. Which is something I knew they weren’t going to do. I called my F and told him that they accused me of stealing their car and that I was very hurt by it. My F told me to “let it go”.  Their little dog bit me multiple times completely unprovoked and one time I screamed at the dog that if he bit me again I would kick him ( I was actually bleeding from the bite) and of course I would never kick such a small dog, but they obviously heard me and they started screaming at me and accusing me of having kicked their dog. I said that I didn’t kick the dog and they saw as it happened since they were there and didn’t even lift a finger to stop the dog from bitting me. I called my F hysterically crying and explained the situation and he said that he understood their point because they love that dog and that I shouldn’t have said that to it. And to...”let it go”. Things like this kept happening, in one occasion I stayed over at a friends house since it was late and I didn’t want to Uber back home at 11pm at night. When I got home, OU was up and he accused me of being loose and staying at a mans house. And that he wanted me out of the house by the end if the week. I begged him not to throw me out since I hadn’t been able to find a place close to my job and I didn’t have transportation (buses here suck and don’t go to many places) He said ok and I stayed. His daughter said that she agreed to throw me out for my “loose behavior “ but what she doesn’t know is that I saw her fucking a former high school student of hers in his car up front in the driveway at 2am. Hypocrisy at its finest. I called my F pretty upset because not having a place to live gave me extreme anxiety and the PTSD from loosing almost everything after the hurricane was very high. Guess what he said? “I’m not gonna get in the middle of that and you should let it go” So I did. 
I was finally able to move out into my own apartment and my other uncle gave me a car that his wife didn’t want. He insisted that I shouldn’t spend my money since he had that spare car to give and that I should save my money. Looking back I should have gone and lived with him. That came with much criticism from OU and OA. 
A few months after moving I met the love of my life. It was literally love at first sight for both of us. I have never ever felt this way for any person I have dated. Hence why at my age (35 at the time) I was still childless and single. When I told this to my OA with much enthusiasm, she said “Don’t have children with him, they will be too dark and have nappy hair” As usual my F said to “let it go”. When me and my amazing partner got pregnant my very religious mother was so extremely excited! Even if we aren’t married my mother was so happy that I was going to be a mother myself and that she was going to have a grandchild to dote ove and spoil. My F was happy too. But when I told OA and OU they were disappointed to say the least. My OU walked out of the room. My OA told me that I had to get married because if not my child would be a “bastard”. I told her that I didn’t want to get married just yet. This really hurt me and I called my F and told him the racist things they said. Guess again what he said? “Let it go, they’re very old-school” A few weeks before my OU had texted me with a picture of the new house I was living in asking why my car was in the driveway at the time I was supposed to have been at work. Which I took as a bit psychopathic and stalker-ish. I said that me and my fiancé decided that since I had been extremely sick and he has a good job, I should quit my job until baby is old enough for preschool. Never got a text back. 
After this I did try and let it go but I just couldn’t. I’ve been very sick with morning sickness and it landed me in the hospital. While I was in the hospital my OU texted me and I forgot to answer him. A few weeks after that I texted my OA to see how they were (COVID-19 was ramping up) she never answered me back.  I called my dad and asked him to please call my OU and ask him if I had received any mail at their house since I’m expecting a very important letter. Apparently my OU started a verbal confrontation with my F saying how horrible I have been to them and that I have been ignoring them. 
My F called me back and screamed at me that I shouldn’t put him in the middle of two people he cares for. With my hormones and being extremely hurt by being put at the same level of my OU, I went off on my F. I told him again all the racist things they had said about my unborn baby and my partner. The horrible way they treated my partner and reminded him of all the times and things I “let go” of because he had asked me to. My father screamed at me saying he didn’t care and that it’s just the way OU is and that he didn’t remember that OU and OA had said racist things about my baby. But “so fucking what? That’s their opinion, and you shouldn’t be putting me in the middle of this. You should resolve this yourself. If you don’t like this and want me out of your life, that’s fine. I don’t care. I just don’t want to be in the middle of this” I ended up hanging up on on him. My partner was wide eyed since he doesn’t understand my native tongue, and all he saw was me crying and speaking very fast. I explained to my partner what was going on and he was obviously upset but told me he loves me and he will always be there for me and our baby. 
I honestly don’t know what to do. Obviously my OU and his family are out of my life for good and if he comes around my home, I will call the police. But idk what to do about my Father. He has never stood up for me. And this is just a small portion of the things he has permitted people in his life to do to me. What has made me want him out of my life is that he brought it up first and that he is unwilling to defend his future grandchild against the racist comments OU (which is his older brother) and OA (his sister in law) have said. For me this is the last straw. My Father has never protected me, but I will protect my baby from things that are not in his control, his skin color or the marital status of his parents. My baby hasn’t even been born yet and he is already treating him just like he’s always treated me...like shit. Idk if it’s because my Father thinks that no matter what, I will always be there. But I’m thinking of cutting him out of my life to not only protect myself from future harm, but to protect my baby.

322,"I didn't think this quarantine would have such an impact on my life/ mental health. I am a college student and prior to this lock down situation, I had gotten the biggest meltdown of my life I guess. It might be a small problem for a lot of people but it created such an impact on my life. First of all, I lost my immediate friend group and my best friend. There was a huge misunderstanding and I was ""cancelled"" essentially. I thought I had been doing the right thing all along as a friend, truthful and not sugarcoating anything, but I had overstepped my boundary and cared about his business too much. I only had the confidence to be so forward with him because we both agreed that if one of us was walking into fire, we should tell each other. I didn't know that I had accidentally said some things that hurt him, he never told me himself but told everyone else in the friend group. I found out only because I felt something off between us and I asked him. He denied there was a problem at first. It was only after I kept asking what was wrong, all hell broke loose. Since the cat was out of the bag all of the friends sided with him ( none of them cared enough to ask for my thoughts or my side). They pinned it on me and said "" you should have known he was uncomfortable"". I do take his feelings into consideration, prior to talking to him I would ask our friends in the mutual friend group for their opinion as well since it was situations they were aware of. They would agree with what I saw and at times even told me I should be the one to tell him since I was the closest to him. But after the fight, they said I too critical of him but when I brought up that when I asked them if it was a thing I should bring up with him and they all agreed  they turned it into "" I saw your point but I don't agree with you"". They scapegoated me and said I said bad things about him in order to convince them to side with me when in actuality they said worse things during the conversations. They also said that me being so straight forward is bad, and I should fix the way I talk. 

I initially gave him space to cool down because I thought that now that we both know I can fix my behavior and it would be fine again but he messaged me a few days later saying he doesn't want to have anything to do with me if it was not necessary. This tore me apart since I didn't know the problem was that severe that he didn't want me around anymore. My boyfriend at that time told me its ok, you can find new friends. It really broke me since I was ready to be ride or dies with him.

To add to the fire, my boyfriend broke up with me a few weeks later. I admit it was kind of my fault for being so upset over the best friend situation. It consumed my life, I could not go without a day wondering what i could have done better as a friend or why I couldn't have noticed earlier. If I had ignored the problems I saw, would it have been better? He kept telling me to drop it, move on, and make new friends. I just couldn't.  I definitely was not myself or the girl he knew. I guess it became too much for him and he left. The break up came as a surprise to me, I noticed that he was acting different around me and when I confronted him about it he suggested we should go back to being just friends. He eventually left for good and ghosted me. 

The Quarantine came at right time, or so I thought. I was glad because I didn't have to see them at events (we are all in the same Frat, best friend, friend group, and ex) because prior to the quarantine my best friend would avoid me and walk the other direction if I came a 10 ft radius close to him. This is where I'm starting to notice my problem. I happen to also live in the same hometown as him, I would start to get really paranoid that I would run into him at the grocery store and I would have to see the hate on his face when he looked at me (he would glare at me if he ever saw me on campus). Staying at home seems to be a safe space for me since I know for sure I will not run into him. At one point I had even wished for this quarantine to never be over so I would not have to attend frat events and run the risk of seeing them. Also, I'm scared I would come off as a loner at events since all of the close friends I made in the frat is no longer my friend.

I did try to make new friends, but I'm having issues. I'm always scared that I have said things that offend or hurt them without realizing which leads to me always rethinking about conversations I have with people. I also have an irrational fear that I had said something that led to them not liking me. I also question whether or not being confrontational is a good thing now. Prior to these 2 situations I have always been the type of person where if there was a problem I would lay it out. Now I wonder if somethings should be left untouched even if I have a feeling about it.  
A few months has passed since these situations and it is pretty clear I have reached a stage where getting back with the boyfriend and being friends with my best friend  is not possible. I just want to be able to talk to them again like a normal person, even just a friendly hello if we ever run into each other. I do admit I am in the wrong at some parts. I shouldn't have been so direct with pointing out the problems. Even if I did see it as a problem, I should have just let him live his life, but I was just scared he would get hurt. I have been so consumed by these situations that I have dreams of different scenarios where my best friend forgives me or my boyfriend coming back. 

To summarize with what I need help with (this has really been on my mind sorry for the long post)  
How can I gain confidence again? How can I move on? When should I be really direct about my opinion? Should I not tell a person exactly how I feel even if they ask for it just in case they get hurt?",26May2020,1

I do not necessarily want to change their views, more or less just not reply to the topic, for my sanity of the duration of this time. Does anyone have advice on this topic?

324,"So I live on a quiet street, two doors down from small community garden/park area (same land size as a small house). My neighbours, who are awesome, recently replaced a wonky rusted basketball ring with a new one. The ring is set at about 7ft and has always been used by the little kids every now and then.

Anyway, now that the new ring is up with a net and backboard, a bunch of older guys from a sharehouse down the road come and play all day every day. They're a little noisy, but the main issue for me is that the little kids don't play anymore because the ring is always occupied by these sketchy looking guys.

Obviously, my neighbour could just take down his ring. But it was meant for their kids and other kids and it would be a shame to lose it. I don't use the space at all so it doesn't impact me personally except for the constant dribbling noise I can hear. But it still frustrates me.

Background info: I've done some research and apparently this is commonish(?), But its been four months and I've yet to return to normal. I'm beginning to wonder if I've developed ED super early. Also, I did go through about a month or two of depression, or at least a prolonged period of sadness after the breakup which is normal I'd assume. 

I'm just looking for ideas, or to know if anyone else has experienced this and grown past it or if like this is permanent or honestly any information on what is going on. Is it perhaps due to myself stressing out about it?",26May2020,1

327,"In November of 2016, I left my university on a temporary leave of absence, with the intention that I would return at the beginning of the next academic year. I honestly felt like taking (just under) a year to “recharge” would enable me to readily come back to a rigorous academic environment. 

I was in my second year of a physics major with a minor in Russian Language &amp; Literature, and I was also involved in the ballet program and a sorority. I realized how thin I was spreading myself. What I didn’t realize was that the “burnout” I had been building up over my entire academic lifetime was going to hit me all at once. Over the course of my “temporary leave of absence”, I all but gave up on everything. I started drinking too much, I never did anything productive, and I never made any attempts at maintaining my social life. 

When it was time for me to return, I decided that I did not want to go back at all. In a lot of ways, I do feel that I made the right decision. I knew I did not want to be a physics major anymore, nor did I feel like going back to *that* place was good for my mental health in general. But I know I should have gone back to school for something else when it was time. I know that I should have at least gotten a job in the interim. I know that I made every decision, all by myself, that led to me being where I am right now. I also know that I’m the only one who can fix it; I just don’t know how. 

I’m seven weeks sober now, and I’m back on Lexapro. I *know* I feel better, and I *know* I can go back. But I don’t know *how*. It’s been so long that I genuinely feel like I’m not even part of the real world anymore. I know that there are extenuating circumstances right now that are keeping me isolated, but I want to get myself back into a spot where – when life does get back to a semblance of normalcy for everyone else – I am *ready* to “rejoin society”.

But I feel like I have nothing going for me anymore. I have nothing to put on a resume. I’ve been out of school for almost four years. I now have trouble being in social situations because I’m no longer used to it. I don’t even feel confident being in charge of my own finances anymore. I feel like I’m too far gone to fix things sometimes, and I know that’s not true, but I don’t even know where to start. I just need some advice on how to practically, logistically go about getting back to feeling like a *person*.",26May2020,1
328,"I know many of you have way more experience with  difficult people or have had similar stories and can contribute.

Here's  a little about myself for context: I'm a calm person, a nerd and I know  I make very good conversation. My intelligence is average, but I sound smarter than I am. Also I have always had  anxiety problems (recently I'm feeling really paranoid, but might be full of shit). 

**I've had jealous people in my life, but have never felt scared of one until now**

Here's a little about the guy, let's call him by his real name, Mike:

Mike  is the most mediocre person I have met, yet he has really high  expectations, which is a big source of frustration in his life. He is  plain stupid but he wants to assert himself as somewhat of a scholar, he  is mouthy, has no remorse, inmature like a fourth grader, jealous, a naracissist and  is a **coward**. I am afraid of cowards because of two reasons:

* cowards don't play fair (they like perpetual revenge)
* where I live you can get a hit or something similar on someone for cheap (cowards do this often)

Here's the story:

We  are both biology students in a b-tier college (low academic level) and I do better than Mike in school (actually, everyone does better),  I'm also likeable, so more opportunities come to me. He has  been jealous of me all along (I'm not that special tbf) because **I think I'm closer to being the kind of person he wants to be,**  and that drives him mad, so he just hates me for who I am and hates everything I do say and have. I've had  disagreements with him because I alone, no one else, have called him out  for his behaviours (petty theft, bullying, lying, insincerity). I have  stood up to him twice and once he deflected and the other time he kind  of got away with it because he had his friends to back him up (he turned  all those guys into unremarkable sprites of what they were). He has  shit-talked behind me for the last year, which has led to me losing all  of my regular class friends (great friends, I know). I don't  want things to escalate anymore, I'm just there to study.

**Here is where it starts to get dangerous**:   I do better with all the women Mike likes, for some fucking reason!  This I can't control. I'll literally do nothing and they have my  attention.  A few times he has tried to escalate things into violence,which I  think I don't know anymore if it's a bluff. I know that if we fight, no  matter the result he will just keep escalating things. Here's the thing:  **I don't want conflict, I don't want violence**,  I want to not care about his existence, but he is just going to be  there through all my fucking achievments for the time being and it's  going to drive him mad. I'm scared he will try something if I don't make  peace with this dumbass (logic doesn't work on him either he says he  just doesn't care about anything or anyone). He has talked about  violence, knifes, and about people ""disappearing"" when he feels insecure  and I just want to know what to do.

I  won't stop myself because Mike doesn't want me to succeed, and I  won't limit aspects of my life because of the whims of idiots. I'm  just a decent, very dedicated guy who is going to do well because of  effort and I won't put up with this. But I'd like to tread carefully because I don't know what to do or how  to do it correctly. Befriending could work, but don't know how to befriend someone who hates your guts.

Sorry for the long post, but I thank you all for reading it.

TLDR:  Guy hates me for existing, and I'm not planning to stop any time soon,  violence might be imminent and I'm just not that kind of person, need  help.",26May2020,1

333,"I wish this was a good damn over-exaggeration. their kid is six, and he is completely an utterly out of control. He was out of control before quarantine started, so we can't even blame it on the outbreak.

They seem to think, that he has ODD, oppositional defiance disorder. But they haven't brought him to get tested just yet, quite frankly I think they're waiting to get their house burnt down.

about 2 weeks ago this kid tried to kick their 16-year-old cat in the face. No fucking reason for it. The cat was quite literally walking past the kid and he lashed out with his foot. I was the only one That saw it, I yelled at him, they came in and asked what he did, initially yell at him as well and tell him that he has no toys for a week. The next fucking day the kids playing with his Legos.

Last I checked, Legos are fucking toys.

They are a large portion of the problem.

Yesterday I was cooking, my roommate was outside with his kid and my son. My son was playing with his drone, and the roommate's kid was watching him. After the drone got old, they found some old bags of kids paintballs and they were running around the yard throwing them at each other.

While I'm cooking I hear the cat meowing. Now the cat's dumber than a box of shit, so sometimes it gets itself locked in closets and bedrooms. So I walk around looking for the cat, he's not in any of his normal rooms or places where he might have gotten himself trapped. As I go walking through the dining room the sound of the cat meowing gets louder, and I see the top of cat's head inside a Rubbermaid tote.

Now now, I know what you're thinking. Dumb ass cat jumped in a tote and somehow the top closed on him. If the fucking tote hadn't been latched shut, I probably would have agreed with you.

So I signal for my roommate to come in to show him, his kid takes off running across the yard. Another indication that we know he did something wrong, because he knows he did something wrong.

It turns out the cat had been in that tote for the better part of two and a half hours. Was dehydrated, pissed itself, and we're damn lucky it didn't suffocate. The tote was sitting in a window sill in a large window, so the sun was also beating down on it.

When questioned, the kid said he wanted to play with the cat and that's why he put it in the tote.

I am moving in 2 weeks. I've known this cat since it was a kitten, and I really don't want to see this little shit kill it. But nothing I say or do seems to permeate the thick fucking skulls of its parents.

I live with my sister. She ran off to another country and did not pay rent because she met some guy. My family had to bail her out to get her back home. She does this stuff all the time.

Soon, I will likely be homeless. If it isn’t my sister it will be something else. But I cannot move into my own place. I do not make enough money to do so.

The most obvious solution is to work 2 jobs. Work 16 hours a day on my feet. I can’t. Already, working only 8 hours on my feet, I can barely straighten my legs out. My knees and feet at murdering me as it is I can’t just go ahead and double the amount of time I’m standing all day.

And that’s all I have, is minimum wage jobs. I have no other option. People will say go get educated or something. I don’t have time for that. I will be homeless long before I go to school and finish some degree.

I don’t need or want much in this world. I only want to be able to live in my own god damned apartment. I don’t even need a car I don’t need anything. I have nothing. I own a single pair of clothes and shoes and I wear them to work every day.

There is no escape for me. I am trapped in this hell and there is no way out.

Otherwise I’m an able bodied person and I am very intelligent. Though I suffer from social anxiety like you wouldn’t believe.

There’s so much I would like to do in life but I’m trapped. I have all the motivation in the world and nowhere to put it. I can’t make enough money to even live by myself. I have to live with my sister or my family. My family is extremely negative and they fight constantly.

I was in the military once upon a time. Life was okay. I got married. But then we split and I went to live with my family. Since then I have been trapped.

I wish I could just get a job where I could make a little more money. A job that doesn’t destroy my knees and shit like the one I have now. 

Honestly I just want to die. I have so many goals and dreams I wish I could get started on but I can’t because I don’t even have the money to support myself.

 I like to do art but to be honest I've only been practicing for about 3 years, i didn't have a big passion for drawing growing up so im really terrible compared to other people my age. I'm no where near the skill level to sell my art as a job, and i don't think i'm even good enough to go to an art school and improve-besides artist don't make much money and it doesn't seem practical to pursue art if i'm not that good at it and i   probably couldn't get a job.

My parents are very religiously conservative, and have always drilled in me and my younger sister that 1) We should NEVER pick up the bottle and 2) We need to “save” ourselves until marriage. 

I broke both of these rules in the past year. Following high school graduation, I finally began going to parties more often where I’d drink. On a cruise last summer, I lost my virginity, and since then I’ve slept with two girls, both of whom my parents thought are just close friends. Additionally, I’ve gone to a number of parties while at my junior college for the past year where I’ve drank.

My parents found out about both of these parts of my life at the same time. I accidentally left my iPad open on a conversation with a girl I’ve been hooking up with, and my dad snooped through it and saw the attachments, several of which were sexual and one of which was a video she took while we had sex. There was also a few pictures of us together at parties that I’d sent to her, which depicted me with a handle of Jim Beam in my hand. 

Recently, I got the good news that I was accepted into USC Marshall for the fall semester as a transfer student. I did not apply with any financial aid, because I’m lucky enough to where I didn’t need it. I submit my deposit last week, and now after these new developments, and lots of arguing and crying, my father has decided that I have until the end of June to move out, and to not expect another dime from them. 

I’m completely lost. How will I pay upwards of $70-80k for USC, especially since I have zero financial aid? Where can I even live? I have less than $500 to my name, and have never had a job.

I have a few dirt bikes and an ATV, and a lot of watches that are worth some money too. I doubt he would let me sell any of this so I’d need to do it quickly and secretly.

I'll preface this post by saying serving is not my ideal career. However, I have been in the industry for over a decade as I've moved around a lot, haven't finished college yet and kind of just don't know what I want to do in life still. I recently moved across the country and found a serving job in a place where it is extremely competitive to come by one, so for that I am grateful. I was working for about 3 weeks when we entered the stay at home order and I was laid off. Where I'm from originally is an extremely touristy area in the summer months and working in the industry in the summer is great money and such a short season it was much easier to mentally ""get through"" as the season was so short and I have been doing it for so long. To be frank, I really don't enjoy almost every aspect of serving, I hate that people don't take it as a serious job when it is both mentally and physically exhausting, the hours, the little to no benefits, having my pay  at the mercy of some customers who can be extremely rude, impatient, and disrespectful (obviously some are great but you always remember the bad ones lol). I've always known I don't plan on serving forever, but for some reason, being in this quarantine has really made me realize how much I hate it, so I enrolled in community college to finally get the ball rolling on finishing the rest of my degree so I can be done doing this in a couple years hopefully. I just received an email from my manager about returning to work, and it sounded as though they wouldn't be scheduling a lot of people yet until they knew what demand would be like with the new guidelines. I should mention that although I was only there a short amount of time, I like my manager and coworkers, and really appreciated how understanding they were in the email. I answered and said I'm happy to come back when needed but would like to do so on a part time basis. I didn't expect to be scheduled for a while but was just put on a few shifts within the next couple of days. I have extreme anxiety and dread about going back, I understand that sometimes we have to do things we don't like and i can't turn around and back out. But the thought of having to retrain with the new guidelines, deal with people who refuse to respect the guidelines and all around be in a even more stressful environment because of corona virus makes me sick to my stomach. Not having to serve for the last couple of months has made me realize how much time outside of work I spend thinking about how I want to get out of the industry. Again, it's not the restaurant, personally I am sick of the industry and now with everything going on it feels even more stress and anxiety inducing and I cannot stress enough how much I am dreading returning.

She’s the kindest person on this planet to me, and I feel comfortable around her, but the thing is that I don’t feel comfortable around my family. I often hold in my emotions and I can never let them out unless I’m talking to her. The only time I feel like I’m safe and when I can cry is around her, but I don’t feel safe to do it around my own family. Recently my step father has been quite harsh (well, harsher than he usually is) to me and when I was telling her about this and she suggested the idea that I run away from home and live with her. I, of course, thought this idea was crazy, but she kept listing facts why this idea is better than being in the situation I’m in now. I’d be living with her and her parents but she claims her parents wouldn’t make me pay rent (though I would like to pay if they were going to be so generous as to let me live in the same household as them). This girl loves me and wants to be with me for the rest of time, and she thinks I’d be in a better position if I had lived with her instead of my own parents. I just don’t know what to do and it’s 3AM and maybe I’m just going crazy, but I needed an outlet so I’m counting on you guys to give me your honest opinions/advice. I would really appreciate it, thank you.",26May2020,1

I’ve always been told that I need thicker skin- no real input after that. So I wanted to write this to see what others think about it and would love to read different perspectives about the 2 questions:

355,"I’ve been seeing worrying instagram stories on   3 of my close friends’ accounts about them abusing alcohol, their unhappiness, and having emotional breakdowns. i’m not sure how to respond to them or how to offer anything useful as I’ve been feeling sad too. whenever i see them talking about how they feel, i kinda feel guilty about my own sadness, like somehow their sadness invalidates my own because i see theirs as more valid or maybe even more severe. I want them to know I actually care but i don’t know how to help them if i don’t even know what to do myself and in a selfish way it makes me feel worse about myself. 
i also haven’t been able to express my own problems with them, so i worry that they think i’m insensitive or don’t care when i don’t always respond to those stories, sometimes i just can’t handle trying to listen to their issues l, and it makes me feel so guilty and selfish for not being able to.",26May2020,1
356,"A little backstory: I met this guy my age (18 at the time) on a dating app. I thought that we'd text and maybe flirt for like a few days and then we'd never talk again, like most of my conversations with guys go on dating apps go. But this blossomed into something that I've never experienced before. We met in June 2019. 

We talked every single day from the day we met. We had so much in common and I was (still am) very lonely at the time and believed that guys only wanted me for sex, which effected my self esteem kinda heavily. He wanted to have sex and I did too, but he also wanted to hang out with me, so I was excited because I saw him as a friend I could vent to and send funny videos too...I wouldn't be lonely anymore. Everything went smooth sailing until January 2020. 

He is very passionate about making music so he told me that he didn't want to talk to me anymore because he wanted to focus on his music. I panicked because I thought that I'd be dragged back into the hole of loneliness  and depression. Yes I was still lonely and depressed, but he helped me through it unknowingly. We stopped texting for about a week and then I messaged him, explaining how much he made me feel better because I saw him as a genuine friend. He said ""Well you haven't done anything to hurt me or anything, fuck it, let's keep talking"". When I say I knew everything about him, I knew *everything*; where he graduated high school, what job he had, his life in foster care, his siblings, his past relationship (he got cheated on). I even know his full name. He said that he'd be sad if anything happened to me and that he trusted me. We were good. 

On May 18th, he said this. 

Him: If you're attached to me in anyway, we should stop talking  :( 

Me: like as a friend or gf? 

Him: gf 

Me: Is this because you want to focus on your music? 

Then he unadded me. 

I texted him two days later, saying basically ""Don't just unadd me out of nowhere. Be an adult and talk to me, tell me why you don't want to talk."" 

He said ""You already know why"" then threatened to block me and I said ""whatever bye"" then I left him on read and unfollowed him from Instagram. Now I had a million emotions running through me: Fear, anger, hurt, confusion; so it just...exploded. I want to apologize to him, but I'm really scared he'll just read my message and block me on everything. 

I'm not sure if being really lonely causes clingy behavior and fear of letting people leave, but maybe I was being clingy and mistaken forcing him to stay because he knew that I was happy with him in my life. I also believe he's scared to start dating again because he got cheated on. I was hooking up with other guys and he knew about it, so I fucked up big time. Probably turned him off. 

P.S. We're both 19 now.",26May2020,1
357,"I’ve developed a habit over the past two or three years where I’ll hit my head when I start thinking about stuff I don’t want to, or that make me uncomfortable. I know it’s probably not good for me, but it’s been getting worse now, and it leaves me feeling a bit dizzy sometimes. I used to just slap myself but now I half punch myself to get myself to stop thinking, a couple times every several hours, but this will probably damage me in the long run so I’m trying to stop but I’m struggling finding a coping method that doesn’t involve hitting myself, especially since it’s kind of automatic now... I’ve googled for some methods but I’m having a tough time finding any.

We are both 24, I am a nurse so I do not smoke (though I have in the past) and he is in IT. He does his job and he does it well, he has never let it get in the way of his professional life- but I finally feel like it is taking a toll on our relationship. He got a pen that is pretty discreet and most days he smokes from the second he wakes up to the second he goes to bed (even while he’s driving, which I really don’t like). I work very long shifts and sometimes I just want to come home to a sober boyfriend.. he always tries to tell me “I’m the same me when I’m high” but he really isn’t. It’s not the same personality or conversation, and it’s really, really starting to get to me. I’ve talked to my mom about it and she told me he is young and will grow out of it, but I don’t know if I can wait for him to “grow out of it”. I am afraid that it’s a coping mechanism for something that isn’t being addressed, which is even scarier. Am I being unreasonable? I haven’t smoked much in my life, but I don’t feel like I’m wrong to think this is excessive.",26May2020,1
360,"Let me start off by saying he isn’t a present danger to himself or me. Some of the details are below to illustrate the severity of it.

This was a double whammy. First of all, he revealed that he was emotionally cheating on me with a woman he knew from the past. He wrote her a ton of love letters on Instagram and she eventually blocked him. 

Now he thinks that she has hacked our phones and computers. He is convinced that she is communicating with him when his phone screen lights up. He also thinks she was sending him cryptic messages through memes, and believes she is following him in real life.

He thinks she is rich and has people who may hurt him if he doesn’t continue to do what she wants. He left the apartment and wandered the streets talking into his cellphone with no one on the other line earlier. He had every intention of leaving me, and not going back to his job because he thinks she is rich and going to take him to live in Australia. 

He has never demonstrated any behavior like this before in the 4 years we have been dating. No drugs besides weed, which I have already flushed down the toilet. Obviously I am fucking hurt by his cheating and obsession, but it seems cruel to throw him out in the streets while he is mentally disturbed.

What are my options here? I am in Texas If that helps.",26May2020,1

In the many years we have known each other I never liked her in the way I liked other girls, but last year in January her boyfriend cheated on her and she can’t to tell me what happened. I realized then that I didn’t just love her like a sister like I originally thought but that I wanted to have more, I wanted to make sure no one ever treated her like that again. I have dated several girls and I have never felt the way I feel about her and I think this is what real love actually feels like. I told her about my feelings a few months after and we had a long talk about what would change and she even said she thought we’d make a great couple. I thought it was going good until she said she couldn’t be with me because she had started talking to her ex again and didn’t feel like it was fair to him. Being as close as we are, we quickly made up and went back to normal but my feelings never really went away. Her and her ex have been on and off since then and I haven’t said a word about our relationship since as I have been trying to get over her, but yesterday I was at her house eating dinner with our families and she walks into the kitchen behind me and puts her arms around me, tells me she loves me, and then hates me take a picture of her hugging me with her head on my shoulder. I can’t get it out of my head and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get over her with stuff like that happening. I know she loves me and she knows I love her but how different is loving someone like a friend and loving someone you’d like to spend the rest of your life with? I really don’t see it as that different, I just want what I had for a minute when she did that everyday. What do I do? She’s still hanging out with her ex currently, do I say something again? Do I try and forget about these feelings? I’m just really confused right now and I don’t know why but I feel like I’m doing something wrong by feeling this way about her even though I have no control over these feelings.

And after all these girls I’ve dated. When I jerk of it always brings me back to her nudes to make me cum.

My problem is you’re not trying, you gave up, and that is not okay. Cutting is a terrible thing, but not trying to stop is worse. You won’t let me help, you said you wouldn’t but you keep me in the dark, you don’t let anything change. You say you tried to stop and it failed, I always thought the phrase “if at first, you don’t succeed try try again” was a dumb quote, but it makes sense now. You went 3 weeks without it yet you say nothing can be done, It’s the most depressing thing I have ever been involved in. I haven’t cried myself to sleep in 4 years yet here I am, my problem is you do nothing and don’t care despite you knowing this is a problem. I know this is a difficult thing to talk about but it needs to be talked about, I know it’s hard to change but if you put in the effort it will be the best decision of your life.

I’ve been trying to be a lot more head-on with how I’m feeling, and doing all of this reading has opened my eyes to the different possibilities of things I may be going through mentally (sorry for no specifics).

Maybe I’m afraid of confrontation? (Characteristic 1). But that confuses me because I really feel like I am able to confront issues that seem really important and I know 100% need to be addressed. It’s the smaller things that seem to bug me and I start to overthink things, causing me to be moody and distant sometimes- a lot more recently (Characteristic 2). 

Here’s the thing, I’ve read that major characteristics include deliberately trying to hurt through sarcasm and back-handed compliments, I never EVER do that. Also, there are a lot more characteristics that I do not relate to. So am I passive aggressive? Obviously you don’t know me so you couldn’t tell me, but any advice?

I’m just really trying to work on myself and grow into an even more mature person, and a greater partner in my relationship.

(Excuse formatting, I’m on mobile)  
About 3 months ago at the time that I’m writing this I opened up to my parents about how my cousins (both male adults) sexually harassed me on 3 occasions. I was 9, 11, and 14. The most recent being 5 months ago. 

My parents were very supportive, they told me it wasn’t my fault, they still loved me, and they would talk about it with my Tia (aunt). 

I’ve been struggling with it for years now, and still am not over it. I have panic attacks almost 4 times a week lasting about 30 minutes. I haven’t truly accepted that it wasn’t my fault, and that I had no control over their actions. Sometimes I even get scared to open my door, and even have dreams about what happened.

About a couple weeks after I had told them, I looked up in my living room and saw a photo of both of my cousins when they were younger. About 12-13 at the time. Upon looking at it, anxiety almost immediately washed over me, and I began to think about what had happened to me.

So I walked out of the living room into my kitchen. Now our kitchen has 2 refrigerators. One is half freezer half fridge, and the other is just a freezer. I went over to the table which is located in the middle of the room.

When I looked at the freezer, there were magnets with both of their faces on it. This made my anxiety skyrocket. So it’s left the kitchen, and went into my room to calm down.

After a bit, I wanted to ask my mom if she could take them down. I went into her room and mentioned what had happened. I told her that looking at it made me upset, and if she could find a different place for them. She looked me dead in the eye and said,

Mom- “I’m not gonna take them down. That was before they did anything to you.”

Me- “I know but looking at it reminds me of what happened.”

Mom- “OP, its done. They’re gone, they’re not coming back to this house. Let it go.”

Me- “I know but I-“

Mom- “I’m not going to take them down.”

I didn’t want to start an unnecessary fight so I nodded my head and left. 

For the past 3 months, I’ve lived with their pictures in the living room and kitchen. I’ve tried to avoid looking at them as best as I could. But sometimes I can’t help but look in that direction.

It’s even worse in the kitchen, the magnets are eye level, so every time I open the freezer or fridge, I’m met with their faces, and reminded of them. I’ve tried moving them to the other side of the fridges, or even at the bottom of them. But the next day, it’s moved back up.

I don’t like it. I just had a panic attack an hour ago because I saw the pictures. I love my mom, but I really wish she could just take them down. 

At the same time, I don’t know if I’m asking too much or being irrational. I don’t want to be entitled, and request something stupid. I can’t bare to think about them more than I already do. 

So please tell me if I would be in the wrong if I ask my mom again to take them down.",26May2020,1

So I broke up with my girlfriend 2 weeks ago. I’d kind of delayed the whole thing because of quarantine and I didn’t think it’d be cool to do it during such a rough time.

380,"A freak accident occurred when the floor mat got pushed over the accelerator and my friend, who was driving my car, crashed into the neighbor's house. We weren't home at the time. He was getting into my car to come pick me and my husband up. 

No one was hurt. The car was totaled. The house suffered structural damage, but they do not need to move out while it is fixed. The house is over 4000 sqft and the only part unusable is their home office. However, it is a major pain in the ass for them. Insurance will cover it, but there will still be some expenses.

We were horrified and my husband and I were both very apologetic the day it happened. The next day, I wrote another apology. I knew that the gossip was flying in my suburban neighborhood and I avoided everyone for a few days after. I was traumatized. Anxious. Horrified. Etc. Then my dog died! It was a bad couple of days. Anyway, they did not acknowledge my written apology.

A few days later, they let us know that they felt we weren't sorry enough. They were angry. I went over and had a face to face conversation for over 2 hours, attempting to share my perspective and hear theirs - and of course I genuinely apologized many times during that conversation. I asked why they ignored my written apology &amp; they said it was because they wanted me to come say it to their face.  

As the conversation wraps up, they casually mentioned that they were mostly mad at my husband anyway, not so much with me.  They felt my husband was being very insensitive and showing zero compassion specifically because he had posted something on his social media about how he is struggling because his dad died recently, his car was totaled, our dog died, and add in the pandemic....  It was just a laundry list of shit. 

They felt that lumping the accident into that list was somehow minimizing THEIR pain. 

(As they mention other things, it becomes clear that he rubs them the wrong way, on a good day.)

My husband is, of course, upset upon hearing this. He starts to feel angry in return. 

A few weeks go by and we don't see anyone because we are socially distancing. Finally, things start to open up and I start to casually chit chat with the neighbours again, including them.

My husband wasn't ready to socialize in the 'hood, at first, although he did speak to the neighbour here and there, and even offered to help with a small shed he was building.

When my husband finally comes out to socialize, right away he brings up the touchy subject of the accident. He is a strong, opionated person who does like to air things out and needs to say his piece in order to move on. The neighbor made some harsh remarks about how he should not being up the topic of the accident and to stop ""making excuses"" for what happened. Our neighbor was  visibly irritated and shuts down the conversation very rudely. My husband storms off and later peels out of the neighbourhood in his car. Which was childish and stupid of him.

The next morning, we get a video sent to us from the neighbor off his security camera of my husband chirping his tires and an extremely long message about how he needs to behave and act. Again, we are told we haven't been contrite enough. In addition, we were also told that we are assholes for not thanking the first people who arrived on the scene of the accident and that this is a major issue in our neighborhood now, too. According to them. (I don't know them well, but have since written them a note. They did not respond).

What do I do now??? It's a new suburb and we all moved in the same time 2 years ago. We all have kids who are similar ages and play together. I can't hide from them. I don't want this to become a long lasting bitterness, and I worry they are spreading it around to other people ..... I'm at a loss and my anxiety is through the roof.

TL/DR My friend crashed my car into the neighbours house. I feel like we are both victims of this accident and it hasn't been easy for either of us.

383,"Keeping it short and brief. Hooked up with a guy about an hour ago. I told him I was very strict about using condoms and he agreed. We used one but at one point, I had a feeling he removed it. I felt his hand grab down there with a quick movement and then it just felt different inside me after that. I kept trying to feel for it around the bed, but he kept pulling my hands back up to his chest, for about 20 seconds. I made a move to roll over and I was able to grab the condom and confront him. I immediately got up and asked him to leave, and he played stupid as if I didn’t feel him remove it. I told him that wasn’t okay at all and I felt very violated. He told me “then why didn’t you just stop me after you thought I took it off then? You wanted my cum in you didn’t you?” I feel so violated. Idk what to do or to feel....",26May2020,1
384,"So yeah, I do distance education and the students who took the test earlier in the week get an extra attempt because they took the test too early. Now, me, someone who hasn’t yet taken the test (due Sunday night) doesn’t get an extra attempt.

This feels wrong on so many levels

These people took the test early and that was there decision, if they failed the test they shouldn’t get an extra attempt, they should have studied more. 

If the teacher didn’t want us taking the test until the end of the week he shouldn’t have released it until the end of the week

If these other people get an extra attempt why don’t i? I shouldn’t suffer because I didn’t take it early. I will study the heck out of the test and may get 95% plus like last term, but that 95 could be a 100 if I had a second attempt

What do I do? I emailed the teacher saying that if they are receiving an extra attempt if everyone else will as well, I also asked if the teacher will be changing the questions for these students second attempts to make it fair and just politely asked how he will ensure the fairness for all students.",26May2020,1
385,"I (19 M) am/was a college student at a community college in my town and when the pandemic struck the whole school shut down (as it should have). But with that shut down I also lost my job at the school theater. Since I was living with my parents I was in the okay zone but I lost a vital source of money, I tried to fill out for unemployment but my job cold heartedly told me it wasn't actually a job and that I was just a temp so I couldn't quit/get fired to file for unemployment. And since I was claimed as a dependent I didn't get a stim check either. I was saving to pay for college and to eventually move out of my house and it all got ruined.

For some back story: I have been wanting to move out of my house because my family has been treating me unfairly and emotionally abusively. My father and I never worked well together and a couple years back he physically assaulted me ruining anything left in our relationship. We had a bunch of family counseling things that we went through but he showed no interest in changing and it was clear nothing would work out. 

Fast forward to now: it's awful, I'm constantly bullied and being home with him working from home everyday (due to the pandemic) has been destroying me emotionally because of his harassment. So I have been trying to get out (in a financially stable way) of course I lost my job and I got a new one a couple weeks ago. My family heard that I got a new job and decided to kick me out of the house (because I could endanger them with the virus) so now my efforts to move out of the house financially safe are out of the window. I ended up rushing getting a place with a couple of friends and I only have $500 in my bank account. The job I was able to get is a part time job and I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to go back to college or even pay for rent. I really don't know what to do. I'm sad, abused, broke, and everything just keeps getting worse in my life at the moment. My family has not been the best and they have taught me close to nothing, all I have is what I know about the world and my own street smarts but I'm not really sure what to do now, and I want to try my best not to go into debt and crawl into a deeper rabbit hole. 

Is there anything I can do to better my situation? 

Thank you.",26May2020,1

391,"i am a male and 17 in highschool. a few days ago when i was driving back from a friends’ house at like 11:30, which is past my curfew i was thinking a lot about my childhood and what i can and can’t remember. i’m known to have a horrible memory and i honestly dont remember much from when i was a kid. the things that i do remember are extremely vivid, most of them at least, and i honestly couldve just dreamt them? but i’m not so sure. here are some of those vivid memories: 
1) my dad slapping me and my older brother’s legs when we sat in the backseat of our truck whenever he got mad at us. he doesnt do that anymore but i can still remember it
2) either my mom or dad, i can’t remember who, telling me 1 on 1 that they might split up, as in divorce i think, idk i was very young so that’s what i remember. they never did though
3) my mom and dad screaming at my older brother lots of times, i remember the worst was when i was in 5th grade and he was in 8th, he got suspended and my parents were mad for weeks, it felt like it at least.

that is all i can think of. some more background info for those of you who read all of this: i used to be the crazy kid in elementary school, big troublemaker and such, then in middle school i was pretty much the same but a bit less of a trouble maker because my dad is a teacher at this middle school. i wasn’t as crazy but i was still more social than i am now. now i am in highschool, i was deeply depressed last year although it has gotten a lot better. i am pretty popular, a lot of people know me and we’re cool and all. but i cant talk to anyone, ive lost a lot of friends over the past years and it’s not because they did anything bad or i did, i just suck at friendships i think. i have a girlfriend of 2 years and she’s great, although the beginning of our relationship was pretty bad. i have a lot of trust issues and i dont open up to people. i’m not looking to open up to anyone or go to a doctor either, cuz when i DID open up to someone about how i used to be depressed it just didnt feel like they cared too much lol. i could just be overthinking it but that’s also another problem i have. thanks for reading and sorry if this is confusing :)",26May2020,1

You don’t have to read the next part, but:

I have self esteem problems. I kind of hate myself. So much so that when people tell me otherwise or even show interest in me I still can’t believe them. For instance, I asked a girl out once in middle school. I liked her a lot. I wrote the question on paper and gave it to her. She was so happy and screamed yes.

I’ve only know. This girl since Halloween last year and I could tell right away that she really did not like me. I don’t know why so don’t ask. She also happens to work at the only game store in town and being a nerd and married to one we go there a few times a week. At first if I saw her out at the pub I would be polite and try and talk to her but after her being very short with me I just settled for a wave when I saw her. Same as if I’m in the game store. I would try and talk to her but she would make it obvious she didn’t want to. Whatever that’s cool not everyone has to like me or be my friend. That’s not the problem. The problem is she is going around telling people I asked her and her partner for a threesome. Once while drunk at the bar, and again while she was at work serving customers. Both of these are completely false. First off, she’s not even my type and neither is her bf. Secondly, I’m married. Thirdly, i have severe anxiety to the point I can’t even order my own food. How the fuck am I supposed to ask this girl who clearly doesn’t like me for a threesome at her work while other people are there. Fourthly, pretty sure if that did happen I would have been banned from the store cause it’s sexual harassment. 

I don’t know what to do about it reddit. We don’t live in a very big town and people love to gossip. Obviously my husband knows it’s false. But it’s honestly making me severely upset.

I've been in a wonderful relationship with my wonderful boyfriend for 6 years now. But my ex is still in our lives because of my family that is so close and always have gathering.. I blocked him for like 5 years and then unblocked him because I just saw him too many times at gatherings and didn't want to hold tension anymore I just wanted to get past it.. To a point where if we see him we can greet him as per normal and move on..

I honestly thought we're over everything. I never message him or anything. But every once in a while he whatsapps me an old song we listened to as teens. I don't know what's up with him. I always had a soft spot for him but I'll never leave my bf for him. He doesn't come close to the personality that my bf has and the way he cares for me.

How do I not let these bother me? When he sends me songs I usually just respond a thumbs up and a music emoji... I never ask how hes doing or anything cause I don't want contact to get any further...

I know for sure I can't block him out my life.. I've tried that but due to family gatherings it's just best to not have awkward tension and speak like adults... One time he tried to talk to me at a gathering and said Im not as happy as I think I am, I'm just settling with someone cause I know they won't hurt me..

398,"Alright so this requires a lot of back story. I work for a major grocery store chain. One of the assistant managers is absolutely awful...she has been moved around a lot because she has slept with multiple employees...anyway she was transferred to my store a little over a year ago. Once she was transferred, she started hooking up with the grocery manager and that resulted in him breaking up with his long term Gf (who he has two children with) to be with her. Things didn’t work out so they have since broken up. (The Gf who he cheated on also works at the same store) 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. My fiancé had symptoms of COVID-19.(we live together) His work required him to get tested so he did. My work gave me the option to self quarantine until he got his results back. I decided to self quarantine because I felt that was the best decision. A few days later I was sick with whatever sickness he got so I figured it was best to call in. (He was negative, but I still had a cough, fever, and shortness of breath) When I texted my manager telling her my symptoms her exact words were “well we need you here so you need to take some medicine, wear a mask, and just wash your hands.” I told her no and sent her screenshots from our company website that said “anyone who has symptoms needs to stay home.” She replied that it didn’t matter and I would be reprimanded for my “ excessive absences.” I was extremely upset because I didn’t want to lose my job. I decided to take the time off anyway because I had to do what’s best for me. 

I tested negative but had time off anyway (I was supposed to get married) so I kept my time off. Since I’ve been back to work she has constantly kept her eye on me. She tried to get my supervisors to write me up for taking time off. I know she wants me fired. I just don’t know what to do. I make really good money which is why I don’t want to just quit. She treats everyone like shit. People (including myself) have complained to corporate but nothing seems to happen to her. I could go on and on about the horrible things she has done to other employees but nothing seems to matter to upper management as she still has a high position in the company.

The thought of another person kissing her makes me want to melt into the floor and disappear. I miss her so much it feels like something is shattered in my head. I’ve tried talking about it with therapy. I feel lost. I don’t know how to describe how happy she made me, and I ruined things. I feel sick. I wake up in the morning and I hate to look at myself in the mirror. I spend most of my days feeling mostly horrible. I don’t know if medication can help at this point because I have tried several over the past two years. I don’t know where to go now. I feel like I have screwed up my life. I felt so safe and happy with her and in a few hours it all collapsed and I am still hating myself years later.

Things I have tried:
1.) medication, three months between alternative medications.
2.) mindfulness, 15 minutes, daily, for three months 
3.) gratitude journaling, three times a week, two months
4.) exercise, evenings, two months

The story goes like this i live with my wife and my 5 year old child in an building that is owned by my parents in the building there are 2 appartements. Me and my family live in upper one and my parents live under us. When my wife gave birth to our  son she had a very difficult labour. After that she was ill for a long time so me and my parents took care of the kid. After a while she got better and than she had a depression that lasted for 4 years in that 4 years she would spend maybe 10 min a day whith our child she said she couldn't explain it but she was depressed and couldn't be around the kid. When our child was 2 years old we found out he has autism and it was hard for all of us but we tried to manage it. I got alot of help from my parents. Now our child is 5 because my wife didn't spend alot of time with him he considers my mother as his mother. Because of the autism our kid would wake up 8 times at night and i would have to help him get back to sleep after doing this for 3 years and than going to work after that was exausting. So my mother took him every night because she doesn't work. Now 5 years later my wifes depression is gone (i think thats what she tells me) now all of the sudden she had a big fight with my mother and wants to go buy an appartment but she doesn't see how damaging it would be for our child because he has his own rituals and his known surroundings that would be gone and how financially difficult it will be. She threatens to divorce me if i don't go buy a new appartment and move there with her. If our child didn't had autism i would probably divorce her but im afraid it will give him big trauma but i don't want to get into a huge debt just to buy an appartment where we already have one for free.",26May2020,1

402,"Context: Almost a decade ago something horrible happened to me. It doesn't matter what it is but let's say it's way worse than a car crash or basic street harassment. 

I got proper help, I'm much better now. I can talk about it and my life is no longer about it. Which makes me really happy because I worked hard to be more than that one bad thing happened to me. I'm what I make of things that happen to me.

But it also really changed me. When people know what happened then it's much easier to explain why I am the way I am. It makes me make sense to share that information in most cases.

There are two scenarios when I share it:
1) People pity me, feel sorry and even start crying for me. Which is well intended but also annoying. Sometimes they start treating me much nicer and that's just degrading.
2) They don't believe me at all because I can talk about it without crying. That took a decade of therapy, dum-dum. How do you think I get help if I can't learn to talk it. Of course I can!

I (16F) watched The Ted Bundy Tapes on Netflix a few months back, and ever since then I have recently begun masturbating while fantasizing about being abducted and raped by Ted Bundy.

I also would never want to actually be kidnapped and raped. Hell, I wouldn't ever want to participate in that kind of roleplay in real life.

I come from a relatively normal family with no background of abuse, I'm also a virgin who only began masturbating like 3 years ago.

Lived with my aunt and uncle (her grandma and grandpa because she’s my cousin once removed) and her little brother until they couldn’t take her behavior anymore and sent her to live in a home for troubled girls. Then earlier this month she accused my uncle of sexually abusing her and my uncle was arrested and is now in jail with a bail at $250,000 dollars.

My aunt said that she hates him and wanted to get back at him for sending her to a home and accusing him and sending him to jail was her way of getting revenge. My mom and my sisters agree that this is the case. They don’t like my cousin either and think she’s just a problem child.

Now I was the only person in the family to be nice to her and try to understand her and subsequently I’m the only one she trusts because of that. She is a very violent girl with loads of emotional issues but I feel like at least some of those stem from how her grandpa treated her. He’s a very strict man who could barely tolerate her. Every time I visited their house he would get mad at her for something. One time she got her period and instead of helping and understanding what she’s going through, my aunt and my mother shamed and punished her for getting blood on the bathroom floor and on the toilet. I think it was just an honest mistake because she wasn’t used to periods yet (she was like twelve when it happened)

She always talked to me about how unfair she’s being treated compared to her brother. She became very violent towards him though and would hit him whenever they had arguments.

Her father is a deadbeat on his fourth DUI and her mother ran away to Mexico. When she stayed with her father she became very clingy and would not stop calling his phone and interrupting his job. 

She had an Instagram for a while but she’d often post rude or obscene images. When I confronted her about this she said she was just being “edgy.”

So I thought things would finally improve for her when she was sent to a residential facility for troubled girls where she could get the help she needed but now that she accused my uncle of sexual abuse I don’t know what to think. 

I don’t know what to believe, on one hand, she really hates her grandpa and it isn’t out of character for her to do this kind of thing, but on the other, it would explain why she hates her grandpa so much and why she has so much hate and anger inside of her. Idk man. Shits fucked. She never told me about this ever happening, neither did her brother. She trusts me and I repeatedly told her she can tell me anything but this is the first time I’m hearing this. I never knew my uncle to sexually abuse kids. He’s always just been overly strict to me. It just gives me so many mixed feelings. We’re there signs I was ignoring? Fuck.",26May2020,1
410,"This might sound like a stupid question but do you have to try to be good looking? Most of my life people have said I’m good looking, attractive an stuff like that. I then stopped trying with my appearance and kind of let myself go a little. Over 2 years ago I started taking proper care of myself, regular haircuts regular exercise, good nutrition. I’d say I do majority of things right now. I feel like I’m trying to hard to be considered good looking though and I feel like it isn’t me. I love eating clean and exercising but the other shit like the regular haircuts and using hair products. It just feels like I’m doing to much to be attractive if I was already naturally attractive.

I have lately been getting more and more into the darker side of thrill because I find provocative things very appealing.

413,"As a last resort, and being a believer that many minds are better than one, let me present my problem to Reddit. 

This is very real and upsetting to me.  

My brother died in prison on 1/21/19 (a Monday, MLK day). I saw him the 19th, my Dad, who lives with me, saw him the 20th. 

He was mentally ill, schizophrenic and was classified/treated as a mentally ill prisoner, which means he was in a special program. He mainly was paranoid over hearing voices in his head. 

So without having to explain too much, and I will answer any questions if you ask, let me sum up where we are. 

He died of a drug overdose, meth. He had 2 bindles of it in his stomach. He was found in his cell, a single cell. The prison and their employees, that did not do their jobs and allowed my best friend and brother to die on their watch BLAME ME for bringing in the drugs. 

I did not. I would never. I haven’t even seen meth in my life. Or hard drugs. (I do like THC capsules though.) 

I have many reasons to believe he was purposely murdered and other nasty things, but that too is not why I’m here. 

I’m here because I did some Nancy Drewing and did find out how he got them and who brought them in.

So, advice is needed on what can I do now. 
I can’t contact the prison because I don’t feel safe. 
I have sent messages to the FBI and the Inspector General. No response or contact back. 
Tried local police. No jurisdiction and nothing they can do. 


So, what do I do?",26May2020,1

Been almost 2 years now and I’ve realized how much I’ve changed as a person. The mistakes I made then would never happen again as I’m older.

I’m stuck in Europe (sweden) because of this damn virus doing my masters degree. The weather is so nice and I see people out and about everywhere. The thing is, all my friends flew to their respective countries earlier on and I’ve been stuck alone for some time now.

418,"We're 19 and have been together a year and a half. We are best friends and we rarely fight. It's a near perfect relationship. When he was 13, my boyfriend went to a sleepover with several boys in his grade. He learned about dry humping and they all tried it out. Shortly after this sleepover, he recalls tickle fighting his brother who is 5 years younger and then humping him. He said he recalls feeling it was wrong on some level at the time and he thinks he either did it once more soon after and can't remember or he did not do it again. I feel like he couldn't have been all that clueless though, as he started watching porn at 12. He said if the brother had been uncomfortable at all he would have stopped, it was seems it was a once off, it lasted a minute or so and he never touched him during it. 

 He apologised to his brother and his parents recently. The brother can't remember and said it was ok. They are close and their relationship hasn't changed since he apologised. They play video games together and always tease each other, he is not remotely scared of my bf and bosses him around a lot. My boyfriend seems really horrified by this event, he cried telling me this and said he felt he had to tell me in case I wouldn't wanna be with someone that did this. This is totally at odds with the guy he is now, who asked for permission to kiss me when we first started dating and continuously asked me if I was ok during our first few times having sex and whenever we do anything new. I'm scared to think this makes him a molester? I'm not sure if I should stay with him because of this event. I feel sick and shocked thinking about it a week later.",26May2020,1

420,"Hey folks. Looking for help or advice from anyone who has written journal articles. 

My gf is currently doing her PhD. She's doing it in Chinese language and she is a Thai native speaker so it's tough as it is.

Her supervisor has sorta changed her topic and she now has to write a thesis on what I feel is an absolutely horrendous topic.

It's ""roughly translated"" a study of Chinese dictionaries for foreigners learning Chinese and researching  grammatical information contained within the dictionary 

When we asked the supervisor (useless btw) they said its analysing grammatical errors and mistakes found within dictionaries for foreign studies students. 

Now if anyone out there has experience writing journal articles I would love a bit of help here:

- how would I analyse something like this? I would have assumed that dictionaries don't really contain any major errors.

- what's the purpose of this research? Could anyone suggest a purpose? How would it improve our knowledge in the field?

- how would you even research this? ""page 234 has a mistake...."" and then want? Is there a way to make some valid quantitative research? 

- has anyone heard of a study of dictionaries like this? I had a quick Google but couldn't find any articles. If you could link a few I would greatly appreciate it. We can't find anything in Chinese or Thai. I could read an English version and explain to my gf at least what she should be looking for? 



Thank you in advance for any advice anyone could offer. 

Note: from my western experience research is something you decide and do on your own. But apparently in China its very common for your supervisor to just sort off assign you research....she can't change the topic",26May2020,1
421,"I'm sorry if this doesn't belong here. I'm desperate and tired and I just want to sleep normally. 

Ever since I moved back home from college 2 months ago (COVID-19), I began to have recurring nightmares. They are always the same, with my dad physically abusing or killing my mom and me trying to save her. On multiple occasions I can hear things even when I wake up for a short period of time (like sleep paralysis). It's stress-inducing and hard to fall back asleep after these nightmares. I had maybe 5 of these dreams in the past month that I can explicitly remember that followed the entire format and many other dreams that are just fragments with this theme. 

For context, my dad has almost never hurt me. But sometimes when he gets drunk, he tends to verbally harass my mom about his irrational fears or pet peeves. Last summer, my mom confessed to me that, while I was gone, my dad threw her phone over the fence and strangled her for no reason. I've seen my dad hurt my mom in person, but never to that extent. 

This seems like why I'm having these nightmares. I feel guilty that I left my mom in pain, on multiple occasions, but I rationally know that even if I was involved, it would only escalate things. She insists that he's the best man ever, he treats her with gifts, etc, but she fails to acknowledge how bad it gets. I'm also beginning to suspect that this abuse has gone on for longer than she's admitting. 

And I'm not sure why the nightmares started just now. I guess moving back home also brought up a lot of family issues that I suddenly had to deal with again. When I was in college, I rarely talked to my family. I came home on the weekends but didn't really interact with my family. 

I looked into it and people with C-PTSD seem to have very similar experiences with recurring nightmares. But it's different because I'm not a victim in these scenarios, it's more like I'm an outsider looking in. 

I know the nightmares are realistically the least important problem here. My family has a lot of unresolved issues. But I just want to stop waking up in cold sweats in the middle of the night. It's hard to fall asleep after these dreams because they feel so real and leave me ruminating in my waking state. 

TL;DR: I've only had 1 or 2 hours of sleep because I woke up from a nightmare about my dad hurting my mom. This happens more often than I would like.",26May2020,1
422,"I opened my boyfriend phone to watch a video and it was opened to a message between him and two of his classmates. They were talking about people. Of wearing masks. So, for reference these are people from rural Louisiana. My boyfriend and I are from the city. One of them replies “it’s probably Cajun Coonass Trump Supporters.” I am Cajun. Not thy party affiliation matters, but this isn’t true for anyone in my family. I feel very hurt by this comment. (For anyone who does not know, Cajuns are French settlers of Louisiana who left France for religious freedom). Without going into detail, I am very proud of my culture and our history.

Some facts: 
1) This woman is also white. 
2) My boyfriend is non white. 

I asked him why he let her say that about Cajuns and he dismissed it. “What? You want me to get in a fight over it?” I then stormed out and he hasn’t come to make sure I am okay or check up on me. This is unusual for him. 

I don’t necessarily like this girl, either. I understand that she and another girl have grown close, which is not something anyone should generally be concerned over in a healthy relationship, but something has felt of regarding her. Likewise, she dated another guy in the program and very coldly broke up with him in a kind of humiliating way considering everyone studied as a group. He suddenly became excluded. I genuinely liked this guy and it rubbed me the wrong way that she did that, and my boyfriend and the other friend would laugh as she said she just wanted penis, basically. I just don’t understand. This guy was super nice and my boyfriend is also friend’s with him. None of this was a huge issue. Just kind made me raise an eyebrow. I didn’t like her, but if he did. Whatever. But this comment about Cajuns and him not only not saying “hey, that’s not cool” but also dismissed me when I saw it. I don’t know what to do. 

TLDR: boyfriend let his friend say a disparaging comment about my culture. I already didn’t have good vibes about this friend. He did not defend me. Smh.",26May2020,1

I started working out and took a lot of effort to improve my appearance.I'm a junior in college now. I'm by no means really handsome but for the past couple of years my looks have improved immensely after gaining weight and taking better care of my self.

My confidence has definitely improved. I gathered the courage to ask one of the hottest girl in college out on a date. And somehow it worked. We've been together for a couple of months now and things are going great. I've never been happier in my life.

A few days ago my GF posted a picture on Instagram and as usual people were complementing her. I recognized one of guys who commented. He used to go to my high school lets call him ""David"". I've talked to him before(when I was in school) and we've been in good terms but I always felt that he looked down on me like most people did back in high school.

I'm not proud of the man I was and wan't to get over it but I'm still not at a point where I can put everything behind me, I'm still insecure. My GF is really beautiful she's so confident and has always been popular. Guys used to talk about her all the time (like it's high school) and a lot of guys were interested in her. Needless to say despite being way more confident than before I still feel like she is out of my league.

I don't talk about my miserable high school life with my GF. I will open up eventually but definitely not now. I always behave in a cool and confident manner when I'm around my girlfriend. She finds me attractive and reliable. That's kind of man I want to be for the rest of my life.

Now I think ""David"" is in the same department as my GF but a year lower so they are in talking terms. Cause of this I've been anxious and insecure for the past few days. I've seen a lot of guys talk trash about someone when they get a hot GF. I just don't wan't David to tell her that I'm a wimp and I used to be a loser in high school. I don't want him to talk trash behind my back .Maybe I'm just being paranoid as the roots of my insecurities are quiet deep.

If in case it does happens I won't know how to react and I don't know how my GF will react. She'll probably be supportive but it's a really sensitive subject for me. As I said before I will eventually open up, but I wan't it to be on my terms. I don't want her to hear about it from someone else especially if they intend to talk me down out of jealousy.

Over the next month shes noticed shes being treated differently, people seemed to treat her worse. Every kne seemed to stick their nose up at her.

Last week she typed up an email explaining what leave she would like to take once the baby arrives. She explained clearly she has no intention on leaving and only taking a small hiatus.

Just a bit of background - my partner and I are both 25, we’ve been together for 9 years almost since we were 17.  We’ve been having issues for the last few weeks which has lead us to go on a break - which ends this week.  (Well, the issues have been going on longer but we’ve acknowledged them in last 3 weeks).  I’m convinced we’re not going to make it through.

I’m terrified of what life means without them, as she’s been my only meaningful or long-term relationship ever...I’ve never gone through a real, tear-jerking break up.  (I should also make clear, I want to stay together for lots of other reasons but fear of losing her generally.)

Also, around 6/7 years ago I was diagnosed with an Anxiety Disorder, which I’ve 99% got under control these days but, my partner had and still has huge influence over me being ‘okay’.  I’m worried that such a big change will make my anxiety awful, and it’s not that I’m scared about committing suicide or anything like that - I’m just scared of being alone with my thoughts for prolonged periods.  And I know you should spend time with friends, family etc. - but under lockdown, it’s not easy to have contact with all those people a lot.  Also - having spent the last 2 weeks at a parents house, I know I wouldn’t cope well living with family 24/7.

What do I do to cope?",26May2020,1
444,"I'm attending college this fall, and I met this dude on a group chat for mingling. He has an art account and as soon as it started, I was getting weird vibes. He has 6 posts as of now, and one is blatantly stolen (he claimed it was his own), one is obviously traced, and another is likely traced, but its a simplistic design, so im not sure.

I was able to reverse image search all 3 of the previously mentioned posts, but I'm not having the same luck with the others. 

His first 3 posts all have the same signature, so if they're not his, I should be able to find the artist and have more proof that he's stealing. 

Would anyone know how to image search on Instagram? I read that they changed their API, which makes it harder for third-party services to view photos, collect data, etc. Ive used Google lens and tineye, but they don't have anything for these 3 pics.

453,"TLDR at the bottom.

So I used to have real bad depression but I've gotten better at dealing with it and now instead of getting really emotional occasionally all my emotions just shut down and I feel really shitty.

Before corona these feelings only came up every couple months, now this is the second or third time since quarantine started that I've been dealing with it.

It really sucks cause in the beginning of quarantine I was working on myself a lot, I took this whole thing as a mental health break and it was going great, now I'm falling back into old habits though and I don't know how to climb out.

I've stopped playing violin, I've stopped drawing, video games are less and less fun by the day, my friends are a good source of comfort and they're honestly the only thing that really makes me happy, I took a shower about 2 days ago (maybe 3) but before that I couldn't remember the last time I showered, I haven't walked my dog in weeks, I'm still cooking but I'm worried that's gonna be next to go, I'm sleeping till 5pm and I'm writing this at 5:45 am. 

Most people, including my therapist say that I just need to build habits and push myself to do things but I just can't. It's not that I don't want to I literally can't and I don't know why. It's fucking terrible, it's like all my passions are dieing and I can't even get mad or really upset about it cause that would be emotional so all my issues and problems are stuck in my mind. 

I live with my grandma and mom and sometimes they'll say things like, ""I wish you would play violin again,"" or something like that, and it's like getting stabbed in the heart. God I wish it was that easy, I wish I could play again too. I just can't. 

I mentioned my friends before, but I know if I came to them with this most would just tell me what everyone else has, you just gotta push yourself, get better, etc. Then I would get mad and try and tell them I can't but that would push them away. 

I'm scared. Scared for my future, scared for what the people I care about will think of me. I joined a culinary vocational in my senior year of high school cause people would say things like oh you'll never go hungry, people always need to eat, then I start getting jobs and I realise this industry sucks, wtf happened to me, why did I settle for this? I wanted to be a writer, writing still helps me think through things, so sorry if this is turning into a rant. 

I think my last hope is going to be getting my driver's license. I keep telling myself if I can just get the card I'll go to the gym, I'll start my own business cause I hate having a boss, I'll get a girlfriend, I'll travel the country, I just need to get the license. But who knows maybe that's just my brain tricking me just to keep me going.

My fingers are cramping so I'll stop soon, but yea basically **TLDR, I want to do things but depression won't let me and I don't know how to break the cycle.** 

Maybe it just comes in waves, but if that's the case I wonder if this is the low point or if I'm still going.",26May2020,1
454,"I’m a 22f and My long term partners parents own a couple of large houses that there children live in. Last year we moved back into his childhood home as it was the closest to a new job opportunity. However his sister who is the same age as me ( who I have a great friendship with) already permanently lived there by herself and her animals. As she’s in uni she doesn’t pay any rent etc. Me and my partner have both been working full time since we were 16, so naturally we pay full rent. Everything was going smoothly for the first couple of months but recently she’s stopped cleaning up after herself. She won’t do her own dishes, won’t touch a hoover or a mop etc. She has also stopped looking after her large animal collection leaving them as my responsibility. She won’t clean up her dogs mess in the garden and is never up early enough to feed them their breakfast or walk them. I am a massive animal lover so would never not look after the animals but the more I do the more she doesn’t.

Like I said we have a lovely friendship and we spend most of our time hanging out, but any time I try bring up cleaning or giving me a hand around the house, she gives me the silent treatment for a couple of days.  I feel like she does this out of embarrassment rather than anger at me, but she gets on the defensive as soon as I say anything. She will just sit there chatting to me whilst I clean up her mess in front of her and never offers to give a hand. My partner tried to have a chat with her but as siblings they just get into a massive argument.

She has never worked, and has lived a very sheltered life as the youngest of the siblings. She is a lovely caring girl normally but I think she just doesn’t realise the amount of pressure I feel working full time and coming home and having to clean up after someone else. I feel like I’m the mother of the house nagging all the time which puts a strain on our friendship.  Any advice on how to get her to clean up without causing arguments?",26May2020,1
455,"I apologize before hand for the format and grammar.  I also apologize if this sounds pretentious of me to think I can help my friend, but after she told me, I can’t thinking about what I could’ve said to help her be more at ease. 

I won’t go into too much of the details behind the story, but it happened a couple years ago. When she was just 13. It happened and she never told anyone due to the shame she felt. She continued to do what she did everyday in hopes that if these terrible people were to want to rape someone again, she would get raped again and not another girl. It was her way to combat against them I suppose. She repeatedly asked if I thought she should have told someone, it was obviously weighing heavily on her to this day and feels guilty about not telling someone. She says she still thinks about it every day, and that she can never have someone walk behind her anymore. 

I told her that I think she did what she could and it was really brave of her to keep going back to where it could have happened again. 
Note: she does not anymore since moving. 

I know I’m not a therapist, I don’t have years experience in dealing with people going through tough times. But it broke my heart that this girl had gone through this and I couldn’t do more to help.

I can’t exactly tell this person to go see a therapist for a number of reasons. But I need to know if there was something else I could’ve said or done. Or is it the kind of thing, I just have to listen to and just be there to support them?

 There are times that I would like to have a private conversation with my pediatrician does not get the hint at all and I don’t know what to do.

I proceeded to face away from my mom and whisper /give her a look to confirm that I was sexually active and she did give me an STD test after making me feel mocked and ashamed.

So basically when my uncle moved in with us it was fine and he was super friendly (i didn't really know him much before and i only met him like 3 times) and he was super cool, he would play videogames with me and my sister a lot and it was going well, however a few weeks ago we were watching movies and playing videogames at night and it was fun, my sister was bored and went to her room and my parents weren't around at the time. my uncle then started saying oddly sexual things to me and would make lots of weird jokes but i laughed it off. anyways this kept on happening and my uncle always made sure i had some alone time with him atleast once a day. one day my uncle started touching me and i felt super embarrassed and didn't know what to say. i remember one time i politely asked him to ""stop"" and he said something like ""oh stop what"" and would be like ""im just tickling you"" or something of that sort. he keeps on doing this and one day i even caught him looking through my room and clothes and i asked him what he was doing and he just said something along the lines of ""making sure i was being good"" and i'm so confused. my sister and parents seem fine around him and i dont know what to do. i tried bringing it up to my mum few days ago and i asked her when he was leaving and she asked if i didn't like him. i just ended up saying no and she brushed it off. i don't know what to do and he does this everyday. i'm scared to tell my parents because they're also kinda religious and really like my uncle.

So this all started last month early in the morning (like 4 or 5AM) when I came in contact with my first cigarette. My uncle is over at our house and he smokes, so I found his cigarette box and snuck one out. I went out through the back porch and lit it up. I take like 2 hits before I decide that it’s pretty disgusting and ya, my parents obviously found the rest of unsmoked cigarette in the yard. You see, I woke up the next day at around 12 and I enter the room my dads sitting in. I tell him good morning and he says it back, we’re both sitting there for like a second until he strikes up a question. “Have you ever smoked a cigarette?” I was reluctant to answer and got chills down my spine. I come clean immediately in order to not make it worse than it already was. He says to not do it again and was pretty chill about it surprisingly, and it all ended there.

Fast forward to now and it’s been about 45 minutes since this all happened. Let me start from last night since it’s like 6AM. Recently I’ve had an itching to try it again and decided to stay up all night so I could be up early (I usually wake up super late and this was the only way) to sneak out another cigarette. I go to the closet where he keeps it and there’s like 5 left in the box, I take one out and grab a lighter and this time I went to same back door porch. I light it up and have almost the same experience as last time, light it up, take a few hits, don’t like it anymore, throw it out. But this time I threw it under the deck which would be very difficult to see unless you were trying to look for it. I come back inside and as I’m closing the door behind me, my mom comes down the stairs and asks what I was doing outside. I stand there frozen and she comes over to me and and smells the cigarette all over me. I repeatedly say sorry over and over while she’s smacking me backside of the head. She tells me to go wash up and come back to her and the whole time I’m just going “Please don’t tell dad, please don’t tell dad!” She just walks off and doesn’t answer. I go upstairs to my bathroom and use some mouthwash, brush my teeth, and wash my face. She knocks on the door and I open it, she tells me to meet her in the other room after I finish. I’m absolutely shitting my pants at this point. But, she tells me to get the holy book and swear on it in front of her that I will never smoke another cigarette again. I do it because I really don’t after what just happened and because it’s just terrible for your health. Anyways she tells me to pray for myself so that god can forgive me and then go to sleep, I did what she asked but instead of sleeping I’m typing this out right now.

So what can I do to better this situation. I just need some advice on what I can do at this point because I’m absolutely scared to death. Thanks for any advice that you guys are willing to give!",26May2020,1

He's on it while we make dinner, play video games, when I try to have important conversations about our relationship, etc. I was happy that SO, who normally has extreme social anxiety and therefore has no irl friends. I have been having to ask him a lot lately to put the phone down because its led to me having to repeat myself over and over again, him misunderstanding instructions, and even forgetting to turn the gas oven off 3 different times.

Today I noticed after he fell asleep that his phone had the red low battery light on it. I went to plug it in and the screen lit up showing a not so PG friendly comment. I'll admit my curiosity got the better of me and that I invaded his personal space when I probably shouldn't have, which led to a two hour long deep dive into his convo histories.

In these conversations, which have been going on since the beginning of the year, my SO is pretending to be a girl and is sending nudes to other people and having intimate conversations with them saying he loves them. He is not just sending any nudes though, he is sending photos of his ex, and his profile pic is of his ex too! 

He tells the people on discord that his background is the exact same background as his ex, down to the profession, childhood upbringing, ancestry, and even mental health diagnoses.

We played, cuddled and I have him some left over canned dog food as a little treat for him. Later though, my friend came over and suddenly he got very defensive. I pet him through the fence (so he couldn't directly get to us) and suddenly he bit me in my hand. It's pretty deep and I almost passed out after it happened but thats mostly because of the shock that my own dog bit me... Later that night my grandma said he got out twice, probably looking for Daisy, so my dad and I went over there to fix the fence (which he absolutely tore apart) and when we got there he looked like he knew what he did. He started sniffing my hand and he was just back to ""normal"", though he isn't the playful little guy he used to be. 

So I guess my question is, how do I make him feel better? It's currently 12:30pm and I'm about to go over there to cuddle and play with him but what can I do for whenever I'm not there? I read that aggression is normal whenever a dog goes through the grieving process, but is there any way I can make this process more bearable for him?

Thanks so much in advance and if I should provide more information about him or whatever, just let me know. I usually don't post stuff like this so my apologies if I did something wrong, lol.",26May2020,1

He has been working from home because of the pandemic and I can't work, because I have a high risk pregnancy. He used to take his job seriously at the beginning, but then he started loafing around. For example, he would work in the morning and then work on his motorcycle in the afternoon. He still stamped his time as 8 hours though. He said as long as he is logged into the system, that's no problem. I told him MANY times not to do this and that maybe they do have a way of knowing. 

Today he had a staff meeting and they told him they know about what he'd done, that that's fraud/deception and that they will have a talk on thursday about it. He says he might get fired, but honestly, what else can we expect from this meeting on thursday? How should he prepare? He knows some nasty company secrets, such as a fellow worker stealing money and the company not doing anything about it and other scams that they turned a blind eye on. Should things go south, should he mention them? 

In short, how should he proceed?

tl;dr: my husband has falsified the time he worked daily. They found out and now want to have a ""talk"" on thursday. What should he expect? How should he proceed?",26May2020,1

483,"I hope this is allowed here, I want your thoughts on an experience I had.

On October 6th 2018 I got married to my beautiful wife, we had a wonderful day and everything went perfectly. We paid for a videographer and photographers to capture our day and the photographers were awesome! They did a great job, acted professionally and gave us the edited photos about 10 days after the wedding.

The experience we had with the videographer was different though, on the day everything went fine but after that it was a long process to get the wedding video.

My wife and I paid a $200 deposit and we would pay a further $850 on completion this was for 8 hours on the day and for 6 hours of editing. 

The first problem we had with the videographer was the time it took him to complete it. We would ask how he had been going with it and we would get every excuse, at first there was family problems (fair enough) then he was working on other projects, then he didn’t have time, etc..

Jump forward to May 24th 2020  after asking for our video, we get it.

It’s not very good. It’s shakey, the music cuts in and out, the main problems I have with the video are that the Audio had stopped recording during singing at the ceremony and speeches at the reception.

Everyone had to re-record their speeches and then the videographer added them to the the video, but left out my speech completely (I was the groom) I didn’t know that that mine hadn’t been recorded so I didn’t think there was a problem. 

Anyway, with the year and a half turn around, audio issues and leaving out the groom’s speech, should I complain and ask to pay less or should I just happily pay. I’m not a videographer and I don’t know.",26May2020,1

I’m in graduate school, but have delayed my graduation for a while now [im in Europe], because my mother was diagnosed with cancer last year. 

I took the year off to help and deal with it and figure out what I want to do. 

At the end of the year I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder which leads to permanent hair loss, which really didn’t help with my self esteem.

And a lot of jobs aren’t hiring right now, so I’m also currently stuck in my job, which doesn’t give me much leeway in the sense of savings, doing more than just living.

485,"I'm a 20 year old college student, majoring in pharmacy. I've never had to earn my money before and I want the experience. I feel bad using my parents' money all the time (My dad's retired and my mom is an RN) so I decided to apply for summer jobs. The first job to respond to me was my local dollar tree. I was excited. For the first time, I felt like an adult. I told my parents about it and I was met with disbelief, mostly from my mom. She questioned why I would want to work there because it's not a ""suitable"" job and people would ""raise their eyebrows if they saw I worked at a dollar tree."" (I really didn't think people would care?????) I explained to her that I wanted to know what it was like to earn my own money and it was just a start to my working experience. She then said I didn't need a job and that I should just volunteer in a hospital. I volunteered in a hospital last summer so I didn't see why it was such a problem that I wanted to earn money this summer. Also, I can always volunteer during the school year.

Instead of being excited for my first job, I felt stupid for even applying. I know I'm still young, but I feel like I never get treated like an adult. Any decisions I make are met with disbelief and questioning from my mom, which only makes me feel more unconfident in myself. The only time I feel secure with myself is when I show her my grades. But that's all I'm good at: getting good grades. I have no outside world experience and I feel like I'm seen as nothing more than a grade. There's only so much a grade can get you.

So after a long argument, I now have to call dollar tree back and tell them I can't work there because my mom said I couldn't. 

I don't understand why my mom is all about titles. Why does the title of the job matter so much? I'm just a college student trying to earn some of my own money so I don't have to rely on my parents. Idk maybe this post is dumb. I'm sorry if I sound bratty, but I'm just genuinely confused on why my mom doesn't want me to work in the dollar tree.",26May2020,1

He followed it up with ""You can set your PC up next to mine and Youll have a master bedroom with your own bathroom I just need you to help me out for 4 months until I find a fulltime roomate, you just have to pay 500 dollars a month. While he pays the other 75% I was going to move out soon and it will cost me upwards of 2,000 and I have 7,000 in savings and I think it would be cool living on my own all summer with no chores, and really get the experience before I do it on my own?

This is about a conflict between two close (married) friends of mine right now. 
Basically the wife recently found out her husband, had an OF account. I don’t know if I’m allowed to actually say the name of the actual website.  But I feel like everyone knows what the abbreviation stands for.  If you don’t know what it is. Basic gist People either invite you to pay for their home made sexual videos  or you actively look up them on the site. Pick who you want to spend your money on and watch. 

So wife found out because her husband left his phone connected in the car. And the car tells you what you’re watching / listening too. She saw it and instantly shut down. 

They finally ended up talking about it. At first husband thought wife just didn’t like him watching porn. She explained that wasn’t the case at all. And that her issue was him actively not only searching for his ideal woman he’s sexually attracted too. But giving her/ them his money. knowing ever since she got pregnant, she’s been horribly self conscious about her body, and recently finally was able to show off her pregnancy with somewhat pride. (She use to wear big bulky clothing for months trying to hide herself) she explained and ended up crying that she feels even more  repulsed with herself, and not at all attractive to him. Her husband now notices that she’s gone back to wearing bulky clothes. And won’t even let him touch her stomach, butt, or chest. And feels like a complete AH. and has since then told her he’s going to delete his OF account.  But feels like the damage is done.  And was wondering if he was wrong from the start, owning an OF in the first place. And how to fix this mess. 

Side notes: wife said she didn’t mind him watching normal unpaid for p*** because “it’s just a matter of randomly finding something decent that you like.  It’s normal” 

Husband and wife never argued about the matter, husband just acknowledged that his wife was instantly hurt. And quiet.",26May2020,1

507,"Let me preface this by making one thing clear: I'm not some lazy freeloader. I was a College student up until February, where I had to drop out due to performing poorly on my exams. No, it wasn't due to ""unwillingness to study"", the course I had choosen was too difficult for me to finish (Engineering), even though I've poured hours of studying and doing homework in order to pass. For this reason I wasn't able to get a job during my college years, due to the fact that i would spend entire days at the library studying, so much that I even lost friendships because of it.

Other things I've done in the past to get out of this situation are: Apply for trade schools, (wasn't able to finish due to not being physically strong enough to pass some of the internships), sent in countless resumès to get a job,  travelled to a different country in order to find a job (where I worked as a dishwasher for a month).

My family is abusive. I don't say this to try and get some sympathy here, I say this because I can't stay here or my sanity will keep getting worse. My father is physically abusive and my mom hates me and enables him.

I have tried sending my resumè for different jobs but it is insanely difficult where I live to find a job with no education other than your highschool diploma and almost no job experience. I have applied to many jobs, including cleaner, dishwasher, cashier, call-center worker etc..and I am still sending my resumè to them.

For anyone who thinks that my parents should just kick me out, I would just end up homeless. My parents have already tried in the past that and I spent almost a week sleeping outside and rummaning for food. There was no point in doing that other than mentally scarring me, because I'm not unwilling to be indipendent, I am already actively looking for a job, and it is hard to get a job while being homeless, since most require you to at least have access to a vehicle and specify where you live.

I also am worried about the future. Like I said I don't have the bests family situation here, so I can't depend on their financial help forever. I have no relatives near where I live and no friends that could help me. I need a job that will help me be indipendent, not just right now but in the future. Working minimum wage jobs such as cashier here don't pay nearly enough for me to live on my own (only 600 euros) and I'm scared I might end up homeless one day if I keep working jobs that pay low wages.

Over and over again I’d find out about him talking to other girls, in constant contact with his exes, even found out he hooked up with one whilst on the phone with me. He lied through his teeth, showed virtually no remorse, would hang up on me as I cried, gaslight the shit out of me, and disappear every weekend to get drunk without texting me more than once or twice. I would break down and he would pretend to care, get better for a week or two, then back to the gaslighting, lying, cheating bullshit.

Shockingly I sat through that desperate to break through to him and convinced he could change. Sometime last year I had a bit of a reality check when I found a text in which he told a girl he was single. I left him within minutes and stuck to it... for about a month. That was the best and worst month of my life. The friend group split. My life was hell- I had very few people to talk to. I ended up kind of falling for a mutual friend and i kissed him... then I was assaulted badly by another friend I had trusted. My boyfriend begged me to take him back for a week, then tried threatening to take my friends, then radio silence- then, right after I was assaulted, he reappeared, and promised all these things about improving himself and loving me.

I went back to my boyfriend... and it’s been blissful ever since. It’s been 7 months- not a single lie, no sneaking around, no exes or other women, doesn’t get drunk every weekend, tells me what’s going on with his life and friends, intentionally sets aside time for me, etc. He has not faltered in treating me amazingly, and I am doing my best to do the same for him.

And yet, I have a hard time. I am struggling not to resent him for the previous 2 years of shit he put me through. I forget sometimes but every now and then all I can think about is his exes, or the way he’d hang up while I cried and make me into the bad guy. He hasn’t done anything even close to that in a year now, but I don’t know how to let go of the anger I felt. Even more horribly, our mutual friend who i kissed keeps popping into my head every now and then, and I know he’s interested in me still.

I’m afraid to leave. I’m afraid because what if years from now I look back and regret it because he changed and did all these wonderful things for me, and I just left. I’m afraid because I will lose almost my entire friend group who have been with me for 4 years, who I speak to every single day. I don’t know if I’ll ever find anyone else again. I don’t know if this is something that will pass. I know we have amazing moments where I don’t think about it at all, but I know those thoughts of resentment creep in sometimes when I’m away from him, and I don’t know if they’ll ever go away. 

I feel like I’m being selfish and cruel. I have no good reason to feel anger or neglect him but sometimes I just can’t stop thinking about everything. He’s apologized with words and actions over and over and I want to forgive him but it’s hard. I want to forget about the fling I had with my friend, but that’s hard to let go of as well. My romantic and social life are so stuck together, I can’t get rid of one and keep the other, and it’s a heart wrenching choice to make.

I love him, or at least I think I do, but I’ve never been with anyone else so I don’t even know. I am so lost.",26May2020,1

We've been together for almost 5 months now and I'm very happy. He’s kind, considerate, SO patient, funny, etc. The only thing I've been struggling with is having anxiety in the relationship. I'm aware of his feelings for me and he's mentioned the future on numerous occasions, but for some reason, I can't shake the feeling that I'm not good enough for him, or that maybe with all of this going on, he can find someone better who lives closer to him. I think the pandemic and not being able to see each other is definitely contributing to it, but I don't want it to be a reason to drive him away. Sometimes I feel like it's complete word vomit when I let out my feelings and it ends up with me arguing, then forgetting what I'm arguing about 10 minutes later ... if that makes sense. I feel like it's an underlying self-esteem issue, and I'm trying my best to work on it, but it's tough. My anxiety has nothing to do with his actions or attitude. It is literally just me getting into my own head and having thought spirals that go too far. I keep trying to tell myself that he wouldn't text me every morning, talk to me all day, call me frequently, include me in aspects of his life (like his million pictures of his house renovations lol) if he wasn't all in.

I know isn’t ridiculous and insane to ask for a virgin especially at 29 with women being able to get sex easier but it still bothers me at times.

538,"I’m 12, a girl and live in England. In a past comment I said I was 13 cos I didn’t wanna be banned from a subreddit but for this situation I need to be truthful. My mum is Italian and would hit me ever since I can remember if I did something wrong or if she was just angry - even if she wasn’t angry at me. She used to even smash plates on the floor but not anymore. She and my dad would argue with my older sister because she was a trouble-maker and always wanted to party and got bad grades at school. They would argue with her literally all day and once she punched a glass door and cut her hands a lot. Now she’s in uni. Just now as I’m writing this my mum just called my sister stupid because she left a bag at our house. My mum and dad argued this morning. My dad is English and doesn’t hit me but always sides with my mum in arguments even though I know she is in the wrong. An example is when my dad said:
“You know your mum has made tons of sacrifices for you. Remember the 11+?”
“You mean when she would scream and hit me if I got an answer wrong?”
“Still, she helped you when you started doing badly.”
“No she didn’t! And I only started doing badly because she would lower my self esteem. I knew the maths and answers but that’s when my depression started. She can’t take any credit for me passing the exams”
Just a note - I haven’t been diagnosed with depression. I have sorta found that out myself. You may think I’m just a bit sad but I genuinely wanna kill myself sometimes but I’m too scared to feel a lot of pain. My mum always says that one day we’ll go to a therapist but she never takes me. Anyway, my parents think it’s alright to hit me or to shout at me but if I talk or hit back it’s unacceptable. This doesn’t make any sense! Just because you’re an adult doesn’t mean you are always right and have the “privilege” to hurt me in any way. I really do wish I had new parents but then my parents probably wouldn’t be paying for my private school anymore and I’d have to be sent somewhere else. It’s super annoying and upsetting for me.

Its probably worth mentioning that there be only 30 jobs in my country available, and they are all through recruitment agencies to which I have had no luck with in the past.

Unemployment isn't the only thing on my mind, I am running out of clean clothes thanks to the friggen lock down thing making the laundrette closed. I'm pretty unhappy with the way things are, because since losing my last job its turned me into a raging alcoholic comtemplating on doing the unliving. I am getting or was getting help with my mental health, but that seems to have gone down the potty with recent happenings in the world.

If you say education, thats not an option and nor an apprenticeship scheme. College is something I am unable to go back to. My life has hit a deadend and I would love to turn that around, but have no power to do so. Might be worth mentioning that I am autistic, so thats unfortunate because a lot of employers don't like my type, I know that. 

So lets take these ""skills"" into account:  
I have an obvious fluency in English.  
I know how to friggen operate a computer.  
I know how to use Microsoft office.  
I can use Vegas.  
I can write scripts in Python.

Yeah, not much I am capable of. I'm pretty much bottom of barrel, and no employer wants that. I have about a year left before my unemployment allowance gets yeeted, and before I basically end up homeless.

545,"My wife and I (and 3yr old son) are facing a substantial set of choices about the future of our family. This will affect our jobs, our home life. The decision might only affect the next few years. But more likely to affect the rest of our lives, as we are both in our 30's and looking to stop hop-scotching around from house-to-house and job-to-job.

My wife and I met 10 years ago in college. We grew up in towns about 65 minutes drive apart and both our families are generally concentrated on each extreme.

We moved to the small town where I grew up after college, as we both found jobs there pretty quickly. We married while living here and soon started discussing plans to eventually move up close to my wife's family. Last year, I took a job closer to my wife's family and have been making the hour long commute for the last year while we've looked for a house to relocate to. The right place has been elusive to this point.

My family lives in a small farming town where my parents live on a 80 acre farm. My siblings live on rural plots across the county. My family isn't terribly close. We generally only see and talk to one another around the holidays. 

My wife and her family are very close and they are involved in each others lives. My wife's proximity to her side of the family is pretty much priority #1 for her at this point. She deeply misses being near her cousins, aunt's &amp; uncles.

My parents are approaching 80 years old and are now discussing selling the bulk of the farm land and possibly handing down a chunk (including the house &amp; buildings) to my wife and I.

This isn't totally unforeseen. However, when discussed in years prior to now, I didn't see taking on the my parents property as something we could do from a budget perspective. Though, I have always looked at taking on the farm as something that could improve our quality of life and get us to be more active than we are with the meager provisions we have on our current property. Over the years, my wife always expressed wanting to have a small homestead and raise animals and she says this would be priority #2 to being close to family.

Today, the discussion for us taking on the farm is more financially feasible. What wasn't on the table before is a ""family discount"" of sorts that would take the venture from the realm of fantasy to something practical from a budge stand point, and enticing from a future opportunities standpoint. There are a lot of things you can do on a farm that you can't do as easily on a suburban allotment. My wife and I have discussed the what-ifs about different types of side businesses we could start.

That also says nothing of the many thousands of dollars of hand tools, machines and power equipment we would essentially get along with the property. 

My parents spent their lives building up the farm that is there. I might be able to rebuild a tenth of what they have in what's left of my life. So I'm looking at keeping the farm as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If we get into and want to sell a few years down the road, my family is fine with that. (I question how money would get split at that point)  

My wife is supportive, but taking it hard that this might mean she isn't right on the cusp of moving near her family. Her grandma is slowing down, and I know it would mean a ton to my wife to be nearby for support and more frequent visits.

It's a complicated mix to try and find an answer to. It only gets more complicated when trying to decide what location is best for our 3yr old son. Being close to my Wife's family will mean greater social interaction and more helping hands for baby sitting duties, etc. Being on the farm will mean more exposure to building things and fixing things of all varieties. And with the farm we would hope we could keep our son engaged in extracurriculars at school to fill in the social void.

I've (politely) argued to my wife that her family is only one hour away. It's not a major undertaking to take a weekend trip up. Though, admittedly, this does limit us from maybe doing visits on weeknights if any nephews or nieces are having a special event.

We're both getting overwhelmed at the weight of these decisions. Thank you in advance for any advice you can offer.

TL;DR - Wife will be happiest if we move an hour away from current town to be near family while living in a rural suburb type setting. I feel my happiness and quality of life will be best if we stay in current town and inherit family farm. I am especially concerned about missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.",26May2020,1

548,"My partner and I have been together for 9 years and have a house together. I feel like we have a lot of problems, some that have been ongoing for years and some new ones. Some of the main issues are that we do not do a lot of things outside of the house. They enjoy the smaller things in life like watching tv and cups of tea etc. whereas I enjoy going out and doing as much as possible and living life to the fullest. My partner has had anxiety which has obviously affected our relationship and they believe that they can change and want to go and do more things and go on holidays and be the one who suggest things to do rather than me always suggesting things. They say they want to make this change for themselves as well as for our relationship but we have had this issue for years and every time we discuss it we say things will change and then a couple of days/weeks later we just go back to how we were before. I feel like I am always bored in this relationship. 

Another issue is me, I've always looked for attention from other people and kissed other people on nights out (yes i know this is wrong). I feel like I don't really find my partner attractive and I don't know whether this has always been an issue in the back of my head. Recently I've not wanted to be intimate with them, don't want cuddles and kisses or for them to even touch me and I do not want to tell them 'I love you' when they say it to me. I struggle to think of the things that I like about them but I know they are a good person. It sort of feels like its just a friendship and we're just still together out of habit and comfort.

Recently I have become quite close to a friend and we both have feelings for each other. I don't want this decision to be based off choosing between the two people because even if we do break up I don't know what will happen with the other person. I want this decision to be based on what is right for this relationship. 

I question that why would I get feelings for other people if I was happy? Why would i not want to be intimate with my partner if we were happy? What if we decide to keep trying to work on our relationship and my feelings still don't change or I still look for attention else where. I know its not fair on him but I just worry that we've been together for 9 years and he does not want to break up but I just think it is for the best, but what if I regret it later on.",26May2020,1

550,"I live in a house in a decent sized neighborhood run by an HOA. My neighbor has a 2 car garage, a driveway that can hold 4 cars, and space in front of his house for 2 more. Yet there are constantly cars parked in front of my house that belong to or are visiting his house. Some are theirs, some are friends, and more times than you’d actually think it’s people they have working on their property (I.e. construction crews). 

It’s frustrating as:
- I don’t necessarily want to look out my front window and see someone else’s car every day and often into the early morning. Partially for aesthetic (which I know isn’t a great reason, it’s a public road), but also it’s concerning having random cars parked in front of your house all the time. 
- They have space to park their vehicles and others 99% of the time in their driveway or in front of their house. 
- I hate to be that guy, but also these work crews and friends are messing up my grass by either driving or walking on it. Living in an HOA they’re anal about our yards not looking like doo doo (I.e. dead spots, yellow, uncut, you know the works...).

So...what can I do? What should I do? The neighbor has I believe 4 cars. We aren’t close as I’ve only lived here for just over a year. I just don’t want to be the jerk who is making a fuss and I know it’s a public road so I legally don’t think I can do anything.",26May2020,1

**Uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatori (UK)**

Pasaulē dažādās valstīs ir atšķirīga pieeja uzturlīdzekļu apjoma noteikšanā. Dažās no valstīm tos nosaka puses vienojoties. Dažās tos nosaka ar tiesas palīdzību, piemēram, ja vienoties nav iespējams.

Lieki teikt, ka tiesas izmaksas var būt ļoti dārgas, process bieži vien ir ilgstošs, neprecīzs, iznākums neparedzams. Ja uzturlīdzekļus tiesa nosaka dažādiem cilvēkiem atšķirīgos tiesas sastāvos, tad rezultāti atšķiras, kas neatbilst viens likums viena taisnība principam.

Cilvēki bieži vien pamatoti ir neapmierināti un pārsūdz tiesas spriedumus nākamās instances tiesā, process ievelkas un kļūst vēl dārgāks, ieguvēji pilnīgi noteikti nav bērni, kuri tiesvedībā izdoto naudu varētu saņemt kā tos pašus uzturlīdzekļus. Tas viss ir ilgstošs stress un no tā izrietošās sekas, kuras vislabāk spēs izskaidrot šajā kvalifikācijā specializējies medicīnas darbinieks.

Ir virkne valstis pasaulē, kur **cilvēki ir sapratuši**, ka uzturlīdzekļu jautājumā ir ļoti grūti vienoties, bet ilgstoši tiesas procesi ir ļoti dārgi. Tāpēc tās lieto ļoti gudrus un pārdomātus automātiskos uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatorus.

Uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatori ir viens iemesls mazāk strīdēties, tiesāties – ietaupīta nauda, laiks, nervi …

**Uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatoriem (UK) ir virkne priekšrocību:**

* uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatori ir dinamiski un ātri (cilvēki var ātri veikt uzturlīdzekļu aprēķinu katru mēnesi, piemēram, iespējams noteikt uzturlīdzekļus par mainīgo ienākumu daļu);
* pretēji tiesas spriedumam, kas parasti paredz noteiktu summu, uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatori spēj reaģēt uz bezdarbu, slimību, pandēmiju u.c. pasaules likstām;
* tos parasti izvieto valsts oficiālajos portālos, tāpēc nav šaubu par uzrādīto datu korektumu;
* tie atslogo tiesu darbu, jo nav nepieciešams tiesā vētīt savāktos čekus vai citādi pierādīt izdevumus;
* tie ļauj precīzi noteikt maksājamo uzturlīdzekļu apjomu, kas savukārt atvieglo pārējos aprēķinus (laulības šķiršanas un mantas sadales gadījumā uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatora aprēķina rezultātus var izmantot kopā ar nekustāmā īpašuma vērtējumu);
* tie izslēdz korupciju vai šaubas, ka uzturlīdzekļi noteikti nekorekti kādu iemeslu dēļ, ja valsts spēj precīzi noteikt kādu “lielumu” ar precīzu algoritmu, tad tā ir viena vieta mazāk, kurā cilvēki centīsies veikt koruptīvas darbības;
* daži no uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatoriem ņem vērā gan maksājošās, gan saņemošās puses ienākumus;
* daži no uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatoriem ņem vērā laiku, ko bērns pavada pie katra no vecākiem, arī šķirti vecāki tomēr ir vecāki un abiem būtu jābūt iespējai tikties ar bērniem;
* parasti uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatori ņem vērā arī bērnu patieso nepieciešamību limitus (bērna uzturam nepieciešams noteikts minimums, bērnam taču nevajag **neierobežotu summu mēnesī** uzturam);
* uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatoru paredzamība un precizitāte ļauj cilvēkiem dzīvot tālāk pēc šķiršanās pretēji represīvajām metodēm (autovadītāja tiesību anulēšana, reputācijas bojāšana, krimināllieta u.c.).

Augstāk minētie argumenti ir pietiekami, lai uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatoru ieviešanu apspriestu valstis, kurās tos vēl nelieto. Valstis kurās ir tiesu noslogotība un citas risināmas lietas. Dotajā brīdī esmu uzgājis uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatorus sekojošās valstīs, kuras parasti iekļauj attīstīto valstu sarakstā: Vācija, Lielbritānija, ASV (katrā štatā savs), Kanāda, Austrālija, Spānija, Somija, Japāna u.c.

Savos rakstos mēģināšu apskatīt pasaules valstu uzturlīdzekļu kalkulatorus, to veidus un darbības principus. Izvēlnēs uzturlīdzekļu kalkulators turpmāk tiks apzīmēts kā **“UK”**.

**Definīcijas, skaidrojumi:**

* Child maintenace calculator – Uzturlīdzekļu kalkulators (British English);
* Child support calculator – Uzturlīdzekļu kalkulators (American English);
* Uzturlīdzekļu apmēra noteikšanas tabele – tabulārā veidā atspoguļoti uzturlīdzekļu noteikšanai pielietotā algoritma rādījumi;
* alimenti ir tas pats kas uzturlīdzekļi;
* alimentu kalkulators ir tas pats kas uzturlīdzekļu kalkulators;
* Калькулятор алиментов – alimentu kalkulators (Krieviski);
* Algoritms – iepriekš precīzi definēta kārtība, kas ļauj paveikt kādu noteiktu darbu vai aprēķinu, uzturlīdzekļu gadījumā šādu kārtību definē valsts.",26May2020,1
553,"Hey, thanks for taking the time to read my post. So I am going after quarantine on my first ever date. I cannot stress to you all enough about how **oblivious** I am to flirting. 

I have a really outgoing personality but with that my flirting skills are like as follows:

&gt;Girl: Bullshit, you are so good looking  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Thanks

So what I was wondering was what do I do on the first date? 

\- Do I hold her hand?

\- What happens if I have to kiss her, which lip, what do I do?  
\- Do I throw my arm around her or is that too forward?

\- Do I hug her or is that creepy

\- What should I say and not say?

\- What do we even do? Like ideas for a first date?

\- How do I act, I am a very 'warm' person but I don't want to come across as overbearing

\- Like what conversation topics?

\- What compliments should I give

\- What is flirting that could come from her side? 

\- What do I reply with

\- How do I calm myself down?

\- What should I do and not do?

I feel like I am asking too many questions, but once again thank you for taking your time to read my post. Any other advice would be 10000000000000% useful and taken into consideration.

I’m not asking to be perfectly positive. I allow myself to have real and natural emotions positive and negative. Sometimes I notice that I’m depressed or angry. Then, when I take a look at my thoughts and pattens they are negative or I’m spending time thinking about traumatic events or even simple embarrassing events and I’m spending more time thinking about what I don’t have and less about what I do have.

559,"Hi all! 

I’m looking for a bit of advice. 

I had been planning on moving to Los Angeles from Orlando before the pandemic after my college graduation, and obviously that’s out of the picture. My degree is in Media Production and my dream is to work in creative development. 

I’m stuck in my home town living with my parents and I’m going crazy. I want to move, but I’m unsure if it’s the best move. I don’t know whether to suffer through my living situation (I currently live with my mother and step-dad and it’s... not great. My mom is a narcissist and my step-dad is on disability and just plays video games all day. My mom unloads her problems on to me because she’s frustrated at her husband and calls me “her little therapist” but I can’t take it anymore.), and save money, or just say screw it and move to a new city and hope for the best. I have about $11k in savings, which would keep me afloat for a bit. I’m just worried because the job prospects are essentially zero and I don’t know when or if I’d find a job. 

I was wondering if anyone could help me out figure out my situation? I don’t have many I can turn to, and I just want to know what the best course of action would be. It feels like this situation is never ending and I don’t know how much longer I can be here. I don’t particularly care where I move, since I have no attachments either way. Ideally I’d like to be on the West Coast, or at least out of the South in general. I just feel stuck and it’s really wearing down on my mental health. I suffer from Bipolar disorder along with major depression and anxiety, and I feel like I’d rather being broke in a city than save money and live at home while my mental stability declines. 

Thank you for listening to me, and I’d appreciate any help or advice you’d be willing to give.",26May2020,1

562,"Whenever I’m alone or just with my thoughts I always try to find girls In my phone to talk to. And I hate it, it feels like an addiction that I don’t want but want at the same time I do

I’ve never been in a relationship my whole life, since I was always taught relationships were serious things and out of all the females I’ve ever talked to in my life I think I may have only really came close to loving 2. Which I never dated but had a on and off thing for years. 
I always say I haven’t dated Most of the girls I’ve talked to because I know I’m not deeply into them and I would end up hurting them. 
Although that maybe part of it. I feel like deep down, I don’t want to get hurt. I Had a lot of rejection coming up, like a lotttt. And i always believed it was because I was too nice and too caring, wanting to fix their problems always there when they need me. 

It used to take me a long time to get over a girl, even just not messaging them was an impossible task
But by now and the more and more I talk to different girls I seem to have learned a way to become detached it’s almost as if when I’m hurt I feel it but numb the pain and bury it. 
as if my hearts a stone 

subconsciously treating every failed interaction of fling with a girl as lesson, like a robot downloading data for the next female.
I used to lack in confidence in my early highschool highschool days. But now I’m 20, and I constantly approach woman whenever I see them in public and I find them attractive. if I get rejected it hurt like a numbed pain in my heart but I brush it off and bury it as usually when

I don’t know why I see woman as a challenge, it’s as if I get an adrenaline rush when interacting with a new girl (the chase). Don’t get me wrong I respect and love woman, would never and have never treated a woman in a wrong manner

but it’s nights like this, where I’m alway for work. Got Netflix on the tv. And have a whole night ahead of me, and I go on my Snapchat and got no one to message or call. Where all those feelings resurfaced, still a bit numbed but alone, kind of sad. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 
feel like when you have a big home and everyone’s over and having a good time laughing, joking but then it strikes 11 and they all have lives to live and some have early mornings. So the door opens and shuts behind them, it’s just you

563,"TLDR at the bottom! I’ve been at my job for about 7 years.... well, it’s not exactly 7 years because at some point, right after college, I left to move to another job as an accountant. 

I spent about 8 months at this job and was miserable because I didn’t feel like I fit in. I was constantly seeking out other opportunities. I had many, many interview opportunities and even got some of these positions. I didn’t accept any of them. At some point, I got in contact with my old supervisor and went running back to my old job.

Whew - finally I felt like I could breathe again. I was back where I felt comfortable, back to what felt like home.

The only problem was that my position was not really defined at this point and seemed to be me just walking around looking for work to do. At some point, their old accountant left and I was moved into that position. I was almost happy at some point, but not really, because it was still not enough work for it to make sense for me to be there. There is no future for me in this company because there’s just no way up. My job is what it is and will never be anything more than what it is. 

I have looked for jobs for a while, and again, I found myself in a similar position. I noticed that I’d get interview requests or maybe even some job offers and I’d run away from them all. I don’t know why. I don’t know if it’s the fear of having to start somewhere new, or if I’m just trying too hard to hold on to this job that I know is not good for me long-term. 

Now with the whole COVID-19 situation, I’ve been laid off indefinitely, with maybe a 20 minute notice from them... I want to finally start looking for something new, but I keep screwing myself over every time an interview comes my way and I try to dodge it for god knows what reason. 

What can I do to stop sabotaging my own success in my career?

I’m having a lot of mixed emotions going on about how to handle this. I wanted to give her a birthday gift, a meaningful one at least from my point of view. The thing is, I should be moving on, trying to forget about my feelings, but at the same time something tells me to fight, like pushing things further and not care about the other guy.

Doesn’t matter I’ll find it’ ‘OHHH YOU HEAR THIS,she thinks she’s gunna find it!’ What is she doing?  It makes me feel like utter shit day in day out.

571,"Alright, I hope I can explain this.
So, one of my best friends, if not my best best friend (I'll name him L.), and me currently are not in contact. I don't know how to deal with the situation we're in.

Me and a few other people we're having a nice house party on Father's day, as it is kind of a tradition in my country to absolutely get wasted on this day.
The party was held at the house of the ex-girlfriend (I'll name her X.) of L. They're separated since 3 weeks now after a nearly 4 year relationship. She became one of my best friends in the last 3 years, as our group of people was always very close. The plan of me and another close friend (I'll name him F.) X. is also good friends with, was to sleep over at the place were the party happened. 
The next day we wanted to watch some Marvel movies with X. and do nothing the whole day.

The party was over and F. and I went to sleep. Of course X. slept in her own room and F. and I shared the guest room, so just a normal sleep over between friends, as I don't care if my friends are female or male. 

The next day L. ""found out"" that F. and I slept over at her place and that we planned to chill the whole day at her house.
L. started to voice message X. and he was furious about the fact that we slept over at her place, even though we all made clear that it was just a normal sleepover between friends and this whole thing was planned since 2 weeks.

Later that day L. came over to pick up some big boxes from X. so he could put X.'s remaining personal stuff in there to clean up his appartement were they lived together for a few years.

Anyway, L. started to shout at all three of us for doing this sleepover and movie thing. For him it was unacceptable that F. and I, who took care of them both equally after they broke up, sacrificing all the time we had to make them comfortable again and to take care of their emotional breakdowns etc., slept over at her place just a few weeks after they broke up and spending nearly 2 days together.
F. and I couldn't get a word out as we were totally surprised and shocked by his reaction because we think that we did nothing wrong and it was just a normal thing that happens in a friendship.
L. then left, leaving X. in tears and F. and me in total shock.

A couple minutes later, L. voice messaged X. again telling her that after such a betrayal he won't be friends with F. and me anymore. He told X. to not play the message in front of us, but later in the evening she decided to play us the message. I was devasted. 

I still can't understand how he can be that angry about something like this. I'm not ready to talk to L. about all of this as he doesn't know I heard the voice message. But this message was kind of the nail in the coffin for me. I feel like he doesn't trust me, although he said to all of us to take care of X. so she feels better with the whole situation. I feel like our friendship will never be the same and I'm really really hurt by the way he reacted and by the fact that he said he won't be friends with me anymore. I just don't know what to do. Other people reached out to me and told me to clear the situation as soon as possible but they also don't know about the things he said. They don't know that I'm truly hurt. Everyone thinks I just should apologize for what F. and I did, but in my opinion I didn't do anything wrong. 

Even if I would apologize for this, I couldn't get over that he apparently doesn't trust me and that he thought we did this to fuck him up, that in his eyes F. and I showed that we chose her to be ""better"" friends with over him, which was never the case.

I hope y'all understood the story and the problem I / we have. Thank you for reading.

I pushed my friends away to stay a little more time with him and before pandemic I never got out of my house, only for school and hang on with him.
He said sometimes that he feels like a monster for making me do those things and I always say that he's not, that he is just insecure and that I'll help him staying away for things that make him insecure, I'm doing wrong, right?
My boyfriend, an female friend of mine and me are in the same class at school, when he noticed her presence he started saying that I was going to leave him to talk with her and those things, I never left him behind tho.

Once I was with him (we were sitting at class not doing anything or even talking, was the school break) this female friend of mine came to talk to me, he was on my side and he left the class when I stated to talk with her, I run for him and asked why he have done that, he said that he thought I was going to leave him (the he left me, the fuck?)

I won't break up with him, he is a awesome boyfriend besides that flaw, he helped me in the most hard situations in my life, depression and those things.
I really want advices to talk to him about his insecurities, we are fine now about that, but I want to be able to talk to someone and he don't run away, and wearing what I want in public.

He won't go in a psychologist, I already asked him, he don't want to, I'm thinking about me going in a psychologist to talk about him and asking what I can do, she also may talk to him, but only if he want to of course.

I won't just say, 'my body my rules, get over it' or 'change or I'm leaving'
I really want to help him, please",26May2020,1

575,"Ok so last week my sister and her soon to be husband came over (im still in HS so i live w my parents).  My sister is just graduating law school. Its become clear that they are my moms favorite (ive had my suspicions before but recently they’ve been confirmed).  But whatever. When they came my mom spent lots of money on them (that we dont have might i add). They mooch off of us. (Ugh i feel so terrible saying this cuz like its my sister but i just dont know what to do). My mom ordered in, got them bagels, etc etc whatever they wanted. They stayed for a week and then left. 

This week my dads job reduced his already meh salary due to covid. 

Yesterday was my sister and her fiancées ex wedding day which got cancelled bc of covid so my parents went to their place (i stayed home). My parents paid for dinner and my mom even bought them food n stuff. 

From what ive gathered, my sister and her fiance  were talking non stop about how much they enjoyed staying at our house and how they are looking forward to coming back and want to come back asap. (Apparently maybe this Thursday)

This worries me because she has no idea about my dads salary and neither of them mind mooching off our parents. So im conflicted as to whether i should txt her and tell her or not. If i do, i run the risk of her mentioning it to my mom and my mom WOULD KILL ME. But if i dont i run the risk of them coming thursday and putting us in a bad place. 
I also wouldnt even know what to say + how to phrase it. 

All advice is appreciated!",26May2020,1
576,"I (15m) and my BF (15m) have been friends for years and eventually got together. It was all going well until quarintine started and I began to go through a lot of stress and anxiety, and fears of abandonemnt (I have an anxiety disorder) and we both eventually agreed it would be better to wait until quarintine ended to date. The relationship was causing me a lot of stress, and I was deeply scared he wouldn't love me anymore after a while. 

Anyways, he said he would wait for me to get better and didn't get into any relationships, but eventually he became really close to someone he met online and started (obviously) developing feelings for them (he also said he would definetly date this person if they asked him out) and eventually he said he would just ""see what will happen"" when quarentine ends and it once again, caused me to stress out. I eventually told him I wouldn't hold onto my feelings and wait for him because if he chose the other person, I know I would get hurt again. We ended on very good terms, (we're still best friends) but I'm just having a really hard time trying to loose my feelings. While I don't exactly regret the relationship since he helped me discover who I am and many other things, but I can't listen to certain songs or watch certain videos (animations more specifically) I used to love because they remind me of the stress I went through.

He was my best friend and everything I wanted in a partner, and I thought all the signs were there that we would work out in a relationship, and I think i let myself get too attached even knowing that he was my only close friend at the time, and wouldn't have anyone to turn to if something happend between us.",26May2020,1
577,"In December 2019 I had a miscarriage. 

I have been dating my boyfriend for 2 years and it was a total accident. I didn't even know I was pregnant. I was distraught after it happened. I have always wanted children and my biggest fear is infertility. 

As a bit of a background, I did an undergraduate research project in a lab during the second half of 2019. I was asked to continue with this same lab into honours. I was excited, however, I knew it wouldn't be easy as my supervisor (let's call him John) had very high expectations. I started honours early - the day after I graduated from my BSc. I shouldn't have had agreed to work over the summer because I was starting before the students but I wanted to do well and John expected that I would. 

Then I had the miscarriage. 

It incapacitated me mentally. I spent the first 2 weeks of January at the lab hardly learning anything and becoming more and more depressed. My doctor recommended that I ask my supervisor for time off. 

John was sympathetic to me and said I should have some time off. He said his sister went through something similar and he could understand what I was going through. 

I felt reassured. I took 2 weeks off to recover. I figured that was where this story would end. 

I was wrong. 

When I came back John was very cold towards me. He said that I needed to apologise for burdening the rest of the lab while I was away. Honours was set to officially begin on the coming Monday and I needed to make sure that I had made amends with everyone for taking a ""holiday"" when they were working hard. I was a bit confused by this but did it anyway. Everyone I apologised to was extremely confused as to why I was apologising to them (they hadn't been covering my work) and treated me the same as they always had. The whole thing was very strange, but I ignored it. Things were normal. I was still recovering but doing well. 

17 days later, I was walking by John's office when I thought I would duck in and ask him a question that someone else in the lab hadn't been able to answer. 

John immediately started yelling at me. 

To summarise a very long conversation, he said that I wasn't working hard enough and asking such a simple question proved that. He said that I hadn't been the same since the miscarriage and that he expected more from me. He said that I had plenty of time to recover. He said that I clearly was disinterested in my project because I took time off in January and that I have been incompetent since then. He said that my male coworker didn't need to be in the lab as often as I was as he was naturally more intelligent than I was. He said that he couldn't see me achieving a high distinction in honours, should I continue, no matter how hard I worked. He said I should drop out of honours.

I was extremely upset by this and began crying. I told John through my tears that I was doing my best and that no one had ever said to me that I needed to work harder - that he, John, had marked me very highly for my lab skills only 3 months ealrier. I told him that I was unhappy that he would bring up my miscarriage. 

He seemed shocked by what I said. He tried to backtrack and say that he was only looking out for me since I had my miscarriage as he believes that it had changed me; that it wasn't something I could recover from. He kept repeating that he liked my personality so it wasn't personal, that I was ""mincing"" his words when I repeated back to him what he had said to me and that he wasn't acting unprofessionally. 

Later I found out that other female students in my lab had been treated in a similar way - they said it was his way of motivating his students. Looking back, I realise that John probably didn't expect that I would challenge him and thought I would just say that I would work harder and stay later at the lab.

Regardless, I didn't (and still don't) believe that I deserved what he said to me. I don't believe that any woman deserves such treatment. I believe John discriminated against me.

I made a complaint through my university and dropped out of honours for the semester. The head of my school, who investigated my claim despite telling me she was biased and wouldn't be investigating, determined that, in her opinon, John did not discriminate against me and she wouldn't be opening an investigation as John did not agree with my version of events. Still, John was ordered to issue me an apology for causing me ""extreme duress"" during and before the meeting as well as sign an agreement saying that he wouldn't discuss what happened moving forward with anyone at the university. 

My parents believe that I won because I received a formal apology (written by the school and signed by John). My lawyer doesn't believe it's worth pursuing outside of the university because the university has many more resources at their disposal than I do. My boyfriend wants me to let it go and move on because it's effecting my ability to recover from what happened and my health. 

I'm not so sure. I don't feel like the issue was resolved. I feel like I was brushed off by the university and that if I go back to honours next semester there will be fall out. I'm scared that they won't reinstate my honours position even if I apply to another lab. I'm terrified that he has told other supervisors about what happened and that I will never get another position and that if I do, I will be judged harshly within the school for what happened and making a formal complaint. 

I don't know what to do. Honestly, I think I just need an outside perspective so if you somehow managed to read all of that, I want your opinions and any advice you can give me. 

Should I apply to honours again with a different lab? Do I take more time off? Should I give up on honours? 

Was it discrimination or am I over-reacting? 

Where can I go for help? How do I move on?

I'm sorry for asking so many questions. Any advice at all would mean the world to me. Thank you for your time. 

TLDR: I had a miscarriage and my honours supervisor kicked me out of his lab. My unviersity doesn't believe that it was discrimination. Do I go back to honours? How do I move on?",26May2020,1

Like you have said before you think girls are pretty but would never date them.” I have never said this. I took this as a perfect time to tell my friends that I have been confused on my sexuality for a while and that I’m interested in girls. 2/3 friends were super sweet and comforting to me, but the one who chimed in initially started to act strange, talk under her breath, etc. We have been friends for a very long time so I thought that it wouldn’t be awkward. I think she was upset that I refuted what she said about not wanting to date girls. I asked her why she was acting weird and why she was mad and she said kept just saying I’m not mad, you were being rude, etc. I didn’t think I was being rude and this was a happy moment for me. She then randomly got up and left us and went to her room (we were at her house). I’m unsure how to feel as it feels like a slap in the face as I just told her something very important to me.

582,"Alright, this is some pretty cliche stuff i guess. Also, excuse my bad english.  


I'm a 23M student of Industrial Engineering, i should be finishing my studies this year (5 year career) but i've failed a fair amount of courses so i'm 1 year late. I struggled with depression during the first years, but i've managed to get my stuff together through going to a psychologist and i think i'm fine now even though there are remnants from it.  
What is troubling me today is that i know that i'm close to finishing my career, but i lack the motivation and the lead to satisfy the difficulties of my careeer. It could be consequence from the pandemy, the confinement and all, but everytime i try to get my mind to study i struggle because it's like it would tell me i should be doing something better for me, like studying music theory or music production (which is something i'm doing as a hobby). This doesn't translate into a ""i don't care about studying"" kind of mood, because i'm constantly anxious about how much i have to study and it doesn't let me enjoy the other things, but even if i try to force myself to sit and study, i get tired so fast and i need to take frequent rests .   
Now, i know what my priorities should be, i wish i had studied music somehow, but in my country is pretty hard to be succesful as a musician, so it's like common sense to study a traditional career first so i can avoid having economic struggles in the future.   
So, right now i'm pretty scared of failing once again in my studies, i feel like i can't do it. Everytime i go to a test i'm anxious because i know i'm not prepared for it and its usual for me to leave thinking ""at least it's over, i can finally rest"".

584,"So to start, my wife (26) and I (28) have been married for a year and we dated for three years. I'd say I'm straight and she's bisexual. About two months ago she shaved her head (I know how inconsequential this detail sounds, but its a starting point) and since then, things have developed at an odd rate. 

1. I found out she had been sending explicit photos to a guy on Facebook. We worked through it.

2. She began to tell me she wants to make an Onlyfans or start posting sexual material of us online for money.

3. She told me she's been feeling gay lately and wants to have a threesome with another girl. This particular one is kind of problematic because I'm not really secure enough for that kind of thing, especially after what happened with number one. I know that a threesome is a dream for a lot of guys, hell, it was a dream of mine for years when I was younger.

These are just the bigger things that have occurred. I love my wife very much which is why I've been just dealing with this stuff but I don't know what I'm supposed to do here. I've stopped talking about the photos she was sending to the guy because it almost seemed like she would get annoyed with me for talking about it so I haven't vented about it at all for a couple of months now. I've voiced my opinion about the Onlyfans thing and how I'm not comfortable with that at all. I've told her how a threesome doesn't even sound slightly enjoyable to me.

587," 

TL;DR: I introduced my 2 female nieces (same age as me) to porn when we were 10-12 yrs old and one time was squeezing my penis through my pants pocket, in front of them. Will this ruin my career and/or my life?

I am currently struggling with an obsessive thought of worry/shame/guilt, and its taking over my life.  

I have 2 female nieces (1 is the same age as me, and 1 is 1 year younger than me. I know it’s weird but I have a sister who is much older than me so that is why). When I was 11 or 12 (foggy memory), I had discovered internet pornography and wanted to show them this “new cool thing” I found on the internet, so I showed it to them.  They were fascinated by it and asked me to show them again another day. We ended up visiting these sites about 3 times or so over the course of a few months when they would come to visit. 

Just about 1 month ago, I felt tons of guilt over this and I contacted one of them (the one who was 1 year younger than me) and asked if it upset her at all, and apologized for showing it to her. She said it didn’t upset her and kinda laughed me off saying its not that big of a deal. I have not contacted the other who (who is my age). I do remember though that she was not quite as interested in it as the younger one.  

Now, I’ve been remembering another memory which is troubling me very much and making me feel very very scared. The very last time I showed these videos, it was started by me, and I remember myself and the younger one were sitting on my bed while the older one was doing something else in another part of the room. We started watching these videos on my phone, and I am now remembering that I had my hand sort of squeezing my penis through my pants pocket (not directly), and that I was discovering masturbation at this age.  I don’t think she noticed that I was doing this, although she might have. I am scared that if she did notice me messing with my junk through my pants, it may have traumatized her. What is the likelihood that this harmed her in any way? She didn’t bring it up when I asked a month ago about whether the videos were upsetting to her, so can I be sure that this was probably also “not a big deal to her”? 

My career seems to be taking off in such a way that I may become quite well-known (within my field, but likely not mainstream well known).  I trust that me showing the porn did not upset the younger one, and I haven’t brought it up with the older one. I am not 100% sure if the older one remembers or was upset by it.

I have this worry that the younger one will come forward one day and ruin my public image by claiming she was traumatized by the incident where I had my hand in my pockets/pants attempting to pleasure myself (though remember, I am not sure if she even noticed). I am scared my career will be harmed by this, especially seeing how many male public figures are losing their careers over #MeToo allegations. 

I know that what I did was not “abuse” by any means. We did not even show each other our genitals. No force was involved. No touching was involved. It was me introducing both of them to porn, and on one occasion, me squeezing my penis through my pants pocket, with my hands. I guess my main questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How likely is it that she even noticed me doing that? 
2. How likely is it that 1 or both of them was hurt or affected by this? (keep in mind they treat me completely normally like nothing happened, and always have since then).  
3. If they happened to be hurt by this, how likely are either one of them to come and ruin my public image/career over it?
4. Should I be devoting any mental energy to this at all?  Do I have anything to worry about?",26May2020,1
588,"Me and my GF have been dating over 2 months now we’ve always been close like ft all day and talk but we have distance between us (3 hour drive) and I’m not really big in the whole distance thing but we made our friendship work and I knew she wanted to date me. so our “thing” has been for 5 months but I’ve known her for over a year and in the beginning of our friendship we were really close but I ended it but started it back up 5 months ago. recently say about a month ago I get a different vibe from her. We don’t ft that much and if we do it’ll be for 15 minutes. I’ll constantly try to start conversation and it doesn’t go anywhere. My texts go for delivered for about 5 hours. She doesn’t even open my texts up (we have read receipts on) as much anymore unless I’m asking her a question but she’ll be on Snapchat and her snaps aren’t even the usual just forehead pics, sometimes a smile. she’s not on her phone as much anymore, she’ll get on it now and then.

589,"At this point, its a 3 year friendship... Every time Im with him, I always cherish it... I received all sorts of feelings... Always happy... always...Sometimes its awkward... Then at one point he's angry at me because I did stupid that will really makes him angry, I feel bad... But its part of it... He forgave me... I forgave him too... Saying sorry to each other... Putting it at the past... Create new memories... One time, he accompanied me to buy my black shoes... One time, my father locked me away that night (it was b4 christmas  days though), because I was enjoying my time with my very close friends, including him (more like brothers to me) and I went home late... I was scared, no place to sleep... Luckily, he let me sleep at his home.... I was so thankful... Well, in return, I devote myself to teach him academicswhen he needed (like extreme hard physics, calculus, maths, circuit analysis, etc) and also... I would listen to his problems, vents, reflections... etc... For the past three years... I always enjoy teaching him... 

 Then sometimes, Im jealous that he's with someone... or he is not full attention to me when I'm with him... YES, IM AWARE! Its bad cognitive behaviour... Im totally conscious of it, hahahaha...OFCOURSE I RESPECT HIM... i guess being jealous is part of it... I will talk to him kindly amd express my (stupid) feelings... I speak, he listens... YES, I KNOW MY BOUNDARIES... But the fact that, there would be always another sweet memory with him, so I know my jealousy will gone... It will repeat though, but time goes by, I will learn to control... like accepting it i feel this way... and it will pass...

Speaking of boundaries... I know, he is not the kind of talkative person onto chatting through messenger... I know he needs time for himself... This quarantine though, we barely chat... Yes, i miss him so much... But I guess I have my own hobbies... Make most of my time... When this quarantine is over, I just want to hug him very long...

Speaking of hugging... I dont remember a time hugging with him... But the fact that, during school, we often act more like couples though, like I often lean my head on his shoulders... Or just leaning myself onto him... I was clingy to him... Yeah, he is sometimes clingy-touch contact to me too...I dont find it romantic, just... idk, out of friendship/bromance, hahahaha... We also talk about all sorts of things, from deep to shallow, from porn to 'What is eudaimonistic way of living life'?

I remembered... Valentines 2020... I ask him to be my date? He agreed just like that... I was excited! hahahaah! Unfortunately, I cancelled because I knew he has still an ongoing assignment that needs atleast 4 days to finish it (in my exp)... and he has 0% progress... So i gave him time... However, 2 days past, still no progress because he was lazy to do it and he is comfortable to procrastinate because the deadline is too far away... He also wondered why I cancelled it... hahahaha, I was so disappointed... Instead, I bought him that expensive tasty bread balls to celebrate valentines we missed... He loved it...

Its just, we're happy... All ups and downs... Its... there... I was just glad I have a bestfriend like him.... I dont want to lose him...

However... you know... this quarantine, it made me thought things... the general question is... Do I love him more than a friend?? Hmmmm, I guess I do... But the real question is... Is it worth the risk? Yeah, its possible... Im positive that... Ill be so happy with him forever...I kept imagining things about my future with him... However, Im also scared of that he doesnt feel the same as I do (at this point). Should I ask him to be my partner?? Im scared I will lose that friendship...

Or... Im just obssessed?? But i feel that im not obssessed because I could still focus on my hobbies, or house chores... or i just really miss him...

Another question... I dont know... Am I gay? Because my definition of gay is... yes, a male likes male / female likea female (or corect me if im wrong)... But if Im gay, I should be attracted to other males not only him... But Im not... Im not really atracted to him... I just... I just want to be with him... Im happy when Im with him... Im not sexually atracted to him...

Usually six feet apart, but there were a few times we were about 3 or 4 feet apart moving past each other.

My dad has been replacing outlets that aren't grounded, helping us with yard work, and he helped my fiancé bring a washer and dryer down into the basement. Installing the washer and dryer was the closest they got to each other. He's been very generous. I hugged him when he bought us the washer and dryer. I was overcome with gratitude, and forgot protocol. I feel awful about it. 

My fiancé's mom went back to church this weekend on Sunday, she said she couldn't stay away anymore. She goes to a megachurch. I'm worried about her, she has an autoimmune disease. Then yesterday for Memorial Day, she invited us to a party at her house. I don't think she's social distancing. 

We were invited to a wedding for my fiancé's family friend mid-July. It hasn't been rescheduled, and they want our RSVP soon. My fiancé said he was going, and based on the conversation we had, I think he will be upset if I decide not to. I just really don't think going to a wedding is reasonable right now.

My younger cousin is having a ""social distance graduation party"". It will be outside in the yard with appropriate distance between people, which is very important because my aunt has a health complication. There will be 8 people total-- my aunt, uncle, the graduate, my mom, dad, sister, and my fiancé + I. No hugging, hand sanitizer stations, etc. We will enter through the side gate and not the house. I was planning on going because they're taking precautions.

I have a feeling he's going to be upset and say there's a double standard between our families, because I've also been in contact with mine. I hugged one person on accident, and I really feel awful about it, but his family's been hugging who knows how many people.

To me, it really feels like my family has been pretty safe about seeing people, and his has not.

What do I do here? I don't think going to a wedding is safe, but I'm fine with seeing people outdoors 6 feet apart. Am I wrong, is this a double standard between how I'm viewing our families? Should I just suck it up and go to the wedding?",26May2020,1
596,"I am a Brazilian PhD student in a US university who returned home when the campus closed in mid-March. Since then I have been quarantining myself in my parents' house.

Sunday, Brazil was included in the travel ban list, meaning that anyone who visited this country cannot enter US unless staying somewhere else for 14 days. Considering this, I am worried about not being able to come back to school in the Fall semester (the university is considering a mix of present and online classes and work). 

So far, I have thought on buying a ticket to Mexico as soon as possible, spending two weeks locked in a hotel room or a friend's house and  then flying to US. The problem with this idea is that there is no assurance the the borders will still be open when I need it. The alternative is waiting two months to think on another plan and check if any other route is available. Moreover, I wonder if returning to US to follow online courses (a possibility) pays the risk.

Can you see any reasonable way to deal with this issue?",26May2020,1
597,"I'll start at the beginning of our relationship. We met on tinder chatted for a couple days, decided to finally meet up one weekend. Our first date was excellent. Fast forward a couple months, we both fall hard for each other. Introduce each other to our families. Our first fight she breaks up with me for 3 weeks cuts all communication. Finally replies we get back together all is good! Skip ahead a couple more months, she ends up losing her job. That's ok 👌 I make enough money to support both of us, I ask if she wanted to move in with me. I give her my spare key and now she's living with me. I never asked her to pay rent or get a job. (I love her) We we're going steady. Jump a year ahead, we're now talking about starting a family and getting married. Its around Christmas time and my girl is all depressed because she is missing her father for Christmas so I buy her a plane ticket there are back round-trip. While she was back visiting her father we talked everyday and once she flys back I go all out buy her a card, some roses, chocolates you know all the good stuff! I still never said I love you to her, but having her leave for the 2 weeks opens my eyes even more and I finally tell her I love her she says she love me. We're in love! Skip forward. We get married, have a child. Jump another year. Now our child is now 1 year. The covid breaks out I lose my job. (Furloughed) huge stresser! We begin fighting not everyday, but every other day. Get into a huge argument we both were yelling and fighting go to bed early just a huge fight the worst I've seen. I wake up early and notice her phone was just blown up all type of messages from SC, reddit,emails,texts. We have a close relationship that we know each others phone passwords (haha funny facts it was my wife's idea to learn each other's passwords) so I unlock her phone and I snoop I admit its wrong, but she's my wife and I have no problem letting her go through my phone. I begin looking at her texts all seems find. SC was good to nothing suspicious. Her reddit was clean even! I start feeling like shit because I haven't found anything guilty! I deside to just check her emails and what I found shocked me! I could not believe what I was seeing emails dating waaayy before we we're dating, while we're dating. Naughty pics were being exchanged, emails talking about being a sugar baby and her talking to her sugar daddy.... addresses being exchanged.....thank you and can wait to meet up next time..... What I was reading I couldn't believe!?!? I become enraged! I wanted to just yell at her and wake her up, but I don't. I waited until she wakes then I drop the fucking bomb on her baby! I asked her as calm as I could who was the guy she was emailing and what the fuck! Is this sugar baby bullshit about!? This man was sending her money!? She denied it. I call her out denied again. I ask her one last time rack your brain and try to remember because I've gone through your phone so come clean now! Or I'm going to leave. She finally comes clean and tells me she cheated on me with a co-worker when we had our first break for 3 weeks. Mind you I had no idea this had happened! I start to freak out tell her to think again because that's not the answer I'm looking for im talking about the emails! She admitted to sleeping with her old fuck buddy back at her father's house and I had no idea! I told her welp! Wrong answer again! Now think very hard! Who is this sugar daddy guy! She finally remembered and says she only send him videos and pictures.... I personally can't believe anything she says now. I feel trapped in this marriage now because I don't want my daughter to grow up in a split home you know? Please what should I do? I've never been in a serious relationship with anyone like this before, but I feel so betrayed! Our whole marriage has been a lie because she fucked her old fuck buddy before we even got married... I feel played and used! Should I take her back or break the marriage and go our separate ways? I dunno, I'm deeply confused! Oh and her reasoning for cheating on me with her old fuck buddy was she ""wanted to feel wanted"" I told her, you have enough courage to call your old FWB up to come over and FUCK! But don't have the courage to tell your bf at the time you're feeling like you need to be wanted?!? I dunno I feel all of her excuses hold no water! I'm hurt and don't know what to do?! Should I stay and try and save our marriage or just leave because I feel like that's what u should do! But I don't wanna destroy my daughter life, she's so young right now. I don't know what to do?

I'm so scared of losing him since he literally saved my life. My birth father was virbully and sometimes physically abusive and I know for sure he would have killed me one day. I have known my stepdad since I was around 7 and I am now 21 and I really can't do this. The tumor/cancer is on his kidney as of witch he only has 1 and depend on how much kidney They have to remove he could lose his entire kidney and be on dialysis until he gets a new kidney but it's also a massive possibility he could die on the table and I don't know if I can handle that,26May2020,1
602,"I'm a 19 year old female who lives with my parents. 
My grandfather recently died and I've never seen my dad so vulnerable and upset. When he cries he wants to be alone and tries to push us away (even though I still hug him and try to be there for him)

They are both alcoholics and can't handle their drink. They argue almost every night and there's a history of abuse. 
But lately my dad becomes even sadder and my mother argumentative. She's been absolutely torturing him since the night grandad died and hasn't shown any sympathy.
She dismisses him when he pushes her away and talks about her own fathers passing and makes it a competition of whose grief is worse. She shouts at him for spending too much time up at his family home as she hates his family. 

She's been incredibly immature and disappointing during this time and I'm worried about my dad but I don't know what to do.

My brother visited last night and witnessed them both drunk and in action. My dad burst into tears and went to bed and my brother sat my mother down for 2 hours telling her she needs to stop drinking and support him during this time but throughout she was incredibly defensive and either turned it around on us or guilt tripped us. It was fucking enraging and he wasted his time. 
He eventually gave up and walked out at 4am. 

I've never seen my 32 year old brother cry, but it's a hopeless situation. He wants to try and get them counselling but he can't talk to my dad for weeks about it as he's grieving. He doesn't know what to do either.

They can't split, my dad needs someone there for him more than ever at this time, and they'd both be lost without eachother if they divorced.
They've been told before they need to stop drinking by a worker but that lasted 2 weeks. And they don't believe in therapy. 
They're good kind people but between the drink and bitterness between them, everything has been sour for over 20 years. 

I'm seriously regretting staying for college in my hometown knowing I'll have to deal with all this for the next 4 years. Ive tried for over 2 years to get a part time job but nowhere will take me so I have no money to move out.
It feels like everyone else is beginning their lives and going to experience more while I'm stuck her dealing with the same shit for the last 19 years. 
Though I guess at least I can look after my dad now and make sure they don't kill themselves or eachother.",26May2020,1

606,"I have a supervisor who will word her questions like: “How come you didn’t do (insert task here)?” before checking to see if I actually did the task. 

If I did the task before she asked about it, she doesn’t say anything and walks away. If I didn’t do the task yet, then she pulls me into her office to gaslight me about how she “shouldn’t have to” remind me to do my work, and threatening to fire me.

Or, she would ask me a question like: “Someone told me that you did (insert act here). Why did you do that?” Then when I would ask her who “Someone” is, she would always retort with: “I can’t say.” When I ask her for evidence that I did this action she’s trying to accuse me of doing, she deflects my point and accuses me of “wanting to go there.”

607,"Hi everyone! Some back story, my partner (23) was in hospital 2-3 weeks ago for a psychotic break, and was  readmitted a couple of days ago. Their delusions were really bad the first time around, but they're not as bad this time. Of course, they're very bored in the hospital. Before they were readmitted, they had a hard time with some of the more complicated TV shows. Some shows freak them out or overwork their brain in an attempt to break down the meaning behind everything (a big part of their psychosis is finding meaning and reading between the lines of EVERYTHING). 

I'm looking for some shows and movies that are easy to watch. Something that isn't overwhelming or complex. Some educational shows like Planet Earth may be good, but could get boring after a while.

If you or someone you know has experienced this and you can remember what shows or movies they may have watched, that would be amazing!

608,"I don't want to cause any problems, but I would also like to celebrate my wedding anniversary. It was a big big struggle for us to get to the point of marriage so that day is important to me. We were engaged for 5 years. Last year our first anniversary was spent focused on my husband's nephew being born, on June 30th so we didn't get to celebrate. No big deal. 

There is some weirdness surrounding the situation. Maybe I'm looking too much into it and it's just a coincidence.

The thing with that is my husband's brother and sister-in law picked the same day as our wedding anniversary to have their child.  The baby's due date was not for over a week after, on July 10th. They decided to schedule the baby to be induced on the 30th before, for no health reason whatsoever. My husband, who is a physician said it was actually a risk for them to have the baby induced at that point so we're confused on why they pushed. I get that my husband and I's wedding anniversary is only important to us, but everyone knew it was our anniversary and it was awkward because people kept bringing it up.

My husband's mom was saying before ""wouldn't it be cool if the baby was born on the same day as your wedding anniversary"" so that was kind of weird. When I went in to visit my husband's sister in law in the hospital to say congratulations the first thing she said to me was ""I'm so sorry for stealing your thunder"". Which I thought was weird too. I don't know her very well as she didn't go out with my husband's brother for only a few months before they got pregnant and had a shot gun wedding.

A few weeks later we went to visit the baby at their home and they told us they picked June 30th to have the baby. I asked what made them pick that day and they shrugged. It wasn't like their regular doctor only had that time slot. They actually had a doctor they never met before deliver the baby. Didn't have a reason other than it was a Saturday and they liked the date (there would have been another Saturday before her actual due date so...). Ok fair enough I suppose. 

Aside from that, would it be rude of my husband and I to celebrate our wedding anniversary and make plans, or should we check with my husband's brother and sister in law first to see what they are doing?",26May2020,1

614,"So a little context for you; I work in a factory and generally if you are going to be even a minute late to work you are better off just coming in at lunch time. Well I decided to come into work at around our first break which is two hours into work. I was going to talk to the management and see if I could allocate some of my vacation time for those two hours I missed so I wouldn't get in trouble. Well I was talking with some of my co-workers who were on lunch and one of them told me that the vacation book was already full so I wouldn't be able to do that. He said you can either just go home and deal with the consequences when you come back of missing a day without an excuse or you can tell them you thought you had contracted Covid-19 and take a test and come back in 2 days. Well being the idiot that I am I decided to do the latter. I thought it would've been easy to take one of those drive-thru tests and just be like ""I didn't have it so I can come back to work the next day.""

I have worked retail/consumer oriented jobs previously and looking back, i found them far more enjoyable then what I do now. The changes from day to day, socializing with people/customers (even if they weren’t great all the time), a steady stream of tasks that I needed to accomplish, and not feeling like I’m chained down by it were wonderful!

624,"So I admit I'm probably in the wrong but I just want to see what I should do. I'll try to condense it. Please don't be too harsh, thanks.

We started talking about YouTube. She mentioned watching a YouTuber who had twins. I asked who it was because I wanted to see if I do/did watch them. Or find someone new to watch etc. She said the YouTuber (I'm going to keep it private) and she mentioned seeing their vlogs with the kids which sparked our conversation. I said that I thought that you shouldn't vlog your babies/kids and she said it doesn't matter because the parents could give consent for them. I said that I felt like it didn't make it right. She said its okay until their old enough, and said that I didn't have to put my kids on YouTube. I said that I wouldn't want baby videos going around with millions of views. She said that no one was forcing me to put my kids on YouTube. (We're talking hypothetical kids, we're both 14 and without kids.) I again said that I personally didn't think it was okay. She said it was the parents choice and I should let them do what they want. I said okay, but I didn't think it was a good choice.

She said that plenty of people put their kids on YouTube for memories and asked why I wasn't okay with it. I said that that stuff should be kept for family and friends, not spread to these people's millions of followers. She said that it's still the parents choice and I wouldn't have to do it. I said it wasn't right for the kids because they didn't have a choice cause they're like one. I also said it was similar to slavery (which I regret but I somewhat stand by.) She said I took it too far and they weren't similar at all. I said that it wasn't right because the baby couldn't say if or when they wanted to be on camera and therefore, wasn't fair to them.

She again said that it's the parents choice and I wouldn't have to do that. I said they should wait until the kids are old enough to make that decision. She brought up vaccines saying that with my logic we shouldn't give kids vaccines until they can give consent to that. I disagreed because giving your kid a possibly life saving vaccine is nothing like possibly letting your child get bullied because of embarrassing of them on the internet. She asked if I thought that these channels are just exploiting their kids for views and said that vaccines should also be a parent choice. I said yes to the exploiting and asked if she'd seen how many views those videos have. She said that no one was forcing me too do it and I shouldn't disagree with what parents choose for their kids. I blocked her because I was pretty annoyed, so I thought I'd talk to her once I'd calmed down and we'd just move on.

She texted me on a chat with other people asking in a very rude way why I'd blocked her and said it must have been a mistake because she had only been stating her opinion. I told her that I was cooling down, and said that I was a little bit upset with her logic, not with her opinion. I said that I just needed a few hours. She said she was confused. I asked her to respect the reason that the chat was there and to stop texting me. She said that she knows that but doesn't understand how she's supposed to talk with me if I blocked her all the time. I said that I asked for some space so she shouldn't be texting me. She said that I should've just told her and not blocked her. I said that I wanted to make sure that I didn't say anything that I would regret and asked her to stop texting me on a chat that wasn't meant for that. She said I should stop blocking her so that she wouldn't have too. I told her no and said that I would unblock her when I was feeling better. She said that I never asked for space and I'm always blowing up. She said if I wanted space I would have all the time in the world because she didn't want to talk to me.

I emailed her about an hour later but this post is already ridiculously long so I won't bore you with the details. We're talking currently but I'm not sure how long it'll last. What should I do?

625,"**** So my long friend (who is a girl) who I’ve known since she was 3, (2 years apart) got married when she was 19-20 yrs old to the son of pastor who is pretty damn slow and lifeless generally speaking (probably being bias), she’s filled with fire, passion and I grew up with her in the early days.
^^^^ She got real fit through out school and was real shallow and hang out with black dudes. She would never do anything, just flirt and lead guys on.  (we went to school together) then we kinda went our separate ways, she loved “god” (complete airhead) and I would rather find out who the fuck I want to be. (In the timeframe of leaving school) Now we just caught up at her dads birthday and she wants to go on walks with me around some nice beaches, (never wanted to do that shit with me).

Am I reading too much into this?
I feel like we have unresolved sexual tension and I could feel that we were reconnecting at the party. 
Shes married remember...I don’t really respect the guy tbh, he’s nice and all but he has no balls, doesn’t speak up, and is very dumb. 

Am I being selfish because I’ve been lonely the past year or so? 

Do we owe it to each other to explore a potential relationship?

I feel like I want to do this, it feels right, I’ve had such a hole in my life and when we were talking I felt normal again.

Rest the people who manage that place sees to it. I was emotionally broken to see them and their plight . And then came a question in my mind. What is the real meaning of life?

631,"So there is a lot of backstory to this but I'll try to simplify this. I have told my therapist I am ending our sessions together, and she is saying I'm doing it to avoid trauma. The issue is, I've thought about this for several weeks, and the reason isn't trauma avoidance. She has been trying to convert me to Christianity for several weeks.  Bragging about how great and open the religion is. All of those sessions where she asked about spirituality could've been about trauma work. If she was so concerned about me avoiding my trauma, why didn't she mention it during one of the many sessions when I said ""I don't have anything to say."" I'm very annoyed by this, and this is a small snippet of issues. Should I go to a final wrap up session, or just say ""I'm done."" She's been good to me for years but it's time I move on. She also suggested that she could find me a new therapist and if I signed a HIPPA form she could give the therapist a brief summary. I'm not sure how I feel about this. I would call her out, but I still care for her as she has been helpful many times in the past.

I have a fairly good social circle (15-16 good friends and by good i mean i can call them whenever and count on them to discuss my problems) and I see people in my workplace and many others who have very few friends but weren't always like that. They got married and they keep claiming that marriage makes you lose friends.

The common reason i hear is: 

1. You dont have time for people
2. You grow out differently

634,"I have been trying to recover from anorexia for about a year now.

 I never received treatment. During my recovery, my mother has been emotionally and verbally abusive to me, and always denied the existence of my disorder. She told family friends (after I confided in them) not to listen to me because I was ""copying"" well-known celebrities and people that I knew to try and get attention. 

A few months ago, I got really upset and couldn't take it anymore because I was trying so hard not to relapse but it didn't seem to matter to anyone if I did. I started cutting myself on my stomach and thighs, and my mother still does not know about it. 

I don't think that anyone will care if I just relapse again, even my mother; she wouldn't care if I died. I am having panic attacks nearly every day because I think that I'm gaining weight again, but she thinks it's hilarious. She laughs at me and calls me fat because she knows it hurts and when I start crying I get punished. She makes me run when she knows my vision is blacking out because I haven't eaten anything in days sometimes, I feel like there's no hope for me. 

My father is not in the picture. Due to an unfortunate family situation, if I moved away from my mother for any reason, I would most likely be put in foster care because my father doesn't want me. 

I've been trying so hard not to relapse but I feel like it's not worth it. I don't even feel like I am recovering because my emotional state hasn't changed at all, and I'm all alone.

Whether I should stick it out at least till tryouts and see how I feel then possibly wasting my summer. Or quit and feel shitty about that. Maybe come back sophomore year to see whether I want to play, but that would make it a lot harder to get an in with the coach and team to yet play time.

They started off right when we moved in that my boyfriend wasn’t welcome to stay the night unless it’s by their terms. They walk in on me in the bathroom. They leave the whole apartment a mess even though both of them are not working due to covid. Someone keeps coming in my room but I didn’t have proof besides some things oddly being moved. Well today I came back from my boyfriends and my dogs urn that was in the living room was in my bedroom. I have told them more than probably 10 times that I don’t want them in my room without permission. And they always tell me they weren’t in there and they basically call me crazy. I’m not sure what to do. I don’t like people in my room or going through my stuff. I ordered a camera on amazon and I’m not going to tell them about it. I think I will then take the video/s of them in my room room and go to the apartment complex and tell them that I want to break my lease. Has anyone else ran Into this problem?

643,"So I (m 16) absolutely dispice school and hate going there, I dont get bullied or anything but the whole schoolsystem just pisses me off. I'm a terrible student even tho I do one of the highest difficulty in school (The Dutch school system is weird and I dont really know how to explain it) I really feel like I've waste more then half of my live on school, which also makes me more demotivated to do school work. I am a quick learner on many subjects outside school but I really struggle with learning for tests (partially because of dyslexia)and I'm just getting by with just high enough grades by using logic reasoning and educated guessing when taking a test. 

When I go home from school I am tired and not motivated to do anything on school related matters. in previous years I studied a bunch but it basically never paid off (except for maybe math) so now I study less and less for tests since it doesnt really make a difference amyway. 

On the other side tho, I am highly highly motivated when talking about sports, and businesses. Not long ago I launched a web development business and got my first client pretty quickly, that job earned me €450 (about $475) And I wish I could pump all my time in that. Which I cant because of school unfortunatly.

I still need to do 2 years of school if I can even make it this year.
Do you guys have any advice on how I can balance school and business or other stuff. And any advice on how I'ill get by in school more easily?

fyi: porn is highly prohibited in islam and my mom is a strict believer 

anyways i decided to tell my mom about it and she wasn’t happy about it but it’s not that she was that mad because my mom knows my dad is like that

since almost two weeks i think my dad is getting notifications from his calendar that say ‘hey sexy..’ or ‘a message from betty’ or something with hot girls

and about two days ago i saw my dad scrolling on his phone checking out women profiles and i lost it but i didn’t say or do anything so he wouldn’t notice 

i hope this is all a misunderstanding but i just cant get it out of my head 
i told one online friend about this as he could tell something is wrong with me. it’s really bothering me a lot. he told me to tell her straight away but im too scared they might get a divorce as my mom told me once they probably wouldn’t be together anymore if they hadn’t had me and my siblings 

i cant take my dad seriously anymore and i always talk really disrespectful to him. im trying not to but it’s too hard for me.

655,"She's (F23) currently going through a breakup and she's in a really bad place right now. Important to point out, she has BPD, which makes things even worse. A few days ago she texted me casually mentioning that she tried to kill herself, she wrote a suicide note, overdosed herself with pills and passed out. The only reason she survived was that she called her BF prior before doing so, he managed to get to her in time and call an ambulance. Basically, I'm the only person left that she keeps contact with regularly, but the problem is, we live 1500km apart. So I can't physically be there for her and my only way of being there is through texts and calls. 

She's constantly having mental breakdowns and cries for hours. She's been living in this mode for the majority of time that I've known her, which is 3 years, but it wasn't as bad as it is now. She did confess to me that during moments like these she does have suicidal thoughts and harms herself, so it's not something new. And she feels sad not because of breaking up with this particular person, but because of breaking up in general. She's afraid of being alone and abandoned, she can't live without human connection. She takes medications, but she doesn't want to go to therapy, she didn't even tell her parents about what she's going through. 

I'm not a psychotherapist, I'm not qualified to give her advice, so the best thing I can do is to listen and try to cheer her up. Problem is, I can't listen if she doesn't want to communicate with me about her feelings. She avoids my calls and immediately changes the subject if I try to talk about her ""episodes"". And I'm not good at cheering up either. Coming from my own experience, saying things like ""it's gonna be alright"" or ""cheer up"" doesn't do jack shit. In these moments I don't want to ""cheer up"", I just want to be left alone and be sad. So my only way to help her is to try to distract her from negative thoughts with casual conversations, but that doesn't last long. 

So, what do I do? She doesn't want to talk to me about her situation, she doesn't want to go to therapy, she just wants to be left alone and when she doesn't, she acts like everything is fine.",26May2020,1

Hi all, I would really appreciate any and all opinions on my question. I recently (within the last few days) took a final online - the answers were posted to a popular answer website and I looked at them. The next day the prof said he was looking into it and would do everything he could to make sure anybody who cheated with that website was caught. I understandably became very anxious. 

I’m asking this today because I am really at a loss of what to do. I could take my chances and hope they don’t catch me (the class is very large, the account is not linked to my name in any way) or I could tell the prof. I’ve been thinking a lot about the situation and feel like maybe it would be better to tell him I looked at the chegg answers before I am ever actually “caught”. Some information I would include in the email as an explanation (obviously not an excuse, I know what I did): 

My family and I had experienced a massive flood of our house a few days prior to the exam which put me at a large disadvantage in terms of time to prepare - the exam could not be moved back at all to accommodate. Since moving back home for quarantine, my depression has gotten much worse and my family is not sympathetic to mental health issues - this has made it extremely hard for me to study and feel motivated to do well in school. Furthermore, my parents accept nothing less than an A and did not allow me to take my classes pass/fail, which I think would have been good for my mental health. In combination with home issues, I had not cheated on the previous test I had taken in this class and did much worse than I usually do - it was very obvious that many people had cheated looking at the grade distribution (but the prof did not look into cheating). This was frustrating as it showed me that I would not be able to do well without cheating to keep up with my peers. Finally, on the day of and during the test I received texts from multiple people telling me that someone had posted the answers on the website and everyone was looking at them. Basically, I felt immense pressure to do well and have been shown in this class and others that cheating is the only way to get to the top.


With about 15 minutes left in my time for the test, I was about done and had come up with answers all on my own from my notes (it was an open-note test, not open internet). When I continued to receive those texts about cheating, I broke and I went on the answer website to check my answers. The worst part about all of it was that my answers were correct and I had no need to even look at the website. I had a few answers that didn’t match the ones I saw online but I didn’t even change them. I feel so stupid for doing this for no reason at all. I regretted my actions immediately and I still wish I could take them back.

So that’s where I am, do I tell the prof? I have come to an understanding that cheating on a test has much greater implications that could affect getting a job or continuing education in the future. I’m so scared that this will ruin everything I’ve worked so hard for and its frustrating to think it could all be destroyed because of this stupid mistake I made. This is my first (and will be my only) cheating offense and I want to handle it as well as I can. Again, I will appreciate any and all advice/opinions.",26May2020,1
659,"One of my best friends constantly tells me how attractive my girlfriends best friend/roommate is, so when she posted a picture in her bathing suit, I DMd it to him on Instagram thinking it’s not a big deal.

Fast forward to yesterday when I let my girlfriend borrow my laptop for work (she is working for home) and I was logged in to Instagram on it. She noticed this and went through my DMs to find the picture of her roommate that I sent to my buddy. 

Personally, I don’t think this is a big deal. She is really upset about it and told me it makes her feel insecure. I tried to explain to her that we are just guys and there is nothing more to the situation. I don’t really know how to handle it, and I am trying my best to be understanding of her feelings. Is she making this a bigger deal than it is and how should I handle this situation?",26May2020,1

662,So about a month ago today my mom found out about a 2 year long affair my dad had with a co worker of his. My mom is a mess my dad has kind of just disappeared and everyone is under a lot of stress. He has recently gotten in contact with my oldest brother but is pinning the reason he had the affair on my mom claiming that after us kids were born he was treated as a second class citizen in his own home. I(14M) have grown very attached to my siblings(16F/18F/20M) I get anxious when I'm not around them. I am almost always in an room with one of them and I'm normally sitting next to them or leaning into them. Just today when I woke up while I was waiting for breakfast to be made I was leaning on my 16F sister shoulder. My brother is a twitch streamer that gets a decent amount of viewers a stream and he does it for a job I almost always have it on as background noise now. It just comforts me. I know this is extremely unhealthy and I want to stop it now before it gets any worse but I get legitimate anxiety attacks without being in the presence of either my siblings or my mom. I'm also the youngest if that helps with the advice at all. My siblings don't seem to mind it now because they know we are all going through a hard time with all of this.,26May2020,1

664,"Hey all,

So just recently, I’ve been suspicious of the strange “grassy” smells coming from my brothers room every now and then. Just today, I basically busted into his room and caught him taking what seemed to be a brownie out of a bag. The smell was enough to conclude he had been using cannabis. Now don’t get me wrong, I straight away told him that if he was 18 or over, I wouldn’t have cared. But the fact that he’s so young and is using drugs is just something else. I use cannabis myself and know well enough. He claimed he used it mainly for sleep purposes but I need a way to encourage him to stop taking it all together. Is there anything I can do?

In regard to his performance in school, i’d say average. He’s smart, but he hasn’t been doing his school work recently and doesn’t really do any exercise. Plus, i’m fairly certain his friends are all bad influences if anything.",26May2020,1
665,"I’m 25 years old and my mom is 57. I am so attached to her and love her more than anything on this planet. 

She’s been an an everyday drinker for years, and over the last few years she’s gotten steadily more sick, but would refuse to go to the hospital. Finally over the past 6 months she’s had trouble keeping food down, losing weight and bad stomach pains started happening. She still wouldn’t go to hospital, until about 2 weeks ago I guess the pain was so bad she called 911 and she’s been in the hospital since. 

I am the next of kin as my parents broke up. She’s been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and her kidneys are failing. She’ll be undergoing dialysis treatment in the next few days but it’s not looking very promising.

This is so painful for me. I’ve been bawling my eyes out and just thinking about how much I will miss her, I never thought I would have to go through this at such a young age. She’s such a beautiful human and all I wanted was for her to grow old healthily and be able to take her on trips and introduce her to my family and her grandkids eventually. 

The world feels so cold and empty without her right now. She’s hardly conscious so I can’t even speak to her on the phone or visit her in hospital because of covid-19. 

Any advice, insight or support on this sort of situation would be great to hear right now. I never thought this would be how things turned out",26May2020,1
666,"She added me on Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat and always acts like we're friends.. We are both 24 years old and we both have the same position at work. She started working there about 5 months before I started so she hasn't been there much longer than me. I have previous experience in our field and she does not. Anyways, she acts like she's my friend which I don't really care to be friends with her anyways, but then during work hours she's VERY passive aggressive with me and is honestly pretty rude in her tone. She's constantly telling me how to do things and she makes sure to do it over email also so everyone can see it. She takes advantage of the fact that she has my phone number and will constantly text me to tell me what I did ""wrong"" according to her at work. She even did this when she knew I was on vacation and texted me about work stuff and being an asshole to me, which upset me to no end since it wasn't even urgent to tell me this. I never do this to her or anyone else and from what I can tell she doesn't do this to anyone else we work with. It's almost like she gets kicks out of making me feel smaller than her. I ignore it for the most part and I do accept criticism as long as it's respectful and nice but she doesn't seem to be trying to help me, just make me feel bad by the way she talks to me. The thing that bothers me the most is I am ALWAYS nice to her and everyone I work with. I can't bring this up with our manager because first off, I don't want drama or for anyone to hate me and also my manager and her act like they're best friends so I don't think anything will really come of it. I just kind of want a way to deal with her in a non confrontational way that will make it clear I don't care about her input or ""friendship"" without causing a big deal.",26May2020,1
667,"17M. I am currently a junior in high school and I'm far behind in my online work. For the first few weeks of quarantine back in late March, I did absolutely zero work, and my grades were about to go downhill. I started making plans to just drop out after my 18th birthday in December because I didn't think there would be any way to get out of this and I should just try to make money and move on.

But I ended up having extreme anxiety about the course of my future, so I contacted my counselor. She told me that it's ok to not do all the assignments, that I just needed to work on whatever I could and not freak out because this is a hard time. The new grading system is an A if you do something (or check in with teachers) or an incomplete in ""rare circumstances"". I took this as an excuse to keep doing nothing, because I figured many other students wouldn't have done anything when we return in fall.

But I did a little work anyway. I did one civics assignment and one art assignment over the month of May. There's a large art project coming up as a final for the year and I'm not sure if I'll do it yet.

I've pretty much let coding class go down the shitter because a few weeks without class made all my knowledge of Python vanish instantly. But I'm mostly concerned about architecture now.

The architecture work started right as quarantine did, and I've done none of it. I told my teacher I was doing other things and he said that's fine, but I should try to do the work anyway. Those assignments ended a few weeks ago, probably the end of that class for the year. I don't really want to fail, but I'm going to fail so many other classes it probably doesn't matter. It seems kinda odd and retroactive to do that work now.

I'm afraid I'll fail high school and get a bunch of the rare ""incomplete"" grades (which are very vague, they don't elaborate on the amount of work that needs to be done). So should I try to do all 8 or so architecture assignments or do the art final and at least make sure I pass that class? Or is dropping our and starting a business a better idea altogether?",26May2020,1
668,"I’m in my mid 20s, and aside from a couple dates here and there, I’ve never had my first kiss or romantic relationship. Even though the guys I’ve gone on dates with were super nice, the whole time I would feel awkward and uncomfortable (especially if they would want to walk/sit closer to me, hinting they’d like a kiss, etc). I figured I didn’t want to be in a relationship initially because I don’t like sharing more than I need to about my life (mainly concerning bullying and dark mental eras in my life); but those dates showed I don’t like being touched by or close to anyone at all, not even when getting hugs from my parents or friends. My skins just prickles being close to someone I know. On top of that, even though I have awesome friends, I’ll instinctually avoid texting/talking to them or making eye contact, even though they’ve done nothing to me for me to justify this (I just always thought it’s common for introverts). At this point in my life, I’m fine with possibly never having a boyfriend/husband or a close group of friends, but this scares my family, the thought of me being alone forever.

671,"It's always been a habit but I wouldn't really describe it as an entitlement to being independent, but to put it in simple terms; I don't know how to ask for help at all. Whether it's related to emotional baggage, education or asking for simple advice, I cannot bring myself to ask others without feeling this intense shiver down my spine or almost like this grab for my breathing that begins to hold it back and make it really difficult.
I'd say it's definitely more emotional baggage and education instead of the simple advice; with the simple advice I've made baby steps to breaking the shell of getting simple advice and it's been going well and helping a lot. With the other 2 it's been a heck of a wall to break and it's still not even close to being broken.

Whenever I'm really going through it emotionally, my boyfriend has been the most supportive and adorable human being to ever catch me when I'm falling. The thing is whenever he's catching me or supporting me through my worst, it's been weeks or even months; he emphasises how he's always there for me and he never wants me to bottle up because he doesn't want me to hurt or feel pain, he's a real sweetheart; but I still cannot help myself or bring myself to reach out to him when I'm going through it until weeks later. It's not just him either, it's my parents, older siblings, professional, anyone. It's no one's issue but my own and idk how to fix it

The education thing is throughout my whole schooling experience I never really sat down with teachers to figure out what I could do with my work to make it better, I was sorta lucky to have a natural hand in passing with average/above average standards but there were definitely moments where I wanted help but I felt held back when it came to asking for extra help.

This is currently happening a heck of a lot more with my first year of university and the Coronavirus especially. I was accepted into my dream degree to study and I was beyond excited to begin, and something happened. I quickly realised how much university isn't high school and the transition was absolutely nerve wrecking that it sent me into a sorta whack feeling: numb? Shock? Fear? I cannot quite describe it. But the sudden state of the pandemic hasn't at all helped and I've been cooped in my room with the biggest motivational struggle to open my laptop out of feel because I've fallen weeks behind in the first semester and I'm risking failing/definitely failing at this point, and no one around me besides the university knows. Not my boyfriend, my friends, my parents. No one.

This is the biggest mess I've gotten myself into and I'm absolutely terrified whilst typing this but I have reached a breaking point and it's the middle of the night where I am and I can't talk to anyone. Help, I don't know what to do and I'm terrified",26May2020,1
672,"I live in Mass. My landlord let me move into an apartment for 400 a month. I have been here for two years. There is no written agreement,. When he found out I had a boyfriend who spent 3 nights a week (10pm to 5am when he leaves for work) he tried raising this to 800. When I refused to pay the upcharge, he backed off about it a little but said it's best if I leave because he's going bankrupt. He also is asking me to hurry up because he has a friend that wants to move in... 

I am now looking for a place actively, but its almost impossible because of my pets, and now I worry he can reprimand me or have me removed for staying and withholding rent  to save for a new place. I am starting to withhold in June because of Corona pay issues, and because the attic I have access to has millions of 3 inch rusted nails from them makeshifting the roof fixes, and the entire floor is crumbling... boards falling through structure, etc, and there are separate apartments below this attic that other people live in.

673,"So this happened while I was at work a few days ago. I'm a healthcare worker in a large urban centre. At around 7 pm that day, a colleague and I were walking outside right next to the hospital to pick up our team dinner order from a nearby food place. We are both women in our mid-late 20s. We were wearing regular street clothes and our hospital IDs on a lanyard. There were two girls - maybe late teens/early 20s who were walking in the opposite direction. I noticed their walking trajectory was coming kind of close to us so tried to shift to avoid bumping shoulders but the girl closest to me made no effort to swerve and ended up ""shoulder checking"" me.

I turned around, surprised at how hard the impact was and I think I muttered “ouch” or “what the..” under my breath. By then she’s maybe 10 steps further. Then she turns around too. I go “are you ok?” trying to sound neutral because I have no clue what is going on. Right away she goes “WTF ARE YOU LOOKING AT? WHAT DID YOU TURN AROUND FOR BITCH YOU WANNA FIGHT”

She then runs back to me and gets RIGHT UP in my face. She's flicking my hair out of my face and throwing her purse on the floor and lunging at me, shouting at me “WHAT YOU WANNA FIGHT”. I'm honestly at a loss for words by then and just try to keep a safe distance so I extend my hand going ""please stand back from me"". Her friend is trying to hold her back too and I hear her go ""She just asked if you were ok! Stop!"" 

She's still not backing down, so by then I’m thinking “How much karate do I remember from when I was 7?"". I'm still with my hand extended to keep her at a distance, getting ready to be attacked/defend myself. My colleague is also trying to defuse the situation. Then her friend who’s trying to hold her back points out my badge and goes “Stop she's a hospital worker!"" and that seems to mellow her a bit. 

At this point we just begin backing away and leave while she’s still shouting and being held back by her friend. 

I honestly have no clue why this happened as I was walking down the street minding my own business. My colleague seems to think the ""shoulder bump"" was actually intentional and that she was looking for a fight but I honestly do not understand what the reasoning is here. My SO also suggested this could've been a way to mug us/get something out of us if a fight does ensue and my phone or wallet falls to the ground (it's happened to him). 

Any theories as to why this happened would be great to help me understand. Is it something about what I did? Is it because I turned around? My co-worker seemed to think the shoulder bump was intentional. Was she trying to prove something? Why did it matter that I was a healthcare worker? 

TL:DR - was walking down the street minding my own business, someone bumped into me seemingly intentionally then got in my face as if looking for a fight. Trying to understand why.",26May2020,1

But talking to my therapist before lockdown she told me I shouldn't let that happen because it's bad for me, so the last few times my parents fought or someone was mad at someone else I tried to reasonably tell them that if they're angry they should try to sort things out with them because there's nothing I can do about it and I don't like them yelling at me for things I didn't do and I can't solve, and it has happened to me three times so far but still they won't listen and keep throwing their tantrums at me. Now I'm just stuck here and I'm really stressed because of so many other things and it really makes me feel awful. Also my bedroom door doesn't close so I can't really have some me time to cry or call a friend and I feel like I'm going to explode.

When we went on a vacation she always commanded my father behind the wheel and behaved like an unsatisfied boss to him. When I told her that I don't want to pursue a career she chose for me she yelled at me called me calling me names and stuff.

She is not always like that though. She can be nice. She always cared that I was happy when it was my birthday or Christmas and gave me pretty presents but I grew really cold towards her because on the emotional side she is very lacking and can be really abusive verbally. But she was not always like that. I wonder if MY emotional coldness did play a role in this (I suffer from depression which makes it hard for me to connect with people). But then again, my older sister also had a bad relationship with her when she lived with us. They were fighting quite often. I remember how my mom would open the doors of her room repeatedly when they argued and screamed at each other.

It is interesting that while my sister was at home me and my mother rarely had an argument. But after she left she refocused her frustrations at me.

I feel kinda guilty because she can be nice but she is a very frustrated and angry person. She also went through some shit with her ex-husband. And I feel like the ungrateful child because I live with her basically for free. 

But in the past, I paid for rent. I stopped because she told me that she will not support me financially during my studies so I was saving up for myself. I find that unfair that I had to pay her because my younger sister had barely worked in her life and my mom never wanted a penny from her. But I had to pay her.

The rant went on for a good 5 minutes until i said "" Can you stop yelling? Its really bloody loud"". She then went on about how its her right as a parent and all that, then i sarcastically mentioned one of her friends and asked whether she thought she yelled at her son like that.

I went to sleep and at 8:00 in the morning, my dad wakes me up and tells me i have to leave the house so i can see how the other kids have it.

So my 15 year old self left the house, and skateboarded to random places in town. It was getting really hot and at the peak it was like 35C outside, or 95F (I'm in Canada), so i was getting really sunburned. I linked with a couple of my friends, which was special for me because my parents never let me hang out with any of those nasty ""Un-Christian"" kids. I told my best friend at the start of this wonderful excursion that i would meet him at some point, but my phone died halfway to his house after saying goodbye to my other friends. I got super lost because of my lousy sense of direction, and was almost passing out because of the sun/heat/thirst (I know it sounds dramatic), but then this random skateboarder guy offered to take me to his house to get some water, which was lit, he actually made bacon and gave me some which was hilarious. He also offered me free shrooms as well, kinda funny. He said he didn't have anything better to do so he used the GPS on his phone to bring me all the way to my friends house. I hung out with him and his friends at the park and talked about the situation, charged my phone with a portable charger, and then later that night my mom texts me at 10 telling me to text her my location so she can pick me up. She then screamed at me for the majority of the ride home, and my dad didn't say anything at all.

682,"My cat has been having very bad breathing and his condition got worse. I took him to vet a few days ago and he was feelling better due to the cortisone they gave him. 

Today his condition got worse and his breathing is very bad he is in dying condition. I was going to take him to be put to sleep but after seeing how bad the condition is I dont think he could resist the car on this very hot day or the stress before the injection due how weak his breathing is. Of course there is always the chance he could make the trip but panic at the vet.

I thought they could put him to sleep at home but probably due to covid since its a medical act the clinic does not do it, when I called the vet thats what they told me. The one clinic I found will only start doing at home in June 1st.

Taking the risk could have him die on the trip or before injection but also dying at home, but in familiar place, could be more painful than that other option.

My parents advised to just let him pass away at home but it could be more painful but could also be painful the risk of him dying in the car or due to panic at vet. This is causing a big confusion in my head.

What should i do ? Is it cruel to let him pass at home? Or cruel to stress him out and maybe have him pass away in car or before inject ? Or take those risks? Its just that his breathing is really really bad but he stills reacts to people and breathing if a lot of people or even me are around me. I just really wished they could do it at home and not have to think of these risks. What would you do?",26May2020,1
683,"I don't know if I'd actually do this, but is there any advice for if I were to? He does have autism, but he is a very smart kid and I know he can do more than his teachers are letting him.

My little brother is about to go to 7th grade and I realized he hasn't learned anything new since we moved to this new state. He learned this stuff back in 4th grade, but is being retaught in 6th grade. He isn't memorizing anything and I don't know what to do. I realized how they are barely teaching him through this distance learning.

He never got homework and I realize that it is because his teachers gave him the answers instead of letting him try during his study hall in school. He has only done about three math assignments since distance learning began, and I would barely call it math, it was just choosing things off of a menu and writing the numbers down. There was no actual math. He only had one thing that was actual math and it was a placement test for a website he hasn't used since.

He hasn't done ELA at all, but his teacher called me and said he would be doing such for the next two weeks, so he has to do his other subjects now. I haven't seen any examples of his schoolwork since he started at this school and if these distance learning assignments are similar, I am really worried. I feel like his public school is putting a limit on his learning because he has autism. In Florida he was being given work that was too hard in grade-level classes, and here in Maine he is being given work that his teachers are doing for him or are just very easy.

I looked at one of his social studies assignments and his teacher answered every other question literally, they were even highlighted.

I'm really worried for him. I feel like he learns more from youtube videos he likes to watch than his classes. He is really interested in biology, plant geography, evolution, cavemen, astronomy, and game design. He is constantly coming up with creative alien environments and species and theorizing about space travel and life outside our solar system. He loves to watch CrashCourse and other educational videos. I did a lab experiment for my marine science class for my homeschool and he joined in and loved it.

Is there any advice on what to do?? I don't think my mom would allow me, but if she did let me, what do I do? I would be balancing my schoolwork with teaching him, but I feel like I could do that because majority of my classes might honestly be similar to what I'd like to teach him other than my calculus and physics. I'd like to sign him up for a club or have him volunteer somewhere with me so he still can be social. He hasn't made any friends in his school and that worries me.

Would it be okay to try this out over the summer and see how it goes?? I want to be a teacher when I am older too and I really want him to learn. I'm about to go into 11th grade. I am in dual enrollment and I am willing to take some teaching courses if it helps to better his education.

684,"This is how my mind has become, after seeing too many contradictions in sources.

And lately I've been finding this kind of skepticism exhausting, but how else will I be able to determine truth?

&amp;#x200B;

When I hear a claim, I don't take it as truth, but as a theory. I then compare that theory with multiple sources and I will always find each source saying something different, I then look deeper and deeper and I figure out soon I don't have the time to be skinning every argument to determine if it is true or not, or by the time I reach 80 years old I will be certain about very few things.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an example, there are sources that claim Milk, Eggs, Flouride, Vaccinations, 5G radio waves, etc, are bad for you, then there are sources that claim the opposite.

685,"Due to a bad relationship, I lost most of my money &amp; I had to move back home. My plan was to restart &amp; go back to school. I’m extremely grateful that my parents allowed me to come back &amp; support me as I resume my education. I never wanted it to come down to this but it’s how my life turned out. 

We had a huge discussion prior to me moving in &amp; I asked them to respect aspects of my independence. I wanted the right to go out when I wanted to and do daily things that didn’t require their permission. Growing up, I was extremely sheltered. I was constantly put down for stating an opinion outside of theirs &amp; I felt like I was guilted all the time for making my own decisions. So I moved out early, I wasn’t financially ready &amp; unfortunately I never was stable. They promised they wouldn’t treat me like a child but reality is, I’m being treated like a child. 

These days, it’s been really hard. I can’t go on a walk around the neighborhood without my mom saying she has to come with me for protection. I can’t leave the house to buy food or whatever because I need their permission. And if they think it’s unsafe or whatever they’re feeling, I can’t leave the house. Before quarantine, when I wanted to sleep over a friends house, I needed to ask permission and many times, it was a no. If I went out, they would constantly text me to check up on me and ask me when I’m coming home. Dating is non-existent. I can’t go out on dates without getting his social security number at this point. And when I’ve tried, a guy ended things because he felt like he was going out with a teenager who needed their parents permission for the smallest things. 

When I would express my frustration, I would get the whole “respect your parents” speech. I fee guilty every time because it is true that they are providing me a home while I attend school. Their house, their rules. But I feel like I’m going insane. I’ve lived a very independent lifestyle, as poor as it was, for a long time. I get that they worry because I’m their child. I understand that I’ll always be their child. But how can I make them understand that I’m capable of making my own decisions &amp; I need to have more independence? 

I spend most of my time studying because I guess I’m slow &amp; it takes me a really long time to understand the material. I’ve tried getting a job &amp; doing surveys online but it doesn’t make much. I’ve searched for a cheap apartment but I can’t find one within my budget. My friends don’t have a place for me to stay &amp; neither does my extended family. I’m not sure what to do at this point. I’ll be in school for the next three years. I don’t know how I’m going to be able to live like this.",26May2020,1

So there are a lot of parts to this story but I’ll try and make it as clear/fair as possible. 

I have been friends with Amy* for around 7 years. She’s always been a pretty typical “full time mommy” she lives in a council house, constantly fights with her baby daddy, screams at the kids and very rarely works, but i thought she was a good person deep down and have tried to help her as much as possible. 

She’s know for being drama and a liar and after one too many incidents that involved her stirring things up I decided to call off our friendship for good about a month ago. 

This is where the problem then occurs. 

So I have multiple browsers installed on my computer however I only really use chrome. Chrome was being faulty the other day so I decided to use edge, I haven’t used it in months and when I went to log into Facebook I noticed she must have previously logged in and not logged out as I could see it was her profile not mine. 

I snooped. I know I shouldn’t have but I wanted to know if she had been lying about me to our mutual friends, instead I found that the guy she’s looking to date (talking for over a month but not met yet due to covid) thinks that she works as an instructor at a boxing gym. Further snooping showed she’s told multiple men that she’s either a boxing instructor or bar manager. 

This pissed me off as I own my own company and work part time whilst getting it off the ground I pay my taxes and she does nothing, I’ve tried multiple times to help her find a job and even offered to put in a word for her where I work at my part time job at a very well know lingerie store. She’s always brushed me off as she’d rather go out and get drunk every weekend than work, she quit her last part time bar job over a year ago because she wanted her weekends free to party. 

I called her out for lying about working when she’s unemployed by choice (I did not say I snooped, instead I said I had ended up talking to a guy she has previously lied to) 

She called me crazy and said I can believe what I want so I said that a simple solution would be for me to ask the guy she’s dating when I see them out together if she had said she worked. 

She’s then messaged the guy saying she has a confession to make, she stopped working a year ago as one of the trainers in the boxing gym sexually assaulted her and she could stand the thought of going back, that she was telling him this now because she felt so guilty about lying that she was working but it was too shameful to tell the truth. He’s obviously comforted her and feels terrible she ever went through this.

The issue is she didn’t. She’s never worked in a boxing gym, she’s not been sexually assaulted but she knows I have and has used some details of my assault to back her story up and make it believable. The other issue is that this gym isn’t made up, she was previously talking to a guy who runs a boxing gym who ghosted her and I suspect if push comes to shove she will claim false allegations against him to back herself up.

It doesn’t sit well with me that she should get away with this, I made sure to take screenshots before logging out of her Facebook but I also know I obtained this information in a bad way.

My current options would be: tell the new guy she’s lying. Tell the guy with the boxing gym what she’s saying. Tell our mutual friends what she’s done. Or do nothing. 

I don’t want to cause drama and I do have better things to do but I hate the thought of her getting away with this, however I’m not sure if I’m making it a bigger deal than it is because the subject is so sensitive to me. 

I know I’m in the wrong for snooping. But would I be in the wrong for outing her?

692,"Firstly, this is on a throwaway account to prevent people from finding out its me and that im just going to call my friend as ""my friend"". And this is also gonna be a long post so yea.  


Im a 16 year old and my friend is 1 year older than me. We are both guys. We are childhood friends and i would consider him as my best friend. He has a personality which i guess would be called being apatheic? He always has an ""eh"" or ""idk"" or ""ok i guess"" sorta responses which im fine with. He is usually very inactive on Whatsapp and recently became more active due to a group chat.   


Heres where i start to worry a bit. Usually, i would be the one to message him or call him to ask him if he wants to go out or come over, with his responses usually being ""ok"" or ""sure i guess"". He's rarely rejected me though i don't really get mad or anything at all if he says no and i just go ""aw okay then"". However, even though im usually the one who messages and calls him first, he used to also occationally send me stuff thru whatsapp of cool stuff he found occationally asks me if i wanna go out to play or smt. He would also used to tell me saying ""oh im free tmr you wanna go out"" or smt like that. However recently, since the start of the year he hasnt messages me once first or called me. I know the whole Covid-19 thing but it started before that. He also now more frequently gives 1 word answers like ""Ok"" ""Ooh"" ""What"" ect. Also, on an online game we play where we can party up, idk why but recently when i ask to join his party when he's with someone else, he usually would kick the other guy and make a seperate party. Idk if its coincidence or its because im worse than most of his friends in the game since i dont play as much as him or something else, but i feel like im somewhat forcing him to play with me only even though thats not my intent. He recently also set his Whatsapp settings for people to no longer see his last online. He still does say ""Ok"" if i ask him to go out(Before quarantine) and also when i ask him to play doe.  


I know some of the points seems to be a little paranoid or being too nosy into his private life, but i mostly feel paranoid because some of the stuff i noticed were things i did to another guy who i believed i was in a toxic relationship with, with me doing things such as rarely messaging him first, trying to end conversations with him with shorter replies to make it hard to continue and to set my discord and steam to invisible so he wont see me online.  I also used to still agree to go out and hang out with the other guy sometimes to prevent suspicion. I am also scared to ask my friend about this whole thing as I'm afraid he would see that as me not trusting him/I'm not sure if he may lie his way out like ""No its not like that"" since that was also some stuff i did to reduce suspicion and to make the distancing from the guy i was in a toxic relationship with and to not make it obvious. So im thinking if that i can do those won't others be capable too? What if he is also trying to distance from me?  


Im just really afraid as I see him as my best friend but im unsure of his opinion of me. I don't want to lose a good friend like him and i dont know what im doing wrong to cause this to happen. It was all good last year too and I'm really not sure what i had done. I have been really paranoid and scared about this especially since quarantine had given me so much more time for stuff like thinking about this. Please help me, im unsure if i should do something or just let it continue.",26May2020,1

Thanks for taking the time to read this!

I am looking for advice for a good friend of mine who is not having a great time. She is a single mum who has a disability causing her to not be able to leave the house very often and makes her exhausted when she does any physical activity. She feels like her life is pretty much over due to this and there is nothing left for her to look forward to which really bums her out.

She is very into computer games, which is how we met, but is getting pressured by her family who make her feel bad for spending too much time doing this and not spending the time with her children or doing something productive. 

She spends time with her children and has activities she does with them but cant do much with them due to her disability. She is really getting down, doesn't really have anyone there for her and feels like there is nothing left in life for her now.

Can anyone suggest anything I can do to help her or any activities I can suggest? She is a good friend and such a lovely person that it hurts me to see her struggling like this and I don't know what I can do. This is kind of a last resort to see if anyone had any ideas.

My gf and I bought a house 8 months ago and have been renovating before we move. It was fall when we bought it so it was too cold out to see or hear any neighbors. The neighbors across the street have kids approximately age 2, 4, 7 and 11. There might be a 5th one between age of 7-9 but I don’t know. We repeatedly hear them outside screaming at them daily. Cursing using words I, a 25 year old, don’t even use. Yesterday’s phrase of choice was the mom walking outside screaming at the ~4 year old “you are just a piece of worthless fucking shit aren’t you?”

Now almost always it’s degrading words. But I have never once heard the parents not curse at them when they talk. Cursing isn’t inheritantly bad but it’s the degrading that gets to me. These kids repeatedly are running around outside and in the neighborhood naked. The 2 year old has been a block away being supervised by a 9 year old riding bikes. It’s alarming they are rarely supervised by parents and look after themselves. The older ones yell “get the fuck away from me” to the younger ones. 

It’s almost repulsive. The parents are always outside yelling things at the kids and the whole block can hear. They have no shame.

I've sent messages to Sam, trying to find out if he's alright, he's read them all but not replied. I tried calling him today but he didn't answer, so I left a voice message.

Well 4 months later I pay for everything for the dog and the granddaughter doesnt come around anymore. So essentially i have a dog I never agreed to but I love the little dude so I'm ok with it. Here's where the title comes into play. Everytime I leave the house I ask her to keep an eye on the dog so I dont have to put him in the crate. Shes home. Her dog is out and about. Not an issue. But she doesnt pay attention to my dog who's 6 months old. So he shits in the house everytime I leave but when I'm here and keep an eye on him he never shits in the house. Only when he's alone with her. Everytime I come home I look in the same spot first. Pile of dog shit. I let her know and she says ""oh I was watching him. He was on my lap almost the whole time. I dont know when it could've happened. He must've just done it."" Every single time she says this. 

So I went to the store this morning and I come home. Pile of shit on the floor. She tells me the same bullshit. I politely said to her. ""Everytime I leave the house he shits in that spot. If you can keep a close eye on him that would be great. I dont want to clean up shit everytime I walk through the door."" To which she responded. ""I do keep an eye on him even if I watch him every second you're gone he'd still shit on the floor."" Clearly this is ridiculous to even say because it's not true. If you see the dog go in that spot (behind an end table) let him outside. He's good about telling you he has to go. I put a bell on the doorknob and he rings that about 50% of the time. Anyways. I dont feel like I should have to clean up this shit everytime. If she left her dog in my care (she does all the time) and it messed in the house I'd be the one responsible and I'd clean it. After her saying the dogs going to shit in the house no matter what in her care I feel like she should be the one cleaning it then. 

If shes neglecting to let him outside she should be the one cleaning the shit. If he messed the floor while I'm home I'd clean it. But theres no reason on earth I'd have to clean poop everytime I come home when shes at the house. She'll sit next on the couch next to the end table he poops behind and pretend like she couldn't smell the dog poop 2 feet from her and act surprised when I tell her he shit. Either way she leaves it there and I have to clean it. My plan is next time it happens just leave it there. If she doesnt want the poop on her floor she needs to let my dog outside. She let's her dog outside. Why is that so difficult? If you know he poops in that spot everytime I leave keep an eye on him. The crazy thing is I'll be gone for 20 minutes to 2-3 hours at most. I dont ever leave him with her longer than that. But every single time he's going in the house in her care. How do I handle this when she refuses to take responsibility for the dog?",26May2020,1
715,"I'm a 24 year old guy. Ugh, in so many ways, I have been really happy how my life has come together over the past few years. I have a job in corporate finance. My team, largely composed of people 30+ , all seem to like me a lot (I genuinely fit in). I make very good money for someone my age, and have my own apartment and nice car. I have gotten super into weigh-lifting in the last 2 years, and have even entered some competitions. And recently, I've started seeing a traditionally attractive girl who is obsessed with me. I really don't have any complaints. 

But...it wasn't always like this. Growing up, I was often a bit of an outcast. Especially in middle and high school, and playing youth sports. I think this is down to a few factors:

* I'm half Asian, and my background stood out a bit for the Midwest city I lived in. Plus, I came from a family in higher ed. My dad is a professor, and I was raised in a bit of a nerdy home. Most of the kids at my school were more blue collar and white. 
* I hit puberty super late. In Junior year of high school, really. I think this affected my confidence with girls.
* I genuinely didn't fit in at school. I was a bit nerdy, and had weird interests, and was maybe a bit over-eager in class some times. And I tried to fit in too much with the 'popular kids' instead of just hanging out with the kids I would have really belonged with. 

For the most part, I **did not** have a bad or traumatic school experience. In Junior High and High School, almost everybody was nice to me. I even had a good reputation as being a nice guy, and was well liked in that sense. I also had good connections with people across all groups...whether it was recent immigrants, some of the kids with eccentric hobbies, etc. 

However, I had strong feelings of exclusion. Even people I considered to be my friends never really went out of their way to invite me to stuff, or make me a core part of the group. I often spent my weekends hanging out with my family and so on. This is definitely not imagined...I was often one of the last ones without a partner in class, didn't get invited to parties, did not have a grad date, so on and so forth. 

I feel like this is affecting my adulthood more than it should. Some times, these thoughts creep back to me: 

1. A feeling that I will be ""outed"" as a loser. I absolutely hate that I cannot relate to people that partied throughout high school, had early sexual and relationship experience, were stars of the football team, and so on. It makes me feel vulnerable that I never had this.
2. This sense that a lot of high school people have it out for me now, or at least don't cheer me on. Some of this is a bit paranoid, but some of it is legitimate. I can recall people making backhanded compliments to me, etc. Since I don't live in a huge city, I see a lot of these people often, and still go to occasional get togethers, etc. But I feel like they still see me as the nerdy skinny kid from before. 

Can anyone relate? How do I stop carrying this shame with me as a semi successful adult?",26May2020,1
716,"Hey, 25M with all sort of mental problems. I've been jobless for more than a year now. My mental health is getting very bad and I haven't taken meds in a very long time. The last time was a terrible incident because I had alcohol and meds. Completely blacked out, created an unecessary mess, I have not taken meds ever after that.
I had a breakup almost 6 years ago. Everything went downhill from there.
I'm currently in a long distance relationship. I've known this girl for almost 10 years now. It was random flirting, but I've always liked her and wanted to be with her. 
She came back into my life after she knew that I was not doing okay and wanted to reach out. It felt so nice to have someone I could be myself with. No one knows me better than her. She made sure that I was happy all the time. She's in a relationship, after a few months we started getting very close. At this point I'm completely dependent on her. 
Then there's reality! The fact that she's in a relationship. She loves me and she regrets not being in a relationship with me earlier. She says that she cannot do anything about the her current relationship because it's complicated. Her parents are stubborn about it itseems. She tells me that there's no choice but still there might be a possibility down the line.
She's also a bit possessive. What should I do about it? It's getting very ugly right now. When she avoids me and hides me. She doesn't spend enough time with me anymore and that's hurting me really bad. My mental problems started showing up at the right time. I'm extremely depressed atm.
I cannot even share this with any one close to me. 
All of them think that I'm in a legit relationship.
I've become to obsessive too, I can't even put my phone down. I'd be constantly staring at it waiting for her. 
I'm sorry for the long post.

723,"In the past I have had many issues with being open with my feeling to my friends, they end our friendship cause its too much for them or they believe I am selfish an only care about my own goals/desires, some of these cases I could understand but others just seemed like they did a 180; some examples being a friend who was a year older than me who had just finished high school and just wanted to stop being friends cause they were moving on with their life, others being friends who liked me in a romantic way and when they got over those feelings no longer have time for me, or say I am annoying and my personality clashes with their's so they don't want to be around me anymore. Due to this I have extremely toned down the amount of information I share about my feelings even when those feelings pertain to actions they have done.

Recently my only group of friends (which includes my older brother in the group) did something that made me just feel like shit for the rest of the day and it wasn't even super huge. Basically I asked to be apart of something they were doing, than the next day my brother told me no with no explanation. At first I thought he was joking for they posted a bunch of meme photos right afterwards and when I asked if they were serious he responded with ""Did I stutter?"". So when I physically went to him being that the other conversations were in discord he rudely told me ""No, how much clearer do I need to be?"" while he was currently in a call with everyone. I than spent the rest of the night feeling like shit. I now want to message the group describing how it made me felt as well as other things that they have been doing but I don't want to risk losing our friendship because this is the last group of friends I have and I have a extremely hard time making friends especially now that I am out of high school and have bad social anxiety topped off with depression. I know this sounds childish for a 20 year old to say just don't have the social skills to actually think this is a good idea and find it easier to just tell my therapist instead of straight up telling my friends. I know this won't change anything and make this situation happened again but my fears are ruling my judgement at the moment. 

I also find it hard to tell someone hey you made me feel like shit because of x and y because my past friends get really defensive and some started listing all the things I do wrong either to them or in general. Also because my brother is apart of this recent hurt feelings and I live with him I don't want have a confrontation with him in person because I will just say yes and agree with him that I was wrong because that is what happens to me in any face to face conformation.

(This is the message I was about to send them before I decided to ask for advice, edited with fake names)

""Gonna share somethings real quick fellas. Last night when you guys told me I couldn't hang with you I have been feeling kinda shitty because when you guys said the previous day I could hang just to change your minds without an explanation made me feel like I was doing something wrong. I feel like you guys don't want to hang out with me either because I am younger than you all or because I am the younger brother to John who was your friends first but John has said he doesn't care about us having the same friends which just gets me confused. I understand some of you have recently been having some personal issues so I didn't want to jump to conclusions. 

Basically their have been a few reasons I am feeling like shit. Obviously as already stated one is when you guys said I could hang with you yesterday to give me a no at the last second in the way you did with no explanation of why. When James was upset with me having D&amp;D meetings on Saturdays because he has actively told us he can't do Saturdays I knew I needed to change the dates to include him and apologizes but when I did he still said no making me feel he either just doesn't want to play and was messing with me or just he just doesn't like me, and I don't know why I feel like he doesn't like me just think he is always acting cold to me. Thirdly I put a lot of effort into the D&amp;D meetings and I feel like that is all you guys want out of me is to DM the meetings which make me feel like our friendship is held together only by D&amp;D, which I know is how I met all of you but I feel like after 4 - 5 years our friendship should be past that point. As I type this up and not think it in my head it, I am sounding more and more like a whiny, needy child. I fully understand it could just be my stupid head looking to deep into things but I won't know unless I ask. Do you guys want our relationship to just be D&amp;D meetings only because if that is what you want I can accept that even if it's not what I want.""

I deleted this message because to me I just sound whiny and needy and this message will only make things worse. Just don't know an easy way to share emotions about someones actions if their even is one. Posting this cause honestly find it easier to send if off as a faceless nobody and get advice from people who don't know me and I don't know them.

727,"So, I am a 12 year old girl. I am on a throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

My parents are both in their 40’s, and I have 2 little brothers. (8 and 5)

They are both white Texan Baptists, and my Mom acts like a stereotypical Karen.   
So, I first started noticing red flags in about November. The first thing that happened was my dad was pretending to be retarted. He was speaking in a deep voice, like one you would do when mocking someone. He was saying things about pooping himself, etc. I felt extremely uncomfortable and thought it WAS NOT FUNNY at ALL.   


Then, my Mom started calling me lazy when I was playing video games and having fun with my friends for over 30 minutes a day. 

I started self harming, and they only paid attention to me for a day when I told my school consular, and they just treated me like a child. They didn’t even bother to remove the slinky (object I was using to self harm) from my room. To this day, it is still up there.   


They keep refusing to Social Distance, and were a few inches away from my Grandmother, who is a nurse, on Mother’s Day. I tried to speak out against this, but they refused to listen and said things like, “LindseyBergman123, are you REALLY gonna be like this on MOTHER’S DAY?” I was very angry, but there was absolutely nothing I could do.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks after that, we were watching tv and there was a dude on there and my Dad made a really, really hurtful comment about his mustache. I told my Dad that that was mean and that he should stop. He refused to listen and threatened to take away my phone and iPad, making it so I had no contact with the few friends I had.

Last week, my parents made plans to go to Corpus Christi, despite the fact that my brother is HIGH FUCKING RISK. I tried to talk sense into them, but they would not listen. When I spoke out against going to the beach when we were there, my mom just threatened to remove my contact with my friends and delete my Roblox account and Youtube channel. Both of which I am extremely passionate about and they know damn well it is one of the only things that keep me happy.   


Later when my mom’s hotspot ran out, she blamed it on my streaming and was all out disrespectful to me.   


When around other adults, they will talk bad about me and my interests. Yesterday they made a mean joke about me in front of one of their friends. I almost cried, but my dad said ‘come on, take a joke. You have no sense of humor.’

They will always make fun of me in front of their friends and treat me like a toddler. A lot of other things have happened that I have no listed here as it will take far to long. I am sorry if this is vague, I just want help. I am in Texas, so it is illegal for me to run away, sadly as there is no abuse going on according to law.",26May2020,1
728,"Hello everybody, first time posting here, so excuse me if I'm not the best at this. 
A year ago I declared my feelings to this girl.. We have known each other since primary school, but became ""friends"" in last year of Highschool. She had always had different boyfriends over that time, so I never felt comfortable being honest about my feelings for her. I was also pretty scared of doing so.

However, last year was different. We hung out a lot during that summer, and she was single for a couple of months. So, finally, I took courage and finally told her how I felt, and her response was that she felt flattered, but had a lot of stuff going on her life back then and didn't feel like having a relationship for that time being. She also said that she cared about me and appreciated our relationship. I understood and respected her, but tried to walk away a bit so I could move on from those feelings. She entered into a relationship two months after that and is still with the guy.

And here I am. One year later, I ocasionally find myself dreaming or thinking about her. I'm not exactly in the same place as I used to, I know nothing will ever happen. We barely talk these days, every now and then, but stopped hanging around, and just talk about nerdy stuff or small talk.

I've tried meeting new people, Tinder, rationalize the situation and accept that this doesn't lead me to anything, but I feel I can´t move on. It's very frustrating. I also feel kinda ashamed of it so I tell my family and friends that I'm over it, since I know it's pathetic.

Do you have any piece of advice that you could give in order to get over her?

732,"I (22F) dated a guy who we will call ""James"" (35M) for about a year. It was never official, but we were definitely dating. I was a student studying X and he works in the X department. He isn't a professor, but he works closely with students teaching them technical stuff about our major - this is how I met him. I ended up working under him along with a handful of other students as a work-study program to get more technical training.

At first I pursued him, which I knew was dangerous, but it was almost a joke to me because I didn't ever imagine anything would ever happen. He was happy to flirt back with me and at its core we had a solid friendship. All of this sort of came to a halt when after months of working there I found out he had a girlfriend (35F). I immediately stopped with the flirting and continued on as normal. It was then that he started to get more flirtatious with me. He would bring up conversations about sexuality (I am bi), relationships, sex, etc.

Since there are significantly less students around during the summer, the work-study program stops until the coming fall term. A week before classes were over he tells me that he and his girlfriend have an open relationship and invites me to hang out with them. Over the summer we all get very close and I admit to him I have feelings for him to which he tells me they are reciprocated. This is when things begin to ramp up.

It started off rocky, he intentionally ""forgot"" to bring a condom when we knew we would be sleeping together for the first time (his girlfriend had a very strict rule about him wearing condoms with other people) then told his girlfriend he had no idea him coming over would lead to sex. I was so captivated by the taboo nature of our relationship that I ignored many red flags like this. 

Over the course of the upcoming months we got VERY close. He always told me though that he didn't want a relationship with me and hat his girlfriend was his priority - what we had was just sex. Yet at the same time he invited to concerts and bonfires and solo dinner dates (his words) with him. I met his friends and I even met some of his family, but he made me feel stupid when I told him I felt we were more. When I had some housing trouble for a month I literally lived in his home. All the while, once the fall term started I was still working for him. It was honestly manageable for a long time until it suddenly wasn't. 

A few months before our relationship ceased he and his girlfriend ended things. Since I was very close with her, she and I talked a lot about her feelings in their relationship. In those conversations some specific topics about James relationship with me came up and I realized he had been lying to both of us about boundaries she had set up. I confessed to her that James and I crossed many of those boundaries and I had done so because James told me those boundaries had changed (conveniently to serve him).

This changed my relationship permanently with James and I felt so guilty about calling him out but also for unknowingly hurting his ex. After having many many serious conversations with him, I told him that our relationship has consistently been more than ""just fucking"" and that going forward if I was to remain with him I would want something more serious. He said he felt sad because he didn't want things to end and told me I was more important to him than I realized. I considered that to be a testament to him making things more serious. But alas he didn't. He continued to keep me at arms length, making me feel crazy for feeling hurt, and started to prioritize fixing his relationship with his ex (to be friends I guess). I was so depressed that my academic performance took a dump and I started drinking heavily. After a close call that left me in the hospital for a week, I told him it was over. 

It has now been a year since things ended (and a year sober!) and I no longer feel hurt and I definitely don't feel love - just disgust. After a LOT of therapy I can look back and realize how manipulative and abusive the relationship was. So this brings me to my question... 

He still works with students and during our relationship consistently asked me about potential threesomes with other students in the department that I was friends with, or just some of my other friends. He commented a lot about how pretty or beautiful or what a ""nice ass"" some of the female students in the department had. He even told me (after the first time we had sex) that there was a student in the past who worked with him who he thought also had feelings for him and he was flirty with. Now that I'm out of the relationship all I can see are red flags and a breeding ground for some other student to get hurt the way I did. The thing is, he is loved by *all* of the department, students included and that job is the single most important thing to him (because it is his alma mater). 

I'm conflicted on whether to write an anonymous email to the department head to just let them know he engaged in a sexual and romantic relationship with a student and that he has shown signs of interest with other female students in the department. Some of my friends think I should because they say his behavior is predatory, some others say I should let it go. Should I send an email or should I let it go?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;** I (22F) dated my boss (35M) for a year that ended a year ago. He was manipulative and our relationship ended in flames. After having time apart from the incident and talking with friends, I'm considering writing an email to the head of the department to let them know he engaged in a relationship with a student and has made a lot of commentary about wanting to be with / finding other female students attractive.

736,"We'll call her Carrie (13) for this. She's always been bossy but since I started high school 4 years ago she's gotten so much worse.

He's the only maintenance guy there and a bunch of the tenants there are terrible to both him and the very nice property manager. I don't get paid for what I do. So when I get home I just want to eat and relax. Especially after harsh days where I barely have enough time to eat a sandwich. 

I don't want to fight my sister anymore but words never work on her. Begging, reasoning, and compromising never works. I also don't want to come home after putting decks in and dealing several 50+ lb bags of dog shit only to find that I have to take out 3 dogs, do the pills, and dishes. 

Lately my temper has worn particularly thin and when she started laughing at my frustration when she wouldn't take a dog out, I slapped her. It escalated into an all out brawl from there. I'm tired of her dumping her chores on me and our brother. I want results and if words aren't working then I'm not afraid to use other methods no matter how much I wish I didn't have to. 

I don't know why she turned out like this when we were raised the same way. My only working theory is that because my parents are tired when they come home from work they just don't have the energy to put up with her bs. 

Any advice you can give me would be much appreciated. Thank you",26May2020,1
737,"So my mom was recently laid off due to the current situation, and has expressed multiple times that I should start supporting her should she need it. Im 26 and moved out 3-4 years ago. My brother got married, bought a house and moved out about 6 months ago (he was 31). I've never had a good relationship with my mom. She's my mother and that's it. She doted on my brother his entire life (first born Asian son thing) but I always got the ""why can't you be more like your brother"" scoldings. She's only recently realized that he would not be letting her move in with him and his wife, and has now turned to me as a safety net. Over the past few weeks she's been telling me that I need to hurry up and buy a house for us both to live in. I feel guilty saying this, but I could never go back to living with her. How do I tell her that I would never in a million years want to live with her again, but in a nice way? Do I have an obligation to provide full financial support?",26May2020,1

It became toxic to the point where I just started calling them out every time cuz I started realizing how much of a liar they are about so much to the point where I really don’t know what’s true about them or not.

I want to stop keeping track of this person and get distance from them because it’s not healthy for either person. The relationship has to end but neither of us are pulling the plug despite how crazy it’s gotten.

740,"I’m 18, female and just finished first year of college 

The title was kind of hard to make because it’s broader than that. I really don’t know what I want out of a guy, and I’ve date d a few guys online with long distance and a few who were in my classes in high school but after meeting this one guy, let’s call him David; I thought I found the one but after our 2 year relationship (which was really on and off bc of arguments and outside stressors) I’m feeling really lost, we broke up about 4 months ago and I want him back, likely just because he’s comfortable, bc at the same time I believe that there is better... 

Now being single for the last 4 months I’ve met some ppl but I’m afraid to commit because I can’t imagine anyone would be better than David even though we really weren’t that good to start..

But recently, (this is where the title comes in) I’ve lost a friend bc he feels that I gave him hope that we would date in the future. That may or may not sort itself out but not what I want to focus on. I want to say that my high school friend, Tony; he confessed to me that he’s had a crush on me for a while and he’s a really nice guy and all but my best friend thinks he’s not that great and would be a bad idea to date him, and not just her opinion but my state of mind about David concerns me bc idk if I want to be with him or not. Now, tony confessed to me and I feel like I turned him down gently but I think I have a tendency to lead people on without meaning to because I don’t know what I’m looking for, and I guess I’m kind of desperate (maybe only for company) but I don’t want to date anyone if I know I won’t be happier than I was with David. Tony has been hanging around with me and my friend josh lately and my concern is I dated Josh over 2 years ago and left him for David, shitty I know, but now he’s jealous because tony has a crush on me... and he hates guys who come around me and idk what to do because I don’t think I will ever get with josh again and I thought I made that clear to him but I’m afraid if I have to be harsh with him and tell him he is friend zoned I will lose my best friend (my best friend since elementary school, we’ve grown apart and one of my new best friends in high school was a terrible influence so I dropped her and my other girl friend she is completely isolated from everyone bc of her bf) so yeah I’m in a terrible confusing state of mind and I’m afraid to lose my closest friend",26May2020,1

743,"How do I explain this? 

Also, sorry for how ramble-y this is. 

For the past year, things haven't been going well at all. I have put little to no effort in any of my school classes, effectively ruined my chances at going to any of my dream universities. I was in a toxic relationship where he was always gas-lighting me and being kinda emotionally abusive. 5 months ago he broke up with me and starting dating someone else in about 2 weeks. That really hurt me. I lost many of friends because I isolated myself and one specifically because I caught feelings for that person. I hate many of the people at my school because they're all stuck-up assholes. I feel like such a disappointment to everyone. I was always the kind of person who got shit done. I was determined and hardworking. My best friend told me that I seemed like I had my shit together. I used to get bullied like 2 years ago and I had to deal with some family problems  for the past 3 years. Even though that all sucked, it doesn't feel as bad as this does.  

Lately I just exist. I don't really contribute anything to anyone. I think being dead would be so simple. I would have no worries anymore. Now I worry about everything but I don't do anything to change it. It's like I'm chained to my bed. I don't want to do any of my work because I know it's never going to be good enough. I feel like my friends would be better off without me. I've reached this breaking point where I don't care about anything but I keep making plans and promises that I know I will never keep. 

I cry so much. Multiple times a day. Sometimes I don't even know why I'm crying. It just feels nice.  

I'm worried about myself. I tell my parents. I don't think they realize how bad this all is. I get angry easily with them. All snappy, you know?

I guess I'm just sick of being alive. I don't see the point. Can someone give me something to look forward to please? 

Logically I know that it will get better. Everyone keeps telling me that.  It's hard to believe. It feels like when things get better, then they get worse. Is it true that it gets better? What if I'm the only exception to that rule? Can someone help?",26May2020,1

I’ve taken another job that also says it’s 30 or so minutes away minimum. It’s 13 miles away and pays about 3 grand more.

746,"We broke up on Sunday after a stream of arguments - he would get offended over nothing &amp; tell me he can't do this and threaten to break up. This is happened over 5 times with 2 ultimatums before.

**Background leading up to BU**:

My ex nit picks everything I say - I asked him to stop banging while doing something so I could hear him on the phone. He told me I can't change him and that he can't do this... all because I wanted to hear him.

He wants to go to Ibiza end of August for a holiday. Not my scene so I suggested him going with friends. He said it would be hard as a lot are married w/ kids. I agreed saying yea you're all at different stages in life. He told me I'm insinuating his friends are further ahead in life than him.

I asked for more empathy from him in the relationship because I feel I haven't had his support. We have different forms of empathy and I told him this. He told me I think I'm better than him adding, 'well you're not'. That because I've been seeing a therapist for low self esteem &amp; he knows this.

This came to an end on Sunday with him constantly threatening to break up. Exhausted &amp; over it I agreed, said it was long overdue and that we both aren't happy. No hard feelings.

**Texts:**

\-Mon - he texted to say he's willing to talk about it but it's best we move on. I replied saying there's nothing to discuss, told him I was upset @ him comment about 'well you're not' &amp; that it's best to move on. He replied agreeing.

\-Today (Tues) - he messaged asking, 'did we make the right decision?'

I haven't replied nor know if I should. Even the 'We' in that makes me cringe. Yes I eventually did agree and break it off but that's only because off constant BU threats by him &amp; everything I say being wrong/offensive when I don't mean to be.

I feel like I need time to process it and I also want him to experience the break up since he's been threatening it so much. I've been feeling so miserable &amp; exhausted recently and just want time to myself now.

748,"First some background.  

My sister (57f) and I (59f) both live in the states (Texas and Kansas).  Our mum (87f) lives in England.  Mum lives alone since dad died 12 years ago.  She has been drinking for many many years but has upped to ante the past few years.  She has a couple of medical problems - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_tremor, very swollen legs which makes it enormously hard walking.  She has a walker but doesn’t use it very often.  She is extremely stubborn and doesn’t allow for anyone to come in and help (she has a gardener and a cleaning lady only).

She has a lot of falls, usually due to being intoxicated.  She has a call button that alerts paramedics.

So, my question is, I know that I will receive a phone call from the paramedics at some point to say she has passed.  We’re expecting it, we know it’s going to happen.  If it should come during the pandemic how would we face this?  Mum is donating her body to science, they will pick her up within 24 hours so I know we wouldn’t get to see her.  No memorial service, just a few beers with her friends.

If anyone has any advice on how to deal with the problem arising from social distancing, travel etc.  Would we wait until times are safer before we return to hold a memorial.  Would it be safe?  

Thanks for any advice.",26May2020,1
749,"He and I were taking a class together and we were so close. People thought we were dating, but we weren't. They started dating and they broke up in March. I was supporting my friend on the phone (we are actually roommates but we are at our parents' houses for quarantine). She went too far with talking behind his back and I couldn't stand it for another 1 hours and I said ''I love you but enough he is my friend'' she said ''you do not need to support me, you both are disgusting me. I know who you were talking to on the phone'' (I was talking to a guy but didn't tell about him to her as it was too new. but as I learnt later she thought it was her boyfriend/my friend so she checked him with a text to see if he replies and he replied late). Also one day he called her by my name but she kept dating with him she was kind of obsessed, and he tried to break up many times and she even threatened him with suicide. 

I ended our friendship, she's apparenetly toxic. Now I talked to a friend and she said ''you know, I support you but it was her first relationship after her dad's death and it was almost her first year without her dad when they broke up, she will apologize again''. I am so sensitive about such things but I believe I shouldn't tolerate it, and I can't forgive anyways. What would you do? IDK when we will go back to our home but it's so weird that a person you support with her break up thinks you are the reason.. And I forgave her once about this cheating thing, I tolerated her once and she did it again very next day, and I'm sure she told her friends whom I also know I was the reason they broke up.

750,"I'm a 16 y.o. girl. I have never been in a serious relationship, and never really in ""love"". I've had crushes of course, but I've never really wanted something more with anyone. That was until about a month ago (quarantine started) when I started talking to this guy who goes to my school, I'll call him Liam. I had never talked to him before, but we just kind of clicked. We had the same humour, paid attention to each other in group calls and we could talk for so long. I started to catch feels. I met up with some friends (including him) and it wasn't awkward at all. We had such a great time.

Jump forward to yesterday. I was in class talking to some of my friends, and we agreed to meet up at the mall after school. When school ended, I walked to the mall with a buddy. We walked around while we waited for one of our other friends (let's call him Noah). When Noah finally showed up we went to buy some lunch and went to the roof to eat. We were all playing around, teasing each other, and just talking. Noah and I have always known each other, we were even a couple in first grade, but we have never really talked too much since then. He is such a nice and funny guy and he is the type you just know that you can trust. We would joke about ourselves and he would say something like ""Wow, u have small hands... Wait, was that rude? was I rude now? I'm sorry"". He is so polite and he cares so much.

I spotted some sheep on a field beside the mall and we decided to go try to pet them. When we got there, there was someone on the field, so we got shy and sat down on a bench beside a small river there. Noah came up with the idea that the three of us (me, Noah and my friend) should play Truth or Dare. I said sure. We asked and answered and joked around. Just as we were about to leave I said ""truth"". ""Who do you like?"" Noah said. Knowing Liam was a very good friend of them both, I said I liked him. They got so hyped, oh my god. Then THEY CALLED Liam and told him to come join us. I got embarrassed and hid my face behind my jacket. We then sat down by the river and I got a full update on Noahs love-life. Turns out him and a girl had had a thing, but then she blocked him, then unblocked him, and he was confused, cuz he didn't know what she thought they were.

Later we met up with a bunch of people, including Noah, Liam, the girl and some other folks. I noticed that Noah was shutting himself off all of a sudden. I tried to talk to him, but he didn't seem to wanna talk, so I just let him be. Liam who also had come by now, barely even talked to me. I don't know why, but I just felt awkward, because Noah and my friend had been teasing me about him all the way here.

When I got home a sudden realization popped into my head: I like Noah. And I still like Liam. what the fuck.

It was late so I went to bed. I usually don't get much sleep, but instead, just lie awake snapping people. I got a snap from Noah: a picture of a Smirnoff(vodka) bottle and the words ""Comeeee"". He was at our school. Now, the clock was about 1 am. but I said fuck it and climbed out of my window. 10 minutes later I'm at school. At night. When I finally found him he was drunk. But he seemed much happier than earlier. He talked a lot, and it was fun. He did ask me if I wanted a sip but I said no. He respected that. We spent some time together, talking laughing. He was teasing me about Liam, and I just laughed. I've never had so much fun alone with someone in a long time. Around 3 am. We began walking home. We were listing people we knew and asked if the other person would make out with that person. I ran out of girls to name and the conversation went a little like this:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I can't think of any more girls we know

N: I can

Me: You sure?

N: yeah, you haven't even said all the girls in our class

Me \*very sure I had\*: Oh? OH

Me \*jokingly\*: OkAy tHen, WhAT abOUt Me??

N: Yes

Me: :0

N: You probably wouldn't though

Me: No, I would...

N \*fully aware I haven't even kissed anyone yet\*: Prove it then

Me: yeah, no

N: Told you

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, I'm still in shock. When I said goodbye, he gave me a hug and told me that he would probably be laying dead or blacked out somewhere if I hadn't been there. I went home, climbed through my window and waited until I got a message from him that he was home again before I went to bed.

All in all, here's my problem: I like both Liam and Noah, but Noah knows I like Liam and he ships us. I've liked Liam for a long time now but just started liking Noah, but we had so much fun together. What should I do?",26May2020,1

Back in 2nd grade a very nice and gentle lady used to teach us maths and I already knew her cause she is my mom’s friend(let’s call her leyla). I loved her from day one.
I haven’t seen her since 8th grade since sometimes when i get off high school I go to pick up mom.
I saw leyla yesterday going on a walk in my neighborhood so i was automatically very happy to see her after almost 6 years now, it took her a while to recognize me since i became much taller and puberty hit me like a truck. Right then I took a moment to truly take in her appearance. She was extremely pale and thin, to the concerning point. She had chapped lips and the old spark in her eyes are no where to be seen. It baffled me, and the only thing i could ask myself was what the hell happened to this old goof ball.
I ask her about it after walking for a couple of minutes, then she have this whole sad aura around her face and i swear to god i could see a tear form in her eye.
Turns out that leyla had suffered breast cancer and had to get her left breast removed (i haven’t noticed it because she was wearing an oversized black robe) and her ex-husband has been harassing her about it (she divorced him back when i was in 5th grade i think).
My heart was shattered to million pieces when she almost broke down crying after telling me she feels horrible whenever she sees someone smiles or an adult with his/her child (she is infertile, the reason her husband divorced her).
She said she doesn’t even want anyone to come visit her since she feels miserable and sad most of the time. 
I tried to tell her to see a psychiatrist but since our shit society looks down on mental issues and health and specially everyone is criticizing her of being “unusefull » for not being able to make children she said absolutely not.
How can I convince her to see a psychiatrist ? She is a very important person to me and i don’t want to see her like this

766," This is gonna be a long one. About a year and a half ago, my friend (J) started dating a girl (E). She was integrated into our friend group after they started dating, and while she wasn't present at every event, I think we all considered her a friend, and I'm sure she did in return. About two months ago, J decided to break up with her, because he decided that he really couldn't handle a relationship at this point in his life. Everyone agreed to stay friends, and while J was fine with having her around, E was clearly very uncomfortable whenever we would all hang out together. (for some context, we are all seniors in HS)

The problem began a week or so back. With things finally starting to open back up again, one of the members of our group (B) decided to propose the idea of going on a weekend camping trip once things were deemed safe. E was not present when these plans were being created. B made a group chat, knowingly leaving E out. I believe that the reason for this was because it would almost certainly be very uncomfortable for both her and J, but the issue was that she was never informed of the group chat or even that the trip was being planned in the first place.

At this point, most of the planning was being done by B and her boyfriend, while me, J, and most of the rest of us didn't play too much of an active role. From what I can gather, all but two of us were aware that E wasn't aware of the trip, Including me. I can't really say why I didn't mention something to her or the rest of the group, but right now, I feel like an absolute piece of shit for not at least asking if we should invite her. (She probably almost 100% would have turned down the offer, but it's the thought that counts)

Earlier tonight, B posted a screenshot of the group chat to her story, which E saw. This led to her texting J stating that she didn't want to be friends with any of us anymore, and that she is cutting us all off completely. B doesn't see the problem and thinks that E is overreacting, saying that if any of us really wanted her there, we would have added her. She also says that we should all just ""move on"" and that ""she'll be okay eventually"".

What makes this situation even worse for her is that while she does have friends besides us, we were her main group. I'd like to send her a message apologizing and asking if we can stay friends, because I genuinely like her company, but I'm not going to do it just to make myself feel better when she's stated that she wants nothing to do with any of us anymore.

In all, I'm well aware of the magnitude of fucked up our actions were. I'll understand if you call me a terrible person because honestly, that's the way I feel about myself right now. I don't think that she'll ever want anything to do with us again, but is there anything I personally or we as a group can do to apologize?

TLDR; Friend's ex who remained in friend group not invited to camping trip, unsure as to how we can even make it up to her or even apologize without making things worse",26May2020,1
767,"We’re both young adults in our early 20s. I did say she was very beautiful awhile back and sent some heart emojis. Next I started messaging:

&gt; Hey beautiful! 😊

But we’re not even dating. And that’s not even my personality, it’s just the warmest side of me and when I’m in a good mood. 


A few things;

1. I have her number but was afraid to call cuz I worried about saying something pervy or weird.

2. She seems happy and makes me happy, but I don’t think I’m going to get far being all cutesy or whatever.

772,"TL;DR: I now know what I want to study. Now I have to chose the way to enter to university. One way is easier but takes more time, the other way is more difficult but takes less time. I'm lost on what to chose. 


Hello! Hope you all are doing well! 
Basically I left my school some time ago because I was not sure about what I wanted to study. Now that I know myself more, I know what I picture myself doing and I'm ready to start school again. In my country the school system is different. I'm going to try explaining it as good as possible.
You can enter to university by doing two different things:

-Two years pre university course: it lasts for 2 years ( you study things like: languages and literature related//economy//maths, physics, chemistry). I would only need a year to complete it. (I did one year, but I left it since I wasn't sure if I wanted to study for university) 
-A professional course: This course is made to basically work. They prepare you to that. But you can enter to university after coursing it too. You spend one year studying for an access there. The course itself is 2 years long. (3 years total.)

Okay so here's the thing. I need high grades to enter to university. In the professional course is waaaay easier to get high grades than in the pre-university course. But in the professional course I would need 3 years to finish it and THEN 4 years of university, which would make me finish my studies at 27. Doing the pre-uni course I would finish at around 25.

So after all this, my opinion: I just feel like finishing university at 27 is kinda old. I know that some people start university at 25. Some people realize they don't like what they studied and decide to start a new grade at 30. I know there's no age to study, to learn, to build a professional career. But again... I just feel bad by thinking some of my friends will finish university at 24, and then me... At 27. In the professional course is really easy to get high grades, that's why I like it. Somehow I don't feel confident enough to get into that pre-uni course... Because I know that stuff I have to study is Hella difficult and some people need 3 or 4 years to finish. Who am I to be able to finish it in one year PLUS with high af grades? Lol I just can't see it. I'm not a 10/10 student... 

So all I need is some advice. What's your experience? What would you do? What do you think. Anything can help me! I just need some external opinions with this. 
Thank you in advance!! &lt;3",26May2020,1
773,"
Me (18M) and my girlfriend (17F) have been going out for about 5 months now and I can honestly say that she is one of the kindest people I have ever met in my life. Her mother and father are divorced from a supposed ugly marriage so I have only met her dad, sister, and brother in law. (sister and brother-in-law is actually our neighbor) To begin with I'm actually Canadian and very much a Toronto city boy from boarding school. My mom lives in SC and so does my girlfriend and her family. I am not very relatable to them because they are more gun-blazing southerners and I have never even hurt an animal before.

Anyways now that introductions are over I should get to the problem. My girlfriend and I were doing the dirty at my house a month and a half ago and her sister walked right into my house like she owned the place and caught us. She forced my gf to go home and almost had a panic attack while trying to speak to my mom (Who didn’t really care that much at all because we are old enough and its expected after dating for 3 months.) When my gf went home to her dad he initially didn’t care either. That opinion changed when his radical son in law who doesn't even have children apparently railed into him about how terrible of a Christian man he would be if he didn't punish his “\_\_\_\_\_ of a daughter.” I guess having his religion insulted changed things up a bit because soon after my gf had her car, phone, and rights basically taken away for a month. Luckily I set up a discord server with me and her that she also thought of and we used that to communicate.

Here's where it gets wonky. A few days later her sister and brother-in-law invited me and my mom to dinner. They told me that they had searched her phone and that she was planning on cheating on me with her ex and was on percocets recently. Her mom gave her percocets after a bad skateboard wreck because shes a PA and had them. I told them that and they got embarrassed because they also knew why she had them and thought I didn't know. By that point I realized they were spouting nonsense but still out of anger I contacted her ex. This dude straight-up asks me if her family told me that before I told him how I knew. We met up and he explained to me why they broke up and that it was also because of her insane family and he just couldn’t deal with them anymore. I believed his argument because it matched what my gf told me but filled in the blanks she left out. When me and her are communicating on discord shes talking to me about how her dad is now going crazy on her and flipping out every night. She had been good for almost the whole month when one night he got wasted and threatened the upcoming college tuition that she saved for by working. (Shes a straight-A student much like her handsome bf.) My mom had been getting harassed over this entire month by my gfs sister for not punishing me and then one night she got a text from the dad, who she barely talks to, about how she is an idiot for letting this “unholy act happen under her roof.” At that point i hated this man more than I thought possible. He and his daughter have been insulting my mom's Christian values for being different than theirs for almost an entire month. However, I know if I say or do anything my gf’s college money may get taken away from her so i refrain from going on a verbal rampage.

When the month ends instead of getting to see her again, her father doesn't give back any of her stuff and decides that he wants to keep her grounded until I contact him. He tells my mom and I do just that. I push down my pride of being someone who has been independent in a boarding school for four years and basically grovel for this dude. He explains to me that this is all her fault and not mine however I have to promise to (I honestly don’t know what he wanted me to promise because it was so unclear and weird. He brought up marriage like a maniac.) he then told me that he will begin slowly giving her privileges back piece by piece. My gfs brother in law apparently went to her house after that and made up a bunch of lies about how I explained to him that I don’t care about her because I'm going to college soon and she has to wait a whole year so I'm just gonna cheat on her. I don't even talk to the guy so I don't know where he pulled this out of. Of course, he didn't realize that we had been talking so we knew that they were just trying to break us up because if we do get in contact with each other we would find out that he and his wife had been lying this entire month and been making up misdeeds that my gf did in order to punish her more.

It has been over a month and a half and she has barely gotten her car back so she can go to her new job as a lifeguard. Also forgot to mention, but her dad made her quit her job at a clothing store that she loved because the 2 fellow employees she shared shifts with were a gay African-American man and a bisexual girl. They are 2 of the nicest people I have ever met and it even made me sad.

At this point my mom wants me to break up with her saying I tried all that I can and she's a great person but these people are extremely toxic and we just can't do anything about it. I understand the point of me breaking up with her but there r three reasons why I just can't. The first is because she has been put into this terrible situation because of me. It takes two to tango. The second is because the only way she gets to go to her dream school (the college I'm going to) is if we are dating. her family really wants her to go to this low achieving college in Atlanta because all of them went but said that the only way they would let her go to (my school) is if she is still dating me. Don’t ask me why it's like that. I have no idea why it makes no sense whatsoever. The final and most important reason is that I really care about her. I have never met such a nice, comedic, mentally strong, beautiful girl and she is the first person I have ever loved. I don’t wanna float my own boat but to put it into perspective I have had many offers during high school but I couldn’t relate or find myself with any of these women so I just didn’t continue those relationships. This one really is special though.

Id love to hear opinions on what I should do or what I should take as the next step cause I honestly really hate her family and I don’t think I will ever get along with them. To give context on why her family is acting this way maybe because her father is going through his fourth failing marriage and her sister and brother-in-law's jobs have been basically fully diminished so they feel the only control they have is by expressing power over a highschool relationship. This explanation isn't me forgiving them, but instead just explaining why they are acting like this.",26May2020,1

775,"Ok so I've been having weird fantasies for my sister for a long time. 

I'm gonna be frank here for the sake of keeping this short. I don't have sexual desires but i really really want to see and touch my sister's breasts (ok nvm this is kinda sexual). But I myself know how screwed up this is so i did my best to suppress it cause I knew the outcome would not be good and it would also cause some serous shit to go down. I'm trying to be a good muslim so I did my best at praying and avoiding everything dirty but I feel like my attempts are becoming more feeble.. But then a couple days ago, I went to offer my sister food while she was sleeping on the sofa and i noticed her nipples and boobs poking out of her shirt. I'm pretty sure she decided not to wear a bra during quarantine or something. But anyways ever since my attempts at controlling my weird thought went down the drain as my brain explored prvsly unimaginable ideas.

One of those ideas is to try and glimpse at her while she showers but i know thats really stretching it so I've done my best to avoid that for now. And honestly i would have asked her abt this but my parents are at home ninety percent of the time so it is quite risky.

Now trust me I know that this weird in multiple ways but for some reason my mind seems determined on seeing her body this time. Just for context- I'm 15 and shes 18(yea I know this is really fucked up for a 15 year old)

And once again i know this is really screwed up of me and i shouldnt  do it but if anyone has any ideas at getting rid of these ideas pls let me know. Otherwise if youve had the same screwed up thoughts as me pls give some tips on how to get to see her.

My mind is really confused on this matter so i decided to post this here to prevent myself from doing weird shit for awhile. And pls don't call me a creep cause i don't intentionally have these thoughts and keep in mind that I've attempted to get rid of these thoughts for as long as i could.",26May2020,1
776,"Hi. I would like to start this off by saying that I'm not here for pity. I pity myself enough and I'm scared I'm following my father's footsteps if I keep doing it. I just need advice, because I don't know how to fix everything I've done. I'm using a throwaway because I don't want to be identified, although I'm sure any of my friends that may see this will likely know who I am. I don't know.

So... hi. I don't have a future and I don't know how to fix it. I need help on *how* to fix it, if I even still can, or if I'm just doomed to be some homeless wreck and if I should just end it now and save myself of all of the hardship.

I'm currently in my second year of highschool, and I've been failing classes since I've been in 6th grade. I'm not sure what lead me to start giving up in everything, but that's where I can pinpoint everything. In sixth grade, I suddenly gave up in school and completely stopped trying, and I struggle to remember anything that could've triggered it. Since then, I've barely made it through school, and I'm practically failing everything now since quarantine has begun. I've had little to no chance of catching up because I'm still at a sixth grade school level mentally and I've only now just started getting help for it. It's been going terribly and I struggle asking for help because it's embarrassing, and I can't retain anything I *do* learn.

I'm gay, and I'm deeply closeted (and plan to stay that way until I move out and I am financially stable, if I even get that far) because of my family's intolerance and homophobia. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of stuff, and watching my friends get into relationships and go on dates and do normal teenager things while I'm stuck here having to keep my innate sexuality a secret is kind of fucking depressing. I don't know if I'll ever be able to be happy with a woman, even if the past few times I was in a relationship I was over the moon. because I'm so scared of being disowned by my family. I want to have both, but I know I'll never be able to.

I on and off self harm, although I was many months clean until this morning (which is what lead me to make this post). Quarantine has lead me to gain a lot of weight and my already insecure self image has plummeted. From 6th to 8th grade, I was actively suicidal, I never found out what caused it, but there are so many times I wish I had took the opportunities to kill myself then because there was no point in staying alive. I suspect that I have ADHD and OCD, but these are things I can't approach my family about because they're distant and I'm deeply ashamed.

I just... I don't know, man. Looking back at this post just feels like I'm complaining about trivial things. I should be thankful for my position in life, I have food to eat, a safe place to live, a family that loves me (albeit conditionally), I'm not depressed and I'm not an incel or anything. I get out, I do things. I have friends and people I love and care about... but I feel so fucking hopeless. I don't know how to catch up in life, I don't know how to pick up since it's all been going downhill for so long. I just need some help to pick up the pieces. 

Thank you for reading. I'm so sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to go to, just please let me know so I can move it elsewhere. Have a nice day. :)",26May2020,1
777," I am 19 years old and I live in the Netherlands. I feel like a total loser,I have no job and I haven't even finished highschool yet.

I was born in the Netherlands.My sister and I were about two years old when we moved to the U.S. Despite the constant bickering between my parents, I enjoyed my life there.Long story short,my parents got divorced in 2012 and my mom, my sister and I moved back to the Netherlands.At first I did fairly well at school, but then in my third year, I started to lose motivation and I skipped school a lot.That lead to me not passing my third year, but instead of doing the year over I decided to go to a new school.This school allowed its students a lot of freedom, we had no classes and were basically free to decide what and when we wanted to study.This did not work for me either as I need structure and organization so I ended up dropping out from that school as well.After that I went to yet another highschool and I dropped out again.Now I am studying from home and I am taking state exams. These exams are slightly different from the ones you'd take if you were attending a normal high school here. They consist of a central exam, which is just a normal written exam and oral exams. Since I dont go to school and thus don't have to take tests, I am never entirely certain if I comprehend what I am studying correctly. Also, I have trouble concentrating on studying because I get distracted very easily.Whats more is that state exams are quite challenging because I have an oral exam in all subjects.I am taking exams in 3 subjects this year and if I pass that leaves 6 more left.I will be taking exams in the subjects English, Economics and Social Sciences. At the start of all my oral exams I will receive an article which I have to summarize and answer questions about, then I have to have a conversation with the examiners about whatever it is I have been expected to work on at home (presentation,book report) .For my English oral exam I have to give a presentation, answer questions about the 4 novels and 3 short stories I read and analyze 3 poems .For my economics oral exam I have to make two reports:one regarding the economical consequences of climate change and the other about how a shopping district might look in the year 2050. For my social sciences oral exam I thankfully do not have to prepare anything. I really do not see myself succeeding at this. Going back to school is not an option for me, so I dont know what to do.I had my first (written) exam today. It was a writing assignment, I had to read the scenario given and write a formal letter based on the info given.I totally fucked it up.I forgot how to write down the adresses, I couldn't figure out how to translate the elements that were supposed to be included in the letter to English..etc. My mind just totally blanked and I couldn't concentrate.Seeing as I cant even manage to pass the simplest exam, I dont see why I should bother trying with the rest.I'm just very stupid. I dont understand anything that I read, I am unable to articulate my thoughts clearly/concisely and I am a very slow thinker,it always takes me a long time to come up with decent answers.",26May2020,1

He won’t come down for dinner unless my parents directly tell him because he refuses to listen to me if I try to tell him. He even does this when he’s literally in bed under the covers he’ll start storming out his bed to usher me out and slam the door closed. (Btw I do knock everyone before going into his room)

Whenever I’m in trouble he always takes my parents side and will add to it if he can to get me in even more trouble even though I literally try to defend him from my parents when they get angry at him because I know how it feels.

Sometimes I hear my parents downstairs ask him what I’ve been doing in my room (when he knows for a fact that I’m doing my uni work because my door is open and the route to his room is past my door) he will always say that I’m probably wasting my time on my phone or being lazy to try and get me in trouble. 

Lastly, he absolutely hates it when anyone tries to hug him or literally anything like pat on the back or out arm around him he will always try to dodge it, if it comes from me it’ll normally be additionally reacted to with an attempted elbow to the ribs, I haven’t tried to hug him in months.

I know brothers fall out and annoy each other all the time and whatever but he’s been acting like this for months and I genuinely feel like he hates me. Right now I just leave him alone and even if I occasionally reach out I still get the same reaction as if he wants nothing to do with me. Is it puberty? Is he just an asshole?

9 years ago, I was in high school and new to twitter. I wanted to be famous and i started trolling on my account where the tweets would blow up and get me tons of retweets. Most of them would be stupid memes but also distasteful jokes where I would joke at stereotypes or be racist. I am not actually racist. These tweets were never directed with hate as most of my friends that I  even consider family are black. They would always laugh at these tweets or give me ideas and the tweets would get alot of retweets. I always would ask them before I tweeted something what they thought and they would be like ""post it thats funny af its not bad racist"" I was so close with all of them, in my community I was considered allowed to say the n word ( obviously not in a racist way but to refer to someone or a group of people despite whatever background they were, this was considered completely okay where I came from where it was a pretty 50/50 highscool for white to black students but growing up and realizing this definitely was not okay) The thing is, i was so dumb and immature with no idea stuff like this would be online for ever.

Not being egotistical but giving you a perspective of who I am with anonymity,  I am one of the best people you could meet. I have never been in trouble, I have always done good and known by everyone to be one of the nicest people that will look out for anyone with the biggest heart. I can promise you that any body that knows of me, would speak very highly of me if you asked. I have stood up for alot of racial injustice and protested and stood by friends at rallys and have also reflected that on my social media. I want the world to become a better place with this and I do not have one single ill intention in life. I am an artist and the artists i work with are majority black and I am apart of alot of different groups that I consider family where I am either the only white person in the group or a very small percentage of it. I realized how negligent I actually was to my privilege many years ago and I promise you I am not the young kid i was in highschool that wanted to be a ""savage"" on the internet so i could get alot of followers.

I changed my @ name in 15 and cleaned up majority of my tweets that would be considered racist or insensitive to any community in any way. I use my instagram and twitter for good and I bring alot of awareness to injustices when i can. Twitter used to be a place where everything was jokes and it wasnt taken seriously, 12-14 were some dark years on twitter. But now, you cant scroll three tweets without someones whole entire life being cancelled. Its scary as f\*ck. Theres some old quoted tweets when twitter used to actually ""quote"" tweet your tweets with your @ name and parenthesis that have some of the racist jokes I posted from back then and my name is in them. 

I am so scared that it literally has been eating at my mind almost every single second of the day just tearing me apart with guilt. I am so ashamed and disgusted to even see my name next to some stuff like that and it messes my stomach up to the point where I have lost 22 pounds during quarantine. I cant think about anything else

I dont have many friends but majority of the friends I do have, are black. Twitter now a days is so quick to search up some old tweets, send them to your job, get you fired, get the world to hate you and ruin your life in seconds. I dont want that to happen. I want to still help the issues others are facing and as an artist, I know my influence will expand one day but when my fans keep building up I get more nervous more of them will search it. I dont want to be known for that, I want to be known to be a help which brings me to two things...

&amp;#x200B;

1. What can I do more as a white person to help make sure I am doing my part for any injustices?
2. Is there any advice on how I can get these tweets deleted? Some of the accounts have been inactive for 5+ years. I have reported the tweets more than once on 3 different accounts. What can I do to make sure they get deleted? Should I dm them and apologize to all the accounts that tweeted them and ask them to delete it and hope they dont blackmail me? Should I pour my live savings (i have none) into finding a h\*cker to get into their twitter and delete them??

I am not sure why this is bothering me now when they have been up since 2014, I am alone most of the time and I dont really have a ton of close friends. Should i even be worried? Its been 6 years and nothing has happened but twitter is an evil place and people love to ruin lives and I am so scared to lose all of my friends and everything I worked so hard for that I am barely holding on to now.",26May2020,1

785,"Hi reddit,

I(f15) received a call from the provincial police a few minutes ago, telling me my dad(m61) has gotten into a serious car accident and will be in the hospital for a while. 

I’m fearing for the worst now, as his alcoholism has only gotten worse throughout the years, especially since the last time I saw him near the end of 2019. He is very unhealthy. He didn’t leave the house for all of winter and only ordered pizza everyday for the duration of the snowfall in our province. He has gotten multiple broken bones from falling over while drunk, had multiple serious nose bleed due to alcohol related complications, and had been punched unconscious my my 17 year old brother. My mother and I don’t think he will life to see 2021.

I’m mostly concerned for my brother right now. He is a great guy, but is easily manipulated by our dad. He’s the only one who can trigger such anger from my brother. He has done nothing but my brother like garbage(ex: verbal abuse and emptied 20k out of my brother’s university fund), and my brother still feels guilt for our dads current state, and let’s him borrow money off of him all the time. It breaks my heart.

I on the other hand cut off all ties with my dad in February of this year. It wasn’t easy but I gave him the decision of choosing between keeping a relationship with me and going to rehab, or drinking. I don’t even have to say which one he chose. 

He left me with horrible memories throughout my childhood, including physical and verbal abuse. 

I know I did the right thing by cutting him off. I have no regrets about that. I just don’t know how I’m going to feel after he passes. I’ve never faced death of anyone who I am close with.

Any redditors who have dealt with the loss of a cut off mother/father, please let me know how you handled it.

TLDR; verbally&amp;physically abusive dad that I recently cut off is currently dying and I’m not sure how to cope with loss, as I’ve never lost anyone close to me before.",26May2020,1
786,"so i needed advice from the community about this and what i should do, a few weeks ago a “friend” of mine got charged for driving without a license, failing to stop, dangerous driving, possession of drugs, and possession of a firearm, he got put on bail and on a curfew and has a court date in july, a week or so after that he got pulled up by police and got searched, now i dont know if he had anything or not but his girlfriend who is a close friend of mine told me he gave the police my details as he was out past his curfew, an hour ago i got stopped by the police saying i look a bit “suspicious” got asked my name i got searched blah blah usual process and then they asked if i have been in trouble with the police before ( i haven’t) and i said no and they said yes you have a drugs charge or something like that i can’t really remember what they said but it was something about me having drugs before, i asked them if they could tell me the date of when that happened and they said no. I now know its my so called “friend” who was responsible for this, i asked him about it and he said no he didnt have anything on him that night but the more i think of it the more i realise he is lying, what should i do?",26May2020,1
787,"There is this boy, I have been in love with him for almost three years now… he knows that. He is so kind and so caring and I love him so much to the point where I would write poems and songs about him regularly. We are close; we share our problems and help each other out. We talk very often. I am a very hard person to read because I am very indirect when it comes to my emotions. But, he understand what I really want to say and I can read him like a book. We can read each others’ minds through text especially. He has a girlfriend now and he ‘loves her to bits’ and it really shows that he does. =( So, I had to stop expressing my emotions to him because it would be unfair and suspicious for his girlfriend and I do not want to break their relationship because he seems happy and I want him to be happy. We still talk but I hardly get responses from him maybe because he is busy. It breaks my heart to think of him now. I have distracted myself but almost everything reminds me of him. I have played the piano or guitar but those remind me of him. I wrote in my diary but that reminds me of him. I have tried following the advice I give to others but those are not working. Whenever I fall asleep, I dream of him. I think of him a lot. The only thing I can do is let go but I do not want to do that and he sees me as a best/close friend and he does not want me to leave him because I mean a lot to him. But, I also feel like I annoy him when I text him. When I stopped talking to him the way I normally would, he sounded like he was crying and I felt so bad because I love him. I could remain as friends/close friends with him but it would hurt. When I text him, I forget how hurt I am so that is good but then I remember and it sucks really. It hurts so much but I will forever love him… thank you for everything…",26May2020,1
788,"Ok so for context we met in a shared housing program for homeless women. When I first met her she had a job and was hard working. We bonded because we both used to smoke after work together when we got home. Well to make a long story short we decided to get a place together. I being a bit more financially stable was able to secure a place (providing the deposit furniture and even buying her girls their bed as well.) I also was able to get a second car and let her use my other one so she would t have to take the bus. She mentioned how she was going to get money from a settlement she had made a while ago. She stated she was going to buy the tv for the living room and a play station so I moved my tv, sound bar and play station to the living room for the time being. It’s been 6 months now. She’s already gotten her settlement money but I assume she blew it all already. I’ve been paying majority of the rent (1400/mo) and when we had first moved I was paying the rent myself. She’s claiming that she still has a job but I never see her work. I took it upon myself to call her place of work to see if she’s still employed there and she currently isn’t so she’s been lying to me. She never really cleans only half ass cleans (she’ll wash some dishes and leave the rest for days, never sweeps or mops I do that) she also brings over so many different people (men) she barely knows either. These are things that we had discussed prior but they don’t seem to stick or she doesn’t seem to care. Oh yeah I recently changed the lock on my bedroom door because I found out she was bringing people in here to have sex with on my bed. She didn’t even try to cover it up. The condom wrapper was on my bed and my pillows and blankets were thrown about. She doesn’t pay any consideration to others as well. She’ll play music loud as hell during the night when she knows I work all day. She screams her daughter EVERY morning. I don’t know how to confront her about any of this because she’s naturally an aggressive person and will turn physical because that’s just who she is as a person. This months rent I only have enough for my half and I’m afraid that she will say she’s short and we’ll be late on rent this month. But I just can’t keep paying for her half of the rent anymore nor do I have to put up with this kind of behavior but again I hate confrontation and I’m a people pleaser plus I feel bad so fast for other person even if they’re in the wrong.

I want to lose weight but i have a mother who makes everything about food bc shes also been overweight all of my life and so has always been on some kind of diet but she always did it in front of me and i think part of it caused me to develop a binge eating disorder, as since i was little its always been about restricting food but its not like anyone cares about that so im not gonna recover so i think ill just stay big.

790,"I have divorced parents and primarily live with my mom. I am also 18 years old. Currently I am visiting my dad and my step-mom. I rarely get to see him because he is thousands of miles away so I always try to have a good time, and be easy going while I am here. Though, every time I am here visiting I end up getting belittled by my step mom over stupid shit. This has been going on for a long time but I try putting up with it for my dad. I try so hard to do everything perfectly, I listen to her, I don’t disrespect her, and she still finds something to critique. I am human and obviously will make mistakes, but it is so draining trying to be here and upkeep this facade and still get criticized for stupid bullshit. 

Sometimes she doesn’t get mad at me but criticizes me over things that do not matter. For example, I was digging through the cooler trying to find the drink I wanted. She then criticized me for touching the tops of the cans because that is where we will all be drinking from. My hands have already been washed and we are supposedly family so why does it matter? I don’t say anything though and just try to ignore it and listen to her even if it is stupid. 

Currently though she is pissed at me because I forgot to put away a dish I had laying out. My dad came up and told me “Hey you left a dish out, can you bring it up and clean it?” I then went downstairs almost immediately and picked up the dish I forgot to put away and did so. Meanwhile they’re in their bedroom and she is throwing a fit over it! I come back up and continue cooking breakfast for myself. They come out of the bedroom and my step-mom asks me “Are you cooking breakfast for everyone or just you?” I responded hesitatingly and said “just me...?” Then she said “how considerate of you.” And walked off. My family wasn’t making breakfast today and my brother had made his own meal yet I am being scrutinized for cooking my own? In my head I was just like what the fuck. I still don’t say anything rude to her and just try to ignore it. But now it’s just this awkward stand off and I don’t think she’ll stop unless I say sorry to her or some bullshit. 

She always does things like this and I’m just tired of having to spend time with her for my dad and her cause issues for me when I am barely here! She has ruined my times with my dad almost every time I come to visit. At this point, I just want to go back home and be able to relax without this constant bitching. Do I need to confront her? Or talk to my father about it? I just want this to end, so I can have good times with my dad.",26May2020,1

So a majority of my teenage years I was in a relationship. 13 to 20 to be exact. We broke up this past Christmas and I have been kinda wild just living and having fun. With this has come a lot of depression and being played. I have made the decision recently to just try to be alone to figure myself out since I really don’t have much to pride myself on.

There is a constant want to have people around because I’m scared of being alone, but I know it’s best for me to be.

793,"I (19M) came back home just before the lockdown from uni and i spend most of my time in my room (what else is there to do?). whenever i come out into the kitchen my mother always makes comments on how i’m fat and that it’s ‘her right’ as my mother to comment on it. i’m not fat, i’m 5’5 and chubby, i have a few stretch marks and i could loose weight but it’s not anything serious enough to always mention it - i’m insecure of it but that’s okay ish.

Here’s where the main issue is, i have issues with my food. i used to be bad when i was younger and i lost around 30lbs in a month, and i think that my mum compares me to my body then. i’m growing and hormones etc mean i gain weight but also whenever i start to eat normally and healthy amounts of food she always comments in eating too much. My older sister is very underweight and my mum also comments on her weight too. My mother herself is chubby, her body proportions don’t help her, so i’m confused. Since coming back my mental heath has declined so badly and i’m struggling to be healthy esp with her in me ear calling me fat everyday.

I’m scared that out strained relationship is going to get worse and that i’m going to get mentally worse just to make her stop commenting on my body. I’m already insecure as it is.

Any advice how to help this situation?

796,"Hey people,

I have an issue that is really bothering me. I joined a new school in 2017 and was bullied quite badly for the first year and only had one friend. I was super close to this friend and we would hang out all the time. Over the second year of school he kinda left me for a few months and became really close to another guy. After a few months we started becoming closer again and we eventually were much closer, though not as close as we used to be. In my third year of school, this year, two new friends joined the group, one was the guy my friend left me for the year before. Now I was very close with these guys and I really enjoyed this friend group but I’ve always felt like I’m not a core feature to it and just a side character. Like if someone was to be left out it would have been me. Now during quarantine and as it eases down they’re starting to meet up again but with far more people. I am quite socially awkward but I am also an introvert and I haven’t met up with them yet, I don’t want to. Like I don’t have an urge too see my friends. They also all are becoming wannabe gangsters which is really not who I am, which just makes me even more out of place when I’m with them. This really hurts me as I’m realising my friendship will soon be over with the only non-family members in my life over the last 3 years. I want to become friends with them again, but they are just changing even more and more everyday and I just can’t seem to catch up. When I was younger I had plenty of friends and as I changed schools I became distant to the but one thing I remember was that my friendship to them was natural, like I would always want to see them and they would always want to see me and it’s just not the same. 

The big issue is that there is nobody else I can be friends with. I am unpopular so all the popular kids are out of the spectrum, then the main group outside of the popular kids are basically the nerds, they’re nice guys but they just don’t like doing some of the social events I like such as partying or getting in trouble lol. Then there’s my group which I soon won’t be friends with anymore. The last group of kids in my school are nice and fun and I also used to be good friends with them but I messed up as one day I was in a bad mood and they made a harmless roast on me (just like friends do) but I was in such a bad mood I just clicked and beat the shit out of them so they don’t like me anymore.

I really don’t know what to do. They’re planning on meeting up tommorow with a bunch of new guys but I really don’t want to. It would mean a lot of some of u guys could give me some advice on what I should do.",26May2020,1

798,"My entire life, I have always been absolutely wigged out by, and unable to deal with catty girls. I don't mean to sound like an ""all women are bitches and they're jealous"" type, as that's not true, and I believe in supporting other women and genuinely want more female friends. However, it is true that although there are nice girls out there, in certain environments cattiness happens a lot.

I tend to deal with this the most when I'm in environments where the people are actively making bad life choices. At the first serving job I worked for 1.5 yrs, it was a great environment where most of the girls were nice, and I had very few issues from anyone. Looking back, I now realize most of the people at that job were full time students who lived one town over and all attended the same university in that town.

I'm premed, which means I mostly take STEM classes now, and I've also noticed that out of the many girls I've studied with one on one, had study groups with, done labs with, etc., I cannot think of a singular incident where a girl was passive aggressive or rude. In fact, a good portion of the girls I've met have been really nice.

However, I just worked a job for the past year that was an absolute fever dream in terms of cattiness. It got to a point that there was a girl who I barely spoke to and hadn't seen in months who was posting about me on multiple social media platforms, none of which I follow her on, a girl graffitied something mean about me in one of the closets, an awful, older female boss who had a reputation for giving young, attractive girls hell (and not just me - she did this to pretty much every conventionally attractive girl at the job) lied about me on multiple occasions, and even went as far as to take up for a guy who I had briefly talked to for around a week, but who I had attempted to cut off because he was severely violating boundaries and making me uncomfortable.

The job was an absolute hellhole, and my mental health kept declining the longer I stayed. I was kind of shocked that behavior like that was the norm there, as it wasn't the norm at my previous job, and I hope it's not the norm for other environments I'll have to encounter in life. I noticed that most of the people there had severe alcohol/drug abuse problems, many of them were proud of the fact that they either didn't go to college or dropped out, and they seemed to really despise people who weren't into the whole drugs/partying scene.

The problem I'm having is, when I'm in an environment where I feel threatened and stressed, particularly when a girl is aggressive to me after I've said literally nothing and have done nothing to her to deserve it, I wig out and fall back on a coping mechanism of making myself seem ""lesser"" in order to come across as less intimidating and get targeted less. I will make myself seem naive, sheltered, ditzy, and sometimes even outright stupid as an attempt to come across as more harmless and to not be viewed as competition. At times, this tactic has worked, but oftentimes, while girls may be less likely to see me as competition, instead of being nicer, they jump on that weakness and it makes my situation worse. My boyfriend has watched the huge difference in my personality based on my environment, and he's commented on how differently I act.

For the first few weeks I was at this past job, I was determined to keep my mouth shut and keep to myself, which I did, but almost instantly, several girls began being catty to my face while completely unprovoked, and it stressed me out, and I fell back on those coping mechanisms. It's like I get into this caricature that I can't break out of, and it's nothing like my real self. I come from a background of heavy domestic violence and some other problems, so I struggle a lot with anxiety, and while pills I got on in February have made this, as well as all the other symptoms of my anxiety better, it's still an issue. This persona I become causes me to hate myself, to be so embarrased of how I begin to act, and to feel even less confident than I previously had.

Is there anyone here who struggles with this? I can't seem to find anything about it on the internet. Is it a form of disassociation? It's like I go from very competent, intelligent, wellspoken, etc. around people who I view as unlikely to be threatened by me (like school friends), but turn into an absolute incompetent airhead around people who I can tell don't like me from the start. Even some of my close friends have commented on this extreme change. It's really messing with my ability to function, and I want to overcome it.",26May2020,1
799,"Hello there! TL:DR at bottom!

I feel like I have to start with this: I can't really decide whether I'm ashamed of my ""type"" or admitting to it in front of my family. Maybe both, but I'd like to think it's the latter because the former would make me feel even more worse about the whole situation.

Growing up, I always heard my mom talk about women on the phone with her friend - not trashing them but - mentioning how these people ""gained weight"" or how they are ""bigger"" or anything. It was ALWAYS her very first thought. Even as a kid I didn't know why it was so important to stress...especially since she didn't stress the body of slim/skinny women. She prefers skinny people, I figured as much.

Now, as an adult still living at home sadly and not seeing a chance to leave soon, I still notice the pattern. Mom talks on the phone, if someone she mentions gained then that's the first info. Plus I am single currently and my mom seems to think it's a good idea to tell me she saw a girl here and there...but I'm consciously not looking for another relationship due to reasons unrelated.

Anyway, there is a solarium not even 150metres away from my house. I've never been to a solarium - I prefer sunbathing - but my mom goes from time to time. Few weeks ago she noticed a new employee, a girl my age two towns next to mine. She goes on to tell me how cute and pretty she is...but a little thicker than average.

That last part got my attention because I seem to be attracted to *slightly* above average girls. And knowing my mother, thick for her is kind of average. But the way she told it...it was kind of like ""yeah, she isn't as good as your ex but she lives close and she is nice enough"". I thought I was just jumping to conclusions but next time she went to the soli, she told just what I was thinking.

And here is my problem: whenever I take a liking to someone my type I just freeze and can't talk to them not out of fear of rejection but because of fear of getting picked on at home. If I could get away I'd probably minimize contact with my family anyway but until then I need a way to overcome this fear. 

After all, I'd like to be happier and maybe this fear of mine is something that holds me back from achieving more than even I know.

Tl:dr - My mom has a slight bias against girls who aren't slim/skinny. While she never shames them she makes comments about them. But my type seems to be *slightly* above average and I'm ashamed to admit it and believe it holds me back. No way to leave the household yet, want to overcome fear.",26May2020,1
800,"I feel weird talking about this especially because i consider myself (24f) pretty average looking. Anyways i was reading about the halo effect and it seemed like some things that have happened to me fit the description.

Pretty much all my teachers give me extensions without question or alter assignments for me. Ive had 3 teachers bump my grade up by a letter without asking. One female teacher in high school who was rather blunt told me and my class that for the school plant sale I was so pretty she wanted to stick me up front to attract customers. I had a simular experience a few months ago at a job interview as a host at a restaurant. The first time i met the manager she said wow your really pretty. We talked for a bit then she hired me saying"" you'd be perfect here we need somone up front whoblooks good and is friendly and can do the job of course."" She never looked at my resume.

803,"Hi! 

So i have had my wedding planned for this coming August since last year, and I started my current job in January 2020. Last week we finally purchased our flights (we live in a different state than our families and will be having the wedding where they live) because we’ve been putting off because of covid. So since I now knew the dates we would be gone I requested the time off from my manager. Now my job is entry level, very not important (in the sense they can get by without me for a little while) and I also have 10 days of PTO that I can use until December. I work in a school and we are given 10 PTO days each semester - I requested 8 days (considering we have to fly back home and help prepare everything, have the wedding, and then go on our honeymoon as well during this time period). I figured that since I have the accrued time and gave my manager three months notice, there should be no issue. I was wrong. 

She sent an email back saying basically that the beginning of the school year (starts middle of August, and I requested to leave August 26th-labor day) is too important of a time for me to be gone and that she is “willing to compromise” by giving me September 3 and 4 off. I feel like the reasons why I cannot really “compromise” in this situation are pretty obvious lol. 

I haven’t responded yet because I honestly don’t know what to do. Like I said, my job is very unimportant in the grand scheme of things in a school and while I understand that she would have to ask a few people to cover a few things for me (like cover the recesses I watch, for example) they do it all of the time and the other staff and teachers are very understanding and helpful... I feel like if people knew I was gone for my wedding/honeymoon, which is a very important and significant event, they would be more than willing to take one of my 15 minute recesses a day or something. I’ve always gotten a vibe from my manager that she doesn’t like me very much for various reasons, despite my always being nice to her, and this really just confirms it for me. I did mention in the email that the time off was for my wedding and honeymoon and so it’s not like she just thought I was taking some random vacation either. 

I just really don’t know what to do/say and could use some advice. My mom told me maybe it would have helped if I had let her know during my interview in January that I would need this time off, and she’s probably right, but that just never occurred to me that I would need to give so much notice. I like this job but I also am not about to try to literally plan an entirely different wedding and honeymoon just because she’s not willing to let me use the PTO I have accrued... am I just being a brat or is this actually as crazy as I feel it is? 

TLDR; My manager won’t allow me to use my PTO for my wedding and honeymoon in 3 months. What do I do?",26May2020,1

Around a week and a half to 2 weeks ago I noticed she randomly was in a lot of pain and couldnt jump walk or sit normally. She's usually pretty high energy and this is super unusual for her so my husband and I went and bought her aspirin for dogs. I followed the bottle and gave her 1 pill over the course of 2 days, so 3 pills total (1 every 8 hours). Then she started pooping blood, I immediately stopped giving it to her. We took her to the vet the next day and he informed me dogs should never have aspirin even if its marketed towards them.

She walks so much slower, cant jump at all and can barely do anything. She seems tired all the time and since yesterday has expressed little interest in food. She hasnt wanted to drink water since the bloody diarrhea started so I thought once she recovered from that she'd want water again but she doesnt. I've been having to mix it in with her wet food but now that's backfiring too. Ive looked at the signs your dog may be dying online and shes showing so many.

Today he called me and began to tell me about how he heard that I had drank with another guy, who has been my best friend for 12 years, at my house. He is upset that I never told him about it and that the fact we drank makes it seem very suspicious. To add to that, that friend and I did a sexual thing once about three years ago. So now he doesn't know how to believe me that I am telling the truth. 

It breaks my heart that I have made him feel like this. I've always said that cheating is such a scummy thing to do and that I never think there is an excuse. I couldn't even imagine doing this. My friend also has a girlfriend who is such a lovely girl and making her feel that way would crush me even more. I can see how he could feel that way, but I was in no way hiding that my friend came over that day, I just never said it to him because I'm so close with the other friend that I didn't even think of it as something bad.

I have no idea how to prove to him that I did not cheat on him. I can't imagine ending things with him because I love him with all of my heart and always make an effort with him.

I'm looking for some solid advice for my current situation. My grandfather has been noticeably declining in health for a few years now yet absolutely refuses to make an appointment or see a doctor in any capacity. He has several chronic health conditions that he has been diagnosed with (COPD, high blood pressure, etc.) Yet refuses to do anything about it. He is a Vietnam vet so all appointments are covered through the VA and with COVID-19 this has become a breaking point for myself and my sisters with how little he takes care of himself. I have offered to drive him, make appointments, etc as he can barely see anymore. I will certainly speak with him again but I want to know what a healthcare providers stance would be and maybe provide some pointers as to starting the conversation and hopefully opening his mind to the idea of taking care of himself.

It seems like it’s affecting my confidence to do my work also, which before this present position, I was sure I could do my job blindfolded.

819,"Think I sold my soul

Im 17 and I’m about to graduate in about like 4 weeks. I was a true believer but I lost faith in god 1-2 years ago I would say. I went on a family trip to nepal and we went to this temple called “pathibara”. And people from Nepal/ most Hindus say if you climb up to the hill and reach the mountain you “supposedly” will be a better person all around, Get most things that are reasonable that ask for. All I ever wanted back then was good grades, For all my family to be happy and looking back man I wasn’t as greedy I would say. I mean everyone has their own opinion‬. I truly believed in Hinduism and all my family members are very religious. The reason I lost faith in god was because I never asked for much I just wanted to make my parents feel proud, I hated myself since I was a kid but now I have came to realization of that. My parents always used to and still say I’m a failure, always compare me with all of their friends child. “Oh look Jessica got 90s+ in all classes and look at you, sometimes I wish that kid was my child...blah blah blah. I mean I ain’t even gon put the blame on my parents too much because they have always provided me with most things I wanted , gave me proper care and food and a roof to stay under and I’m very grateful and aware of that. But materialistic things and money doesn’t buy love. They never cared to ask “how do I you feel”, “how hard is school?”, also sending a kid to tutoring won’t do shit, tutoring is one of the biggest scams you can get into in my opinion 
and to be honest I probably am and im sorry for that and not reaching their. I have a lot of conditions which I never open up about. I have adhd, I’m bi polar, I have a lot of fucking panic attacks like almost every hour or so, I also have social anxiety(I can only talk a lot to people I’ve know for a long time ). But back to the story fuck my sobbing and shit. So After 2018 winter or so I slowly lost faith in god. I just kept telling myself no one likes me not even god and god just hates me and this life I live is a punishment. Ever since I’ve always been curious what if I just sell my soul, thoughts like “ if I’m already so miserable why not just sell my soul how worse can it get”. I don’t give a shit ago fame, all I ever want and been wanting is inner peace just happiness. In truth and no exaggeration No one likes me, no one cares about me from their heart I’m a loner always hated. Most people I know or came across always just make me feel like I’m the worst person they’ve come across. I’ve always been that person everyone uses for their personal gain/financial gain. I’ve been nice to everyone I know, I care for people, I tell them what is wrong and I’m almost always frank and straight forward. I’m not into kissing ass or being a yes man.
And I think this is all because I sold my soul to the devil without knowing. Ever since 2018 I started smoking cigg, weed. 
Do most drugs I could get my hands in.
Acid, percasets , xanx, OxyContin, to name few. And ever since all I want to do is find myself Only thing I’m really into is music and I’m so fucking trash I can’t explain it and that’s why I have a second thought I haven’t sold my soul. I know whoever is reading this think I’m just dumb, delusional, full of myself  and retarded but if anyone can help pls help. It’s a lot of shit I can’t explain just in one post.

I work very hard and had to learn a lot of new things, most of the stuff was new and adjusting to a real job post college is tough. I worked alongside my boss with a similar role to mine, who at the time was leading a department, and in December 2109 my boss moved up filling in a recently vacated position. He was technically still in charge not me but I was left almost entirely on my own. Since then I have basically been leading my department, the youngest there by 4 years, and the next closest guy in age works directly under me. 

I have basically free reign of whatever I want to do with hardly any oversight, plus I have to give jobs to some people under me and supply information and run meetings for the rest of the department. And yes while this probably sounds like the dream to some people I only have 10 months of experience under my belt and I am incredibly overwhelmed. I've lasted till now, but working from home has been really tough on me, I'm stressed, anxious and barely get anything done each day. My lack of productivity is hurting the department, and I don't know how to solve it. I'm trying to work really hard, I just feel like everything is on my shoulders. Am I just freaking out about nothing, is this just normal work? Am I just being weak and need to tough it out?

827,"Hellooo

I've been loving to perform since I was kid but I didn't have a lot of opportunities. I know I am into performing art. I wanna choose performing art as my major back in college but my family opposed it because they said I would not able to find a stable job after I graduated especially in Malaysia. During that time, I thought my parents words are true. Even if my parents would let me choose performing art major back then I would definitely failed the audition because I can’t sing. I never sang since I was in primary school due to some trauma. I don’t go karaoke with my friends because I was too afraid to sing. So I choose another course for my college. I joined dance club when I was in college because I will get the chance to perform on the stage. I did few performances with my friends back then. However, everything stopped after I graduated. I even cried during my last stage because I know how much I will miss them after that. I really missed the feeling to be on stage and the sleepless night preparing for our performance. Even though we are not professional dancers but I did enjoyed those moments.


I still couldn’t stop thinking about it even I got my first job after graduated. Performing art in Malaysia does not have bright future according to my family. Only 9am-6pm job can make you financially stable. Im not young anymore according to them. I am 25 years old this year. People said I should not think about it after I graduated in 2017 and should find myself a stable job that pays well. I have been working for 2-3 years now but I still think of this everyday. These days I been thinking about it even more due to the lockdown.  

I have been spending a lot of time watching musical theatre videos lately and wish I could be part of it. The thing that I most concern about is I can’t sing. But if this is something that I really want, I need to start learning singing first. I hope it won’t be too late for me to learn singing. 

Do you guys think that it is too late for me to learn singing? because I heard it is hard to change my voice when turning adult.

828,"Heyy,

I'll try to keep this short and sweet but I need some inspiration right now. 

I graduated law school in 2019 with a 2:1. I have an offer to do a Masters in International Law but it seems like a waste of time and money in the grand scheme of things. 

Right now I have some boring customer service job and tbh I'm staring down the barrel of just plodding away at this job gradually moving at glacial speeds up the ranks and not really making something of myself. 

The past few months have basically been me madly jumping from one extreme idea to the next, from the military to another degree in a different field to god knows what else in a frantic attempt to find something that sticks.

I'm at the point where I just want to take a year out to travel my heart out and maybe come back with some fresh ideas but I don't feel it entirely wise in the face of a global recession.

I'm ambitious for sure and capable.  I know if I put my mind and energies towards something, it'll happen but Im just a bit clueless and apathetic as to what?

I'm interested to hear from other 'formally directionless' people on how you got out of the rut and found something you're interested in?

&amp;#x200B;

A couple of points:

\- I was aiming to be a Barrister (the lawyer not the coffee maker lol) but the qualification fees are upwards of £19k with no funding. The legal market is so saturated with desperate law grads it seems more of a gamble than a career path.

\- I look through job postings to see if there is something that grabs my interest and nothing does. 

\- I've tried listing down what I do/don't want in a job and see if I can find a match. Closest I have come to a decision is Paramedic, but there are numerous blocks relating to funding a second undergraduate degree.

\- Tried the usual mind maps, lists, maybe searching professions via Google Images to see if a visual stimuli works haha.

\- It's a bit tough at the moment to find any other work experience or whatever because I a) Have a job that I can't just skip out on for a placement and b) Corona.  Im not sure how to really test the waters on a new career path.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone with any idea's on how to get out of the mind trap or can tell me what they did, I'd be grateful! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

\- Graduated law school

\- Highly apathetic and directionless

\- Any ideas how to fix??",26May2020,1
829,"Back story: my parents don't trust me to succeed at anything, they wanted me to go to art school but since I'm in sciences, they just want me to get a job as quickly as possible. I was in a really controversial and political college so I decided to quit bc constent riots and cops gave me panick attacks at some points. I was in maths and computering fields.

I still love maths, but I've discover the healthcare field and I just want to work in it.

Now.
I've applied to med school and nurse school. Where I live, they're both free, and the first year of med school can lead me to others fields in healthcare maybe more interesting than nurse if I can't succeed to become a doc. I wasn't bad at school before getting to my college.

So my parents wants me to do the nurse school because it ends in three years and I'll have soon enough a job. They don't believe I could be a doc. This means that if I want to try med school, I'll surely have to ask my grandma to take me at her house or take a credit to find a cool place to stay.

However, I REALLY want to at least try medschool, I know I'll have regrets if I don't try, and it's only one year, after I'll know if im accepted or not. And if Im not I will go to nurse school.

Fast forward to covid me and my counterpart decided to split the stores and work those stores by ourselves and I start noticing this man in the store I’m working literally every time I’m in there so I make sure to figure what he drives and take a pic of his plates and that was in March.

We’re moving out at the end of the week and we made a list of who is responsible for what in terms of cleaning. I took on more of the list, and even split bigger things like cleaning the fridge with her. We decided to split the fridge, so I took the freezer since that was a more daunting task with stuff being frozen to it. She saw me cleaning out the freezer the other day and asked me if I was already packing my frozen food (even though we weren’t moving for over a week so that would make no sense... but I digress).

Yesterday she said she was going to clean the fridge. She cleaned the door and and the bottom shelf. I thought she was just starting and would go back to it, but she texted me earlier to talk about the things she would finish when she got home and the fridge wasn’t on there. I mentioned that the fridge  could use another cleaning and that I would help with some of the grosser parts. She asked for pictures (attached [here](https://ibb.co/Zz8d7S3), [here](https://ibb.co/pWMJTsK), [here](https://ibb.co/h8HCqQf), [here](https://ibb.co/MNtkP42)), so I sent them to her. She told me that she only cleaned the things she could reach. I told her she should empty the fridge to clean it thoroughly. She then said that some of the stuff she tried to get off wouldn’t come off. I told her that I had quickly wiped something and it came off.

She was coming back at me with a million excuses as to why she didn’t clean properly instead of owning it. I told her that annoyed me and that it's not something she needs to be defensive over. I told her I’d clean it so when she got home from work she could focus on cleaning the other things she had on her list. Then she sent me [this text](https://ibb.co/VvKt0Ps) essentially saying ""sorry you don't feel like I didn't try"". 

To me, this felt, once again, really blame-y. Like my expectations are way too high, when in reality she didn’t do a good job at cleaning.

I’m nervous that with the things she has left to clean that she’ll continue this pattern of half-cleaning and I’m not sure what to do.

With this whole social distancing crap going on, she’s been stuck at home with her 55 year old leech of a son. Doesn’t pay rent, former druggie and alcoholic. Anger issues. The whole nine yards. My family and her have never been too close except for me. For the last 22 years I’ve been at her beck and call whenever she needs me for whatever time and vice versa we both are very close. Recently though I’ve needed a mental break from everyone so I texted her this morning “ hey just letting you know, I’m taking a 2-3 week break from social media and electronics, nothing personal I just need to take a break” which I don’t think is anything to be ashamed of. 

She texts me back : 

Ok. Don’t know what’s going on over there since no one bothers to keep in touch. You were my only real contact but I guess you need to do what’s best for you. I have your little brothers present here but there doesn’t ever seem to be a good time for me to drop it off.    I was going to see when you would be home for me to bring it over.  

At this point I’m so frustrated about everything I don’t know what to say or do.  Like I said no one keeps in touch and now I won’t even hear from you.    I have a lot of thoughts going on in my head and I guess it’s time to just let everything go and do what I have to do. “

I really don’t know how to react to this. Am I being selfish in saying this is fucked up of her? Holding me accountable for her misery? I love her but for all the shit she’s done over her life to start drama in the family, she plays devils advocate way too damn much and I’m sick of it. If she did hurt herself. I would be the one to blame and live with that guilt forever.  Like I said before this isn’t the first time she’s pulled crap like this, 
When I was 15 ,18 and now 21 she’s done this. I can be certain if she’s going to do it but she’s always complaining about how miserable she is, but whenever anyone is with her all she does is complain and bring us all down. She hates everyone and everything then bitches when no one wants to be around her and then the rest of us look like assholes because she’s “an old lonely grandma with no one to talk to” I’m at a loss for words. I texted her back “I’ll still stop by and see you it’ll just be in person not over the phone” 
No response.  I don’t want anything to happen to her, but this feels like such a toxic relationship and any time I try to break free I look like an asshole. I just have no damn clue what to do anymore.

like on lower lights, when its no equally distributed on my nose, it looks bumpy and weird

dunno if everyone's like that tho

but on even lighting, when its directly hitting it, it looks normal

i do know that its a bit crooked, but i mean, doesn't everyone have a crooked nose?

how do i know if its actually something needing fixing?

and i mean aesthetically

like i have angles, like one or two, where it looks extremely extended and it looks hella weird, and im almost pretty sure its cause of the tip being turned to a side

but again, how do i know if its something worth fixating on or not?

848,"We're in our mid-20s and have been married just over a year

Two nights ago (Sunday night) my husband added one of his old exes from years ago on FaceBook and was talking to her The next afternoon, (Monday) but deleted their conversation.

When I confronted him about it, he didn't deny or try to hide it. He admitted to it without hesitation and gave his reasons. 

This was the explination- He doesn't rember how or why he added her as he'd been drunk. (We were drinking together that night, but I'd fallen asleep at this point) he just woke up to a notification saying him and  the ex were now friends on FaceBook, and in fact at first he'd thought she'd sent the request to him. She messaged him and he had responded, because he saw no reason to blank her or be rude. (They haven't spoken since they were teenagers so don't really hold any animosity towards eachother at this point) He'd then ended up deleting the conversation because he had no desire or reason to keep it, and he knew if I'd seen it would just cause unecesary upset. He said apparently he'd spoken to her about me and how we've been TtC for a year without luck, and if I saw that he thought it would upset me that he'd mentioned it.

 I'm not sure how to take all this. If I'm honest I do think his Explination sounds somewhat reasonable. If he was drunk possibly he could've added her accidently with the slip of a finger and not even realised. Maybe he'd just been looking at her profile out of curiosity, (I Wouldn't really mind if he had, I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong it, it's something we've all done and doesn't have to mean anything)

What he said about not seeing reason to ignore her when she popped up to him makes sense to me too. Though I don't really want him talking to exes I also wouldn't expect him to completely blank one if she tried to speak first, no need for that. If an ex messaged me I'd probably reply at least to see what they want.

I Can kind of understand his reason for deleting the conversation, just so as not to cause any unecessay fallout. He didn't realise at the time that I already knew he'd added and been speaking to her, he thought it was easier for me to just never know rather than have to explain it and potentially cause an argument. I'm A pretty insecure and sometimes jealous person, and I have admittedly been somewhat toxic about it in the past, (It's a flaw a battle with) so I could see how he might be afraid of me seeing it even if it's innocent, in case i overeact. In all honesty, in his position I may have done the same.

Up until now he's never given me any reason to think he was cheating with anyone, he's not secretive with his phone or anything like that, and we're almost always together so he hardly has opportunity anyway. He has a few female friends/aquatences from uni or gaming, but I've seen his conversations with them, they're innocent and he talks about me a lot.

Another thing that adds reassurance is that on FaceBook he is very obviously married. His profile pic is our wedding day, I'm also in his cover photo, his relationship status says married to me, his bio mentions 'my wife and dog' and as soon as you go on his wall most of the recent posts are with me. Basically he does not have the sort of profile someone would use to try and talk to other women.

Despite all this though, I can't help feeling like I'm being niave. Part of me wants to read their conversations (I Know there's ways to recover it) but I'd feel like I'm being needy or toxic if I asked that of him after we've already settled it. Also if I do see something incriminating in there, what an I even supposed to do? Then I've just upset myself. So long as he's not talking to her anymore does it matter, am I better just leaving it?

He would sometimes be manipulative and mean if you got in an argument with him, but since he has moved away he’s changed a lot.  I didn’t talk to him forever after highschool and then when we reconnected, I moved to the beach near him , and kind of went through a rough patch and ended up loving back to my home town. I guess I really kind of let him down and he lost respect for me as I screwed up a lot when I lived near him. But that’s not the problem. I’m kind of a real goofy person always have been. And since we have been hanging out, he just like trolls me and makes fun of me after a everything I say. He acts like he’s my friend but won’t hardly make plans with me or respond, and when I do get him to come hang out with my other buddies , he just comes over gets drunk with them and then makes everyone like make fun of me. He’s so rude and mean but like plays it off as like he’s joking. And most of the time I just have nothing to say back, so I don’t know how to stop it. And then everyone picks on me , and it just really bothers me. What do I do about this? Just stop talking to him? It aggravates me so much because he picks on me and it feels as though
There is nothing I can do. Part of me feels like if I just punched him in the face he might start respecting me more and I would feel a bit better.

TLDR: I went away to college fresh out of high school. At the end of freshman year I came home. 2 years have passed, and I want to go back but preferably to a different school.

So, I graduated from high school in 2017. I had been dealing with a fair amount of shit life had been throwing at me and was excited to leave my home town and go to school in NYC. Things went pretty smoothly to start, but in the middle of the spring semester I fell into a pretty deep funk and wasn't going to my classes. I ended up withdrawing and ended the year with very few credits and not much positive to look forward to. I had hoped the time would allow me to clear my head and get back on track doing the things I loved and intended to do in school and as a career. 

I instead ended up working a job that I didn't enjoy but was really good at, and planned to go back to school the following fall (2019). Things were mostly on track, but (and I'm not saying this for sympathy) my father who had been battling cancer for several years got far worse to the point I had to take care of him full time until he passed away in late June 2019. Around that same time, I got laid off when the company i worked for closed my location. All this is to say, for a variety of reasons I was not ready or able to return to school the following month.

Fast forward 10 months too long to now. I want nothing more than to get my life back on track. Ive dealt with the personal shit and established myself to a point, but college is the next step i want to take. I'm just overwhelmed and don't know where to start or anything really. Like do i apply as a transfer student, do I see if a new school will accept AP credits that my old one did not, and many more questions. 

Honestly, I'm just not sure what to do, and I feel like I'm very much on my own with it so any advice would be greatly appreciated. I hope this info is enough to give you all a good idea of where I'm coming from but if you have some questions that would help you help me I'd love to answer them.",26May2020,1

857,"My neighbours have a child (10?M) with severe autism. He has in recent years been given a trampoline in the back garden, and according to my neighbour, trampolines are advised for children with autism to allow them to tire themselves out and get all their energy out. Since this trampoline has arrived, the child bounces all day screaming, and this will not tire him out at all. He will scream and bounce all day every day and will continue to scream and run around indoors into the night. 

This would normally happen all day every weekend, and every week day after he would come home from school, but since nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19, he starts bouncing and screaming every day from morning until late evening every day, and we don’t have much escape from it. A walk a day or some essential shopping can only get us so much time away from the never ending screaming. My family and I cannot sit in our back garden on a sunny afternoon/evening. 
We have tried playing music so we don’t hear it, but this violent screaming is very hard to drown out, and we have noticed if we play music louder he will somehow scream louder to try and compete with the sound of music, which defeats the purpose of looking for some peace. The child has also a habit of climbing the wall that divides our back gardens, and staring at us and screaming if we are in our kitchen/back garden. We have also noticed he has been throwing things such as shoes at our dogs if they are in the back garden too. At one stage he threw a full bottle of bleach into our back garden, which could have been ingested by our dogs or, heaven forbid, the child himself.

We have considered speaking to our neighbours about this, but I think it’s fair to say at this point that they don’t really care. His mother never tries to tell him to be quiet, and his father only very seldom does. They lock him out of the house all day, and let him scream his guts up without any supervision. We are afraid of any confrontation, because at the end of the day, we have to live here and these are our next door neighbours. We are also afraid of being branded as discriminatory towards autism by our neighbours and the community.

We have considered moving, but this house has been our family home for many years, we aren’t in the financial position to move, and my parents are getting older and need to stay close to their family and the facilities our nearby town has to offer. 

We do not want to make enemies next door to us, but we are at the end of our rope. We understand there is only so much his parents could potentially do as well, but they make absolutely zero effort to keep him supervised or stop him from screaming. We are also concerned about the child, because this constant screaming and bouncing cannot be doing him any good, and he seems to be often left unsupervised.

Anyone that could offer us some advice would be greatly appreciated. My mother starts crying at times because she feels so trapped. We are all going insane from this horrible demonic screeching all day every day, and we are too close to tipping point. 
Thank you if you have taken the time to read all of this.

858,"Some background info: 

I started out at the company as temporary help around the office. It’s a small general contracting firm. I am the only office employee, everyone else is an onsite worker. I’m also the only woman. 

My boss is a family friend. He knows my parents really well, his kids and my younger siblings hang out often, and he’s over my parents’ house pretty often as well. Their relationship is how I got the job in the first place. 

It’s been a year and a half that I’ve been there, now. I gained more responsibilities, started doing more outside the office— meeting clients and going to site meetings when my boss (the company owner) wasn’t able to go. I never had an official job title, and only got one raise about 8 months ago. But my responsibilities keep adding up. Looking at other job descriptions in the same field I’d consider myself a Project/Office Administrator. 

Now to my issue. Since COVID we’ve had to temporarily close the office. I’ve been doing a few things from home, but the majority of my work is office related so I had to take a massive pay cut. At one point (for a little over a month) I wasn’t getting paid at all. My boss never mentioned anything about filing for unemployment. I’ve seen him on occasion at my parents’ and he calls me thrice a week to send some emails/check up on stock. But he hasn’t mentioned anything about when we’re supposed to return to work/what’s going on with payroll. 

I can’t just not get paid. These last two months I’ve been lucky enough to cut my bills in half but they’ll start piling back up in June. I’ve used all of my savings on rent, utilities, groceries, and bills I needed to continue paying. It was a huge bummer because I saved that money to buy a new car. Now I’m car-less, savings-less, and essentially job-less. 

Another “problem” is that I recently found out I’m pregnant. I’m super excited to become a mom and start a family with my love but the problem is I have zero benefits at this job. The company doesn’t have disability insurance so I wouldn’t be able to file for disability when maternity leave time arises. I’m still under my parents’ health insurance for another 1.5 years but once the baby comes it won’t qualify for my parents’ insurance, but I still would. BUT my baby needs health insurance too. 

I’m still in the first trimester so I haven’t told my boss yet. I was planning on telling him whenever we returned to the office. But now I’m reconsidering going back at all. 

There was an incident regarding unemployment for another employee. The employee wrongfully filed because they quit before COVID. And somehow it’s my fault he filed. My boss blew up on me about how he won’t be able to pay payroll because he needs to get a lawyer to “undo this mess” and how he might have to close the company. I had no idea what he was talking about and I tried to explain to him that I had nothing to do with it but he wouldn’t let me finish a sentence. 

It left a bad taste in my mouth. I have a feeling there’s some illegal stuff going on and I’m in the middle of it. Even though I had no idea about any of it. 

But what bothers me more is that he took this out on me instead of, I don’t know, calling that former employee and figuring it out. This isn’t the first time he’s blamed me/gotten really pissed at me for making a mistake I didn’t know I was making. 

He expects me to know things without being told. He never apologizes after being proved wrong. He is very short with me and mansplains the simplest most common sense stuff. Like I’m some idiot. 

I got the job because I have a college education (in an unrelated field). He told my parents he needed help because work was picking up and he wanted someone with an American education. He reached out to me for the job. 

He’s an immigrant (as are my parents) and I often have to proofread his emails, analyze legal documents, speak to new clients, etc. because of his lack of understanding English. 

I want to quit. I can’t keep walking on eggshells trying to avoid saying/doing something wrong when I don’t even know what I could potentially be doing wrong. I hate how he makes me feel too. He talks to me like I’m some imbecile. 

It’s frustrating to say the least. 

I just don’t know how to go about quitting. I was planning on telling him I’m pregnant and need a job with benefits. But I also don’t want to be pregnant and interviewing for new jobs. I know it’s illegal to discriminate against pregnant women but who the hell is gonna hire me when I’m going to need paid time off in just a few months? 

My boyfriend makes a decent living but not enough to support the both of us, a newborn, and my ridiculous student loans. 

I need advice on how to proceed. Should I stick it out and quit towards the end of the pregnancy? Should I say goodbye to this job and start looking for something different?",26May2020,1

862,"My bf and I recently moved in with his mom and she's one of those people who are customer service nightmares. As a specific example, I just spent 2 hours on the phone with our internet provider trying to figure out why our connection cuts out and is generally slow. Ended up not being able to solve the problem due to them not sending technicians into homes because of the current pandemic. 
I used to work in a call center so I didn't mind waiting and being transferred to different departments for 2 hours and I dont even mind them not being able to fix it. But the whole time she was impatiently and angrily talking in my ear trying to get me to tell them what I was already telling them. After hanging up I let her know whats up and she's been mad about it and wants to call and complain when all they were doing was their job. She wasn't even the one on the phone so I dont understand why she's getting angry at the wait times. My bf is also upset but not outright angry. I feel like if anyone has the right to be upset about it its me since i rely on our internet speed far more than her and my bf combined, but I'm just not bothered. So why should they be?
 
It takes a lot to make me mad, and I've never felt the need to complain about bad service. I genuinely don't understand why anyone would. Maybe I'm just too easygoing or I've worked enough customer service jobs to understand what they're going through, but her throwing a fit about things like that makes me more angry than anything else in these situations. It always embarrasses me so much even when we're at home with no one else around. I feel like im the target of her anger even though I know I'm not, and I get super embarrassed and find myself stuttering and trying to say anything to calm her down. Its like this with most of my grandparents and extended family too so you'd think I'd be used to it by now.
Is there anything I can do to convince her (and my own family) that having to wait for service and customer service making mistakes are nothing to get so angry over? Or am I just not getting mad at things that I should be mad at? How can I stop being so embarrassed when things like this do happen?",26May2020,1
863,"Hello Reddit, I’m in a bit of a pickle.
So for some background, I’m a freshman college student majoring in mechanical engineering and I’ve been working in an on campus office job all year. This job is basically my first “real” job as I’ve been quite sheltered all my life.

Receiving this new job has been great as I help Highschool students get college advising and give them info about my university. During winter break however, my friends and I thought it would be fun to apply to summer internships. I didn’t really think I would get accepted as most companies hire junior/senior students, but to my surprise, a very well known local electric company has offered me a job for the summer (online of course because of the current pandemic, but I will still be getting “experience” from it). I was ecstatic to hear the news but a sudden realization hit me. How do I tell my boss this? 

For some reason he has this idea that I will be working with him for my entire college career but obviously I need more experience than just “working an office job” if I want to make it far in the field of engineering. I’m worried he’ll get offended by this since we are low in employees and has been very patient with my many rookie mistakes. 

How do I even go about mentioning this? Do I send him a months notice and a lengthy email? Do I call/video chat him? Do I need any paperwork? 

The internship starts in July so I have more than enough time to let him know but that time is slowly starting to run out :( please help",26May2020,1

865,"Hi everyone. I'm a 18 year old who's set to graduate high school in two or three weeks.

I'm currently only taking two classes, a Photography class and the required Civics/Econ. I have 100% in the Econ class.

However, recently I've had some pretty shitty circumstances. I was working full time, got too exhausted from poor eating habits, sleeping \~3 hours a night, working full time manual labor, and trying to balance all my other obligations- so I passed out. I fractured my shoulder and was hospitalized. When I got out, my license became suspended, and now I have a pending court trial. I'm back working full time again, and trying my best to balance all these new things I need to worry about as well as academics. 

My Econ teacher has been super understanding and allowing me to turn in work late and miss meetings while I prioritize more important matters. However, I've been falling pretty significantly behind in my Photography class. I have a 43% (failing, obviously) and several missing projects.

I don't need the class to graduate. If I got a 0%, it wouldn't affect me at all. And it's quite difficult for me to take themed photos when I can't leave my house (license suspended, and where I live you can't just walk around with a camera down the streets, especially at night) 

Would it be in my best interests to just fail the class, and brush it off? Should I try to get the assignments in and finish strong? If I brush off the class, it's possible my dad will get pissed and try to force me to do the work- I'm an adult, I would leave, which would strain our relationship further. Brushing them off would give me a bit of a break, which is something I desperately need- I'm in a much worse situation in terms of mental health than I was before I passed out and got injured. I respect the teacher, and would be ashamed of myself if I let her down since she was a pretty good teacher. And I enjoy photography- I just don't enjoy graded photography with deadlines and forced themes and such.

I'm leaning towards brushing it off, but I don't know. What are your thoughts?",26May2020,1
866,"I have lupus, and i just started working again today. 
I won’t qualify for unemployment anymore, and I was really saving EVERY single dime of it so I can save up for a new car or replace my engine. 
I was wondering if it’s true that I can keep unemployment only if I work so many hours in a week? 
Plus I’m not comfortable working since all of my coworkers aren’t wearing any masks. 
I need to cut my work hours anyways because I’ll start school this fall semester.

868,"Hi! New to this sub so apologies if I break any rules.

I move to LA from MN in August with my partner of 8 years. We had lots of great opportunities and it was the right move for us at that time. 

I landed a job with a software company that started out great but quickly went downhill. I have two extremely abusive bosses and have been looking for a new job since March.

Then COVID hit, all new jobs in my field disappeared. A bit discouraging after only being in the city for about 7 months. Then last week, my old company in MN reached out and told me they want me back. I loved that place and my boss. The company culture is night and day compared to my current position. 

The thing is, I JUST moved to LA and was just getting started here. I had made lots of traction and was finally starting to get into a grove when CoVid hit. I wouldn’t even be considering leaving if Covid didn’t happen. My industry probably won’t be coming back soon and I’m too new right now to really find any new jobs so I’ve been thinking that maybe it’s the best thing for me to move back. But deep down I don’t want to move back. I would feel like a failure.

Also my partner told me he wouldn’t move back with me, so if I take this job then we’d either try long distance or breakup. 

So, should I take this job and move back to MN and leave LA? Will I regret it? Idk what to do",26May2020,1

However, I am just now starting to realize something: are Americans *all* bad people or am I just associating with the bad ones? My experience with Americans has been consistently negative, but I am starting to realize that most Americans I have associated with are very low-class, unintelligent, uneducated individuals.

He would mostly just go and play video games with his friends or just go to their house and come back hours later. He would also lie and act like he had something to hide when he doesn’t, he would literally show me what he was doing. I trusted him but it felt like he never trusted me. I tried everything to keep us from breaking up and tried to communicate but I was always give I don’t know as an answer. We had a mutual breakup because he said he’s just not ready for a relationship but he knows that he wants to get married to me in the future. He said he needs a year or two to mature but I don’t know if that’s just an excuse to hangout with his friends. He also didn’t tell me years back he wasn’t ready because he was afraid to lose me but I would have understood if he wasn’t ready, we could have still been friends and hanged out till he was.

875,"Context: I am 24(F) currently living with my mom during this pandemic. She and I have a complicated relationship (and always have), but in the past few years we've had a mostly functional truce. 

The biggest threat to this ""truce"" is her reliance on alcohol. She drinks 1-2 bottles of wine a day, but usually hides the bottles from me so I can't call her out on how many of them there are. She is not as subtle of a drunk as she thinks she is, usually slurring and occasionally falling over (which worries me, as she's in her mid-60s). 

Recently, her doctor asked her to refrain from drinking for two weeks, as her blood pressure has been incredibly high + they're looking for solutions. She lasted 3 days before I found more wine bottles. I told her we needed to talk, and that while I'm not trying to pick a fight, if she's going to drink, she needs to tell her doctor about it. 

In short, she told me that I am being controlling, calling her a bad parent, and that its her business, not mine. She admitted to hiding the alcohol from me but stated that ""everybody has secrets"", and if I'm not willing to air out all of mine, neither will she. 

But, it kind of feels like it *is* my business. She's actively putting herself at risk against her doctors orders, and making it incredibly difficult for us to cohabitate during a time when neither of us really have anywhere else to go. 

I am looking for advice on how to approach this situation without putting her in a position where she feels like she needs to be defensive, or just ways to deal with this- because at this point, it's taking a very real toll on my own mental health. Thank you!",26May2020,1

It lasted for about thirty minutes and most of it I could hardly even realize where I really was. At one point I said to myself I was at work. Looked at the people around me and almost vomited.

885,"Growing up, I was considered the golden child. My father and mother were married and we lost him from a traumatic accident a month after I was born. Then she had 3 more after he had passed with my father's childhood best friend who she now hates. When my siblings made a face like their father or acted like him she would be upset, but I made her happy when I resembled my dad. She was more keen to tell me happy stories or to take me to memorials or camping trips while the others stayed home and have never camped... I never realized until I was older. I just thought I had to because of who my dad was and they were usually therapy camps because my dad was a cop. Anyways, we weren't struggling growing up because my mom was able to sue for my father's death and she split the share between her and myself. She decided not to tell me this until I was 17 because she didn't want it to influence my decisions and for me to be responsible with it. This is important because she told me that people will ask for money. Even people within our family and I should tell them all no. So, continuing on with my mothers advice, the first person to ask was my mom........................

She had run out of her share and she wanted me to help her buy her house because she had it refinanced after it was paid off.... (I did enthusiastically let her know my interest in my childhood home, but I think I was too young to be part of that negotiation, considering I was a freshman in college....) She was upset when I went to college and told everyone I had already left her. She would scream and cry at me and say she is the reason I can afford anything because she put the money there for me and that I owe her because she took care of me with her share. I tried to plan a nice trip and she screamed at me because I wasn't taking her, but I was taking my sister. It didn't happen because I shared a card with my mom at the time so she could watch my spending and she was denying my flight payments. Makes me feel spoiled to say I tried to plan a trip for myself and it's not like I wasn't spoiled growing up. I will admit I was, but growing up I was her personal mom helper and I took care of the kids, cooked meals, cleaned and organized. I didn't do it all, but I didn't have a life or a chance to have friends since she made us travel 5 hours every weekend to her boyfriends... another awful story, but the point is. I wanted my freedom and I wanted to be able to take a trip when I wanted and I had to leave once I was able to. She made me feel like my purpose in life was to make her think of my dad and act happy all the time while taking care of her. I counted down till college and I felt so free once I made it there, but I feel conflicted. I did leave my mom. I don't see her anymore now that I've graduated from college. I had walked out during her crying fits (she would cry then scream at me and cry then scream at me. I couldn't say anything and I don't want to be trapped there with her).... she's a good person. Really loving and caring, but she's stuck mourning about my father still and I feel like I'm making it worse and going back will trap me again. That is my greatest fear... being trapped with her and forever trying to make her happy or doing things for her because I have to. I just want to be free. Please, any thoughts? I know this is deep but I feel so lost and my family judges me because I shouldn't be like this to my mother. I've been called a spoiled brat, I've been ignored, and I don't want to lose my family. That's all I have.... I just can't be with my mom. 

I grew up with her around, but we weren't close and we didn't talk that much. She didn't even attend my softball games or she would have me miss games to see her boyfriend.... she was happy when I was simply around, I just don't want to be stuck with her. I feel like I really need her away, but I don't know how to truly get away and be happy. Please, any thoughts?",26May2020,1
886,"I honestly don't post on reddit, but I read a lot and just wanted to let this issue out of me and hopefully you guys have insights! 

I met a friend last year at school (we weren't classmates but same department) and we got a connection because we were both same country foreigners at this school. Since that first day of school, we would always hang out everyday, but since her class is in the morning (8am-12nn) and mine is 1-3pm, she would wait for me outside of my classroom till my class ended and we'd hang out after. Everyday. I honestly didn't think much about it with the thought of her doing her classwork while waiting. 

During those 3 months of school, we would hang out often and at some point I felt like I have no space for myself. If I didn't want to hang out she'd be disappointed and start feeling sad, so If I had the capability to go, I wouldnt refuse. Sometimes I would I say I wanted to rest at home, but she would ask if she could come with me (to my house, to rest). I couldnt refuse because I was thinking how she'd wait for me after class so long, only for me to go home. She doesnt mean any harm but I did feel uncomfortable when she'd ask or tell me too much. I've let her know that I need space too but after a while she'd forget about it. I purposely fought with her once to get myself some distance but somehow we made up and made that made the 'friendship' stronger. I didn't know how to bring it to her about my feelings, I've also let our mutual friends know, but at that time our mutual friends and was thinking that since she was gonna leave soon, I'd let her be.


After that 3 months she left the school and returned to the country. I'm still in the same school to this day and she keeps in touch everyday via message. If I didn't reply on one platform she'd message another and another until each of our social media conversations had its own unique topic. She was overseas so I didn't mind talking to her, but we'd talk about everything and she wanted to get specially involved in my things. Examples: 1. I told her I was writing a report, and later on she sent me a full report on my topic. 2. I told her I was moving house, she helped look for places to the point she had a lot of listings and even offered to talk to the landlords for me 3. I told her I was getting my official documents renewed, and for some reason she told our mutual friends that I'm getting MY documents renewed (I just found out today from a friend) 4. She would message my classmate or a friend I tagged on my story if I didnt reply to her. The list goes on and on.

I got overwhelmed and scared because I want to have my own privacy and things to do so I decreased my reply to her to once a day, and slowly to none at all. It would bother me If I didn't reply but I honestly don't have much energy to reply and continue the conversation. I eventually muted her and today she sent me a long message asking if she did/said something wrong. I didn't want to have a 1 on 1 conversation so I had a 3rd friend (mutual friend) in the chat and explained my situation. Its been a few hours since I've sent it, she's seen the message but hasn't replied. 

Am I overreacting? What should I do?
 
(If you've read so far, so sorry it's so long, this has been bothering me for nearly a year now and I'm so anxious and everything)

888,"I recently became close with someone with narcissistic tendencies. They constantly talk about how ""no one can compare,"" ""no one else is on \[their\] level,"" they are the smartest, hottest, funniest, all-around best person to ever grace the planet. They never have anything nice to say about anyone else, denigrate the character of all so-called friends, and constantly tell stories that make themself look good. They'll regularly bait you into saying nasty things about others.

This isn't my first experience with a narcissist. People like this make me a worse person by recalibrating my sense of normalcy. (It becomes ""normal"" to be arrogant and cocky, to nitpick at others' flaws, to focus on the bad parts of other people.) When they're finally finished with me, I realize I've become someone I don't like. I've realized that I need to set firm boundaries with the new narcissist, if not completely cut contact.

My other friend is in deeper than I am and doesn't seem to notice anything's off. On the one hand, if my non-narcissistic friend is comfortable with this behavior, I don't want to pit them against each other and put myself at risk.

891,"Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this. I'm not sure what to do and don't have anyone in my life I can talk to about this. 

My husband (H) (30m) and I (26f) have been together almost 8 years, married for 5 this spring. A couple years into our relationship, he confessed to me that he was raped and molested by a trusted family member (A) for years as a kid/teen. I was the first person H ever told about it. A was never caught at all, and obviously never faced any consequences for it. After H told me about it, he sought counseling, and has been doing therapy twice a month for years. He's made fantastic strides in moving on from the trauma, and I'm infinitely proud of him for that.

The other night, H called me from work and asked me to log into his old email account to look for a specific piece of information. As soon as I logged in, I noticed an email from A. The subject line said ""I miss you"" with a frowny face. I immediately felt like I was going to throw up. I searched A's name, and found that he had been sending H regular emails to ""check in"". I didn't open any of them, but most included the phrase ""I miss you"" or ""I love you"" in the opening lines. 

I got the info I needed and logged out. I didn't tell H about the emails. I'm truly worried that reading those things from his childhood abuser will bring up old feelings that he's been trying to move past. Would I be justified in contacting A to tell him in no uncertain terms that he should never attempt to contact our family again? Is that a logical course of action, or is that just the anger talking? Should I tell my husband about the emails and let him deal with it in his own way? Would that be harmful after all he's done to move on? Would it be better if I just let it be?",26May2020,1
892,"So my first name is an older German name that’s pretty uncommon in the US. I know people who know people with my name but I’ve never met one myself. On top of that it’s an uncommon spelling. Unfortunately, as I learned in middle school, the front half can be mispronounced as “anal” since I pronounce it like Ann and not like “Ahnn” how it is in Europe. It’s not that big of a bother anymore but I still get a bit self-conscious about how uncommon it is and how often it’s misspelled. I’ve kind of embraced all the anal jokes by now but I wish I hadn’t needed to.

On the other hand, my middle name is Kathleen. Easy spelling, pretty common, and can be shortened to Kate. I’ve always considered going by Kate instead in order to save the trouble in my professional career as well as make it easier for new people. Plenty of professionals go by other names for various reasons. I kind of want to try it out.

So around half a year ago i got myself my first cat since moving out, Caesar. I love him to death as he's probably the cat i've had with the most personality out of any i've experienced in my life.

Anyways, the last two months or so when i go to sleep after about 2-3 hours he will start to complain. He'll meow nonstop untill i get up. He then proceeds to just asl for head scratches and then go away. I'll follow him to see if he wants to show me something. But turns out he just walks to my couch or a basket he has to just lay there and sleep. I will check his water/food bowl to see if there's something with them, but they're ok. His litter boxes are all good aswell, so it seems he just has a big problem with not getting attention.

Is there anything i can do to either stop the meowing like that and teach him to just come and cuddle? Should i get him another little friend to play with? I actually am looking to get another one, but i'm worried the next one would do that aswell, which would just result in me not sleeping what so ever.

When I explain my side of the story, I cry because I feel like no one is listening and I feel bad for her, and my dad just hugs me.
My sister thinks I'm acting like the victim because I cry and because of how I act, even though I'm just trying to explain.
She tells me that I'm the worst person to ever exist, because when I get mad, I do and say things I don't mean. I don't want to be a bad person, I always try to explain things to her and apologize to her. I know I can't change my past actions, but I'm trying to become better.

I will buy some things for room.
I will borrow building tools from my dad garage

901,"Hello everyone reading, 
I'm 18, soon 19 years old and I attend a grammar school, that means a school without a particular specialization. I have one more year to go. When you graduate, you receive a high school degree, but you have no field experience. I've always planned to go to uni, because it is required in order to be ,,useful"" in a certain field after grammar school, but school is just bothering me so much right now that I just wished I'd work as soon as possible.

Now my plan is this: After I graduate from high school, I will take a gap year and find any job that I'll like. I know what I want to study at uni (IT), so if I find a job that is somewhat relevant, it would be the best. But the thing is I just want to take a break from studying and make some money in that one year. I can use my free time after work to study web development and programming on my own, so I either go to uni after one year of working or find a job in this field later on (would be harder without a uni degree).

Do you think it is a good idea? I'd love to hear from people who've taken a gap year and can share their experience with me.",26May2020,1

I try to remain happy and positive and keep my relationships healthy where possible but I’m. Big big big giver, I will but most of the rounds and so on.... since the recent death of our friend I’ve had support from a few people around me,  it the last few days I’ve completely turned on them. I’ve berated them, not supported them through things they’re going through (break ups, Illness, house moves). I just wake up with an internal monologue about how awful a person I am, how they’re working against me and send a barrage of abusive text messages to them. 

I really really don’t want to do it but once I’m on a roll I say the worst most disrespectful things anyone could possibly imagine.

I apologise and then just do it again.

I decided to seek professional help this morning I have help talk lines . I will be checking in with the doctor, I will seek a schedule of therapy. 

I will also pick up excercise in the morning again and try go for a long walk before I start my day so I don’t start it with an abusive message.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Transfer for to an alternative Jet2 Holiday ( the same or different destination)  my advise January 2021 onwards. Any extra cost/ difference will not have to be paid straight away but would be due 12 weeks before your new departure date.
2. Instruct Travel Counsellors ( me) to claim a full refund from Jet2 Holidays and hold the monies on a credit file to be used as and when you decide to rebook your travel plans
3. Claim a full refund from Jet 2 holidays whereby the monies will be refunded onto the same payment method used to pay your holiday . Please note this could take rather a long time to process anything from 4-12 weeks .

Before anyone says ‘confront her’, please know just the thought of doing that fills me with anxiety and dread, I’m super non confrontational and also she is a good friend to me.

She knows during our current lockdown that i am really struggling being separated from my boyfriend and only able to see him for a few hours a week at a distance. She’s also had a blow that she’s having to move out of her London flat she loves and back into her parents due to job loss. This week she’s gone up to London to collect her stuff and clean the flat, her dickish behaviour is 2 fold from here. 
she met up with a super cute guy she met on Hinge. I don’t believe she’s made it clear to him that she has no intention of perusing a relationship with him, I’ve seen their messages and he seems genuinely into her. whilst she was out with him she was arranging a hookup with some sleazy dude she knows from London who she’s wanted to shag for ages, who she knows has a girlfriend. That’s dickish on its own but, as mentioned, we’re in a lockdown and I’m actually shocked at how selfish she’s being, which says something.

906,"My husband (H) (30m) and I (26f) have been together almost 8 years, married for 5 this spring. A couple years into our relationship, he confessed to me that he was raped and molested by a trusted family member (A) for years as a kid/teen. I was the first person H ever told about it. A was never caught at all, and obviously never faced any consequences for it. After H told me about it, he sought counseling, and has been doing therapy twice a month for years. He's made fantastic strides in moving on from the trauma, and I'm infinitely proud of him for that.

The other night, H called me from work and asked me to log into his old email account to look for a specific piece of information. As soon as I logged in, I noticed an email from A. The subject line said ""I miss you"" with a frowny face. I immediately felt like I was going to throw up. I searched A's name, and found that he had been sending H regular emails to ""check in"". I didn't open any of them, but most included the phrase ""I miss you"" or ""I love you"" in the opening lines. 

I got the info I needed and logged out. I didn't tell H about the emails. I'm truly worried that reading those things from his childhood abuser will bring up old feelings that he's been trying to move past. Would I be justified in contacting A to tell him in no uncertain terms that he should never attempt to contact our family again? Is that a logical course of action, or is that just the anger talking? Should I tell my husband about the emails and let him deal with it in his own way? Would that be harmful after all he's done to move on? Would it be better if I just let it be?",26May2020,1
907,"Hi there, thanks for reading. Some formatting may be off because mobile.

My grandpa is 72 years old and is immunocompromised, which obviously didn't stop my mother. 

I have to go over there at least 3 days per week, and work about 3-4 hours per day. My mother constantly has me go over (even in corona virus season) to drive his tractor and truck to do work for him. This interferes with cutting lawns, which I do for a job. And this also interferes with the already minimal time I get to talk to my friends online for. It started out as only Fridays, and then being made to cut her friends law, with my mower, gas, batteries, blower, and weed whacker for free.

This is the first day of summer vacation for me and I'm fed up. I worked Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Today, and will be working Wednesday, Thursday, Friday - again at my grandfather's - and Saturday, for sure. Not yet know if I'll be working Sunday. I asked my mom for one day off and she said yes, and then proceeded to plan this, knowing that I wanted a day off.

I've tried to tell her no, but she goes into a screaming fit, whenever I do so.

915,"Earlier this year, my mom had asked me to move out of her house. 

Understandable. I am currently 22 years old, married with a 2 year old. So I found an apartment no too far away from my moms house. I wanted to make sure I can still take care of my mom even though we aren't living together. 

The plan was to share an apartment with my husband's brother. He's great. He cleans, cooks, and is fun to be around.

A week before I moved out of my moms house, my husband's mother got evicted from her apartment. My husband's two younger sisters had no where to go. (age 22 and 18) So we basically had to take them in or they would literally be homeless. 

His mother is currently living in a extended-stay hotel suite with her husband and her two younger daughters (age 5 and 2) (yes, she is still planning to have more children.) (i know. i know) 

So now, his sisters have been staying with us ever since. 

The first two months were okay. I didn't mind helping them out, providing food, and cleaning after them. Since this is my first time living on my own, I was actually excited to do everything. 

While they were here, they were at least working part-time jobs. The only thing i've asked from them is to help out with the grocery bill. All I wanted was 300 for both of them a month. They both threw a fit and said that 300 is too much and they couldn't afford it. So, they asked their mom to cover that expense with her food stamps. So now, my husbands mom is giving up 300 of her food stamps every month. Keep in mind that’s basically her only source of income right now. 

That's fine, but what I don't understand is why they couldn't handle that themselves? Their mom is obviously struggling with finances and instead of helping out by take care of themselves, they are depending on their mom to do that. 

It's not like they don't make any money. They do make money. But, instead of helping, they purchase things like clothing, make-up, and order food to be delivered through Uber Eats. 

After the coronavirus pandemic lockdown situation, they have been out of work. My husband and his brother have been out of work as well. When we all got our stimulus checks, they refused to give my husband and I any of their stimulus checks to help with the food bill/rent/appliances. His brother even gave us most of his check without any complaints. 

I currently work 65 hours a week from home even during the coronavirus pandemic and it has gotten to the point where I am literally paying for everyone in this house except for his brother. I also started my own business just encase my regular job does not work out. I am covering majority of the rent, the food bill, and all of the miscellaneous supplies we need to sustain ourselves. When it was just my husband and I living on our own, our bills weren't that expensive, but now it has literally tripled. Not only that, his sisters do not help clean the house. They lay in the bed (that I gave them, using the pillows and blanket that were mine) all day long watching tik toks and taking selfies. If I do not clean, the house will be a complete mess for multiple days. 

My husband has asked them to just clean up after themselves a few times. This is their response, “no boy! Ain’t no body told you to clean up after us. Leave us alone. You’re so annoying!”

Here is my current schedule - I wake up, clean the house, get to work, take a break to cook for everyone, continue working again, before I go to sleep, I must reset the house or it's going to remain dirty. On top of that, I need to watch and tend to my child, and please my husband when he wants it. (I don't even want to get started on my husband, long story short - he plays video games. . .  A LOT) I go to sleep at 6-7am and wake up at 11am and repeat that same process 6 days a week. Sunday is my sleep day - and most of the time I go over my moms house to help her with whatever she needs. 

I'm also dealing with a lot of stress from my father having cancer, but it's like they don't even care about it. I have to help him with whatever he needs because he literally is losing his marbles. My husband even said to me today, ""Tell your dad not to call unless he's dying.""

I have asked them to clean, they ignore me or give me attitude. (His sisters) I asked them for money. It's a no. I have asked my husband for help. It's always, ""What do you mean, I'm helping!"" (He washes the dishes once in a while) The brother usually goes out all day. 

I'm not a confrontational person. I'd rather do it all myself then nag someone to do it for me. The space is small and I don't want to cause any tension.

So now it comes down to this, if you were in my situation what would you do? I’m extremely exhausted, no one seems to care, and I definitely do not have any time for myself. 

I’ve recently started going to Panera Bread to go get a cup of coffee in the morning before anyone wakes up. As soon as I get there, I get like 4 calls from my husband. When I get home he’s literally mad at me and calls me selfish. 

I’ve been vocal but apparent, “I’m over dramatic.” 

My mom calls me stupid every time I go see her because of the situation I’m in. 

I honestly don’t know what to do",26May2020,1
916,"BACKGROUND:

Me (16f) and a relative (19f) of mine work at the same facility it's a local carwash. We both run the counter inside the carwash, we both have been working there a little over a year and two years.
Recently, we were bought by a much larger company that runs out of state.

A little before we were bought, we hired some not so friendly people who are known in our local area as members of a local gang. There were a ton of them, about 7 in the beginning. Let's call them the Peter's. My managers knew exactly who they were when they hired them. The Peter's were not shy to hide the fact that they were in a gang. A outside of work incident happened with another employee, the Peter's were threatening to jump him when he got to work. So much as he had to get transferred to a different location. Meanwhile my current managers are making jokes about getting shot by the gang members if they were to show up in there neighborhood. They also keep close with one of the Male gang members who often sticks with them. I dont have a problem with people who live like that. But it is scary to work with. 

I come to work scared every single day, so does my other female relative. The outside employees are not really supposed to come in the lobby or use the customer bath room and normally we tell the employees that. But since the gang members started working there we cant tell them to leave because of how scared we are. They come in and we can't do anything about it. When it's hot I dont have a problem with them walking through the lobby getting a drink or drinking coffee or just sitting in the office. But when its constant it's a problem. The male gang member, let's just call him Ryan, always stares at me no matter what or where I am. 

Apparently the Peter family was hired previously at a different location before we were bought out. And they caused trouble and were eventually fired because of their infamous Gang. One of the managers from a different location told our regional manager about all of this a he said he would work on it but it's been about 3 weeks since then and nothing as happened. 

A few days ago the female relative was training a girl to work the register and ryan was talking to the girl who.was training and caused a scene in front of customers and was calling the training girl fake and calling her different and just completely being unprofessional in front of customers the lobby doors were half open half closed. And that makes it loud and was disrupting customers so my relative asked ryan to leave nicely and he turned to her and told her to shut up and that he can be there if he wants and that she can run that by the manger and that she needs to shut up. 

So later that day the girl who was training told our manager what happend and he took ryan side saying she shouldn't of asked him to leave and that she was being rude. The managers are either afraid or obvious to what is happening. 

I fear for my safety when I'm at work, as well as the other people who work here. 

I'm at a lost to what I should do. Sorry for the long post its alot to explain.

I (F22) need some serious help. I’m at a point in my life, where I literally don't know how to continue living. I don't have any friends, my stepdad makes me feel very uncomfortable (he’s narcissistic and many other things), I have Social Anxiety and I’m pretty sure I also have Depression. I haven't left the house in months (not related to the coronavirus situation). I faked having a job and instead hid in the basement for months on end (because of my stepdad)...I couldn't finish school, because my mom got very sick (she couldn't afford it anymore and my stepdad refused to pay). 

Now here I am. Broke. Faking a successful life for my stepdad who otherwise would kick me out. I have no clue how to pay my bills each day. I sold everything I could possibly sell. My room looks like a guest room or a cheap hotel room. I never go out, or buy new clothes. (Cannot even afford makeup at this point.) I am physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted and drained from all the worrying. 

Last time I had a good job was one year ago. Sadly, I had to quit because I didn’t have the financial means to continue. I don't have enough money for transport, so I can't accept a new job either. It's just one huge vicious cycle, which I desperately want to escape from. 

Recently I’ve had this idea which could probably solve all my problems. It makes me feel very uncomfortable, however, I’ve been taking into consideration finding myself a sugar daddy or worse...selling my virginity. 
This is so not me, but for a better life I’ll sacrifice myself. The problem is however, even though I’m really nice, have good manners, and am very empathetic...I feel very insecure about myself and am quite shy. 

At this point I really just want to give up. But I don't because of my mom. 

Sorry if this was all super confusing and messy...I just needed to get it all off my chest.

928,"I am fully aware of how this sounds but this situation is devastatingly real. Last month I was the extremely unlucky person to realize a singer in a band ‘mouths’ things while they perform, meaning you hear one thing but they are saying something entirely different. (like if you were to say out loud “the sky is blue” but move your lips to say ‘I hate you’.)

Again I know it sounds insane but there’s proof, plain and simple. The couple vids I saw he mouthed really vile things about his then gf, and I had no business doing it but I jumped the gun and told her, sent what i’d seen. It was so wrong in retrospect but I thought she deserved to know. 

Fast forward a month, I completely forgot about the situation until I just saw a recent interview where this singer addresses me directly. He said they’ve got my picture off facebook, that he’s ready to post about me, called me terrible names. (fat, ugly, dumb bitch etc.) The best part is in the public eye he’s a prominent ‘feminist’. 

This is all because I found out he mouths things. I‘m terrified of him, the label he operates under, this conspiracy shit. Most of all I’m devastated that this sounds so outlandish and difficult to believe. If i read it I’d think it sounded crazy too, but I could never make something like this up. It’s far beyond the realm of anything I could’ve ever imagined happening and I can’t explain how lonely the feeling is. 

I’m being threatened and intimidated by a fucking singer that knows there’s a power imbalance. He has the resources. The whole reason he’s threatening me is because they think ill post video proof which could end his career bc he says terrible things. 

This is just black mirror-y, I didn’t realize how serious it was or the lengths him and his label would go to keep me quiet. I don’t even care enough to ‘expose’ him, I just don’t want my life threatened. 

I don’t even know if there’s advice for this really, I just want to be heard I guess. To get it out there. I feel very small. There’s nothing I could gain by making this up considering I am literally powerless. I’m just in a state of shock and im terrified it’s gone this far.",26May2020,1
929,"Not posting personal details because it will certainly skew the advice I'm given, however the situation is a friend and I broke off our relationship due to this being a difficult time for them and my love for them turned obsessive, as opposed to simply very close friends. They had ambiguously reciprocated feelings but withdrew them. We have set a time limit that we will check back in October to see if we want to continue being friends, so I have a good amount of time

Our respective partners understand and are ok with the friendship we have/had, so this is not sneaking around significant others

930,Sorry if this feels rushed. My mom has used Life360 to track my every move for around a year.

932,"Just wondering this. I took a walk today around the block,which took me about 30-40 mins,and it was hot and humid,and I forgot to take a water bottle. As soon as I was near my house my face felt hot and had a slight headache,nothing too bad.I took a small break under a shaded bush then proceeded to go home. As soon as I got home I drank lots of water and i jumped into the shower and had a cold shower. After my shower i went to lie down with the fan on.
My question is,is it possible to get heat stroke even after trying to cool off? I read another reddit post where a guy got it 12 hours after he was exposed to the heat.
Should I be worried or what should I do?

934,"So I started an internship in September '19 alongside my Masters degree. Its a small office, I get along with everyone well, the owners of the company are workhorses and sometimes not the easiest to approach but the other staff are. So I'd been told by a colleague that I was going to be offered to stay on full-time at the end of my internship, which didn't come as a surprise as I had done really well, worked hard and got along with everyone. Then comes Covid.

I usually would work Wed- Fri in the office and weekends at my bar job. Bars shut on the Monday by the government and isolation was put in place. I contacted my boss via Whats App asking about the situation in the office, what to do, should I come in - but also that I understand it's a stressful time and theres a lot to figure.

I sent this as I hadn't been in the office when it was announced and everyone was working from home, something I can't do as an intern but I wanted to make sure I wasn't expected to work Wednesday and not just assume and I also didn't want to put them under any pressure as I'm only an intern, I'm not essential to the company, and they've much bigger issues at hand. However, he never replied and nobody contacted me Wednesday so I didn't work.

No biggie, I don’t mind, I have made my move and now its up to them to let me know. I do however get anxiety thinking about if I am letting the company down in any way. So I message one of the girls I'm close with in there to see if she knew anything about the situation, which she didn't and asked if the boss had not rang me, which he didn't. Again, I explain to her, no stress, I know theres a lot going on, I just want to make sure I'm not supposed to be doing something and that I had a tonne of work for my degree to do anyway. She said she'd inquire and then I get a response from the boss apologising saying they were sorting things out and he'd be in touch the next day.

Again, no call, no info. Thats fine, at least I can relax and not stress over if I should be working or not.

And then two weeks go by, still nothing. I'm talking to my colleague again and she's shocked. I honestly don't care as I've so much Masters work to do, but now I'm a bit annoyed at the lack of communication after 2 weeks, it takes 2 minutes to make a phone call.

A full 6 weeks goes by, I get a missed call from the firm, I ring back 2 minutes later. One of the bosses answers and says she's sorry they're about to go on a conference call and she'll ring me back later. Nothing.

So now I'm here 3 months later, not knowing what to do. For a communications firm, their lack of communication is appalling. I am still silently in the work Whats App group and haven't been contacted. I don't know what to do, its been so long now do I contact them? What do I say if I do? They put me in quite an awkward position, and I did enjoy the work at the time and need them as a reference going forward. I don't expect anything out of them now, or to be going back there to work, as I've since sat all my exams and finished my degree, but I would hate to leave it awkwardly. Please, some advice would be really appreciated!",26May2020,1
935,"Before anything, I want to say that I love my parents dearly and the thought of anything ever happening to either of them is terrible.

But I am getting married this summer to my fiancé who I’ve been with for 4 years, and we are moving up north, about 300 miles and 4.5 hours away by car from my parents and my fiancé’s parents. 

I am an only child and my mother is insistent on moving across the state to live near me, stating she couldn’t bear to be away from me. Like I said, I love my parents, but I don’t want them living near me. My mother has her church, her life, her house in my hometown and she has lived there for about 35 years. She is in her late 50s and I think she’d have a hard time adjusting to a brand new city, which is very metropolitan unlike my hometown. Also, she wouldn’t know anyone here besides me, and I don’t want to be the sole source of my mother’s entertainment as a newlywed and in my early 20s. 

Also, I want her not have as much control over my life as she does now. If she lived near me, she’d force me to go to church and nag at me and judge every single thing I did, much like she does now. I am not really religious in the context than she is, and neither is my fiancé and I want to live my life differently than her, and I don’t think I would have the courage to do that if she followed me.

941,"A little backstory: I met this guy my age (18 at the time) on a dating app. I thought that we'd text and maybe flirt for like a few days and then we'd never talk again, like most of my conversations with guys go on dating apps go. But this blossomed into something that I've never experienced before. We met in June 2019. 

We talked every single day from the day we met. We had so much in common and I was (still am) very lonely at the time and believed that guys only wanted me for sex, which effected my self esteem kinda heavily. He wanted to have sex and I did too, but he also wanted to hang out with me, so I was excited because I saw him as a friend I could vent to and send funny videos too...I wouldn't be lonely anymore. Everything went smooth sailing until January 2020. 

He is very passionate about making music so he told me that he didn't want to talk to me anymore because he wanted to focus on his music. I panicked because I thought that I'd be dragged back into the hole of loneliness  and depression. Yes I was still lonely and depressed, but he helped me through it unknowingly. We stopped texting for about a week and then I messaged him, explaining how much he made me feel better because I saw him as a genuine friend. He said ""Well you haven't done anything to hurt me or anything, fuck it, let's keep talking"". When I say I knew everything about him, I knew *everything*; where he graduated high school, what job he had, his life in foster care, his siblings, his past relationship (he got cheated on). I even know his full name. He said that he'd be sad if anything happened to me and that he trusted me. We were good. 

On May 18th, he said this. 

Him: If you're attached to me in anyway, we should stop talking  :( 

Me: like as a friend or gf? 

Him: gf 

Me: Is this because you want to focus on your music? 

Then he unadded me. 

I texted him two days later, saying basically ""Don't just unadd me out of nowhere. Be an adult and talk to me, tell me why you don't want to talk."" 

He said ""You already know why"" then threatened to block me and I said ""whatever bye"" then I left him on read and unfollowed him from Instagram. Now I had a million emotions running through me: Fear, anger, hurt, confusion; so it just...exploded. I want to apologize to him, but I'm really scared he'll just read my message and block me on everything. 

I'm not sure if being really lonely causes clingy behavior and fear of letting people leave, but maybe I was being clingy and mistaken forcing him to stay because he knew that I was happy with him in my life. I also believe he's scared to start dating again because he got cheated on. I was hooking up with other guys and he knew about it, so I fucked up big time. Probably turned him off.

944,"So yep. I asked a question on Reddit and a guy started a conversation with me. He seemed friendly (now I realise a bit rushed to get my number) so I talked to him. And after a good enough conversation, I gave him my phone number. (I now hate myself for doing that.)

The conversation started fine, but then he started saying things that made me uncomfortable. But I’m a very anxious person and I’m scared of hurting others so I went along with it. I felt pretty much pressured to reveal my name and what I look like.

Yea. But at one point I just left his texts on read because I was uncomfortable. (He talked about alcohol, nudes and stuff that I’m generally uncomfortable about. He texted saying that he wanted to see what my room looked like because “it’s a girl’s room.” This is when I said “excuse me?” And he goes “You read my text bish.” I was so uncomfortable I left him on read.) All this was within one day of texting.

He asked about my friends in a pic he saw of me and them. His reasoning was because “I was too busy for him.”  

He said I didn’t have manners and I’m overall a terrible dumb person for not telling him sooner that I won’t talk to him. 

I was done so I told him I’m terminating contact. He said bye and I blocked him. 

He also proceeded to message me on reddit saying I’m pathetic and lack people skills and stuff like that.

946,"my boyfriend and i are both 17 i’ve been with him for 3 months but is someone i’ve known mutually for a year. 
we are very close but i’ve noticed he has had one friend that is a drug addict and has supplied him with hard drugs when they are together. 
a few weeks ago they both almost overdosed on xanax and his mom found him. 
since then he hasn’t been seeing that friend as often, yet i worry whenever he doesn’t text me for a few hours in fear that he might be with him. 

about a month ago he was having a bad day and drank a whole 26 of tequila. told me he drank it and that he loves me and “just wants to escape reality”  and i told him “there are better ways to cope when you’re upset and that i’m always here” then he fell asleep. meanwhile i was crying in my room worried he was going to get alcohol poisoning in his sleep. 

last night the same thing happened because he was having a bad day he drank a whole bottle of rum and i was so anxious about him. i talked to my mom about it and she said i should text to ask my boyfriends mom to check on him. so i did that and she told me he was asleep. 

my boyfriend is not a drug addict, although i would say he’s addicted to smoking weed. but he hasn’t done hard drugs in about a month i’m pretty sure. and has only drank twice in the past month. 
but i do worry because whenever he gets drugs or alcohol he tends to overdo it. which puts me in a situation to stress about him actually dying one day. 

his parents recently split, and he never has had a good relationship with either parent. and suffers with depression and adhd. 
he thinks that he’s a fu*k up and that he’s stupid. so i try to reinforce those negative thoughts with positive ones. 
he has told me i’m the best thing in his life right now. and he the best thing in mine. 

i don’t want to leave him, so i want to try my best to help him but so young, this is all new to me. if someone has gone through a similar situation or has any advice that would be very appreciated.",26May2020,1
947,"Question at the bottom.

Here's the deal: I started a job in Nov 2019, got married in Feb 2020, and then the pandemic/quarantine started mid-March 2020, unemployed until May 1st. Now being paid to do nothing until the PPP loan ends on June 20th.

After getting married in Feb, the job had less work in the pipeline (and less revenue consequently), so the boss told me that my salary is safe, but I'm welcome to find another job. Then we all got furloughed until the end of April. But now I'm back at work thanks to the Payroll Protection Program, but I have NOTHING to do, and it feels wrong to be taking money. So I found another job, but I need to send my references...

So here's the awkward part, during my whole time working, I worked under a manager, but needed to report to the boss which happened maybe 3 times including the ""welcome to find another job"" meeting.

Now once I was locked in a very small bathroom from outside by a friend and she turned the lights off, the Window inside there was not large enough to fit a human being so I wasn't really scared. I guess it was because I could hear people outside. (I got out in a few seconds)

Now when I sleep alone, with NO ONE in my room which I thoroughly check with flashlight and lock door, I kinda become scared of ghosts under my bed, while going to sleep.

So I guess it's the fear of unknown?

Now it's not really a phobia or any sort of emergency situation. But daim I hate getting scared. I reduced riding rides similar to rollercoasters anymore.

So is it fear of not being not on control?

Idk man... I'm not stressed too, no pressure of money or studies or similar. Maybe because I watch movies that I know what's the worst that might happen to me and that's why I'm scared.

952,"(Throwaway)     My whole life I have never been loved by a motherly figure. Since I was about 2 my mother left and I have been raised solely by my father. I have had a good life, and my father has always raised me well. However, I have never had a mother or motherly figure in my life. The absence of love from a “motherly” figure in my life has led to me seeking out this “motherly” love in my romantic relationships. Now, to clarify,  by “motherly love” I am referring to a woman who essentially coddles, spoils, and protects me with the type of love usually given by a mother or motherly figure. (I do not have an odd fetish, such as incest or dressing/acting as an infant). Due to this, I am attracted to women who are a bit older, taller, or more mature than me. (A little older, I am not a cougar hunter). This has also led to me liking women who take a more dominant role in a relationship.  I don’t like the term “mommy issues” as I am not a womanizer or a misogynist. In fact, I believe the absence of this motherly figure has led to me having a greater appreciation for women.

959,"On a throwaway looking for anonymous advice/recommendations. I apologize if this sounds all of the place I'll throw a TL;DR on the bottom, just getting all my thoughts out here. 

Okay so I am having issues with a friend, to put it bluntly he is turning into an asshole/dick and I have no idea why or how he started to become like that. 

Some context: We are in college now and we have been in a large friend group since high school, I've known him in particular since elementary school. I'd consider him one of my best friends however for about the past month and a half he has really started to annoy me. 

He projects his insecurities very hard and is becoming very jealous of accomplishments/careers in our friend group. We are all in the 20-22 age range and most of us have chosen the computer/engr. path in college while some have chosen business. I'm not trying to put one choice of study above the other but the guys in the tech/engineering industry are getting more interesting lucrative jobs (myself included) and we are not being dicks about it in any way. I'd say for the most part we are being very humble and keeping our professional lives to ourselves when we hang out. 

I am sensing this is the first strong point of jealousy, I avoid talking about my work because I know it is a trigger so I avoid it. Anything that makes him feel inferior in any way I can tell visibly triggers him, almost to the point where I have over-analyzed it and think it's a superiority complex that has always been lurking, some other guys in the group disagree. 

He can't take jokes very well anymore, any time we jokingly tease him or give him shit he gets very irritated and takes it personally. My group is very ""macho"" for lack of a better term and we are constantly joking with each other and giving each other shit, which he was fine with for years but all of a sudden bothers him. He will act very toxic towards us and say actual mean personal things and it takes most of us off guard; we usually don't know what to say.  There was one instance where he said something about my work and it really pissed me off, and I verbally went off; we later apologized but I can tell he held a grudge.

Finally I feel this is important, we play call of duty as a group at least once a week and he is constantly screaming and is hyper competitive, it has gotten to the point where I have been drifting from the game and playing other things. I sometimes give him a pass on this one because I know that some have their fun on COD by being insanely competitive but that's not me, I really don't get frustrated with the game. What bothers me though is he will whine like a child when he is having a bad game and will sometimes just silently quit the match and leave our call. I know it's just a video game, but in my eyes randomly quitting on a team and screeching over a game is something I'd understand a 10 year old kid doing... but we are adults now and he is the only one that still carries this attitude. I don't know if this is completely relevant but I thought I'd throw it in there. 

Many people in my group are noticing this and we are not sure what to do. My gut tells me to just move on, I asked my dad for some wisdom and he advised dropping him as it sounds toxic. I apologize for the wall of text and the poor structure, I just wanted to get it all out there.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Friend is getting jealous/projecting insecurities more and more. Is very toxic on video games, can't handle a joke in social situations. Has randomly become an asshole/dick to us after years of being a chill guy. What do we do with him/say without him freaking out? it is becoming unpleasant to be around him

961,"So here’s the sitch- (this is long, TL;DR is at the bottom) I’m a 15 year old girl, and I was looking to expand my babysitting clientele from just a few family members to friends and the like. A about two months ago, I approached a few people I knew- friends of my parents who had younger kids, and told them if they needed a babysitter to hmu (but more professionally, ofc). A few weeks later I got a FB message from a step-father of two asking me if I could babysit regularly on Friday afternoons, as their mother was starting a new job in a nursing home and needed someone to be there that time and day in between when they got home from school and when their dad picks them up. I was ecstatic, I didn’t think anyone would take me up on my offers and the idea of getting paid regularly was awesome. 

They decided to have me come over to babysit while mom and step-dad went out to dinner as a sort of trial run, but unfortunately that week my mother’s friend visited us and her husband later tested positive for rona’ so naturally I couldn’t go. The same day I was supposed to babysit, everything in my state was closed. So that was the first time they cancelled on me- no biggie, it was very mutual. 

The next time, they asked me to just go ahead and babysit while the mother started work on a Wednesday, but then she moved it to next Friday, so that was the second cancellation. 

Then they asked me to babysit on the next Wednesday (two days before the Friday she was supposed to start work) because the mother was going to visit a friend and the step-dad was on call (he’s an ER nurse). She ended up canceling her outing because her friend tested positive. Boom- third cancellation. 

I’m having trouble piecing together what happened on that Friday (March 27th, I think) but I ended up not going that day as scheduled either. There’s no message history from that day, but they had come around on Wednesday that week anyways because my parents wanted to talk to them about having me babysit. It’s possible they just told me then they didn’t need my help that week. So maybe fourth cancellation there? 

Then they asked me to come babysit the Wednesday after THAT, but their mother ended up with a sore throat so she stayed home. 5th cancellation. After that day, the step father insisted on venmo-ing me $20 as compensation for the fact they cancelled so many times (at this point no one was really keeping track, I just wanted to do something nice for a friend and as someone who follows the same religion as me). This was at the beginning of April. 

Fast forward to May 4th- They ask me to babysit again on Wednesday, the 6th, because the mother was finally going in for training after being sick, I guess. In between Monday and Wednesday, they move the time they need me to babysit and then cancel on me again because they moved the mother’s shift. 6th cancellation. Their step-dad sent me another 10 bucks. 

This brings us to last week. They’d asked me to babysit on Wednesday, the 20th. They sent me a message asking me to watch the kids between 1:30 and 10:30 pm, and I said yes and that was the last I heard from them until I sent them a text the Thursday beforehand double checking they still needed my help. At this point, the step-dad said yes, but for less time because their mother had the day off but he convinced her to have me come by and help out anyways so she could catch a break. 

20 minutes before I’m supposed to be at their apartment, I get another message from the step-dad asking if I had heard from the mom about that day. I said no. Their house, according to the address I was given (which turned out to be the wrong one, but still in the same HUGE apartment complex) is about a 10 minute walk from my dad’s workplace, so I got my things and left, (I had decided to make some cookies to surprise them with) thinking if they didn’t need my help I could still drop them off. Well, as I said before they gave me the completely wrong building number and didn’t include an apartment number so here I am walking through this huge apartment complex. I asked someone what was up and they told me you needed the building and apartment number, so 10 minutes after I was supposed to be at their house, the step-dad gets back to me and says that the mom doesn’t need my help, and then I have to remind him to give me the right address. 7th cancellation, 10 minutes after I was supposed to be there, and I noted the time and I definitely wouldn’t have been late if I just had the right address. I was already having a shitty day, (I started my period, ended up being stranded without anything and had to walk 30 minutes to my aunt’s house right after this) so I was a little pissed, mostly at being cancelled on (the period stuff is my own fault, obvs) and I left without dropping off the cookies, and I didn’t tell them about the cookies either. 

So, keeping all that in mind- I wanted to send them a message asking if they’d compensate me again, and warning them if they keep doing this I won’t babysit but I’m terrified of being rude seeing as they’re healthcare workers right now and the scheduling stuff wasn’t either of their fault. Would I be in the wrong do doing that? 


TL;DR, some friends have asked me to babysit 7 times and all but one of those they were the one to cancel for various reasons- the first time was mutual. I want to send them a message asking them to compensate me for my time the last time (they’d sent me money twice previously, first $20 after the 5th cancellation and then another $10 after the sixth) and possibly warn them if they keep doing this I’m not going to babysit. Wtf do I say without being a bitch? Any help is appreciated.",26May2020,1

Please help (sorry for the long read)

Recently I’ve took up nihilism, which is a belief system. I know their are not a lot of true nihilists in the world just a bunch of edgy teens but recently I’ve gotten quite su1Cidl and lost the will to do anything, anytime I want to do something I just invision in my mind the universe and how big it is and how it will die and nothing matters. I am aware that nihilism is a VERY limited way of thinking and honestly I don’t see a reason to anything anymore and I’ve lost all will to just do anything. The worst thing is I’m aware of how dumb it is and I’m aware of how dumb I am for being like this but I just can’t get away from it every time I’m my mind it just zooms out from earth to show how small we are and I really can’t get that out of my head. I’m quite an emotional and caring person but recently I’ve been desensitized to it not fully desensitized to the point were I’m like a psychopath but I just don’t care for anyone because like I said I just invision in my head everything just zooms out and sees everything like I dot. Care for anyone or anything because when I do in my brain I just come up with why do I care they’ll die anyway and I hate it I really hate it. Like I don’t have a good social life I really don’t have a lot of friends like I used to be sad when my one of my friends showed her and all the fun she and her other friends have I used to be kinda sad but know I just don’t care and other instances like that too. Usually most headlines like ""man kills 5"" or something like that would piss me the fuck off but know I don’t care that much, I really think I’m going to hurt myself and I don’t want to I really don’t want to I’m aware of existentialism and how it is a 100x better form of nihilism but I can’t get out of my head that it’s just ultimately pointless and it really pisses me off that my mind is going it that direction I’m starting to not care about my family and friends but I really do it’s just when I think about my mind just jumps back to “they’ll die anyway why should I care“.

       I’m a bit uncomfortable asking my friends for help on this since they may think I’m a bit obsessive or odd. Essentially, I’ve (22f) had a crush on this guy that I met in 6th grade since day one. Granted, it wasn’t a constant crush all 12 years but essentially whenever I saw him again he’s all I could think about so I’d say it’s more about 8 out of those 12 years. I really feel that we wold be great together but I also have tried to accept it’s never gonna happen. We’re in touch but he doesn’t seem to talk to me much, sometimes we have good convos and some days it’s just painful one word responses. We’ve sexted last year which I regret cause now I feel that might be all he wants from me when I’ve always wanted more. I don’t really see him in person too often but would run into him at school, and even then he didn’t really talk to me. He talks to me more on snap/text IF he does. Anyways, how do I move on from this? It’s very mentally draining for me to be hung up on him and always itching to hear from him or over analyze every response. Any advice?",26May2020,1

I live in a small town with the pinnacle of work here being a factory, I can’t handle it mentally. I grew up very poor and not in the best household, I’ve been working jobs I hate since I was 14. I had to get my diploma through night school because I was working so much I was falling asleep in class. I haven’t stopped working... just moving up wherever I can but I don’t really see a point anymore. I am an incredibly hard worker and I want to devote that work I to building myself. I’ve Always connected with video games because that provided an escape from reality for me as a kid and never went away, even had some luck with competitive gaming in my early days but the internet in my area struggles to play the most simple Games lately .That being said it doesn’t feel possible here... went to college for things I enjoy but there doesn’t seem to be enough of a market near me so that feels like a waste considering I need to work 50-58 hours a week to stay in my position at work i don’t have any energy to do a lot more unfortunately. That coupled with severe depression and anxiety make me second guess everything I do... it’s a character flaw I’m working on because the things I’m passionate about I tend to hold onto, that probably keeps me from a lot of potential exposure but I just can’t seem to let it go. Art and music has always been what makes me happy. I have a degree for photography and graphic design but as i was saying the cash isn’t really flowing and work has taken over so I’m rusty regardless. I feel like I have a lot of good ideas and fairly often but my confidence is holding me back... I know the City/state won’t make the different ultimately but I just need an area that could potentially provide a chance at being able to enjoy life for a little while. 
I’ve been looking into cities that could have everything I need but it doesn’t mean I would be able to do those things necessarily if I moved there because the cost of living is different.
Denver and Seattle seem to be the “best” options but considering I don’t have a massive savings account right now I don’t even know if those would be options. All together I have probably $6000 extra saved up. I have my own vehicle and I think I’m a quick learner so any entry level job that isn’t brain dead having me coasting mentally would be wonderful at first but I have to survive also. 
I know this is a lot but I’m kinda just jotting thoughts as I go, reaching out for help isn’t a strong point of mine lol

So I guess the question is... 
Even though chances are slim, humor me?
I’d love to get into esports, gaming/streaming for fun. 
I’d love to reignite my love for photography and graphic design in my own way.
I’d love to live in a place full of open minded people.
I definitely won’t succeed in making millions anytime soon so the best “bang for your buck” areas that could at least be a first step to forward momentum towards happiness would even be amazing. 
I’ve done research and I can read and read all day long but actual people living in some areas can give real information and it is more believable to me in that form because it’s not necessarily an advertisement to get you to move somewhere it’s a more realistic take. Sorry if this is something that is asked a lot. 

So I guess the question is
Is there a place with everything? Probably not... but I’m very appreciative and thankful for any information

Maybe this is just a desperate attempt to figure out that it’s not in the cards, but the years seem to be flying by and I seem to give up more and more each day. I need to take a chance on myself in some form and I’m trying to be as calculated as possible.

985,"Tldr: neighbor kicks soccer ball against fence everyday for an hour; disrupts our routine and rattles the windows 

I live in a townhouse community where I am sandwiched between two neighbors. I got a new neighbor, a single young woman, on the west side about two years ago. I tried to speak with her once in English but she responded in Spanish so I’ve just been nodding/smiling when I see her outside ever since. Recently there have been new residents living there with her who look like a family unit - mom, teenagers, younger children. 

My master bedroom lines up perpendicular to their patio/our shared fence line and everyday for about an hour the teenage son kicks a soccer ball around their patio by repeatedly kicking into the fence like he’s passing back and forth to another player. This not only makes an obnoxious thud sound with every hit but also rattles my bedroom windows on the wall attached to the fence line. My toddler son naps in my room and I, being pregnant, have also found naps a necessity as of late. The soccer more often than not prevents either of us from napping. 

I realize the kid is a teenager and must be getting much needed activity in a small space. I also realize where my son naps or my napping schedule is not a right that my neighbors must respect, especially in townhouse-style close quarters. I want advice on how to address the situation with them (given the language barrier) or should I leave it alone entirely and adjust our routine? 

P.S. - I had a negative encounter with the mom last week when we both backed our cars out into the lot at the same time. We were both headed to the right but she sped around in front of me just as I began to drive to drive forward to complete the right turn so that I had to slam on my brakes.

989,"From K-7 i never had to do much at school. I learned pretty much everything faster than the other kids so I was considered smart. But then I started 8th grade at a school for smart kids. I thought I could wing it like I did my whole life. I just never made homework and studied for tests. That resulted in me getting only +- 60% in my tests. But that was enough for me to pass to the next grade. I did the same thing in 9th but this time it didnt go like it went before so I had to repeat the year. But because I already knew the subjects it was easier that year then I went to 10th. I almost had to repeat that year but I managed to go to 11th because the teachers thought I tried hard enough and thought I could do it. But now im in 11th, ive procrasinated the whole year and now im about to fail the year and I can only fail one  year at the school before I get kicked out.

I would love to do a cosplay like Sniper or Medic from TF2, or something from Skyrim like Cicero or Vilkas, or Crowley from Good Omens. I have no desire to look even remotely appealing to a man. 

However, my dad is calling me a freak for feeling like this. He keeps telling me I’m not allowed to cosplay male characters, and that any female characters I do suggest, like Pearl from Steven Universe, are ‘weird and roleplay-y’. He wants me to do something like Harley Quinn or D.Va.

another detail i should add is that a week after the dreams started, (we weren’t in quarantine at the time), the dude in my dreams started to act weird. like he would talk to me a lot more, but i think it’s just a coincidence tbh. after the second week we got into quarantine so i never had a chance to talk to him.

1002,"Background: my fiance's grandpa just died (not covid related that we're aware of), and their mom is sick and might have covid. Like, was tested for covid just hours before everyone found out that grandpa died, so she hasn't heard back on the results yet. 

There hasn't been word if there will be a funeral or not, but that family in general hasn't been taking covid-19/social distancing very seriously, so I don't think they would let covid stop them from having a funeral.

My fiance and I are \~8 hours away, and have been quarantining HARD for the last two months because we don't want to get sick. They said we'll have to wait until we hear back about their mom's covid  test to decide if we go there or not. 

To be honest: I don't feel comfortable going, regardless of  what her test result is. There's a 0% chance of social distancing actually happening if we go, they are a very touchy-feely family, and we have no idea if other people in their family are infected. Not to mention, if people are flying from out of town, the exposure they bring to the picture w/airports, public transportation, etc. 

I might be getting ahead of myself, but I don't want to be the asshole that said ""I'm not going to your grandpas funeral"" especially since me saying that would mean they would either have to drive themselves (which wouldn't happen), or not go.

For the chocolates, he instead messaged me on Instagram and said ""thank you for the chocolates 😁"" but he never responds unless I tell him happy birthday or if I ask if I should give him the notes (he usually says that he should be fine). Thing is, I have tried my best. I offered to talk to him (which I could tell he was looking forward to) but I get anxious and just lose my ability to speak. The offer was that I gave him a note that asked if I can show him my fake tattoo and he can tell by going doing a certain route or not. He did and when I failed to go through the first time, I remember seeing him looking down at the note and then holding it to his chest.

I am a uni student and my classes are finished for the semester so I have lots of time to chat now. But I always try to schedule the calls in the morning so my parents are at work and not in the house. I have always felt anxious when talking to others on the phone in front of other people, especially my friends in front of my parents. We do not even discuss anything bad or crazy but feel like they are judging me for how I am acting or what I am saying. By the way I have severe anxiety/depression, so often possess fear of judgement by others. But for some of my friends, they have limited time in their schedules to talk in the morning and can only do so in the evenings. I always make up an excuse to avoid having to talk to them in the evenings since my family is home and try to find a time in the morning that works for both of us. But I feel as though I am running out of excuses for not being able to talk in the evening (since how can one be so busy when stuck in the house) and this limits the amount of communication I have with them.

1008,"Over a year ago, my BIL’s new gf started bringing over dogs that she dogsat to our place and they would just go poop and pee everywhere without her cleaning up after them. She left them in cages alone for up to 14 hours at our home even though she didn’t even live there. We raised concerns about the quality of care she was giving to them and she got upset and lashed out at us.

So the lack of cleaning up after the dogs and the animal neglect eventually led to our landlord (other brother) telling my BIL that he could not have his gf bring the dogs over anymore. 

The night that my husband and I told them this news, the gf started slamming doors and physically trying to confront us and stare us down us while we were out walking our dog. 

BIL and his gf then left for the night to her place. However, the following morning, the gf came back with another different dog she was dogsitting and strolled into the house like nothing had happened before. BIL was not there and she just walked in without being invited. When my husband tried to talk to her about the situation, she said that it wasn’t her problem and to wait for BIL to come back. We said that we could talk as long as the dog wasn’t there because that was the rule.

They then got into an argument where they both started yelling. I got involved and at one point, she got so upset that she was clapping at me and her hands touched my face. I simply just asked her to not touch me and to calm down, which is something that I had said to the both of them. However, she got even more upset. 

Things end poorly and we haven’t really talked to them in a year but to this day she is still posting about how racist we are for telling her to calm down when she got upset. 

She also states that she did nothing wrong and will not concede that she should not have just brought the dog over despite her still wanting to restart and be friends. My husband and I cannot be friends with her with her constant shit talking on social media about us still and her inability to self-reflect. 

I’m honestly not trying to be a Karen, but I’m tired of an angry person posting about something they did wrong a year ago and framing it in a way that makes them look better. How do I get her to stop posting it at least have it not bother me?",26May2020,1

1012,"Suffice to say, I can't stand my older brother. He has mental issues that have not been properly addressed throughout his life, and it has made my life incredibly exhausting and downright miserable at times. 

When I was 11 years old, we were living with my dad because my mom was obsessed with her now ex husband. Life for me then was very difficult. I was a weird kid and had trouble making friends, and had trouble processing my emotions and had no one to turn to. I started crying one day because the stress from school got to me, and my brother decided it would be a good idea to record me and save the video. I asked him why he did that, and his response was around the lines of ""you looked funny"".

When I was entering high school, my brother decided to project whatever his insecurities were onto me. He made himself out to be this wise, positive role model for me, buying me food and taking me to play video games and stuff. He then would give me ""advice"" like ""always care about what people think about you"" and ""if someone doesn't like you, it's probably because you're an asshole"". I listened to him, and the results were what you would expect. I was incredibly self conscious, developed an inferiority complex and hated myself. He also included me in his relationship problems and put his weight on my shoulders, and would sometimes blame me for his problems.

My brother's  mental health has taken a serious nose dive in recent years. He has incredibly odd and irritating behaviors (constant singing, out of no where yelling, paranoia, drinking, etc), he cannot pass a class to save his life despite only taking two classes and not having a job, and loses important items frequently. This has taken a direct affect on me as well, as he once tried to steal my car keys in the school parking lot because I wouldn't let him take my car, as I had a doctors appointment to go to. 

Recently, my brother has gotten into legal trouble for leaving the scene of an accident, even though he claims he was unable to pull over and had to turn around. My mother is moving to Florida this summer, but I wish to stay where I am for college and to see my friends and dad, and so I can get away from my brother. It turns out, my brother will have to live with me and my dad until August because his court date was moved.

When we met, he was a god fearing virgin and although ive been respectful to that, time with me has kind of helped him grow into his own person and beliefs. We’ve had sex. We’ve stayed the night together, and overall, my gut tells me he’s the one, and I’m not one to just fall in love. Due to my own family kicking me out (long story) I needed a new place, and due to him hating his roommates and wanting to have more privacy, we got an apartment together. Although we do love eachother we mainly did it for financial reasons. But here’s where things get rough: he never told his parents. He never told them he signed the lease, or was looking at apartments with me, or even that he wanted to move. I would pester him constantly about it. I told my parents, and yeah at first it was rough but they’ve accepted it. I decided to let my bf do his own thing and decide for himself. But we’ve been officially living together for a week and a half and he still hasn’t told them. He’s terrified to go against them and their ways.

Since finding this group I have made great progress on myself and made an effort to follow advice etc. My ex broke up with me two months ago, and I was devastated, to another degree, in part due to her lack of emotions and it coming out of the blue. A week prior, she let me look through her phone as i saw a notification from some guy, i screen shotted a conversation about me. Horrible things were said, like calling me a child, her friend said 'dump the current one in April'.

After the breakup, we tried to be friends for a week, didn't work, and i was going through my photos when i saw that screenshot, it was horrible, and there and blatant, discussing messaging another guy, one she doesn't know, saying i wont find out. After this week of 'trying to be friends' (Because she wanted to) I found this subreddit and decided to go no contact. I asked her to block me which is when she said she was talking to someone else a week after we broke up.

Now this was my moment of weakness, I posted a screenshot of this 'cheating' to my private instagram, She controlled the whole breakup, she told people we were friends, i know this was wrong. Next day I received horrendous messages from people i assume to be her friends. Calling me mentally ill, joking about suicide, 'Fucktrumpet' was one. my reply was just 'don't joke about suicide' . Anyway safe to say this hurt me a lot.

No contact began, and has lasted since. I made great progress with the help of this sub and close friends, with at times not even feeling bad. Anyway, last week i noticed she unblocked me. Now something as trivial as that shouldn't have affected me the way it did, but the fact a channel of communication was open made me think.

So i sent her a request yesterday, thinking if she has a problem she wont accept, you know she unblocked me on everything, all my media. And today....... well today i messaged her. Big mistake and am currently in tears. It has opened up old wounds and did not go the way i planned. I messaged amicably, and the conversation seemed ok, I tried to be nice, and kind. It ended with me getting blocked. Not before she took a blow at my mental health (I have social anxiety, what other people think of me really affects me to the point where i break down. for a time i couldn't even post to reddit).

[https://imgur.com/a/Rtajahm](https://imgur.com/a/Rtajahm)

The screenshots show the conversation. At the end I was blocked. And as of writing this I have been unblocked and sent a message, ""not for the right reasons I'd advise against it in the future lol, but as i said i'm not bringing anything up ofc"".

It seems a bit late for that, Im a mess, Am I in the wrong here? I tried to enter contact in a kind amicable way, I was dumped by her yet I feel Im to blame? I feel like posting that screenshot of cheating is horrendous, i wanted to be heard and yes I was angry that she moved on so fast but she didnt have to tell me that?, Why did she block me just then and unblock me as im writing this?

I have attached the screenshots to an Imgur link. Any comments would be appreciated. I hope I have written this in a way that can be understood my brain is a bit jumbled right now. Feel free to ask me any questions and I will answer them.",26May2020,1

So basically I’m trying not to let me insecurities ruin an otherwise great relationship.  I was a virgin up until we met.  She wasn’t.  I’ve never explicitly asked about her sexual past because I’m smart enough to not ask questions I don’t want the answers to but it still gets to me.  I know isn’t ridiculous and insane to ask for a virgin especially at 29 with women being able to get sex easier but it still bothers me at times.  I feel like I’m giving more than I’m receiving and going somewhere that other guys have already gone.  I know that sounds shitty, territorial and misogynistic but that’s how I feel.  Of course I’ve never said these things to her because it’s not only rude but I don’t want to project my insecurities on her and make her feel bad.  I’m self-aware enough to know that I cannot blame her for living her life and doing things before she even met me but a part of me feels like I’m missing out because she’s been with other people and I’ve only been with her.  I know the term retroactive jealousy from research and it applies here. Would the best point of action be to let her go so she can find a more secure partner while I work on improving myself?

I am posting this here because I am so bad at talking to girls that I am interested in, and I really need help. For girls I’m not interested in I have no problem talking to, but when it comes to a girl like this, who I think about a lot, I feel like I overthink it and say stupid stuff in front of them. 

Now even if I did know how to talk to this girl, I still don’t know what chain of events I’d have to go through to get her to hang out outside of work. It’s hard to talk to her in general because my department always has a lot of stuff to do so we’re always busy which doesn’t give me a whole lot of time to have meaningful conversation. I’ve talked to her a couple of times but I just don’t think I’m gaining any traction. 

The rough part is that every girl I have ever actually had a deep interest in, like with this girl, I have always failed. Not one single time have I ever gotten past the first date. Even then, it’s really hard to get to the first date in the first place. I’ve actually failed so many times that now when I start gaining interest in a girl I think to myself, “well let’s see how I can fuck it up this time.” I try to learn from my mistakes and move on but goddamn is it hard to try again when you have a 0% success rate. I’m asking here about this girl because I really really like her and I’m afraid to fail because I know if I do, it will leave me in extreme emotional pain and possibly even slight depression bc I’ll probably start thinking about how I’ll never get married and I’ll be like 40 years old and never have had a girlfriend.

1029,"I'm a recent arrival in Canada from the US. I've had three jobs between early 2018 and today, and my experiences have been awful. This might be a long one so I'm sorry :(

My first job in Canada was incredibly stressful, which I could handle in and of itself - the type of job where you're constantly mitigating customer complaints, the volume of work never diminishes no matter how hard you work, etc. Unfortunately, I was also ""preyed upon"" by an older coworker who didn't work in my department. I dealt with him to an extent since he was in purchasing and I'd need to figure what was coming in, but he would come to my desk every day and massage me, say things like ""I hope your boyfriend can handle you; you're all woman"" and would even comment on things I was eating when he would pop in to the lunch room during my break (""I'm glad to see you're eating protein.. need to support that tight figure"" etc). I went to my supervisor and HR about it - my super was furious (I loved her); HR was a bit lukewarm. Ultimately they ended up forbidding him from coming anywhere near me - a sort of unwritten restraining order. This unfortunately led him to poisoning other people in the office (men) against me, where he allegedly told them I was making up lies and for all the men to ""watch out"" because I was out for their jobs. I eventually left due to that pressure, as well as a lack of structure within my job (I literally performed the jobs of four people for the pay of 3/4 of one).

My job after that was somewhat better (still doing too many jobs though for little income), but then they started withholding pay. I stayed for a year which I regret, as nothing ended up changing. I still have US student loans and if it weren't for support from my husband, I would've been on the streets. It made me feel incredibly dependent and worthless, so I left once as I had an offer for a better job. They went under the month following my departure. 

The next job seemed too good to be true. Everything seemed structured, great pay, the company was large but our office was tightly-knit and I loved the people. I really thought this was my chance. Unfortunately my supervisor missed that whole ""be kind.. or at least reasonable"" memo and made my experience hell. They'd put on a nice face for our co-workers but would ridicule me in private, picking on my mannerisms, telling me to smile more, that I was a miserable person and I was lucky they were giving me this opportunity at all, etc. Once as it got to the point where I was fetching them personal items from the store (this was not anywhere close to my job description.. I mostly worked in purchasing but, again, did the jobs of several different positions), I thought it was time to leave. I was again ridiculed when I left, followed like a hawk (I was escorted out), not allowed to say goodbye to anyone and was ultimately humiliated. The few months I was at this job was much worse than I'm willing to describe, but this is just the gist. 

Anyway.. despite all of the bad experiences, the last one really broke me. I'm now hyper-aware of my ""mannerisms"" that were picked on, and I feel like I have no value to bring to any job any longer because of how often I was talked down to and embarrassed in front of other people. I'm back to relying on my husband financially (though I am on unemployment) and I hate myself for it. I know I should be easier on myself but I'm mad that I let myself be such a doormat in so many ways by convincing myself that I had to take the hits as a new arrival to the country and a young adult. Finding employment to begin with was so difficult that I was just trying to make any money I could. I work so hard in every job I have and with the exception of the last position, have always received glowing reviews and great references. It's getting harder to hold onto those positives.

How can I gain my confidence back? I haven't been able to find another job since COVID began and I really want to have my moment and start a career. I'm fast-approaching 30 and feel like I've done nothing of worth professionally. I'm worried I'll get back into a new office and self-sabotage somehow with this lack of confidence.

tl;dr after facing several different types of abuse and illegalities at work, my confidence in myself professionally is pretty much shot. I have pretty bad anxiety as it is and I'm unsure how to gain my confidence back. Looking for advice re: taking control of my professional life. I don't want to give up.",26May2020,1

1031,"This may seem related to the recent job losses that covid has caused, but it’s not. I’ve been unemployed since May of last year, and I couldn’t be happier.

Without getting into too many details, I’m a 20 year old male, and I’ve learned over the past 3 years that working a “normal” or “traditional” job, is one of the most depressing, terrible experiences I’ve ever experienced in my life. So much so, that the negatives that come with not having a reliable income, in my mind, are so so so much less impactful than the feeling of having to go to a place you hate more than anything else.

My problem doesn’t really lie in me not having a job. It lies in how my parents view me because of that. Their view of me affects me immensely. Now of course, my parents love me and want the best for me. But they can’t seem to understand that “the best for me” in my mind is about happiness, while to them, it’s my financially stability.

My mom very often flip flops about how she feels about my mindset. There will be days where she says “I just want you to be happy son.” And then there will be days it feels like she’s in denial, where she says things like “oh son, you’re so young, I hated working when I was younger too, you get over it! I know you’ll figure out that you have to live life eventually!” And then there will be days where she takes the “tough love” approach. Using words like “lazy” or “unmotivated” etc etc.

Believe it or not, it’s the denial that hurts me the most. When she says that she knows I’ll figure out I have to “live life eventually” I always just try to be upfront, and say “I am living MY life. I am happy without a reliable income. I am completely content with the idea of never working a job ever again.” And when I say things like that, it seems like it only re-enforces her denial about me being “young and dumb”.

I currently live with my grandmother, who is very emotionally supportive, and loves me unconditionally weather or not I’m working. So since I live with someone, who isn’t my parents, I have temporarily taken the liberty of not talking to either of them for a period of time. What I’m trying to figure out is if I can have a happy relationship with my parents (moreso my mom) with the condition of never bringing up the idea of work.

I almost want to set an ultimatum, as bad as that sounds. I basically want to tell my mom, if you want to have a relationship with me, I don’t ever want to hear anything to do with work, jobs, responsibilities, etc (in context to me of course). Many people in my life who I tell this say that that’s a completely unrealistic expectation to put on a relationship with your parent. But I almost feel like it’s necessary. As bad as this sounds, if she can’t not bring those things up, then I don’t want to ever talk to her. When my mom says things regarding those faucets of my life, it depresses me like no other. I truly feel worthless, and like my life has no meaning since I don’t have what society considers “important”.

I’ve tried telling her how those things make me feel. And it’s always a response of “so what, I’m just supposed to not worry about what you’re going to do with your life?” And I’m basically thinking yes that’s exactly what I want.

I know that this whole thing runs way deeper than just not wanting to work, as I had a WAY higher than normal hatred towards school, and other activities I “didn’t want to do”. As silly as it may sound, when I am somewhere I don’t want to be, and I cannot do anything about it, I feel mentally imprisoned. I don’t want to ramble on too long about why my mind works the way it works though. Either way I’m most happy when I’m “existing”. Not in a bad way.

Ultimately, I don’t want to keep my mom cut off from my life like she is right now. But I also can’t fathom staying in what my mind considers a cycle of sadness when I hear her question my life choices over and over.

Is there anything I can do to help my mom become content with who I am, and who I will continue to be?",26May2020,1

There is a 4th year med student I know who I fear is going to be a doctor who will practice unethically. 

I have lived in the same house as this person and witnessed them steal full prescriptions of stimulant medication from someone who actually needed it. They did this twice without anyone realizing until it was too late. This student was forgiven due to the fact that he stole from a family member but no one can trust him now. We no long live together, as this student has chosen to move out. But in the process, the student did not pay rent or utilities for over 6 months. I don’t think we’ll ever see this money from him.

This person has gotten into multiple car crashes, some of which I know were hit and runs. They are also currently facing eviction because they have straight up refused to pay rent and don’t care about being in contact with their current land lord. Also, this student and their gf were making money off dog sitting while they were neglecting dogs for up to 14 hours in their tiny cages.

No one can tell this 4th year anything without him cutting them off. Any advice as to how to approach this situation? I am honestly so afraid of this person becoming a practicing MD.",26May2020,1

1037,"Hi, in posting because I'm lost with this and don't know what to do now:/

I had an app idea last year and in December 2019 approached a friend Ive known for a long time. He earnt over 100k a year as a software consultant and after I explained my idea he was keen to work with me to develop the app and even offered 50k in funding. Luckily it was at a time he was between contracts and he made it his sole focus. We worked round the clock for the 3 weeks leading up to New year's eve where we tested our up for the fist time in a local pub. (the app does restaurant ordering/table service but with a twist). As he was a longtime friend and he offered to do all this I agreed we'd go 50/50 (mistake on my part). 

 We took a few weeks break and then at the end of January I moved into his house to get to work, or so I thought. When I moved in I found out he was addicted to cocaine and had a 1-2g a day habit. I spent 5 weeks living with him trying to help him out of his addiction, he very little work. The work he had done was all for a platform that could be an over night success, we had a novel marketing idea that we thought could get us a lot of users quickly and he seemed taken with that idea.

Eventually I left his house we'd gotten very little work done and it was obvious I couldn't stop him from locking himself in his room whilst he lay in bed with filthy sheets, sniffing coke from a laptop - really living the dream. Anyway the guy ignores me as I try and contact him over the 6 weeks, maybe there was two occasions where he graced me with a reply but aside from that, nada. He decides to head to a country where he can't buy any coke and goes cold turkey. 
Then COVID becomes a big threat and the UK goes into lockdown, he sees gold and rings me wanting to get started again, I agree and get to work. We spent 4 weeks working tirelessly and even dragged in 3 other devs. Things were going great, I was happy that my first business was starting to take shape. The developer had been growing very concerned about shares and who had control etc, I didn't realise at the time but this was the beginning of a psychotic break. He bullied and harassed me into following his ideas and being nieve I listened because he'd ""run ten businesses"" and ""earns over 10k a month"" I should have trusted my gut.  

Suddenly loads of very weird behaviours started and we realised he was having an episode of psychosis, he was diagnosed bipolar and given medication in the country he was visiting. I tried to work with him and get the app to MVP (minimum viable product), which it almost is, but to no luck. He held all the account passwords and has since locked me out. 

The project is stagnant and 6 months of my life wasted trying to get this idea off the ground. Now I have a copy of the code but it's missing certain backend bits I don't understand. Im now left with part of an app and lots of media/marketing/plans  and no way to use them. 

I started reaching out and trying to find other developers I know, but that hasn't had much success so far. My funds are very limited now and I stand no chance of affording someone else to finish the app for me. I feel like I've exhausted myself trying to help and cope with the situation and now feel overwhelmed with no idea of where to look to find someone to help bring this project to life.

I don't want to give up on this project as its the perfect time to launch as we move out of lockdown but I don't have many ideas on what options I have.",26May2020,1

What should I do here? Everytime i try to explain something to them, they get really angry and say something incoherent, or state some random doctor they saw on the telly.

1045,"So long story short: I worked for a small company - two owners who I got along well with and one supervisor who I saw responsible for having at least 4 other employees leave within the span of 2 years.

After 2 years of unprofessional behavior (constantly micromanaging, lying to the owners about my performance, screaming at me in front of other new employees) I sought out some advice from both reddit as well as my friends. 

Both unanimously decided that I should have left months ago and that I didn't have to prove anything to myself by sticking around.

And so I decided to do so. 

Unfortunately a week later, the covid quarantines started happening and I was unsure if I would qualify for unemployment. The owners messaged me saying not to worry and that even though I left, they would cover for me and say that I left the company due to covid.

Unfortunately because it is a small office, the only one manning the telephone was my supervisor who told the agent that called that I left on my own, thereby making me out to be a liar and disqualifying me.

The agent called me to clear things up, I told him the truth and now 2 weeks later I have received a formal letter that after 3 months of no jobs I am indefinitely disqualified.

I let the owners know what happened and since they work in a different building had no idea about the whole situation.

Due to my pre existing condition, mounting medical bills, and credit card bills, I am unsure how to proceed at this time.

The appeal process could take another few months and I simply do not have the means to get through that.

There is this boy that has a crush on me and he is slightly autistic(not that is a bad thing). He and I went to the same elementary school but we were never close. Yes I would say hi to him while passing by but nothing more. During freshman year, he asked for my phone number and I thought nothing of it because the way he asked was causal and I did this with lots of guy and girl friends. He literally confessed his feelings for me and said he loved me right after he got my number. I didn’t even get to say anything when the bell rang. Overtime he would give me weird hand shakes and messages like “ I love you” when I barely knew him. When I mean barely, I mean it. I never even had a real one on one conversation with him until that time. It was really weird but I took into account that he didn’t really know what love is( I don’t think any high schooler knows). When I confronted him and told him I was clearly was not interested, he explained he thought I like him just because I drew a heart when I signed my name in his yearbook during middle school.🤦‍♀️Even after expressing that I don’t feel the same way as him,  he continued to text me weird things. I ended up blocking his number and Instagram because it made me feel so uncomfortable. 

During sophomore year, he and I got into the same class and were in the same group. Yes it was uncomfortable but I was never mean to him and even defended him when people picked on him. He told me he wanted to become just friends again despite me not liking him and I agreed because he seemed really genuine. Literally on the same day within hours, three of my friends messaged me and asked why he out of nowhere requested to follow them. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt but I was totally overwhelmed and creeped out. I sent a message to him saying, I wasn’t confortable and wished him the best.

I have always been scared of ageing, since I was 15. But it’s never felt like this, I think because this time it is real. I’m starting to notice fine lines that weren’t there before, and I just feel so helpless. I’m terrified of looking older, I don’t want to look in the mirror and not see ‘me’ anymore. And it makes me feel so depressed that I can no longer stay being care-free, and have time to make mistakes. It’s making me worried that I haven’t done enough at this point.

1050,"Need advice, my dog nipped me

Hey, so I’m pretty much 100% sure he wasn’t being aggressive, we’re best pals and have an amazing bond of trust between us. He is highly affected by the emotional balance of the household which is why i think this happened. 

Today three human members of the household were having a very angry shouting argument including me, i was in the bathroom doorway arguing with two people in the ball and the dog was behind me in the bathroom. 

He was barking and upset and resorted to nipping me on the bum i think to try and stop the argument. It isn’t a serious injury, if he’d wanted to hurt me badly he’s more than capable, he’s a big boy. The thing im confused about is that after he did it i turned around in shock and he sort of fell to the floor in fright. 

I’ve never hit him or punished him for anything so i’m not sure why he anticipated punishment from me. 

Similar thing happened a couple of weeks ago where i was doing a silly game of putting my hand on him then slapping the hand (we play a lot and he likes being rough housed) but i think the noise of it was unpleasant for him, i thought he was being excited but it evidently was more nervous excitement because i turned around to do it to the other dog and he nipped my arm, then same thing acted very scared and backed away and hid under the table. 

I responded by saying nothing and stopping the game and just indicated for him to leave the room and gave him a time out for about 45 seconds.

1058,"So, I came to the United States from another country and i was forced to restart high school for some stupid law, now i am 18 y/o and i am in 10th grade. my grades were good in 9th grade, and also good at the beginning of this year, but the quarantine fucked me up , i even failed an AP class in my home language. why did this happen? easy, instead of doing my school work i was looking for a job. It comes that i have been coding daily since 3 years ago and i am skilled enough to get freelancer jobs, and i have been doing so and i generate 100 dollars a week (and i think i can increase this number, i have been limited because i have also been doing some homework)  
I talked with my parents about my horrible grades and they are very angry (I dont blame them) they told me that if i want to work i will quit HS and start generating money for the home, they want me to give them 50% of my earnings (I think its fair because they let me live here after all)  


Do anyone know if there is some kind of exam that lets me validate highschool quickly in California?   
If so, should i take it?  
If it doesnt exist, should i just get out of highscool and become a freelancer until i get enough job experience so i can get into a more stable work?  


what should i do?

1059,"I need some advice. My fiancé and I bought a house together a year and a half ago. I was hesitant to move in together for one reason and that was that he had a husky mix at the time that was so much work to clean up after. He was 12.5 when we bought the house and he convinced me that the dog probably didn’t have too much longer. Well he’s now 14 and 3 months and my patience is wearing thin. He requires so much vacuuming, mopping Bc he’s a huge drooler, lint rolling and walking Bc he’s such a hyperactive dog. We took him to the vet and he the vet said he has harsh lungs and wants to do xrays to see if it’s congestive heart failure or lung cancer or something else. My fiancé doesn’t see the point and thinks we should just let him die on his own. I feel bad for complaining about the dog so much but it’s frustrating Bc he’s not even that attached to the dog. He got him as a puppy and his ex wife wanted him to get rid of the dog so he gave him to his parents. He got him back 3 years ago right before we started dating.

1067,"CW: rape

throwaway for obvious reasons. I have to ask this somewhere, it’s eating me alive if i dont.

My best friend raped me two years ago but claims that he genuinely thought i gave consent, but i was sleeping at the time that it happened. I never told anyone because I didn’t want to label him a rapist, even though the situation was rape. We went our separate ways because he started dating a girl who hates my guts. She’s told me before she only hates me because her bf (my ex best friend) told her drunkenly how much he loved me before they started dating. 

I went to therapy because I got suicidal because of the rape. I recently confided in a friend of mine who then told my ex best friend that I thought he was a rapist. 

He now is very angry (read: absolutely furious) at me and apparently his girlfriend and him are constantly trash talking me as a person and saying im trying to ruin their lives, also saying that “women make things worse than they actually were and that i was exaggerating and in need of attention”. He now has blocked me on all social media and is trashtalking me as a person still.

I was at the point in therapy where I wanted to have a talk with him about it and leave it behind me forever. Now I can’t even message him. Idk if it makes sense, but I see what happened as rape but I can’t see him as a rapist bc of the negative Hollywood stereotype you’d originally associate with that term. Also, i have major loyalty issues to him because before the rape, he was the best friend i could possibly ask for.

What do I do? Was I wrong for calling this a rape/calling him a rapist? I can’t leave the situation behind me and get closure without talking to him about it, but i am feeling so stuck right now. Sounds weird, but I kind of miss him as a friend too.",26May2020,1
1069,"I have been friends with this girl for nearly 4 years, I considered her to be my best friend. She recently broke up with her boyfriend and I was there for her. I supported her through everything, I helped her move, I texted her when she needed me, I made sure she was alright. I’m leaving my boyfriend too. She’s hardly there for me, she only seems to be a friend when she’s there in person. I really need support right now, too, bc I’m stuck in a lease with my bf.

She told me she wanted to move in with me when I left my boyfriend and I said I want to leave the state and maybe move to Greenville to start over. She said that sounded perfect and we began to research how we could do this. A week after she moved out of her boyfriends house, she said she didn’t want to leave her friends here and I agreed because I was scared to do big move alone. So we started looking for places in the area and she was so picky, almost unreasonably so. Then, today, she texts me (after basically leading m on) that she has decided to move to Greenville in 5 months without me. To give you an idea, she was still texting me potential places for us to move in the area last night.

I got pissed. I started crying a bunch and I just felt so alone. I thought she had my back and we were on the same page but she keeps changing her mind. I feel like she has NO consideration for me or what I’m going through, I feel like she isn’t a good friend and I feel like I had a plan to move out and now I have nothing and I’m so stressed. I told her all of these things and she tried to make me feel bad by saying things like “I’m sorry you think I’m such a bad friend” (manipulative) and “it was you who wanted to stay” (untrue). It’s really hard for me to stand up for myself so I feel so bad for saying some of the things I said, but I feel like they were warranted.

1071,"A close family relative is involved with drugs, and its really affected my family. I don't know what they're on, maybe y'all could enlighten me. 

It first started when they lost a severe amount of weight in like six months, they're 5""8 but they weigh 5st. They were about 12st before this all happened. 

They tried to tell us it was caused by Crohn's disease, but they've been found by friends passed out in the street and covered in vomit, dazed and speaking very slowly and also never suffered from the disease before. 

They drink a lot of energy drinks, I remember hearing that an increase of sugar intake was related to some drug but I don't remember what - I don't know much about drugs, which is why I'm here. 

They lost all of their teeth, too. We tried asking a doctor but he wouldn't say anything about it because he doesn't know enough about the person to comment - I understand that they have a professional code, even if it really annoyed me. Do you know what they could be using?

I've heard from a local police officer and close friend that they may also be selling drugs. They're being watched by the police because of it. We *know* they're on drugs, we don't know what but it's very obvious - they've stole from us and lied about it, they lie about everything and try to swindle money from us, they've attacked us multiple times and they even tried committing insurance fraud in my father's name. 

We're kind of at the end of our rope, and we don't know what to do. We've tried so many times, offered to pay for rehab and even tried bribing them with a year's rent to get help. How else could we reach out to them?

1075,"My wife and I are a younger couple and decided it would be nice to have a roommate in our apartment to help split bills with for a year so we could save up for our future. The roommate ended up being my brother. He was known to not shower daily before we moved in together but we sat down and had a casual conversation with one another about expectations moving in- everyone cleans the common areas, he cleans his bathroom weekly, take showers regularly, etc.. Working construction is a really sweaty and dirty job. At first he would take showers every other day then it got to maybe once a week, which is disgusting to me. We had to have maintenance come in for an issue right after he moved in and they complained to our office about the smell in our apartment because of my brother’s room smelling so bad. We’ve talked to him multiple times, not being accusatory or anything, but telling him he’s expected to shower daily. Now, with COVID19, he’s expected to shower as soon as he gets home because my wife and I are both immune compromised. He has been showering daily as promised HOWEVER he doesn’t use soap. AT ALL. For Christmas we bought him a dual pack of soap and it’s barely been touched (he doesn’t buy soap, either). 

He is not easy to talk to at all and gets defensive with any situation. He blames the smell in his room and our apartment on his dirty construction clothes (he doesn’t wash) and thinks that maintenance overstepped by talking to our property manager about the smell in our apartment- I disagree. It’s horrible. 

He walked into the living room yesterday and my wife started noticeably gagging and had to leave for a walk. He smelled like rotten taco meat. It’s disgusting and I’ve had enough. 

I need advice on how else to talk to him because clearly being nice about isn’t working at all.",26May2020,1

Once I almost cried in a meeting and I just lower my head. But now I have online meetings over zoom and there's no way to escape. People can see my face and that's what they're looking at and it might show through with the microphone. I had a meeting one-on-one with a teacher today and almost cried.

I don't mind crying out of the meeting but I don't want to cry next time I'm in a meeting (I'm terrible and take criticism to heart easily or want to cry when I have a frustration and go on cry mode)

tl;dr How to not cry? and most importantly, if I do shed tears, how do I cover that up discreetly? I think that's hard to hide when in front of a camera.

Back in 2018 at the start of our senior year of high school, I had no friends to hang out with, because I had a falling out with my then best friend who was a really bad person to be friends with. And a month into school Jenny transferred and she was in the same boat as me. We both had yearbook together and we hit it off and started hanging out. By the end of the first semester I pretty much considered her my best friend. The only issue then was her dad and stepmom. They both strongly disliked me from the beginning and for no reason. I wasn’t getting their daughter into trouble or anything like that. Anyways, fast forward to now and I’ve changed a lot since senior year for the better. She still hits me up and wants to see me and I feel really awful saying this, but I just don’t feel it anymore tbh. Every time we hang out she just wants to get super high and tbh that’s not what I’m into anymore. Like if we go to the mall, boom let’s take this wax pen to the bathroom. At my house? Boom. Wax pen. Anywhere? Boom. Wax pen. She just gets so high that it just completely kills it. Last time she slept over at my house was before I left home for college. I wanted to make memories with who I considered to be my best friend, but she just ended up getting so high that she was falling asleep at like 8:30pm. I still love her and have a place in my heart for her but every time I hang out with her I just get bummed and bored. Now here’s an example of what I like: the person who I consider my best friend, I’ll call her Rose, I’ve been friends with since junior year but we didn’t hang out that much since she had her own group. But towards the end of senior year we got closer. Every time we hang out I enjoy seeing her family, and have fun. Like we’ll go out and actually do cool stuff.

So, do I move out of state away from friends and family and have more bills, barley making it doing what I love. Or do I stay at home and take a lower job where I'd be an entry level doing something new, but no bills and be around friends/family.

1095,"I'm 16y M

It was already bad before the quarantine and has been going on for atleast 3 years and only got progressively worse, but it got much worse after the quarantine started.

Sometimes, while I still get distracted a lot, I manage to do some school stuff, but it's only homework and only on easy subjects like english (bc it's my 2nd language and not the first).


I just cant get myself to do the harder stuff like studying and the other subjects's homework. I keep wasting time on some shitty social media and even when I don't have my phone, I just keep doodling things unrelated to school, keep fantasizing about stuff (not sexual fantasies) and keep walking like a robot programmed to walk in circles in my house or staring at something, and I don't even enjoy any of that. 

I barely can't do physical activity and do stuff I like to do because I keep worrying about school and some shitty grades, but I almost always end up not doing school stuff. 

This or last month I started to hit myself in the head hard enough to feel hurt, sometimes even with a phone, as a punishment for not doing school stuff.

As much as I don't want to die, I deserve to die painfully for being the epitome of laziness and wasting my life over being seemingly unable to do something as seemingly easy as doing school stuff, but I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself, I guess.

1097,"Our house is constantly a mess and my mum refuses to take any responsibility for it. She fills the sink with dirty dishes (and would happily leave them lying there for weeks if no one else washed them.) The worktops, dining table, coffee table and tv unit are completely cluttered (basically any available surface in the house!) She leaves ‘important’ letters and paperwork lying around in heaps all over the sofa unorganised and refuses to let anyone else sort them out even though she has absolutely no intention of cleaning them up herself. We can’t even use the dining table anymore because she’s cluttered it up and I’ve just gave up tidying. 

She had my brother 4 months ago and I understand that yes, he obviously takes up a lot of her time and she is tired most of the time, but am I really being that unreasonable to expect her to at least use the bin and stop leaving dirty nappies lying all over the floor? My sister and I take full responsibility for doing all household work now but it’s seems utterly pointless when she messes it up the second we’re done. I also help out a lot with my baby brother but any spare time she has that could be used tidying up a bit after herself is spent sitting on her phone. 

The untidiness has always been an issue for her, not just after the birth of my brother, but she’s always been in denial about it and tries to blame others for the mess. Her idea of tidying is shoving stuff in cupboards and boxes (including her ‘important letters’) then going on big screaming rants about not being able to find stuff.

I’m fed up tidying up after her and her not taking any responsibility for the mess.

1098,"I will keep this brief as possible and try to focus on this one issue. I got pregnant by my now husband when I was 18 years old. There was a big age difference, he was 32. I was his first girlfriend. He was a virgin, I was his first time. Apparently he had a lot of issues with women, and also had a hard time “keeping an erection”. My husband was VERY socially awkward with girls. A lot of times we would go out and the dates were very awkward and weird. I had a hard time finding things to talk about and he never made much effort. I was very confused because it seemed like he liked me, I mean he did nice things for me. Took me nice places. But I feel like I was forcing something to work that just *wasn’t there*. I swear I broke up with him every other week. Then I’d get back together with him. I got pregnant a month into the relationship. I tried really hard to force it to work even though there was huge red flags everywhere to just walk away. He told me he loved me, wanted to spend his life with me, I was his one and only true love. We went looking for apartments together and was going to move in. He said he wanted to marry me. He came to appointments when possible and tried to ask about the pregnancy a lot. Things just were not working and I was getting fed up of expressing myself and him never making any initiative to change. We could barely have a good sex life due to him not being able to stay hard. I decided I needed some time. He came over to my house and I ended things. I told him I was pregnant and still needed him to be there for our child. I told him I’d like to be friends and try to focus on just being good parents. He agreed. He said he didn’t plan on dating for a *long* time. He assured me seeing other people was the LAST thing on his mind, and that he was still going to be there. 

Well this changed, and it changed fast.  A week after this conversation he started seeing another woman. 2 weeks later they are in an official relationship. He’s got my ultrasound photos up on his Facebook with his profile picture with another woman. This is when everything changed. He became extremely mean. He acted like it was an issue to purchase baby supplies knowing I was just a teenager. But yet could spend money on this other woman. He didn’t come to another appointment, barely ask about the pregnancy. He got a lawyer (same lawyer his girlfriend used during her divorce) and started a huge custody battle. He even sued me to be in the delivery room! Yes, inside the room! He wasn’t around 6 months of the pregnancy, dated someone else, never bought vitamins, prenatals, nothing.. was completely uninterested the entire time, but yet wanted to SEE me give birth! This ended up going on the news.

He treated me like complete crap. Every time I tried to even have a conversation with him he told me to “talk to his lawyer”. I did some research on this girlfriend of a month to find out a lot of things. For one: everything out of her mouth was profanity. She drank constantly. Had a history of drug use. Had a criminal record. Wa a devout atheist with NO respect for anyone of religion. (To the point she thinks it’s funny to let her six year old son beat a crusfix). She has been in trouble around here to the point an officer that came out to my home said they were “very aware” of who she was. Constantly in drama, and loud. 

I refused to have this nut job around my son. At this point, I felt like nothing but a surrogate. I was just going to push this baby out and hand it over to him and his fling of month. I couldn’t believe he couldn’t even give me time to have our baby before he started wanting other people in our child’s life. My anxiety got so bad the doctors were afraid I’d lose my son if this continued. His girlfriend said I was “exaggerating”, listened in on our conversations. Apparently she talked constantly that because I am black &amp; white, our child was going to be “black” and face a bunch of racism, etc. She was crazy, and he wanted this around our child! 
He ends up dumping her the month our son was due. He calmed down a bunch after he broke up with her. Started working with me more. HIS lawyer, after the case, personally came to me and apologized. She said I didn’t deserve anything I went through, and she was so sorry- she was just doing her job. I stood there in his lawyers arms, crying. I didn’t trust his judgment at all with our son. I was scared to death to let my one month old go over to his house because I was afraid of the people he would have around him. 
So I ended up getting back together with him for our son. This lead me to falling *in love* with him, and marrying him. It’s been 2 years and I still think about this a lot. I blame him more than her, but still. She was 37, she knew as a woman what pregnancy was like, and she knew better too. She should’ve stayed out of *my* business and just dated him. She does these podcasts and completely bashed me and him both in one of them. Called me a bitch. Said he was a “predator” for being with someone my age, but she was WELL AWARE of that when she was dating him my entire pregnancy. All of our fights revolve around her. My husband buys me anything I want. We live in a brand new construction home, he lets me get anything I want. I get to stay home with our son. I don’t have to work. I am able to go back to college and take things at my own pace. The financial security is great. I love being a stay at home mom. But I am so unhappy within my marriage it is sad. I hold so much resentment towards him. My family refuses to have anything to do with him. I have no trust at all. I realized what a mistake I made by getting back with him in the first place. My husband says he never loved her. He said he was only looking for someone because he was lonely. He said he was so sorry and would never do me that way again. The thing is, I’m afraid to leave. I’m afraid he will use our son as a pawn, won’t co parent with me, and will put me through another legal battle.. or even try to take my son. He says none is this is true but I can’t help but think it would happen again. My mental health isn’t good, I’ve became a very angry person.. and I’m unsure how to ever find happiness again. 
I guess my question is, from a mans perspective, is it possible maybe he could actually love me at all after all these things? I guess it’s hard to believe that he could’ve ever cared, even in the slightest. Makes it hard for me to trust him now at all. I’m wondering if I should just leave if I can’t give over these things",26May2020,1

1106,"tldr: Extremely paranoid making friends, constantly overthinking what I say or do lest I make a mistake and they vanish just like every person who I thought I was close with has after being removed from the community I was apart of. Sob story I know. 

Around 6 months ago I was sat down by a group of close friends and was told that my old roommate was accusing me of assaulting her 10 months ago when we lived together(groping her while my ex, her, her ex and I were in the same bed together sleeping when I had merely placed my hand on her side since it was a cuddle puddle situation). She was making posts on social media claiming I shouldn't be trusted. I was dangerous. I was ,""on some sexual assailant shit"". That there was other people claiming the same. My friends were very confused, and I was as well. I'd always been described as a good wholesome person and thought the same. But, being in a very ""punk"", or counter culture(DIY music, train hopping, graffiti, squatting, dumpster diving) type of community with strong political views it's very important to believe the victim first. So they asked me to leave the house we were living at and I went to my parents. That's when the messages over social media started to come in. Other friends I had who were also confused, and in disbelief. The accuser had a history of abusing ""cancel culture"", ie. claiming her ex had hit her, claiming others as dangerous, and just general name dragging. In one of her posts she described what had happened but many of the details were changed to make things worse. Saying that she had tried to talk to me about it months prior but had not. I was completely in the dark about what had happened, especially since up until she had made the posts we were still close friends. We hungout, posted pictures of each other on social media, even kissed a few times(our friend group was very comfortable and trusting with each other). This all happened the weeks following a fallout I had with my ex who was her best friend. Which made me feel like it was a planned out attack but I'm probably being paranoid. I tried to reach out to her but ended up being blocked. I made posts not denying it but just trying to out who else was claiming I was dangerous. I still haven't made any public posts denying it or not. I think that was a mistake since friends just started to ghost one by one. No one is willing to be seen with me or talk to me as they'd be accused of being an apologist, or sympathizer. One of my closest friends had told me that if I made any new friends or tried to be apart of a different clique that it would just confirm the accusations. I've been completely lost with what to do. I recently accepted that my old friends weren't coming back. So being extremely lonely the last six months I reached out to some people. I've explained the situation to them as they asked about it. I'm completely struggling to maintain any sort of relationship with them since I worry about everything I say or do. I overthink too far into the future of the relationship. I'm completely uncomfortable talking to them. When they notice my anxieties and I explain we usually stop talking for the day. It's terrifying. I just don't know what to do. The situation has messed me up pretty bad. I want to leave the city I'm in and start somewhere new but then my legacy here will be that of a garbage can piece of shit person. Fighting to rejoin the community is what I really want to do. The issue is that if I go to a social gathering when they start to pick back up and someone asks me to leave because someone else is uncomfortable honestly I don't know how I'd handle that. I've been trying to be focused on myself and have done well but I don't see any point in existing if I can't communicate and share experiences with others. 
Sorry if this post is a mess, it's my first one and kinda impulsive. Story telling also isn't in my skill set. If anyone has been in a similar situation I'd like to hear what choices you made. Or just how to move forward honestly.",26May2020,1

In the mean time, we need to choose a city to live in for one year. I work on the Internet and family/friends is not an influence in our decision. 

So I thought I’d ask all of you for some advice. What would be a cool city to live in for one year? Maybe a city lesser known city or one we hadn’t thought of. 

Here’s some additional info about us:

-We prefer walkability, not interested in suburbia or farmland 
-No kids involved 
-We are foodies
-We are also fitness junkies
-While we don’t like such labels, our style could be thought of as more liberal/progressive
-We are very active so we are looking for cities with great entertainment options
-My wife is a photographer who loves nature so we prefer beautiful places with great views 
-We are middle class (probably couldn’t afford San Fran or NYC)
-We are open to any medium to larger cities. Probably nothing less than 75k population 

Here’s some cities that we have visited previously and are interested in, but would love to hear others maybe not on our list:

-Portland
-San Diego
-Denver

1120,"I'm an 18 y/o college freshman who's never actually dated anyone, mainly because I've just not found the right person (the only people who show interest usually seem to be about 5 years older than me, creepily enough...). Almost all of my friends and acquaintances have had relationships, intimate experiences, etc. I don't, in all honesty care about not having those experiences yet, I would love to date someone if I genuinely like them but until that happens I'm happy to be single. I think I'm young enough to have time for so much more...

But, dating is so normalized in my community/network that people have always pressured me and made me feel like some sort of freak for never having dated. So, when I went away to college I simply told people I had a boyfriend in high school and we broke up... I made up a few stories, enough details that it would be believable, and have left it at that (why is he not on social media? strict parents). Ever since then I've felt free, like I can choose to live my love life the way and pace I want to live it at. But.... is this really weird? I feel like a bit of a conman... I'm not dishonest by nature so now this is kinda eating at me. I just feel like unpacking the lies now would lead to too much drama and make me seem like a pathetic idiot, but I can't keep up the facade, exactly, either.",26May2020,1
1121," My boyfriend confessed that he did something awful and really embarrassing  as a 13 year old. He used to read Simpsons erotic fan fiction, cos he loved the characters so much. The younger characters were always in their teens or adults in said stories. It's so sick and he is super embarrassed. He recalls on a few occasions searching for images of Lisa naked at the age she is in the show. He feels super bad about it cos technically that character is 8 and he recalls one or two images where she didn't have boobs. I guess he saw her as around his age cos she acts older in the show? He said he found these images easily so he didn't go anywhere illegal for it but I'm super weirded out. Is this a warning sign?

1123,"I was recently assigned a project for my English class, and this morning one group of my friends asked me to join them. I said yes, but then, out of regret, I asked my other friend who I had left alone if she wanted to work with me (and she accepted). I then told the 1st group I was leaving and joined the new one.

However, I am now regretting that decision and want to go back to the 1st group, who I haven’t told about me joining the second group. But, the 2nd group said that I’ve already declined many times (which I have), and it would be a loss for both group since if I left, one would have to decline. I just want everyone to be able to do the assignment, and I feel like I’m being too nice. I just don’t want to decline the 1st group that asked me TWICE. That is just rude and they would think I am being indecisive (which I am). Ugh, I just want everyone to be happy. 

In respect of my feelings, I would want to work with the original group.

Sure i may be insecure in some things but literally all his questions seem to make me feel like I’m doing something wrong.

And i respond “yes i think they are about that price.” And he just stares at me for a bit then makes a “hmph” sound before he turns back to the tv. 

He seems to be very pompous but not too sure if that’s the right word to describe. One time he got upset with me because i didn’t tell my boyfriend to do what his father suggested regarding a car accident he was in. I thought that was extremely interesting as well. He waits for me to greet him when i see him. It’s like he is observing my every move and calculating who he thinks i am. Funny thing is he’s scared of my dog. Side note: He tries to hide it but he never wants to make the wrong move just so he doesn’t bark or snap at him. It’s quite funny 

To help understand this man even more he thinks he knows everything. And although he knows a lot he doesn’t know everything. He’s very opinionated and can be controlling towards my boyfriend.

1131,"I dont know what to do. I've always thought I would be a mother one day. How I feel about myself has always been based on how I capable I feel I would be as a mother. While we were dating, we had conversation after conversation about having kids. He always said that he looked forward to being a dad. I wouldn't have married him if he said he definitely didn't want kids. 

We picked out names, I familiarized myself with everything I could get my hands on about being a good mom, read everything I could find about healthy parent-child relationships, child development, advice from moms on blogs, everything. We held off on having them sooner in our relationship because I endured a very traumatic childhood and I acknowledged my need for healing, so I could have a better chance to be the mother I knew I should be.

I went to doctors, got diagnoses and treatment, medication, and therapy. I've healed a great deal since then and I feel prepared and excited to enter this next chapter of our life together. I thought we were just waiting for me to be ready. That's the way it seemed anyway. He said he was just waiting for me to be ready, then we can start trying.

So I tell him I'm finally ready. I developed coping skills through therapy so I could cope with my PTSD and anxiety to the point that I can function well without medication. We talk and we work out a plan on things to get in order first. I take mental notes and start making progress immediately. I work on my health, I help to make sure we stay within our monthly budget so we can save up for all of the predictable future expenses, I'm on a mission and the goal is in sight.

One day, as I'm standing at the sink washing dishes, he says he doesn't think we should have kids. He tells me he's changed his mind. 

I'm crushed, almost beyond recognition. Instantly, a gaping hole grows in my heart and I fear I'll be lost forever in it. I cried for weeks. Now I cry every time my cycle comes around. I've explained how I feel to him, but he hasn't changed his mind.

I had a couple of friends and even family recommend that I babysit. Their theory was that babysitting would change my mind or somehow suddenly reveal to me that caring for children is so difficult or scary or something. That didn't work. 

I love my husband so much, but I've even questioned myself that maybe I've wasted the last decade of my life with a man that didn't know what he actually wanted until it was almost a reality, or a man without any capability to be a father.

1133,"This is a bit of a long story.
I'm a single father. I am mainly alone in raising my son, and have been for years. 
My son has always been very close to me, and that's how I noticed it in the first place- He became very secretive. At first I assumed it was typical teenage angst and thought nothing of it, until he started wearing jackets in the middle of blazing hot days, and spending long amounts of time in the bathroom.
I got suspicious and one day, while he was outside, I snooped. I'll glaze over the details, but I did discover that my child has been cutting for a year and a half. 
My son admitted it to me when I brought it up after hours of researching, trying desperately to understand why my son do that. He's always been a loner, and very shy and quiet, so he's never been popular in school, which has caused some animosity towards him from some of the other kids. I didn't know about this. 
This was three days ago. I don't know what to do. I've poured through many articles, I've sat down and talked to my son. 
I decided to make an account to try and get advice from people besides the numerous doctors who've just read about it. I want to help my son, and I'm so scared to lose him. All the razors have been cleared from the numerous hiding spots he'd taken to putting them in, and I've even gone so far as to move the knives. I don't want to lose him.

1134,"short version - i really strongly dislike some things i did in the past. but i was never really that mean. so why do i hate my old selves? its like if i do one thing wrong in a phase of my life, that whole phase is tainted. i know people say that cringing at past versions of yourself is a sign of growth, but it seriously messes up my mental health because im always thinking ""whatever i do right now will cause me to hate this version of myself in a few months"". how can i stop?

long version - i divide my life into phases based on the music i listened to, my hair, my outfits, what blankets i use at night, etc. none of these things are really bad, like my music taste was perfectly normal and my hair was only parted differently. but if i make any mistakes in a phase of my life, i look back on it and hate that phase of my life. currently im spending my grandpas last few weeks/months/years with him, and it hurts me to know in a few years ill look back on this time and hate it because of one stupid mistake i made, like being too obsessed with something or an argument with a friend. 

i want to be able to see that mistakes are mistakes, and that the stages in my life should not be hated because of a mistake. because i will always make mistakes. so does anyone know how to combat this before i look back on this post of me asking for help and think of what a whine bag i was?",26May2020,1

Humidity here is 60% and it's 85 degrees. We are both really sensitive to heat and when we have had AC we'd keep it at about 68-70 degrees which was comfortable for us.
We've tried all the tricks I could find on Google. Open windows and doors at night. Put up blackout shades and close windows before it gets warm. Have fans set to counterclockwise and placed so there's air currents through the home. Put icewater in front of your fans. It's a 1 story house so we're not hanging out upstairs.

1137,"So recently I’ve been seriously thinking about getting a new car. I’m 24 and I’ve had two cars since I’ve been driving. The first I brought off my grandparents, it was a great little car, but had no aircon and a cassette player. I had it for a few years. Then my parents offered my their old ford since they were getting a new car, I just had to fix up a few things on the ford which I did and I’ve had that for a few years. 

The ford still goes fine but is getting pretty run down so I’ve been thinking of getting a new car. I told my dad this and he jumped straight onto helping me look because he loves cars. I was only thinking about it but after talking I had basically decided to get a new one around the June/July sales. I was looking at buying a corolla or Mazda new. Didn’t have to be fancy. I drive a corolla at work and love it. However I had decided to buy a new cheaper model, looking at between $20,000-$25,000. 

I decided this because they come with 7 years warranty, all the services were free and free road side assistance. Seemed better than paying $12,000 for a second hand car with no guarantees that might be a lemon. 

My partner and I have lived together for 4.5 years. Been together for 8.5. We have joint accounts and never had an issue with money. We are currently trying to have for a house deposit and a wedding though. He is also currently playing of his loan for his second hand car he got when his finally died. We have never owned anything expensive other than his car. All our furniture and most of our things are second hand from family or friends, except our washing machine, bed and tv. 

We both work full time, and I would be able to afford to pay this loan off. Yesterday my dad called to advise me that I didn’t have to get a new car if I didn’t want and he didn’t want me to feel like he had pushed me into it. He said I could get a nice second hand car for half the price or could even continue using the ford for a few years. They are just worried that it will affect our house savings. 

Now I’m confused. Half of me thinks I’ve worked hard and deserve something new. But the other half is frugal and knows I don’t need it. I could use the ford for a few more years, and I really don’t need to buy a new car, second hand cars can be great. I am so desperate for our own house and we are planning a wedding for within the next two years. Both of these need a lot more savings than we have. I really don’t know what to do now",26May2020,1

I’m 20F. I’ve been quarantining with my boyfriend since the Coronavirus started. In the beginning, things were normal enough...I focused mostly on my college work and taking care of my body. Everything was great between me and my boyfriend, and we enjoyed spending lots of time together. 

Now that the semester is over, and the quarantine is still in effect, I’ve noticed changes in myself. I’ve been getting irritated much more easily. I have all this energy some days and then absolutely no energy the next...those days in particular are usually accompanied by headaches for some reason. 

I’ve been going on hikes with my boyfriend to get fresh air, so that’s definitely been nice, but I still feel so unsettled inside. I’ve become a lot more obnoxious, and sarcastic too, coupled with an overall heightened aggression (it tends to comes out in the way I speak, I’ve never physically hurt myself or anyone else)...I know it’s taking a toll on my boyfriend to see my emotions go all whack. It’s taking a toll on me for sure. I feel like I’m going crazy, like I’m losing control of myself and my life. It’s a horrible feeling. I’ve been having nightmares almost every night these past few weeks as well. :(

Their fights have been aggressive (my mother always initiates), and I have had to stop them from fighting, which has caused me to get beat up a few times by my mother. Their fights get violent when my mother is drinking. This doesn't happen everyday, but when they're stressed it does. They're still married btw.

I have 3 siblings &amp; I'm the eldest. I am so excited that I got into my dream school! But its hard to bring myself to leave home because I wouldn't be able to stop my parents fights or protect my siblings. My parents are well known around town because they're involved with politics, so even if I told the police or anyone else, that would affect EVERYTHING and maybe even worsen things.

 TODAY: I got beat up by my mother bc I was holding her back from fighting my dad, and i saw my dad choking her. She's had a six pack of beer, some Jack Daniels, and some blue label... all today. My father is not perfect either and is so busy that he barely pays attention to us.. but at least he can control his emotions. My mother can't. Quarantine is making this worse. I am still recovering emotionally from my suicide attempt 3 months ago. And I cant take the BS anymore. I don't know what else to do.  I have two options, I can go to my dream college next year, or I can take a gap year and keep an eye on everybody.

1144,"Ok, so me and my S.O. are both 15, I am a male and she is a female if that helps at all. Recently, my S.O. has been getting worse and worse and blocking out/getting rid of anyone or anything that helps her or makes her happy and I'm extremely worried about her. She took up cutting about 2 years prior, even back then I knew her and did all I could, but eventually it came down to me calling the authorities to save her when she threatened to kill herself one night and her parents sent her to a mental hospital for awhile, which yes, while it did make her stop when she got out (for awhile) the things she got away with and did in there are absolutely horrible and I'm disgusted by the way mental hospitals go about ""helping"" their patients. So anyways, recently she picked it back up again, I'd say about a month to a month and a half ago. I've been doing everything in my power to help her stop and I got her to for like 1 maybe 2 weeks at most before an event occurred in which she got her phone taken away by her parents and started it up again because I couldn't be there for her. She also most likely has an eating disorder, I say this because one moment she is eating/snacking just chillin, the next shes throwing it all up and going days on end without eating. Shes claimed it has nothing to do with being fat (shes under 90 pounds) but yet she still brings up eating ""like a pug"" or not wanting to ""get fat"" so I assume that may be her reasoning but it could be more. She tells her parents (who are doing a very shit job at looking after their daughter btw) that shes just not feeling well or she pretends to eat and gets away with it. She also has terrible mood swings, one minute shes happy, joyful, playful, laughing, the next shes depressed, crying, suffocating herself in her blanket, cutting herself..... (this is all over facetime because her parents are not allowing me to see her as they are very strict) so her mood just changes out of nowhere and whenever I try to bring up her needing help or asking if somethings wrong she gets really upset. She's terrible at taking care of herself and has proclaimed many times ""I hate myself, that's why"" but never goes into detail. She names many things about herself that she ""hates"" but I dont think those are why she does everything she does, and if it is that's why I suggest for her to get help but she refuses all the time. She never eats, never drinks water, barely sleeps, does everything she can when shes sick to make herself worse such as drinking coffee and staying up, she never takes her medication, she purposely hurts herself, she doesnt open up, she doesnt respect her own values and boundaries, hell she threw away her inhaler because of whatever reason but she needs it so she doesnt die from a coughing fit due to her thyroidism, which she doesnt do anything to help either. She never allows herself to warm up when shes cold, she suffocates herself in a blanket, she doesnt take her meds for it, it's sad more than it is upsetting if I'm being honest. Lately she has been getting rid of/blocking out people who are helping her, which is why I'm glad I convinced her to let me talk to her about this tomorrow, but anyways she convinced her stupid ass useless parents that she doesnt need a therapist anymore, she doesn't tell her doctor anything, she doesnt open up to her parents (understandable because they get mad or brush it off. Dude FUCK them honestly) and she's even blocked me a couple times for spam calling her when she attempted to cut herself (134 deep wound cuts caused by an army knife her dumbass parents never took away btw because I couldn't reach her and her parents for SOME reason trust her home alone) and she's pushed away friends too.
