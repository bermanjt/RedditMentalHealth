1,"Earlier today we let our dogs outside and the went under our deck and ate a bunch of bunny’s and tore the nest. We didn’t know until an hour after and we went under the deck Because they wouldn’t come inside. We had found a newborn bunny that was bleeding from the mouth and Lying on our rocks so we put it on a plate of soft napkins and let it lay down where we found it. After a while we checked on it and it was moving it’s arms and legs and rolling around. I don’t want to let it die, how do I save it?",16May2020,1
2,"Back in October, I (22F) met Katie (19F). I was instantly pretty infatuated. It seemed reciprocated. We went on one date but nothing much happened - continued to just see her around in person.

Around february, I met Ellie (22F). We instantly clicked and started talking. We went on maybe three dates. It was really really early, but it felt kind of presumed we'd continue seeing each other, unless something happened to change things.

A month into talking through Ellie, I went through some personal shit, and my replies became slow. It was verging the point of ghosting her (this wasn't deliberate I was just distracted/depressed), but I bumped into her in person and agreed to go on a date, that obviously got cancelled because of the pandemic.

Right before the pandemic, I went on a night out and bumped into Katie. We got together at the end of the night. I know it was just club-encounter, but it was genuinely really romantic - it was like we could've been anywhere.

I don't know if Katie's disinterested or just bad at replying, but we haven't chatted much since, and that's not due to me. I'd honestly like to take the chance that she's a bad replier. I'm probably going to text her a little bit (like every few weeks) and ask to see her once lockdown's over.

This complicates things with Ellie, who wants to see me (socially distanced) during the lockdown. I genuinely like her. If lockdown wasn't happening, I would probably slow things down with her and give things a shot with Katie. I think it's fine to do this as long as things aren't too emotional (and we'd only been on three dates).

I don't exactly want to end things with Ellie or commit to Katie when barely anything's even happened. At the same time, stringing her along potentially for months while there's someone else I like feels like a shit thing to do.

It's like life has been put on pause. Nothing can actually happen, but if I don't end things I'm basically giving her false hope potentially for months. I obviously don't know how she (Ellie) feels, but she seems to really like me. She seems very happy and excitable around me, and when we'd go on dates she wouldn't be able to leave (we'd be outside her house, she'd say bye, and then she'd just not go into her house until I left).

I don't really know what to do.",16May2020,1

Every source says clinical depression is caused by BOTH genetics and environmental factors. This is called the gene-environment interaction. You are born with a genetic predisposition, and your environment can help pull the trigger. So why are people saying that it’s entirely genetic?

4,"Hey dudes, something has been bothering me for a while now.  
I am a 29Male, i have been in a pretty good relationship from the past 2 years and I got fatter.  


There is  a short verion, in the end, if u arent in the mood for all the reading 

Introduction

After the breakup of my 1st relationship (this is my second) i started to go to the gym, a good and decent diet whit professional help, that leads me to my best good looking form.  
My life was 1h workout in the morning, 6-8h of work, 4h in college at night. i usually would get home around 23pm and to bed, rinse and repeat.

After 1 year into to that i got in a relationship in the start of my last year of college. It was a whole wear (for the most of it) where i stopped going to the gym in the morning and started doing the final paper, so i could graduate, my thesis, and of course, weekends, some week days also + college it self.  


It was hard, but all worthed.  


In the end of 2018 i graduated, whit a big 10 on my thesis.

And then it came, the lawyer exam (i am graduated in law).  


I started to study for the exam soon in 2019. Did the 1st phase, aproved, then the second, and we were in middle of 2019. And then done, i can be a lawyer.  


However continue in my old job. And then a promotion came. My 6h daily work load became a 8h work load on minimum, some days 10h.  


And now i am studying for a governament job.   
And my routine is taring, really. My job is really stressful, my work load is gigantic.  
My studies take a big time of my free time.  


The point is:  


I know i am fat (1,75m whit 82Kg), my waist is big and most of my older pants arent confortable.  
But i dont feel the need for going into a diet, and stop consuming the conforts foods i like or consuming some alcohol (beer mostly) because I have been focusing all my free time in my Fun/entretaiment and my future .  
Today got in to a fight whit my mom. She bought home some pants (for working) and none would fit me. She said she woundt buy me, like if i needed or asked for the pants, any bigger pants.

And now theres all this covid shit. where i live everything is fine (low infected numbers), but i dont feel like doing to the gym or doing a diet, my time and energy are elsewhere.

  
Maybe i am a litle depressed. i hate my job, but it keeps me able to invest in my future. i dont know.  


I know, that if i have free time, and force of will (that i am lacking at many points in my life) i can lose my waist overwheight.  


but i cant feel like this is a priority.  


Well, thanks, i needed to put this out.

5,"I (22) am writing this for advice, but also just to vent and get written what I feel is wrong. It's been about 3 or 4 weeks since my brother (24) got a puppy. When my brother first told mom and dad that he wanted to get a dog they were not fully on board with the idea. My mom had a dog when she was a kid but idk any more about that, however my dad's never had a dog and both of them now are experts with knowledge about dogs just because they have read one book about them. The puppers is a pure husky and she has a lot of energy. She is still in potty training (kinda) and sometimes has accidents still. My mom gets really upset at my brother, because her view is he's not properly caring for her. My brother has spent the most time with the puppy and so he knows more about her just simply from being with her. my mom gets upset cuz he's becoming more independent and needs her less. Lately arguments have become more frequent because either my mom or brother don't like how the other is handling the pup, training ect. I guess what I want advice on is should my brother and I move out if he is not being treated as an adult? Some of his rules set in place for his puppy are disregard when either my mom or dad help out. Am I over reacting to think that this behavior is not ok? Also a side note is my mom and dad try their best to keep control over me and my brother even though we are adults. If more info is needed I'll try my best.",16May2020,1
6,"So to start off, my dad's a great person. He loves each and every one of our animals and would never hurt them for any reason. 

Yesterday night, our dog bubba started getting sick. He was throwing up, which had some blood in it, very weak, drooling from the mouth, and diarrhea with blood. As time went on it got worse. 

We determined he must've gotten into some of the rat poison we had hidden around the shop in our backyard, and he was on his way out. 

My dad stayed up all night with him until he finally passed, at around 4 in the morning. We are all devastated, but my dad is the worst. A little while ago I asked him if he blamed himself about Vinny's (he had two names) passing. He told me he did, because if he hadn't had put the rat poison out, he'd still be alive. I tried telling him it wasn't anyone's fault, and Vinny was just being a dog and getting into stuff, but it didn't make him feel any better. 

I guess the reason I'm writing this is because I need advice on how I can get him to realize it isn't his fault bubba is gone. I love him to death and hate seeing him so tore up about this. Thanks in advance Reddit.",16May2020,2
7,"I'm over 20 years old and I'm still struggling with the trauma and anxiety I have from my entire life. 

I didn't grow up in a shitty home where I was starved to death or severely beaten on the regular, but both of my parents had a history of anger issues especially when I was young. 

Personally, I think a lot of my issues stem from my parents. One of them cheated on the other the first time when I was about 3. I obviously never knew, but they got back together and things were seemingly fine. The next time it happened I was 11. I still didn't know, and here's the worst part the parent that cheated told me that the reason our family was splitting and I was moving with them was because of the abusive tendencies that the other would break out into on me when things were going bad. 

-Some examples of these abusive tendencies can lead from anything such as screaming in my face for absolutely no reason, spanking me while holding me by the hair until I pissed myself, and sometimes if it was bad the slight choke or drag on the ground. This doesn't include both of them using vulgar language around me and towards me so young. 

*All of this, I can I guess forgive. In the current day, one of my parents is actually completely mellowed out and I'm able to forgive them. *
 
So we move, and parents seem to handle their issues and we all are a ""happy"" family again. Then another cheating scandal, same parent and now I'm 16. I find out because my young sibling is playing on their phone, and brings it to me when they find a weird messaging app with exposing photos being sent. This was the first time I had ever seen or been aware that one of them was cheating. I was crushed. I called out my parent and they tried to convince me that it wasn't cheating, even though it was full on cheating w nudity and sex talk lmaoo. 

I told my parent if they didn't tell the other I would. They promised me they would in time. I waited, and ended up getting blackmailed and borderline harassed by family that's close with the parent that cheated and was told to ""think of the bigger picture"" and that ""my other parent would kill themselves if they found out"" I even told them I was going to kill my self because I couldn't handle it and they told me which would I want my siblings to loose me or their other parent. I stayed quite. 

I was then bribed on shopping sprees, concert tickets, and a family adventure to the ""happiest place in the world""  -- right bc after I just caught my whore ass parent cheating I want to go on a trip with the entire family and enjoy our love, let alone sit at the same dinner table. Lmao. 

So I couldn't handle that pressure. I ended up telling one of my trusted family members I was close with, they decided since we were more like bffs than anything else that I could drink w them. Even though I'm 14. I get drunk and my family member ends up telling me about all the other times that my parent cheated. I didn't even know that that was going to come up in conversation. I was shocked and frankly I felt vulnerable and semi taken advantage of???

After like four days I just couldn't hold that shit in anymore I had a full break down at school and I had a classic conversation at the park w my cheating parent about how it's gonna be fine and how they'll tell them. They didn't. Flash forward the next weekend the cheating parent forces or I guess bribes me to go to a concert w them before they tell my other parent. We went and it was all fine for a few hours until some randos try to get at my parent and wanna party and theyre up for it even though I'm there. I get so upset I freak out and we get into a huge fight in front of an entire crowd of people where they literally slap me across the face for calling them out. They then call a cab to take our asses home. I'm crying the entire time and my parents telling me how I ruined our family and life. 

We get home and my parent literally wakes up the 
Other and makes me watch them tell the other that they cheated. Then listen as they tell them they they're keeping my siblings but I can go w my other parent. They declare they're supposedly getting a divorce and send me to bed. 
 
Two weeks later everything's fine and nothing happen. This is ONE out of a thousand stories I can tell you where something super traumatic happens and it gets blown over and pushed away. I'm not even upset about this anymore I literally don't even care they can screw eachother however the fuck, but I just don't know how to cope w the trauma and pain I get from these experiences. 

Can someone please give me advice?

TLDR: I have a history of experiencing traumatic events and pain  from the people I love and do not know how to cope/handle the pain and suffering that comes with it. It literally haunts me in my dreams and memories and has for years. Any advice? I just want to clear my head and heart and sole of the pain and trauma I've been through.",16May2020,1
9,"A little background info: she lives in a house with her sister and niece, and her niece’s friend. We live in different cities about five hours away. 

The niece’s friend will leave for the weekend to visit his mom, then her nephew will come stay for the weekend. Currently where I live, there are pretty strict social distancing suggestions for everyone to maintain their safety, with suggestions to only spend time with the people who live in your home. There are currently active COVID-19 cases in her city, and both her niece and the friend work outside of the house. It makes me extremely uncomfortable with everyone coming and going, and my mom has mentioned it makes her uncomfortable as well. 

Now, the issue. My mom is very introverted so she doesn’t speak up at all when something upsets her or makes her uncomfortable. When I had asked if she said anything, she didn’t text me back until the next morning about a totally different topic. 

I’m not sure what I should do. I don’t know if reaching out to my aunt will resolve anything, or if it has the potential to cause any problems. Any suggestions are much appreciated!",16May2020,1
10,"So my internet carrier (spectrum) sent me a letter saying one of my devices has been hacked.. but I can only download the guard they give us on my boyfriends computer .. not my phone. 
But I’m pretty sure it’s my phone that has it because my niece clicked on a notification from my email which was a fake Apple link.. and I think that’s where it came from. 
How do I get it off my phone? Do I just reset it?",16May2020,1
11,"All my life I haven’t been a very social person. 
I always said I was an introvert. 

But recently... I started craving for friends. I love anime and have watched tons of it. Whenever I go to Instagram and see pictures of people cosplaying as anime characters and hanging out at anime conventions it makes me feel so fucking envious and upset at myself for not being able to make friends. 

People who are into anime and hang out at anime conventions seem so nice and friendly and fun to be around. I sometimes fantasize about finding a small group of people who have the same interests as me and hang out with them and go to movie theaters with them and stuff. 

I always described myself as an independent introvert and no matter how much I deny social interaction and say I don’t need it unlike most other people, deep down I truly want to have friends that care about me and appreciate me. 

I was diagnosed with depression and other mental issues and I probably have more that I haven’t been diagnosed yet. My anger prevents me from socializing most of the time. 

How can I make friends?",16May2020,1
12,"I’ve never dealt with so much nausea. It comes in waves. I’ll be fine and then all the sudden I’m so nauseous I have to sit down til it passes. 

I’ve noticed sometimes it’s around the time I’m hungry or need to eat. Usually I feel a bit better after I eat food,  but not always. 

I get very shaky and anxious when I’m hungry. I also feel tired a lot. If I don’t eat at certain times of the day, I’m so fatigued and sometimes lightheaded. 

I also suffer with a good bit of anxiety and depression. Which, I often wonder, could be causing it as well. 

Any ideas? Thoughts?",16May2020,1
13,So I moved out of my old town where I had a good amount of friends who all knew that I was bi. Now no one knows that I'm bi and I don't know how to tell my new friends. Should I check with them first to make sure that they are chill with bi people?,16May2020,1
14,"Ok. So I at the time of the break up, I was 26, she was 28. We was together for 3 years. The break up was traumatic for me. And what I mean by traumatic, meaning there was violence, cahos, police involved, you name it. She was the one who broke it off and was very vindictive at the same time. I found out from Mutual freinds that she had been sleeping with another guy during the ""post-breakup"". When I heard the news, my world hit rock bottom. I felt embarrassed and pathetic because I was begging for her back, making a fool of myself. She was stringing me along as if we were going to get back together. During that time I couldnt eat, lost weight etc..I was heart broken.

6 months down the line I pulled myself together, found a better job and did the no contact rule, and I executed it quite well. She would randomly call or send me an email about unnecessary things. During the no contact rule, I found another girlfreind and unfortunately that didnt workout either. (I'm 28 yrs now and I'm starting I'm beleive nothing doesnt last in this lifetime anymore). Anyways, About a month after my recent ex left me, that same ex sent a freind request on facebook. I ignored it. Kept my no contact rule strong. Mind you this was 2 years later after that terrible break up. At this point I had isolated from social media altogether due from the recent break up that I'm still trying to recover in.

Anyways, 2 months pass by and today out of no where I get a messenger request from that same damn ex!! My question is, why the hell is this woman trying to contact me? When she broke up with me, she said she was done, and that she can do better by her 'damn"" self, and left me for another guy; also heard rumors that the guy she left me for left her ass, and now shes with a whole other guy. 

Should I respond to her politely? Or just keep ignoring her. My gut instinct is telling me to ignore her for the rest of my life because its some things she did during the break up that I cant forgive her for. I could have went to jail behind this woman. On the other hand, I dont want to come off as petty either. What you guys think I should do here? And why does she randomly keep trying to contact me? I never understand how someone can crush your heart, and expect you to jump whenever the hell they feel like their comfortable to come back to you. Its just selfish to me. What you guys think?",16May2020,1
15,"I understand that I’ve been fortunate enough to be working in an industry that is currently still deemed as essential and also have the ability to work from home. Our company, based in Los Angeles, has been working from home since mid March, and we have about 2-300 people in the office usually. 

However, this week they’re starting to discuss how to slowly bring the employees back into the office. They’ve included that they will continue working from home where applicable, follow the state guidelines, and provide PPE. 

A lot of my coworkers that I’ve talked to actually enjoy WFH and feel that WFH is working for them, which is the feeling I share as well. But I know that isn’t the case for my direct manager, who doesn’t like WFH, citing reasons such as difficult communication/meetings and such. I know he doesn’t take the coronavirus seriously because he’s still unnecessarily going to places that are open just to “get some fresh air”. He also believes that the stay-at-home order and all the closing of non essential businesses are too much, so I’m pretty positive that he’s going to make us come into the office whenever possible. 

I’m pretty young so I don’t belong to the high-risk group and I live by myself so I don’t have anyone to possibly spread the virus to. But still, with that many people in an office setting, a lot of whom I have no idea if they’re adhering to the social distancing guidelines, etc. I don’t know if I am being selfish but I’ve literally been staying home other than groceries for the past two months. I am also getting all my work done while working from home, so I see no reason why I should be going back to the office this early. Do I have a case in telling my boss that I would like to continue working from home if they do in fact make us report back to the office?",16May2020,1

18,"I had an old friend but over a couple months we have stopped talking. He was really bad at communicating with me and never replied to me when I messaged him. It sounds like he was avoiding me which could be what happened? but I don’t want to speculate because we were very tight and he is TERRIBLE at communication. 

I can’t stop thinking about him and I just get a sinking feeling in my chest when I realize he doesn’t talk to me anymore. The last time we chatted was Dec on his birthday, obviously it’s May now.

Our other best friend (also his ex) can’t reach out to him. She sends him memes sometimes to try to be friendly and he avoids the texts or blocked her I’m not sure. I am also concerned reaching out to him will hurt her feelings. I’m trying to fix how I feel though. Ive spent a lot of my life sacrificing my mental health to make others feel comfortable but I want to take a selfish move. I think getting closure might help me.

I really, really miss him. I miss smiling and joking around with him;) I have been giving him space because I assume that’s what he needs? But I also have needs, you feel me? Would it be a bad idea to text him to get some closure? Any idea of what to say? Any idea on how I should cope if he doesn’t reply?",16May2020,1
19,"I work for a physical therapy office. I was originally hired on as a medical biller with no experience (I worked with insurance before this job). I kind of gotten thrown at this job and had to figure out a lot on my own with an asshole for a boss (he doesn't think it's harassing if I keep calling people for payment and I leave a voicemail -- as long as they don't answer it's not harassment until they say it is). In February, he decided to promote me to Office Admin and told me he wanted me to be in charge of reception, and he'd slowly train me. He did not. I was able to pick up pieces and tasks I should be handling but he hasn't defined my job so black and white. I won't lie, a lot of things I'm doing are borderline shady, if not illegal in some aspects.   


He hired a marketer on 5/1/20, who is doing Admin tasks that I should be doing (running/sitting in on interviews, etc). We finally hired a receptionist (I had been doing reception working 10 hour days for 2 weeks and unable to get a lot of my work done) on 5/11/20. My boss had said that he was going to be enrolling us in a Scientology college to do some courses. Even said one of the courses would ""teach us how to study"". When we tried to discuss it in the meeting where he brought it up, he had mentioned we had to set aside at least 3-4 hours a week and isolate ourselves in the break room to ""study, and do your assignments/essays that will be graded"". Trying to keep my head down because my boss has fired about 6 people in the last 6 months, I didn't speak up. None of us want to say anything and already I had a phone call regarding Hubbard College to take these courses, that the other two forwarded to me because they didn't want to deal with it either. I admitted to them I haven't been given any information other than the fact he said he would be enrolling us. They seemed a little caught off guard but I managed just to have them email us the information instead of him insisting on personalized calls to each of us.   


None of us want to be enrolled or do these courses because we all feel like it's a waste of time. Considering the fact it's also a religious college and none of us are religious, it's really off putting to put religion on us when this is a work environment. I came here to work, not to do school work. Not to mention, the marketer also has 5 degrees.   


I guess the main question is: is it legal to enroll us in a college without permission? Sorry for the rant, this situation is frustrating and there's been a long history of shadiness or rudeness from my boss that has made me want to quit multiple times but because of COVID-19 and my experience, no one wants to take me and I can't really afford a paycut to work elsewhere.

Before I get into exactly happened, I wanna explain I’ve known her for years because she has been close with my sister since high school, we aren’t necessarily friends but we are closer than acquaintances. I am also gay, with a boyfriend and I thought she knew that before the fact. 

My sister and her friend lived in the dorms at their college but had to come home because of quarantine. Her friend couldn’t go back to her parent’s so we happily let her stay with us. 

Last night was my 16th birthday, we celebrated and it was cool, whatever. At like 11 last night I was in my room and my sister’s friend came into my room and shut the door. Which was weird, but whatever I wasn’t worried about it. We were just chatting, I was sitting on the bed, she sat down next to me, and kissed me. There’s 3 layers of fucked to this, firstly I’m a minor, which she knows. Secondly, I’m gay. Thirdly, I’m in a relationship. Which I think she knew. I like froze for a solid 3 seconds, she grabbed my hair and I pushed her off me, told her I like men and to please leave my room. Before all this she had been making a lot of sexual jokes towards me, but I wasn’t weirded out by that until now because I thought she knew I was gay and was just messing around. 

I’ve been avoiding her like the plague all day, I would tell my mom but because of some stuff I don’t think she’d believe me. My sister might but I don’t really know her that well anymore so it could really go one of two ways.

23,"(I'm giving fake names)
Kev, James and Ellie are my friends and we are all friends with each other. Kev and James were my childhood friends and we later about 3 years ago met a girl named ellie online and she is our online fiend and visits us every time we have a break at the same time.

The thing is.. Sometimes I can be with Kev and James.. But I am never with them alone - though they are almost always with each other alone.
That makes me sad and makes me feel left out.
Kev have had a broken foot for a very long time and I recently got to know from ellie that James got to follow Kev when he had the surgery and I never even got to know he had the surgery until I met both of them again as a group. - they didn't even mention they we with each other.. Probably cause they knew I would be kinda upset about it or yea.

I feel so left out and I kinda blame it on me and how I can be bad with communicating.. Thiugh I have no problem when I'm with James and we go to school together so yea..
Me and Kev have it easier to talk when we are texting but how should we knkw we never hang out irl.

He (Kev) always says that he wants to be with me irl but never acts on it!! He also says he dosent feel awkward around me - cause I thought that was why he didn't want to be with me so I asked him that. He apparently feels completely comfartble with me - though he never wants to be with me irl but can be with James..

Idk I feel like he say stuff that aren't true and just keeps me as a friend cause otherwise he would feel bad and feel bad for me or idk.

I'm pretty sad about James too.. He never dms me anymore or send any messages or memes as he used to.. We were suppose to play on Playstation one time and he have not responded since 10th of May when I asked ""tell me when you're ready to play"". 

Ellie is on my side about this can understand why I feel this way which is nice.. But the thing she dosent know is that I kinda wanna cut Kev of.. Or something

I don't wanna be friends if I'm just a ""backround"" friend. I don't wanna be in the group if I just am because they feel bad for me.

So I'm asking if that's a smart thing to do here.. Does anyone understand what I'm going through?

I guess Kev and James have more in common too.. The funny thing is ellie said that Kev thought that me and James were close and better friends then those two lmao?? The only reason he thinks that is probably because I go to school with him but yeah idk I thought that was hilarious. 

Me and Kev can talk alot in dm though.. About random shit but like he never tells me stuff about his legs etc.. He does get personal with me alot and seek for my advice.. Or to be honest.. Lately he actually haven't.. Hmm.. He used to at least. 

If we go back even further I can see that James also asked me if I wanted to hang but it has never happened.. He never acts on it even though I suggest a date. 

Idk maybe I should cut both of them off... None of them seems to want to be with me and they are better at being alone with each other etc.. 

I am also gay but I don't think that's why. They have been supportive of the lgbt - except that one time where they said pride is unnecessary and thought gay people already have been recognized etc.. Which was not so nice to hear tbh but whatever.. I'm showing too much bad sides here I feel like they are overall nice dudes but yea we are not just as close I feel like and yea.. Maybe it's time to start backing off for real..

27,"Im a 19y/o F 

Me and my now ex best friend (also 1st cuzzin) have been on no speaking terms for almost three months now. Our friendship started out when I was in high school (16) and she was out living on her own (23). naturally I thought of her as a mentor and she took me under her wing and taught me a bunch about being an adult and social issues. We got along really well mostly because i was super mature for my age (this was said by her, not me eating my own ass out lol). She was a great support to me when it came to family issues and mental health. We both smoked weed but whenever she smoked all she wanted to do was watch friends for 14 hours straight, and in some ways gave me bad advice when it came to school and getting my work done.

Now before i start this let me give u some backstory. Her most recent ex bf and i had a HUGE age gap, but intellectually i was able to keep up with him and her when it came to topics discussing social issues and arguments. fast forward to about three months ago when shit went down. So she started seeing this guy which for a lack of better words is a scum bag. hes a drug dealer, unemployed, lives at his friends mom house and doesn't pay fr food or rent. Whenever i would hang out with him all he would talk about is drama or shit talking people who i didnt know because i was much younger than them.

My friend started to have some doubts about him and i told her how i felt about him and she agreed to cut it off..... a week later i asked her if i could come chill after i go to a powwow, she says she has nothing planned and i think everything is good. so i go to my event and i text her a few times being like ""hey when do u want me over"" stuff like that, but i get no response. I got a ride to her house anyways as her not responding was normal as she sleeps in till like 3 or 4 everyday. I started calling when she didnt answer the door, after that i went around and knock on her window thing bc my ride left at that point. she opens the door and she informs me that shes on a date with that guy she told me she wanted to cut off.

So I go in and i left as soon as i could because i felt as if i was lied to and she really did let me down. When i got home i messaged her about it and when i started to call her she just stopped opening my messages. Once i finally got a response she blows up and calls me immature and that me and that guy don't get along because of the age gap...... And that's where i lost it . i posted some passive aggressive snap chats and the more i would argue with her the more she would use logical fallacies or dodge questions. after that i blocked her on everything and told myself not to talk to her untill we can both agree that we need to apologize to each other, but her being her she thinks that she cant do anything wrong. in the 5 years we've been friends i haven't seen her apologize for anything.

fast forward to now, she got her younger sister to ask how i was doing, then on my bday sent a snap from her roommates account saying have a nice day, then today she dropped off a small gift for me. But she also messaged my brother and she is now also a dealer along with her imbecile of a bf she has. honestly im here because i dont know what  i should do, should i let her in my life and tell her boundires? does she deserve to be my friend? the last thing i want is to hang out with her bf again",16May2020,1

30,"I am from the USA and I am a junior in high school, and the summer after I graduate I have the options to go on two different school trips. Price is not a concern.

Option A:With the Spanish, German, and French countries to visit all 3 countries over 2 weeks. The trip is open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors. I have only 2 friends really going and few others I know well enough to hold a conversation. I was able to form an opinion and like 2/6 teachers going, the rest I don't know. Would be a fun way to travel and see much of Europe which is one of the things I really want to do.

Option B:With the accelerated English classes. Open to juniors and seniors (I technically fall under senior). 1 week to England and France. I have 3-4 friends and the others I have classes with and I'm pretty comfortable with the people and can hold a conversation well. The one teacher really likes me already and she's one of my favorite teachers, the other I've heard is nice and will have her next year. Would be a fun way to spend senior summer with friends.

My mom made a great point to me about how as a senior, I should make memories with friends because I can always go back to Europe and visit  later. However, I have good friends in Option A but better friends in B, but A is much longer and you see more.  I am indecisive and just need help deciding which one. Thanks.",16May2020,1

Its scary cause were moving in together already signed the lease but she gets so much male attention.. she also has onlyfans etc. I dont know if i should just dump her and move on and find a good girl but i like this girl 

She makes it really hard when her snapchat has 500+ males its crazy. She tells them all the time she gotta ask her man (me) before shes able to link up w them. And for the most time she seems pretty great.

But then has odd mood swings and snapps out on me and i cannot deny the fact that shes a hoe. 

Shes loving and nurturing, but at the same time a demon its so hard to explain idk with this girl

Maybe she changes her password cause she dont wanna hurt me .. Idk its been alot of times ive had the chance to meet with fairly attractive girls im an attractive male my self. Sometimes i think the relationship is all good then other times i wonder if i can trust this person 

Should i just move in and see how it goes .. or give up :( 

Like i try not to let the other male attention bother me cause im the one whos with her but she has some shes already fucked hitting her up and theyll play i message games together i feel like like a lame ive asked her does she want an open relationship and she says no .. but id be fine w that. That way i know i dont have to worry about shit. But its just not fair if im being loyal to a women who clearly belongs to the streets . Maybe im overthinkin maybe she do care about me. But switching passcodes deleting messages that shit makes me suspicious. 

Btw i DO not go thhru her phone. But at the beginning (before the relationship) she would message this annoying ass dude and exchange nudes it pissed me off and now theres the odd time weere i get suspicious and ask her to show me whats goin on.

34,"A few weeks into lock down I broke up with my boyfriend. It was a long distance relationship and we’d been together for nearly 2 and a half years. It was a difficult relationship for many reasons. We both have mental health issues and we weren’t intimate often. 
I want to get married and have a house with my significant other but my boyfriend had no plans to move nearer to me or have me move nearer to him, there wasn’t really a future even though I loved him and cared a lot for him. 

Someone started paying attention to me who I had a crush on years ago and I liked the attention. I got way ahead of myself and saw this person as a possible other option as he lived in the same town as me. One thing led to another and I ended up sexting this other person and I felt awful about it and realised I’d have to break up with my boyfriend as it wasn’t fair on him and it obviously showed that our relationship had ran it’s course. 

The other person was only interested in ‘having fun’ and doesn’t want a relationship. I didn’t leave my boyfriend for him but it was a very confusing time for me. I’m still really good friends with my ex boyfriend and he was really understanding when I told him about the other person. He’d been expecting the break up for a while. 

Anyway the point is I miss my ex boyfriend, he was lovely and kind and the nicest person I’ve ever met. He thinks the break up was the right thing to do and i do too as we have no future but I miss him really badly. I’m trying to fill the hole in my heart and replace him with someone else who isn’t interested in me and I think I’m projecting my feelings onto this person and I know it’ll end terribly.

40,"Throwaway because I don't feel comfortable using my main account

A very important note to the story is my now ex-boyfriend/Girlfriend is a system meaning they have  dissociative identity disorder (or did) and I was dating 2/3 alters in the system

So to what happend, they asked me out 2 days ago and I said yes because I mistook my feelings of wanting to become better friends with them as romantic feelings, I also have alot of trauma surrounding relationships and I guess I also wanted to prove to myself that I was healing and that a relationship wouldn't scare me (spoiler alert it did)

I shared with them my mother's abuse and they made a joke about kidnapping me away from her, I assumed it was a joke so I laughed and said ""that would be cool"" and didn't think much else of it until I got a message later that night from them asking what I would do in a kidnapping scenario, the message read:

""You are lying in bed reading a book, when all of a sudden the lights cut out
You hear something open your door and before you can react, a hand covers your mouth

And you hear us telling you it's okay and not to worry, that we're going to take care of you, and go somewhere safe

Reaction?""

I responded with ""would probably be freaked out""

And they responded ""Realistic, k""

This severely freaked me out and caused me to have a panic attack and to call my best friend crying, I told him everything that happend and I realised that I had rushed into the relationship, he adviced me that I should be honest with ex and tell him how I feel, so I messaged them a huge paragraph telling them how I felt, we talked about it and then they had to get off

And now to the current, why couldn't I have known my feelings before I said yes instead of putting them threw so much, I don't know what to do but I still want to be friends with them because I still care  for them and I've put them threw so much, we already introduced each other to our friends and now I'm panicking that everyones going to ask what happend, I've created such a huge mess and I just really needed to rant anywhere, I'm so sorry that this was really long to read",16May2020,1

Ok so basically theres a girl that I know since Christmas, and we just met again to « netflix and chill » , but the fact is that she’s already in a long distance relationship, ( France to England) and we find each other cute and stuff  

So we did it several times (3) then at the fourth time , the things stepped up and we started teasing each other, long story short she sleep at my home and we cuddle all night . Then at the morning , we were both horny , and we started french kissing and having « sex » with the clothes on .

Next day , she come back again and we kiss and at one point , after a level 100 of hornyness , I start teasing her about how bad she wanted my weenee . She finally slurp me , but in the middle of that , she felt bad because it was cheating .

After that , she leaves my house and I texted her to apologise to her for making her do it ( I do not forced her to be clear , we were both in that mood) and no response , and usually she respond in like 1/2 mins .

So what should I do to see her again ? I kinda love her , and it hurt me to know her sad. Please answer if you have ideas .",16May2020,1

46,"I apologize if I accidentally break any rules, I have never posted here before but I find myself lonely during quarantine and something that has been bothering me for a really long time has been able to become prominent and it’s driving me nuts. 

Quick background information, I was emotionally abused by a severely mentally ill family member so my entire adult life has been me learning to feel emotions and process them healthily and maturely instead of disassociating/maladaptively daydreaming. I am also chronically ill and wasn’t diagnosed until an adult so I have had to overcome and manage a lot of “unexplained” physical exhaustion/pain along with my mental health. I truly missed out in my late teens/early twenties and made no friends, memories, fulfilling/enriching decisions because I was an angry, bitter person too terrified to feel unworked-through trauma and I was too physically sick to have the energy beyond taking care of my basic needs. 

I have done a LOT of self work these last couple of years and I find myself in a place where I am quite lonely and unfulfilled. I am working on managing my chronic illness so that I can go back to college and try for a degree. I of course can’t help the fact that I am chronically ill and so I am finally accepting that I cannot do all of the things I was expected to go on and do when I was a kid from the adults in my life and that has been a huge relief for my self esteem. Emotionally/mentally I finally believe things truly do get better and I am so thankful and blessed to be so far away from where I used to be. I feel more positive, healthy, and like I am in a good place to be a good person to others and to myself. This coming fall depending on how quarantine goes I really would like to try and put myself out there and make some human connections and find what I am passionate about for really the first time in my life. 

Long story long (I’m so sorry) my self esteem hasn’t always been the best but it has been improving. I have been in a few romantic relationships the last few years and each one has been healthier than the last. I am learning who I want to be as a partner and who I want for a partner. My self esteem/feeling of self worth has always been so terribly low that I really never had a positive outlook on dating. I do know my worth is not based on another person and that I have to be a healthy and happy independent individual and that romantic relationships can enrich my life further on top of that so I promise I don’t expect a person to complete/fulfill the things I am still super actively working on and focused on. 

Anyway this seems random now but two years ago when I was still very depressed and withdrawn into myself I met a man at my college. All I can describe is the moment I saw him I knew that I had never met or seen him before but that he was ‘supposed’ to cross paths with me? If that makes sense. I had never met him before and he felt like home. I did not take care of myself physically at this time so I had chronic cystic acne and greasy balding hair and probably smelled bad and I also felt so lowly about myself that I didn’t feel ‘worthy’ of meeting him. I was so intimidated by the way he looked that I could not make eye contact. I did force myself to finally talk to him and he is the most lovely person I have every met. He is kind, he is gentle, he is artistic/creative, he is down to earth. He radiates this positive warm energy and I am completely enamored and drawn. I was so severely awkward though that I absolutely stupidly ignored/avoided him and so now two years later we have zero sort of relationship beyond recognizing each other on campus and saying ‘hi’.

I do notice him looking at me a lot. At first I thought it was because of the way I looked (low self esteem). Then I thought (most likely) it’s because of my bizarre behavior and being socially awkward toward him without it ever being warranted. Then I thought maybe he knew I had a crush on him (also probable but my behavior was like that to everyone because I was so rusty on my social skills from the last few years and am out of practice making friends) and it made him feel awkward. Then sometimes I excite myself and think maybe he is attracted to me too and that’s why he’s constantly looking at me but I feel foolish for thinking like that because I don’t want to hurt myself. I’m sure a lot of the reason why I am so enamored by him is he encompasses the sort of person I want to be and I admire/look up to him.

But, now that I am in a way better place physically and mentally I literally cannot stop thinking about him. It hurts so much. I know I myself am the one creating unlikely scenarios in my head that will just let myself down in the end but I am like creepily obsessed with him. He consumes all of my thoughts because during isolation there is nothing else for me to do but sit here and ruminate in my own head. I know this is just a schoolgirl fantasy/crush and I plan on being friendly/not awkward (I’ve never been inappropriate or creepy I understand social cues and respect boundaries) this year and treating him well/possibly making a new acquaintance which would be nice but obviously I want more. I’m also terrified of befriending him (or anyone!). because I really have done zero in life/can’t do much now because of my health and I am just discovering who I am and what I like/any passions and I don’t want to seem boring and one dimensional. I did talk to him once before quarantine but I again feel like I sounded like an idiot and he didn’t seem interested in what I had to say (he was busy so of course), and I emailed him a link to something I know he would love and he never responded (which again he could be busy). 

So basically how do I get over my crush? It hurts, it’s unrealistic, and even if there ever was a chance I feel like my own mindset and behavior has ruined it these last two years. Any situation I could use to “support” him considering me attractive can also be universally interpreted any other way as well. I need advice on how to stop ruminating on him and the situation so that I can get through quarantine in a healthy productive way, and so I can be happy and healthy this fall when school starts and be the person I have been waiting to be! I don’t want to ‘hold myself back’ in my own head which is what’s happening. I know I am my own worst enemy. Any advice would be appreciated. 

So yeah: how do I get over an unrealistic crush/mourn something that does not exist and move on for myself?",16May2020,1

They’ve had some beef with each other for some time now, and I’ve tried not to get into it that much.

The three of them have finally really hit the breaking point, and my acquaintance has decided to distance himself from my friends. He also has a discord server which I’ve joined; and one of my friends has either joined + left, or has been banned twice.

56,"Yesterday, before I went to bed I was leaned towards my closet door. It was cold and I had my back against it for a good 3 min. After some time, I was already laying down in my bed, I felt this icy sensation in my upper middle part of my back, but it wasn't superficial. It felt as if my bones were covered in icy. Then it disappeared. It came and went back for some time until I fell asleep ( bare in mind my body wasn't cold, it was warm like normal ).

Today I woke up and I had back pain in the same place for the entire of the day. It wasn't always there, just when I was in some positions. I also did a 35min workout ( if it helps, it was the first day of chloe things 2 week shred program), but I've been working out almost every day, so I don't think it's because of muscle soreness.

I've been searching and I've come across that muscle soreness can be a symptom of corona and I'm extremely alarmed by this!

67,"I recently made the decision to form a plan to cut off a toxic friend. I haven’t cut her off yet, but I’m going to try. She’s the textbook definition of a toxic friend as she’s both manipulative and narcissistic. Everything was a competition to her, and she did anything to appear “better” or “smarter” than me, including belittling my opinions in front of others, badmouthing my appearance behind my back, and excluding me from conversations.

I’m not the only one she does this to, in fact, she does it to everyone, so it’s no surprise that everyone else dislikes her as well. I’ve genuinely have never met someone who truly liked her and didn’t see a problem with her attitude.

My problem is that she’s in my friend group. I travel to and from school with my friend group everyday, and spend lunch with them. All my other friends hate her. I honestly don’t know why we let her get so far into our friend group, but she’s here now so it doesn’t matter either way. Obviously, I want to distance myself from this toxic friend, but I don’t want to distance myself from the other friends in my friend group that I actually like. My other friends don’t want to stir up drama so they’re going to continue tolerating her. I can’t exactly distance myself from her if we’re going to be hanging out in the same friend group.

I’m scared that if I cut her off I’ll be all alone, and be the person who gets bullied for being a friendless “weirdo”.

What do I do? Should I try and tolerate her for the sake of my friend group at the expense of my self-esteem? Would it be crappy of me to try and convince my other friends to distance themselves too? Should I distance myself from my whole friend group completely and make new friends?",16May2020,1

I agreed and I told her that she didn't need to compensate me or anything for the art piece.

94,"My boss: depressed, socially underdeveloped. Thinks he's smarter than everyone else, gets angry/frustrated at the smallest things like me asking questions, getting something incorrect the first time, or a misunderstanding, is racist and sexist, can't hold down a job because he would rather play video games all day and refuses to communicate with his bosses(and refused to let me communicate for him, which is kinda my job). Resents that I'm smart, and any idea I come up with to make his life better, he automatically rejects and then claims he thought of it a while later. Ignores most of texts and emails. Completes absolutely nothing on time, if at all. Despite being on several meds for years and his shrink sees no reason to change it, he is unable to get out of his depressive rut and does nothing most of the day. 

Two years ago, he managed to find a woman just as dysfunctional as him. When they began dating, he heard the horror stories about the mother: she demeans the gf, she throws the gf's meat in the trash before she's done cooking it, she says any man she dates will cheat on her, better get as much jewelry out of my boss before he breaks up with her.

The gf slowly moves herself into the apt (my boss was too weak/desperate for a gf to ever have conversation about money and moving in, so she just slowly did it and lived there for free for a long time).

Things soon became clearer: it turns out she cooks meat every night until they are so burnt they are nothing but hard lumps of charcoal. All the neighbors in the apartment building have complained to management about the most awful smell wafting through. Suddenly her mom's actions seem understandable though probably not the wisest way to get her daughter to change.

She has been fired from every job she ever had. She has been kicked out of several places she lived in. 

She has an eating disorder where she starves herself throughout the day, and then gets up at night and binge eats anything with sugar. My boss ended up locking all our foods in his dog crate, depriving his dog of his bed.

Soon after she moved in, she started asking me if I'd seen something of hers. I thought at first she just misplaced something, but it started happening several times each day before she even bothered looking for it. She will literally walk into a room, want to find something, and ask me to find it. 

I thought this was a ""I'm jealous/insecure about you so I'm going to make you subservient"" to me sort of thing, but she apparently does this with my boss as well. I've had conversations with him about how this is outside the bounds of my role working for him, and that it's not really cool a 36 year old woman is too lazy/disorganized/forgetful is depending on others to find all her stuff for her.

Speaking to the boss and his therapist about this, we all agreed my stock response to this is ""I don't touch your stuff."" So I started saying this and she got an attitude about it each time and would continue to ask me all the same.

Once I complained about that, she started accusing me of stealing her stuff. Over one weekend, it went from a book to several books and then some of her clothes too. She ended up finding everything but one lib book. She apologized to me eventually, then went to my boss demanding I pay the library for her lost book.

She has always been a bitch to me, but every few months has turned nice all of a sudden, and soon after she asks me how much money my boss's parents have.  This has happened four times in the span of a year. I have told my boss and his mom about this each time it happens. The mother is furious and has grown to hate her. My boss doesn't seem to care.

Any minor request, like ""can you please not move my food to the sink's edge where it gets wet without asking me?"" or ""can you please not call me from your work asking me to do things for you? I work for your boyfriend only and I'm busy helping him"" is met with hostility and child-like petulance and snootiness.

I hear her talk on the phone with her mom often. They always seem to get along fine. They talk like any mother/daughter, and always end the conversations with ILU. As someone who came from a really violent household I have never been able to have this conversation with my mom. Other than the bitchy comments she makes, which sounds more like misguided and unwise advice to a daughter she sees is fucking up her life (I'm sure partly due to how she raised her), the only straight story I've been able to get out of what is so awful about the mother is she has rules about objects in the house, which sounds like mostly anxiety/OCD than abuse.  (Which she clearly passed onto her daughter too.)

Last Thanksgiving, she invited me to her mom's for dinner. I played coy like I'd try to make it because I know saying no would be a disaster. All the same, she had only begun to be nice to me a week prior so I knew something was up. So I texted her on the day and said sorry I'm caught at another gathering. The week after she saw me and was clearly pissed off I hadn't come: ""I was scared my mom would put me down. You said your other party was in the area and you could probably make it.""

Ah ha. So that's why she wanted me there. I brought this up with my boss, who was surprised she admitted to it.

That incident allowed her to have my phone number though and though I knew in the back of my head she invited me so she could have my number, I gave it to her. And that's when she started calling me from her work to do things for her. I asked her, as I said above, in the most polite, smiley, pleading way possible that I can't do things for her, and she lost her shit, and then started a huge fight over it with my boss, that this is all my fault and I should be fired. (Her request that last time? She wanted me to tell my boss not to have any appts Friday so he can accompany her to her cancer test appt: needless to say she doesn't have cancer and he never has appts on Fri mornings; his whole life is spent in bed or playing games.)

After about 6-8 months of living at my boss's apt, she stopped night-binging and instead doesn't eat until 5pm, weighs all her ingredients, and sticks to the same meat/veg/cheese meal each day. 

Around this time I started to notice things going missing. She threw out, without asking my boss first, the following in the span of a few months: all his cutlery except one spoon and fork, his cooking utensils, first aid kit, the bottom of the dog crate, all but 2-3 of his pens, his cutting boards.

He keeps asking me to make lists of stuff she should replace. I do. I don't know if he doesn't ask her or she just says no, but none of that stuff has been replaced except a pot she burnt.

She agreed to hire a cleaner as most of my duties are as an assistant.  She never did. So it was agreed she'd buy paper plates and cutlery to cut down on dishes. She stopped doing that and demanded I wash all her dishes because ""I'm his housekeeper"".

My boss said to me this week ""she won't replace anything out of a sense of responsibility."" You'd think he was complaining. He wasn't. He wanted me to come up with a way to convince her to pay for the stuff she threw out.

She started to micromanage my boss's diet.  She started to demand I shop for her. My boss thinks his no longer needing to lock food in cages is a sign she's changing and improving. I tell him it's a sign her disorders are morphing. I tell him she has to have borderline personality disorder. All the signs are there.

She has been trying to have me fired for the past year. He won't do it. 

Finally, after COVID-19 hit us, she started to be there all day. Not because her job was furloughed: people at her job hate her, and she did something to piss them off. I am not certain but I think she threatened to make one of the homeless women she works with lose her temp housing. So she asked HR if she could work from home; they said no only execs can do that; you're essential. So she stopped going to work because she couldn't work from home as an excuse to avoid being disciplined. She's probably about to be fired.

With her there all day, things became so fraught and crazy, my boss sent her away to her mom's for a month. We were expecting to not see her for a month but she decided to turn up each Friday. Of course she started drama the second she walked in. Of course there was no clear indication of when she'd leave Monday and started drama before leaving. So I told my boss to ask her to not come until 7 on Fri and to text me when she's gone Monday. That of course failed because she demanded to come at 6 on Fridays, and he let her. She stays as late as possible on Mondays and he never texts me because he's gone back to sleep.

Monday last week when I came in she left her coffeemaker on. I turned it off. This Monday I hear I'm being accused of deliberately burning her coffeepot and I must replace it. Like hell I will.

The one month punishment was supposed to end today, but she turned up Weds unannounced and he let her come back. It's unclear whether she told him and he didn't tell me, or she didn't tell him either.

He had apparently told her if she doesn't change he can't stay with her and can't marry her (they have plans to marry and sweet Jesus have children). She didn't change at all. And yet she's back.

96,"I was engaging in my night time rituals when I dropped my water cup. It bounced off of the sink before falling and shattering. Shockingly, my wall mounted sink now has a large chip/hole in it, with a large crack extending away from it. 
I am a renter. I’ve been here for 1.5 years and only called for a lightbulb change assist (too high). I normally fix small things on my own. Have never had an issue like this before. How do I approach with my landlord? He’s a very nice guy. Am I liable to fix? It’s an OLD sink (30-40 years old). A quick google search shows a comparable sink for $65. Nothing fancy...

99,"I was pulling into my house’s driveway and accidentally pulled in front of a car who had the right of way (my house is at the end of a T intersection). He honked at me and stopped his car in front of my house. He wouldn’t leave, and when I got out of my car to get into the house, he started talking to me, telling me I shouldn’t have done that, to be careful, drive slower, etc. This was fine and I immediately began apologizing, but then he ended with “I know where you live,” and drove away. I promptly went into my house and had a panic attack. Today (the next day), I was in my front yard, walking to my car, when he drove by my house again, going 40 mph, and slamming his car horn. He scared the crap out of me and now I’m scared to leave my house. I’m young and a girl, I feel really threatened. If I get his license plate, can I sue him or get a restraining order?

100,"A couple years ago I was in a pretty bad spot in life, I hated going to school and was constantly fighting with my dad. My parents split up earlier this year and living without my dad was a lot easier. Also earlier in the year I got pretty close with a girl, we never went out but we loved eachother and would pretty much say so everyday, we also almost always had a text conversation going. With all of that I ended up feeling better, I genuinely enjoyed being alive and thought that I'd done it, I'd found something worth living for. Recently she texted me saying her mam had hit her and after we talked for a while I ended up telling my mother after asking the girl if that was ok. My mother called the child protective services and reported the situation to them, all without speaking to me or the girl about it. The girl when she found out blamed me for ruining her family and basically told me to never talk to her again. She later got annoyed at me for not asking her how she was feeling after she had already told me to stay away, which is what I did. I'm a pretty sensitive person in general and I have an especially hard time when it comes to fighting with or losing people, when everything first happened I had a complete meltdown and panic attack at the same time and consistently had problems with anxiety afterwards. It's been about a month since then and I've never felt worse, I've been suicidal in the past and that was still better than what I feel now. When I think that I've hurt her I can't help but hate myself. When I remember that I'm alone I just go numb. I can't think of anything that could make me feel better and I know I'll probably never feel the same as I did back then. I just don't know what to do anymore.",16May2020,1
102,"I just feel like I can't control my life anymore. I have no self-confidence because I feel like I need some form of talent to earn self-confidence.

I'm not good at anything. I tried coding but it was too hard for me to comprehend. I'm trying languages, but even that is starting to show that I'm not as good as English as I thought I was despite going to American school MY ENTIRE LIFE.

I'm pathetic. I'm spoiled. I can't do anything for myself. I can't lead my life. I can't become a game director/developer that I wish I could be. I can't be an artist because I lack all the talent and self-training an artist goes through. I can't be a writer because I have no confidence in my writings at all despite writing being one of my main passions at one point. 

All I want is to bring my imagination to life. I want to entertain people with my creative works. But I am nothing. 

This is even affecting my ability to enjoy games and other media that I used to enjoy. It prevents me from looking into other media, because I can't help feeling envious of the creators talent and tell myself that I will never make something as great as their creations. I know it took them years to be talented enough to create these products but considering that I'm 20 and I don't have a glimpse of the amount of talent that they have means that I simply wasted my life. And considering that the world might change for the worse or even end soon due to all current events, I may never have the time to make my imagination come to life.

I went to an art class with a teacher that was growing proud of my early beginnings. But ever since the quarantine began I haven't drawn in a long while and I feel like I have lost all the art skills I barely had. I was a beginner.


I also think about how people much younger than me have found their talents and skills early and made names for themselves in the fields of my dreams. The more I think about them, the more I want to legitimately kill myself.

I don't know what to do. Once I'm done with college I feel like I'll find myself in an uneventful job that won't get me the amount of money my father earns. Meaning I won't be able to enjoy my life as much as I do under his care.

103,"I am a psychology undergrad in AU and I saw on Kickstarter a very interesting/useful card game made based on DBT (therapy used commonly for borderline personality disorder and/or emotion regulation) and another on 'chain analysis to change behaviour'. I want to work in clinical psychology and I find this fascinating! It could be used with children with difficulties (like, stressed out easily, or destructive behaviours) since its a game, and also used on adults as well. It is a fun take on the intervention. But I'm still years to go until I get my provisional license, and I don't know if its worth it to spend $75 USD (approx $120 AUD as of today) right now. Of course, its on Kickstarter, and there are risks, but the creators have given a free copy of the digital version for everyone - and it looks promising. Should I risk my current finances (not detrimentally but right now it is a bit much for me) and invest in it? My 'buying brain' has been thinking about this for a while (3 weeks since seeing it on Kickstarter) and I'm trying to find any reason to buy and not buy, to weigh the pros and cons.

105,"It was a few days ago and it started with a phone call. I usually never answer unknown callers but I was half asleep trying to take a nap. When I answered the phone, all I could hear was a males voice say hello but there was like a connection issue so I hung up and closed my eyes. Then he texted me with a ‘hi’, ‘how are you?’ And I responded with ‘hello who is this?’. 

I’ve had my number for over a year but I still get occasional texts and calls for the lady who used to have this number where I politely inform them that her number has changed and they say thank you and stop.

At this point I was distracted by some emails I saw and gave up on my nap. That’s when I see that he’s texted me a picture. When I saw that I honestly thought he sent me a dick picture and I was annoyed. But when I looked closer and the tiny banner I saw a black banner with tiny red things like maybe beef patties on a black grill. 

I thought maybe he was sending a picture of food that my numbers previous owner might let her know exactly who it is. I know it’s a weird train of thought but it didn’t look like a penis or anything so I clicked on the text.

Warning: Graphic :/

At first even though I blew up the picture, it took my brain a minute to realize what I was seeing. I thought maybe it was doll heads. But the picture was actually of a giant black canvas bag laid out on a bed stuffed with dismembered heads, arms, and legs. When what I was seeing was starting to sink in, he sent another picture that popped up into my line of sight . This one was a bigger photo with a close up of a dead mans face. His skin was burned and cut up I think. I just remember seeing red. 

That’s when I closed messenger and jumped up to leave my bedroom. I could feel my phone vibrate with new texts as I walked to the garage. I was trying to tell my dad what was happening on my phone but he seemed annoyed and told me it was a hoax when he finally let me explain. My mom told me that she was sorry but it was probably my fault for being on the phone all the time 😐 lol. 

He sent me five more pictures and tried to call me again a few minutes later but I ignored them all and blocked his number. I haven’t looked at any of the other pictures. I’m a grown adult but I don’t watch scary movies and I especially don’t like seeing violence.

My friends convinced me that I should file a police report since this could be a real threat or maybe this scam where people try to have you pay them money by saying they’re in the cartel or some gang. Supposedly they send you pictures of your family and of your house along with these types of pictures to try to scare you. I didn’t look at the other pictures though so I wouldn’t know.

Geez this post is getting long - sorry if you’re still reading. So I called the non-emergency police line and asked to file a report over the phone. They asked me instead to go to my nearest police station the next day when they opened and gave me the phone number to call. So the next morning I called the police station and asked if it was really necessary for me to come in because I didn’t want to waste anyone’s time but they said to come in and file a report in person.

When I get there however I explain the situation to them and they tell me I don’t need a police report. They first asked me if I recently broke up with anyone or if the caller made any demands. I explain that the phone connected was robot-voices, that I didn’t look at the rest of the pictures, and that they called back but I didn’t answer and blocked the number. So they told me to just block the number (again) and delete the pictures. 

Honestly I’m just paranoid and kinda shocked by what I saw. I’m really hoping this is just random person and that will be the end of it but my friends are telling me that maybe I should go to a different police station. Idk, I just wish they could look into the phone number or something. Sorry for the long post. I’m just trying to forget about it but I keep thinking about what I saw and I just feel uneasy all the time. Thank you for reading.",16May2020,1

107,"I’m really conflicted (first post, sorry if i posted in the wrong place).. I adopted a cat from the shelter a couple of months ago and she’s so sweet. She is loving and hasn’t bitten or hissed at anyone. I recently moved back home due to the coronavirus and my parents aren’t too fond of her. She’s been an indoor cat her whole life and I’ve recently been training her to go potty outside because my mom doesn’t want a litter box in the house. She is also learning how to tolerate our dog since she hasn’t been around dogs before. She’s been doing good with both of those things but the main problem is that she meows A LOT. I adore her and I try to quiet her down for my family but I’ve gotten no where with that. She meows for attention and when she wants food. I’ve tried ignoring her and telling her to stop. It annoys my parents who were okay with me adopting her, but every time they talk about her they just talk about how much they hate her and how bad she is. They threaten me with “if she does this or that then we’re getting rid of her.” I’m really tired of hearing it and I really don’t know what to do. I’ve been waiting a long time to adopt another cat and I really do love her, but it also makes me feel like I’m upsetting my parents by keeping her. They aren’t the most patient and I don’t know what to do. I’m going to be torn either way this situation goes.

Her demeanor very dismissive and she said “not any time soon”. Two employees standing behind her immediately erupted into laughter like she just dissed me or maybe my question was so ridiculous that it was laughable, idk. And then she said “and I’m glad too”.

I didn’t know how to respond to them, so I didn’t. Just acted like everything was normal and left. It seems to me that people like that take pleasure in seeing when they get to someone. I felt a little humiliated and was left wondering what the hell did I do to deserve that reaction.",16May2020,1
111,"Biological father (Jeff) was never physically abusive or broke the law.  My parents split when I was 2 and Jeff was just a generic deadbeat dad who flaked on me all the time and never cared much about being a dad, and we've barely had a relationship since I turned 18.  He has done some *very* shitty and intentionally hurtful things without remorse but again, nothing physical or against the law.  A year ago I (24F) told him I didn't want any contact with him anymore outside of family emergencies and he respected that -- didn't hear from him since.

A few months ago, I got my dream job.  I totally forgot that Jeff used to do some work for this organization a while ago (mostly at a different branch) and I found out from a coworker that he still stops by the office sometimes to say hi to a couple people.  Our office is really small and everyone knows Jeff is my biological father but I only told 2 coworkers (Leah and Talia) that I'm no-contact with him because it's just awkward and not a conversation I want to have if I can avoid it.

A couple weeks after I got the job, I got an IM from Talia warning me that Jeff had just walked in (her office is near the front door).  I share an office with one of the people Jeff usually comes in to see, so I ran to Leah, told her what was happening, and she told me to hide in her office with her.  She and Jeff do *not* like each other, so he never bothers her when he comes by and it was a pretty safe place to hide.  Plus, there are only two people Jeff comes by to see and neither of them were in that day, so I thought it would be quick.

I found out later that Jeff stuck his head in every single office looking for ""something"" (he's been in the office many times before and it's very small -- he knows where everything is), and when he realized Leah's office was the only one left, he told the receptionist he needed to talk to Leah so she brought him back to her office.  Sure enough just a few minutes after we close the door, there's a knock and we find Jeff standing with the receptionist.  He said he ""just wanted to see if the rumours were true that you're working here"", making it very clear that he was here to see me, and he threw in a few passive aggressive digs at Leah which was embarrassing for me because Leah's like my mentor at work.  It was very uncomfortable and he ended the conversation with a snarky remark about how he'd let us go back to our closed-door meeting now.  Leah confirmed after he left that in the 20 years she's worked here, he has never ever come into her office before, so she was as shocked as I was.

That really rattled me and ever since then I've been terrified every single time I hear a man's voice from reception.  I work in a satellite office so our branch has no managers or anyone else I could ask for help.  Plus, this is still a relatively new job that I love and I don't want to create waves.  I don't want to go to Jeff directly because any interaction with him fills me with crippling anxiety and I don't want to talk to him in case it invites any more interactions from him (also it happened a few months ago so I have no justification as to why i'm only bringing it up now).  Right now our office is closed until further notice but as soon as we reopen I feel like I'm back to feeling afraid every time I hear a man's voice at work.

TL;DR: Told my father I wanted to go no-contact a year ago, he respected it up until he randomly decided to show up at my new job and looked for me specifically, so now how do I stop feeling so afraid of him coming back and doing it again without causing problems or gossip at work?",16May2020,1

that's how I feel with my family, they might want the best but they dont love me anymore. i am human and ive made plenty mistakes that i wish i can take back but sadly cannot. yes, people heal from certain things with time but my family criticizes me and mocks me a lot. 

example, my mom goes through my browsing history and saw what I was looking up and instead talking to me one on one, she ended up talking to my father and telling the family about my business. then tries to act like she didnt anything..
meanwhile, im getting shady remarks and comments from people that i wouldn't even think that would know about my private life, knows because of my mom cant help but to gossip.

another example is me getting into a fight with her god parents grandson (cousin). it was both our fault and instead of me uplifting me, she made it seem like it was my fault and basically called me a trouble maker. and my family mocks me about the situation anytime they get a chance to. the fact that she picked people over blood, still confuses me till this day. 

my mom over steps boundaries and that's why my little siblings feel it's okay to talk about me and to me anyway and why my father doesnt think im man enough. I dont really have a relationship with my father because he didnt know his father that well growing up so it's his excuse.

Since I know that, I just don’t like it, I would prefer to never know. Reasons why I hate it is because 
1. I am placed at a higher standard than my siblings. I have more pressure to not fail my parents
2. I feel like my siblings hate me
3. I feel like I am placed at a higher pedestal and I don’t know, this sounds really douchy but I have become more favoured. My parents treat me to stuff more often than my siblings which just makes me feel theres an imbalance. I’m grateful but it feels off
Like, just this month, my parents got me a new keyboard to play for quarantine and also these books I have been eyeing to read and they also gave me £40 because I have apparently been helping a lot in the house. I am grateful for all of this, I truly am but I feel guilty taking it. It feels like my parents are wasting money on me and there feels like theres some inequality between me and my siblings. 

Another example is my parents say they are gonna get me a new phone. Now don’t get me wrong, I would love a brand new phone, I have had this iPhone 6 for 5 years now, its busted up but even though its old and buggy, it still functions. I still have all the apps I need and I can call people. Thats all I need right? It just feels wrong for my parents to buy a new one for me for my 18th. 

Are my feelings justified?",16May2020,1

132,"So I've been feeling bad about every social media but Instagram, it's like everything that happen there is making it worse. And yeah, I admit I have very low self esteem and watching everyone on Instagram having a nice life, having a lot of friends and hanging out with them are some of the reasons that make me cry at night sometimes because I don't have any of that. At least I don't have so many friends to hang out with, I don't even feel appreciated from my  friends. Also the fact that people unfollow me affects me, but I get it, I can be annoying sometimes posting so many music memes and songs on my stories (also I haven't post any pic of me since 2017 because low self esteem :/ ).
The reason why I can't take a break from Instagran is that I feel like I'm missing something special, something really big, ya feel me? If only I could go to therapy right now...
Any advice to help me take a break from social media without feeling anxious?",16May2020,1

134,"I'm M15

My dad for some reason is very touchy with me and all my brother's (who are all over 20, however nowhere near as bad) and it makes me so uncomfortable. Anytime I see him he's trying to hug me, tickle me, scruff my hair, or something around that. It may not seem bad just saying that but I really don't like it. I ask him to stop every single time and if I do he gets very defensive about it and says im being moody and if anyone in my family tries to talk to me they're told to leave me alone because I'm moody.

It really annoys me. This happens literally every single time I see him during the day. Like I mentioned, if I tell him to stop doing that he gets really defensive / offended by it. The reason I'm writing this post is because earlier today at around 8pm he called me downstairs as my family got a takeaway. I was taking a nap at this time so of course I wake up really tired and just not wanting to really do anything. I go downstairs and the first thing I notice is all my brother's girlfriends are over. Great. Next thing I know he starts patting me like I'm some sort of dog ? I had no idea what he was doing but it made me so uncomfortable that I pushed his hand off my head and said ""I've told you to stop doing that"" and he immediately starting raising his voice at me (not shouting, but loud enough that everyone else went quiet and looked at me) He said ""If you're going to be such a miserable child then go upstairs. I don't want you down here if you're going to keep acting like that. Go."" And like I said, this is even more embarrassing as the WHOLE family + my brother's girlfriends were in this room. I didn't say anything, turned around and just walked up to my room. He didn't even let me grab my takeaway 

When I walked to my room, I heard my brother's asking what the hell I did and he just told them ""he's being a miserable child like always."" And I just laid in bed so annoyed. 30 minutes later my brother came up with my food and told me to just ignore him, he is being an idiot. This was seriously the final straw. I want him to stop touching me all the time starting immediately but as ive said, everytime I try I am basically punished.
Does anyone have any advice? My mother is nothing like this and it's quite obvious I'm a lot closer to her, but if I try to ask her to tell him to stop she will say I'm overreacting and it's not that bad.

Thanks in advance",16May2020,1

Around 2 yrs ago I think she realized she wasn’t treating him right and tried to correct her behavior. She stopped being as blatant with the physical abuse, but I think deep down she hates him for some reason and just can’t admit it to herself. that hatred isn’t something you just shake off.

He has an older brother and a little sister neither of them are treated like that, she’s not a bad person but something happened maybe with his dad and she subconsciously hates him I truly believe that. 

It’s so clear that what she’s doing is wrong but she can’t see it, and for a really long time the rest of the family didn’t want to see it either. the younger generation (me, my sister, and my older cousin) realized that we had to do something real quick, and we’ve been fighting to get some type of change. We’ve finally made some headway with the older more stubborn members of the family, and we’ve organized an intervention type thing; but I have a really bad feeling, that it’s going to work for about a week, then everything’s going to go back to normal,  or maybe even get worse.

He wants to stay with me, but I’m only 19 but He trusts my mom and I can convince her to adopt him if worse comes to worse. If it gets to that point, my aunt will definitely put up a fight.

I want to reach out to see if he would take me back as a friend but I don’t know what to do. I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t want to be my friend again and a few of his tweets have implied this to me.

143,"Ok I know many people reading this post will think that it's silly to even hesitate on this decision, but to be honest I'm really leaning towards just going to high school.

 There are a few factors in this. Now the whole college thing is that I've just completed middle school, and I can do one year in this program they call transition school where they prep me and like 16 other kids for college, and then after that year I just head straight into my local college into normal classes. On the other hand, I can go to my brother's high school, which is a very good high school. 

I'm a big fan of math, and I figured if that's what I want to do then I should go the college because then I can get right into more advanced things, but after sitting in on some of the math classes for the transition school, I felt it was pretty low level (not trying to brag or whatever but the syllabus starts out with linear equations and such) and that my brother's school- the high school- would have a better math program. 

Then there is the whole thing about the ""high school experience"" which I really don't know how to feel about. For some, it was a horrible 4 years, but then again if I don't go to high school I never will know what it'll be like. 

I suppose I do like academics and learning and all that, but I don't know if I'm ready to fully commit to something like this transition school thing. I've learned a lot of math at home and will definitely continue that, and honestly it feels like I'm much better off learning by myself than relying on schools. But then again, this kind of opportunity doesn't just pop up every couple years. 

Anyways that was pretty unorganized but it's really how I feel about the whole topic and how I'm feeling for certain things. Would like some advice different things to consider.",16May2020,1

Might be a long one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Don't know where to begin so I'll just start. 

   My Mother got addicted to Opioids when I was born, and has struggled with them to this very day. I was close to her as a child, but quickly drifted far, far from her. I have memories as a kid of her dosing off while driving and hitting all kinds of things including our house. She's shown up to birthday parties and school trips visibly out of it, and the list goes on. Describing exactly how she is when on her drugs is probably one of the most difficult things for me, I could spend all day trying to capture the nuances of how she moves, how the muscles in her face droop, the difference in her voice. She acts like she was replaced by an alien and it's painful for her to try and be human. 

   My mother use to be a nurse, after my birth she injured her back which is why she continued to received pain medication. She will always, 100% deny that she is visibly medicated, even if she's caught doing something illogical, like stacking pans or putting in a full plastic bag of corn into the oven. She's had a tough childhood, her parents were alcoholics and abusive, and her only brother was also abusive. He's shot her with bbs, stabbed her, and if I'm to believe what I'm told, aimed at gun at my mother while I was in her arms as a baby. Life's complicated, I knew him as a child growing up, he was kind but rough from what I could tell, most of those violent complications left in the past. Her father shot himself when I was young, and later cancer would take her mother. Her brother then disappearing later to be found dead of a heart attack though we all suspected foul play. Her only other living relative, a cousin, suffered a brain injury in a car accident when I was young and she has to stay in a special home. 

   My brother, a half brother, older by 6 or 7 years, has always been a problem child. From childhood to his teens he caused and got into all sorts of trouble. His biological father beat my mother, so he has his own issues coupled alongside her pill addiction. I was a very docile and scared kid, I endured a lot abuse because of this growing up as I was free real estate to fuck with, my brother among others took advantage of this. He'd like scaring me, intimidating me, threatening and cursing at me, he'd take everything out on me and then some change just for fun. Since he was a teenager he's been kicked out of our home and pretty much homeless. He's one of those rare individuals where most after encountering will says they've never dealt with someone like him before. He'd never stay anywhere for long, he has a tendency to say his thoughts out loud, and is almost always talking shit, making snide remarks and snickering to himself, if he's hearing someone else's conversation he'll basically narrate it. He's been kicked out of every place he's stayed at, and has gotten into an incredible amount of fights, a lot of which were from his own friends. When he got older he started drinking more and became more overall violent. He's always had anger issues but alcohol turned that into rage issues. Since he'd live with us off and on, he'd come home drunk and ensue chaos, often times this meant coming into my room quietly and antagonizing me to fight him and very seriously threatening my life (death threats in general are a big favorite of his), he's come home drunk and kicked open our door, smashed our T.V, etc etc, just overly chaotic behavior. If you couldn't tell he's pretty crazy, he had a psychotic breakdown and began shouting ""I LOVE JESUS"" all over the streets, he ran into a church and just kept screaming it, the priest called the cops and he was escorted out. He still stands by it, said he had some big revelation. He's told me he thinks our mom has a succubus demon in her, that he uses his third eye and speaks to animals and can tell the future and all this shit. 

   The great cycle is usually my mom with consistently get fucked up all year round, some years better than others. Then from time to time, my brother will pop up and live with us due to being kicked out or having his vehicle taken from him because he doesn't have a license, until he is then kicked out of our home. Then he will come back and my mom let him despite the latest things he's done and said to us. 

   I have been living with these two for my entire life, I am 22, after High School I could not afford my own place but worked in the city for an agency, which in the beginning of 2019 I was removed from, and have been home since. I'll be very honest, I'm a sorry piece of shit. I started smoking weed at 17, and have been intensely since. I spend my waking moments high, and have lost all my ambition and motivation. In its place, I've found immense hatred for my family. I've grown so cold, so insanely bitter. I snap at my mother constantly and say horrible things. I am disgusted by her, I don't let her touch me and instinctively swat at her hands if she tries getting close, I try so hard not to be so mean, I know it can't do any good, I know its not 'right', but oh my god, when I hear her voice, when I'm around her, the anger just consumes me and I can't control it. She isn't perfectly fine when she's sober either, she's vindictive, manipulative, and blames nothing on herself. She's a pointer, a victim and an absolute slave to her wants. I hate my brother too, I hate being around him and the sound of his voice, he's instilled fear in me since young, but I think about hurting him badly daily, him and my mother. Obviously, this isn't good. I don't know if I would ever. But like I said I'll be honest, I daydream it, every day, very often, and it's so hard to not. I feel like I'm at a snapping point, like I'm going insane. I have strokes of anger and my brain has this fog around it, and all I do is lay down in bed and get high, to which I'm just numb and useless. Sometimes I want to escape and just drive off, sometimes I want to kill myself, dramatically, tragically, fashionably. Sometimes I want to be the person I wish I could be, to be the brave hero, to stand up to my brother and fight him and win and have him stay out for good, to fix everything to make things better make them quiet. But I feel so weak, I feel so small, I'm scared.

147,"I would really appreciate some advice. This may be a bit of a long post... but thank you for anyone who takes the time to read it. 

A bit of background info: My immediate family has had a very strong relationship previous to the death of my step dad. My parents lived in their home and had a guest home that they rented to my husband and myself. We were living there to assist my parents with property maintenance as would begin to age. The entire family plan was for my husband and I to inherit the house when they both passed- and offer the guest home to our future children as they aged. My husband and I have been living there for 10 years.

My step dad passed away 2 months ago. He was very young (52). He passed very suddenly, no health issues. It has been very traumatic on my mom, myself, and my husband. We were all there when he passed- performed cpr on him for over 30 minutes as we live rural and the ambulance took forever. I have never experienced something so traumatic as this. 

After my step dad passed away- my mom began to ask my husband and i to do tasks. We did literally as much as we could. We did all of this without her: visiting funeral home, making arrangements, visiting step dad, picking up ashes to bring home, contacting pension center, mortgage lender, debt, taking care of her dogs, making meals, shopping, yard work. My mom wasn't capable of doing anything with the amount of grief- I understood and I just wanted to help ease as much stress as I could. We began to burn ourselves out, trying to grieve, and spending 15 hours a day trying to get something accomplished for my mom. We barely got any sleep for the first month as we were sleeping in bed with my mom at night. It sounds weird but she didn't want to be alone at night and we could sympathize. 

About 3 weeks after my step dad passed away, my mom started to act very hostile. She began to lash out at us for everything and began to target my husband specifically. She would begin saying that he is a dope head, loser and wouldn't be anywhere without me. There were many days that she would scream at the top of her lungs where we couldn't even understand what she was saying. She chased me through the driveway threatening to hurt me. She blocked the driveway with her truck so I couldn't leave with my car. She has asked me repeatedly if I could divorce my husband and move into the house with her. She asked me to remove some of my personal items from my step dads spare property because she would like to put it up for sale. I went the next day, removed my items from the property and my mom phoned my police on me for theft. When the police officer questioned me, I showed him my text messages between my mom and I discussing removing my items. The police officer let me go- as they were aware my mom is going through some issues. They recently had to do a wellness check on her for suicidal threats. 

As a result, my husband and I packed up our clothing and moved to a friends house. We are currently looking for a place to rent or buy. We have left all of our household belongings there and hope we will be able to retrieve them when we find a place. My husband went to pick up his vehicle 2 days ago and there was a huge dent and missing paint in the back. I dont know how she damaged it but it was definitely her. 

Every day my mom will phone me crying asking for me to come home, saying that she can't live without me. But at the same time- she will also call me a couple hours later that she doesn't want anything to do with us. I want to go back home because the whole plan was for us to help as my parents aged. I feel like I am failing my family for staying at my friends right now and looking for other accommodations. She is constantly guilt tripping me saying that I am choosing my husband over her. In a way, maybe I am choosing him over her? But I can't handle the way she disrespects us. My husband will not entertain the idea of ever going back to help her- and I don't blame him but she is still my mom.

My mom has never been like this... I know that the grief is taking over my mom. She has been seeing a psychotherapist and other social workers to help her deal with her feelings. They are helping a little but the angry outbursts are still happening. I never know if she will be in an ok mood or if she will be hostile and threatening.

I am angry because she hasn't even considered my feelings in anything. I am living at my friends house which I'm grateful for the opportunity... but it is so uncomfortable not having any home comforts. She hasn't asked me if I am ok after loosing my step dad, she knew we were very close. Everything has been only about her and in return I get treated like garbage. I am so sad.

How do you guys think I should deal with my mom? Should I continue to try and help her when she is being so ignorant? Is it wrong for me to be looking for somewhere else to live? Should I be more tolerant of her? Any insight would really be appreciated",16May2020,1

and due to schooling i’ve discovered sociology and just, that perspective of thought and then my just subjective observation of the world. i’ll talk my friends or family’s ears off with just things i’ll notice or find interesting but i know they’re not interested like that and i know i’m not like, talking to the right audience if that makes sense lol . i’m not trying to put pressure on them to be interested and it’s not like a specific subject or topic, show movie, person or thing so it not like i can go to a fandom or anything of the sort and i’m not trying to enter like scholastic level debates with cited claims and bibliographical references. i just, want to have interesting conversation i suppose abt my (unusual) interest in sociological observation . i’m not very exposed to things, that is to say i’m in my house a lot with myself and my interests 🥴 so maybe it’s just me not being exposed to or made aware of an outlet existing for this sort of thing, i figured i’d ask reddit lmao 🥴 

it’s hard to explain bc it’s always random and abstract but alway in line with over analyzing a thing occurring in “society” (i live in america)

i’m just making all these intangible observations for no reason and it’ll just be interesting to me. is there somewhere i can go with all this energy to be used “better” or am i just doomed to suppress it and wind up writing a blog page or something 🥴",16May2020,1

He has an older brother and a little sister neither of them are treated like that, she’s not a bad person but something happened maybe with his dad and she subconsciously hates him I truly believe that. 

It’s so clear that what she’s doing is wrong but she can’t see it, and for a really long time the rest of the family didn’t want to see it either. the younger generation (me, my sister, and my older cousin) realized that we had to do something real quick, and we’ve been fighting to get some type of change. We’ve finally made some headway with the older more stubborn members of the family, and we’ve organized an intervention type thing; but I have a really bad feeling, that it’s going to work for about a week, then everything’s going to go back to normal,  or maybe even get worse.

He wants to stay with me, but I’m only 19 but He trusts my mom and I can convince her to adopt him if worse comes to worse. If it gets to that point, my aunt will definitely put up a fight. I love him like a little brother and I just want him to be ok. Right now he’s not ok, I see it, and I’m so scared of the long term ramifications. that house isn’t a good environment for him somethings gotta give, what are my options.

151,"I’m stressed. My grandpa died on Wednesday. He had pneumonia that went septic that then caused a heart attack. He died within 24 hours. We made the decision to take him off life support because he was essentially brain dead. 

My grandma is regularly expressing she wishes to go and join him. It’s extremely sad. Like I’m hovering and being as supportive as i can. But I’m only 20, this is the most time I’ve spent with her ever. I can only do so much. 

My mom is just being so dismissive and not doing enough to reassure her. And it’s really frustrating me. Like i know this broke her heart. She wailed when the doctor called. But he just constantly drinking and not addressing anything is just too much. My mom gets so overwhelmed and doesn’t know what to do when my grandma expresses her fear. But it’s too bad. I am way out of my comfort zone, kinda tough shit in this situation 


We hope to have her move in with us. But that means she’ll be moving from East to west coast. I am planning to pay for most if not all of it. She wants to pay her own way but too bad.

153,"So back in hs me and this girl flirted the we went on a date and just kept flirting we were grades apart and kinda just shifted apart.  Jump to my senior year and once I graduated she came and said hello saying she cheered for me so we talk mainly about college and we talked for about 7 months.  I told her I cared for her and she told me she liked someone else.  I know that this was probably my fault for not telling her sooner but I figured she kinda liked bc we never full on went on another date.  Kinda confusing.  But after that incident comes to present time.  I have never really found a girl I liked in college bc in my mind I kept comparing them to the girl from hs and I couldn’t forget about her.  So, with this quarantine I got bored and struck up a conversation with her expecting to be blocked or just ignored, but to my surprise she responded and we have been talking for a little bit.  Now that she is back in my life I think I’m starting to develop feelings for her whenever I think of her I get happy, but also nervous bc things ended bad last time.  We talk and have spurts of back and forth then radio silence.  She waits a day to respond.  I figured she is busy at work (grocery story employee stocking shelves during this pandemic).  So from the texting I can pretty much tell she is not that into me.  I don’t get one word answers and she keeps the conversation going and is interested but the response times have me worried.  I want to wait til end of June which gives me a good month and a half to see if she is into or if should cut bait and just delete her number forever.  My problem here is no matter how hard I try I cannot forget her and this has kept me from pursuing other girls.  I want to tell her how I feel but I do not want to scare her off.

161,"I’m 20 now but I had a boyfriend from 2 years ago that I dated for about a year. It ended because he had been cheating on me with multiple girls for about half the relationship. It sucked pretty bad at the time but I am over it and in a new happy relationship. However, my roommate (we all went to high school together) told me that my ex had hit her up on Facebook saying that his current girlfriend was out of town and wanted to hook up with my roommate....
I don’t really know his girlfriend but I know a little about her and we are friends on Facebook since she went to the same high school. She seems like a great person and I feel really bad because I know what that is like. I also know that he is probably using a lot gas lighting and lying to keep it from her because that was what happened with me. (He shaved his own head bald once and faked getting hacked to get me to stay with him). He is a pretty toxic person honestly and I hoped he had changed but now I’m not so sure. 

I think it’s just that I can relate to what his current girlfriend is probably dealing with. I thought of texting her but that kind of news sucks when it comes from a stranger (especially your boyfriends ex) and I don’t think she’d believe me anyway. I wouldn’t believe me if I was her so I get it. I thought of texting him and reminding him of all the crap it put me through but he is manipulative and I don’t think he really cares about how he hurts people. Should I try and intervene?

165,"So my roommate and his girlfriend--let's call them Danny and Helen--started dating about eight months ago. Danny has had near-relationships a couple of times, but this is his first real relationship and Helen has had a couple of long-term boyfriends before. Now Danny and I are really close (as is our other roommate), so I know him pretty well. He is a really independent, growth-minded dude, but he is kind of a pushover when it comes to girls that he's seeing. Helen is a bit different. She doesn't really have many friends and she doesn't spend any time with the few she does have. Instead, she wants to spend every waking moment with Danny and/or her family, who live next door to her. She wants to live in her house forever and get married ASAP (which Danny has often stated he does not want to do anytime soon). These factors combine to create some issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Helen basically wants him around her 24/7. Actually, it isn't ""basically."" She cries and has tantrums if he ever says he wants to spend a day with the guys or by himself. For a long time at the start of their relationship, he would have her over all the time, which is totally cool, but they would shut themselves up in his room and she'd get mad if he was out of the room for more than three minutes. Over the past few months they've shifted to staying at Helen's house, which is owned by her dad and she has to herself. Predictably, she freaks out if he says he wants to go spend a day with his brother or with me. Hell, Danny is a guy who will go walk around the city by himself just because he wants to, and he's not even able to do that anymore. Further, any time they have a fight about this (or anything else) they can usually come to some kind of vague understanding of one another, and Helen will attempt to stop doing whatever it was that Danny didn't like. Exactly once. She fixes her behavior long enough to say ""there, I did it,"" and then goes right back to what she was doing.  


Danny has talked to me about this a few times when it becomes particularly constraining for him, almost like clockwork every two months. I try not to be super biased because I really just want him to be happy even if we come to different conclusions, but the last time he talked to me about it was different. He was seriously considering breaking up with her and we talked for several hours about it. He said he knew that she was being very self-centered and that he didn't feel like they were making any real progress towards fixing things. He was very emotional about this, and he was really leaning towards breaking up with her, but he abruptly changed his mind at the end of the conversation. He just suddenly said, ""No, I can't do this,"" and went to see her. He said later that they talked it out, so I was hopeful they had made progress.

&amp;#x200B;

But that isn't exactly what happened. Instead, Danny hasn't been home in over a month. I work with him, so I see him around and he acts totally normal, but he is up Helen's ass all the time, more than ever. From what he says and from how they seem on social media, they're happier than ever and getting along great. But I see him become so much less of himself. He doesn't do any of the things that he found value in before, he doesn't spend any time with his friends or family, and I'm sure he knows that if he ever says that he wants time to himself that he can expect a firestorm from Helen.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my conundrum: First, should I say anything to Danny at all? There's always the chance that I'm wrong, that I'm not seeing the whole picture. Maybe he and Helen really did smooth things over really well when they talked and he has sequestered himself with her because they are doing really awesome. Who am I to try to harm that? But I just don't believe that's true; her character has been fairly unchanging and I don't think she has it in her to stop being so controlling. I honestly think he's just telling himself that things are okay because it is easier than facing the reality that they aren't. Am I wrong in thinking this?

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, if I do tell him, how should I go about it? This is his first real relationship and I don't want to stomp all over it, but I hate seeing my bro get trampled on by this girl.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My roommate is in a relationship with a super controlling girl and has convinced himself that that is completely fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be awesome, thanks!",16May2020,1
166,"I work in retail and am considered an essential worker, so I've been working since the beginning of the pandemic. I've been with the company for almost 10 years. Today, I received a formal offer letter from another company not in a retail environment and I accepted it. I will start this job in a couple of weeks.

When it comes to my two weeks notice, I'm not sure if I should put in for the full two weeks, if give any notice at all. The store I'm currently working in has had one person out for Covid-19 for the last couple weeks and had two more people go on leave due to testing positive today. I no longer feel safe at work and I'm worried about catching the virus to the point of giving me some issues with anxiety while I'm at work. I'm considering just telling my boss the next day I see her that that day is going to be my last day. I've looked at the calendar and because of the way pay periods line up and a payout of my PTO, I would have no issues with money until I started my new job.

I would normally have no issues with putting in the full two week notice, but with everything going on, I feel that if I don't have to take the risk of catching the coronavirus, I shouldn't take it.",16May2020,1

169,"I have been volunteering for a cat rescue and adoption center for about 6 months now. On an average week I volunteer around 30 hours. My volunteer duties are house keeping, customer service, Instagram, and at home foster care. 

I mainly help with keeping the building clean as all of the cats are free roaming and never in cages. I also help and clean in the back where there is a few other rooms, a work office and the sick cat room.  Sometimes these guys are gross and I'm cleaning up diarrhea and blood off the cage walls. Some have ringworm etc. 

Customer service duties mostly include answering the phone, assisting potential adoptors by answering questions and getting them excited for adoption. Then helping with the adoption process and telling them what to expect when bringing home a new cat. 

Instagram duties are to post pictures of the in house cats, foster cats, upcoming events, adoption availability and new cats who will soon be available. Growing the following is also an important aspect. And of course interact with messages and comments. 

Fostering is taking care of their cats at my home. Most of the cats I take are sick in some way. One cat is sort of crippled. 

Anyway...

After months of volunteering I finally fell in love with a cat named Lana. 

I tell the adoption coordinator (AC) I'd like to adopt Lana. She kind of argues back saying she thought I was going to adopt the crippled cat. I never said I was going to. They always asked if I was going to and I always said that I like her and I'm thinking about it but I'm unsure. She then awkwardly avoids the conversation. (This is the 1st sign she isn't going to let me adopt Lana) 

Six days later Lana's sister Pearl was found. The AC messaged me while I was napping at home saying that the sister Pearl needs to be picked up immediately. She then said Pearl is going to a new foster home and so will Lana. (2nd sign) threat she isn't going to let me adopt) 

As soon as I woke up I told her I'd be on my way to get Pearl and begged her not to take Lana from me. She let me take them both home. (Gave me some hope) 

Later that night I sent AC a text letting her know that I was upset that she would have rehomed Lana because I'd really like to adopt her. AC never wrote back. (3rd sign) &amp; &amp; 

AC use to be really cool and teach me how to administer shots and other vet things. Well after I expressed my want to adopt Lana things changed. 

I brought in my foster kittens so AC can vaccinate them. I was so excited to help but instead she told me to go clean the front. I put my tail in between my legs and did what she said. (Another sign I feel like she isn't going to let me adopt)

A few days later she told me that I'm slacking on my Instagram duties and she has 30 other fosters who can take over. (3rd sign / threat) 

She deleted a bunch of pictures and videos of the 8 kittens who I foster. I worked so hard on getting amazing pictures and videos that people were loving. She went behind my back and deleted all but one post per cat. She deleted one female cat leaving zero pictures or videos of her. 

I finally said something to the CEO. CEO made excuses for AC's behavior and actions. CEO told the adoption coordinator that I'm not to volunteer at the center until further notice and that for now my only duty is to foster.

The CEO told me she refuses to give me ""special treatment"" nor will she give me any promises of adopting Lana.

I am desperate for advice. I am falling in love with this cat. For the last 3 days I have avoided Lana as much as I can because I am so afraid of falling more and more in love because if they deny my adoption application my heart will ripped out more than it already has been.",16May2020,1

I absolutely should not have assumed that I couldn’t pass covid to any of you, especially since I was the one taking the huge risk of traveling across multiple states. What I said and the way I have been acting have been very insensitive, and I am so, so deeply sorry.

Backstory: 
I’m returning to my college state after being very far away at my parents house for the last 1.5 months due to covid. My dad is a massive germaphobe with lung problems so our home has been practically a fortress with too many extra precautions to count. 

I’m staying in my college state for just a little over 2 weeks to finish up some things here (from the safety of my apartment) and then packing everything up and returning to my parents house. At college I live with my 3 best friends in an apartment. On the way into my college town I was trying to get Siri to text my roommates to remind them that I’ll be “quarantining” in my room for the next 2-ish weeks (I meant self isolation, but I did say “quarantining”). As I’m coming from my parents fortress and I literally have not talked in person to someone I’m not related to in sooo long, I admittedly have lost some social tact. 

I only meant to remind them of my isolating, as a way to remind them that I can’t hug them hello and I would not like any help with my luggage, as they have done sometimes in the past. However, thro a series of texts with them, my texts were vague enough that they could have been interpreted as I believed that they all were going to give me covid, and that there’s no way I could give it to them as I was coming from a fortress and taking way more precautions than necessary. I was essentially undermining any and all the of the precautions they had taken in our apartment while I was gone (which we had not discussed and I most wrongly assumed they were taking only the minimum precautions set by the state)",16May2020,1

176,"Hi Guys,

Long story, but details are needed for this one. Ok, some back story..

About 12 years ago, I moved away from my home city due to family stuff, but I had so many great friends here that I'd visit every year during the years I was gone. I’ve since moved back to my home city again, and have lived here for 3 years. So 10 years ago, back when I was a senior in high school, I was visiting my home city and seeing my close friends. We went to hang out with some people I've never met before. That's how I met him...let's call him John. Back then, he liked my friend, but she didn't like him back. I thought he was cute, but honestly just thought he was a really nice guy and had no interest beyond that. 

I went back home, and about 6 months later, I visited the city again, and I invited him to come to a hotel party with us. He agreed, and that night, I got very drunk. He doesn't drink, but he stayed by my side the entire time, and we sat on the couch together and I rested my head on his shoulder while talking to him for the entire night. Nothing romantic happened, just him being nice I guess. After that night, I started to develop feelings for him because I saw who he really was. Gentle, sweet, HOT. (lol)

Anyway, I went back home after the trip and we started texting casually. We lived about 1000 miles away, but the casual texting turned into daily texts from him, usually saying ""good morning"" and continuing conversations throughout the day into the night. Again, this was 10 years ago and I was immature, so I naturally became obsessed with him and fantasized about him being my long-distance boyfriend. We joked about him flying up and taking me to prom, but beyond that, I don't remember us being overly flirty, maybe a few flirts here and there. He genuinely just texted me every single day wanting to chat and hear about my day, I guess? We were just like long-distance friends, though my friends at home thought there must be something going on between us. Beyond that, my memory is murky, but at some point, probably after 6-8 months of talking every day, we lost touch. My friends back home also stopped hanging out with him as much, I started seeing my boyfriend, and we lost touch. He did come up in conversations randomly over the years with my friends, and I think that my boyfriend could sense how infatuated I was with him in the past, though I honestly didn't think I had any feelings for him. 

Fast forward to the present day. I'm living in my home city again (John doesn't know because we no longer have mutual friends). That boyfriend I just mentioned, we were together for almost 10 years and broke up a couple of months ago. I'm doing good since the breakup. My ex told me when we broke up that I can ""go for John now"", but I didn't think I'd ever see or talk to John ever again.

The other day, I went into the store, and completely stopped in my tracks as my stomach dropped. John was stood there working.. I had completely forgotten he worked at said store. I just about ran out of there and drove away, horrified. As I drove away, I started getting a flood of emotions, almost feelings of infatuation. My stomach immediately starting hurting, and I've felt like that since..it's been 2 days. He looked so amazing and had the same kind face he always had. I so desperately wanted to say something, but I didn't think in the moment. He didn't see me. My friend (who he used to like) knows about our past friendship, is telling me that I should go back in and casually start a conversation with him, ask him to hang out sometime, initiate a friendship, etc. Should I? 

I know people change in 10 years, but I can't stop thinking about him. I know through social media that he's not taken. But I guess I am hesitant because I was always smitten with him, but I never found out if he had any kind of feelings for me. I have thought about him many times over the years and wished that I just told him I liked him so I could know the truth. But he never told he liked me as anything more than a friend. My friends do believe he liked me, but didn't say anything due to our distance. But who knows. Right now, the game plan would be to ""bump into him"" with my friend, catch up for a couple of minutes, ask to hang out in a friendly way and bring him back into my life as friends. Even if we were just friends forever, I would be fine with it. It would be nice to have him back just to talk to about deep things, just like we used to. I'm not saying he's my destiny LOML or anything, but the feelings I had when I saw him, and the thoughts I've had since then, have to mean something. But I'm scared as hell to approach him after 10 years. 

Will I regret it if I don't initiate contact with him, or should I let the past stay in the past?",16May2020,1

My mom has always been a bit messed, whether is was faking her suicide and abusing me regularly as a kid. I went through a phase at age 8-10 of beating up other kids because I was taught that it was normal.

 Despite DCF getting involved (many times), they always looked to me instead of my mom. Even when my little brother came to school crying about how my mom forced my brother and me to beat him up, they never looked to my mom. I'm grateful I got the blame and learned the hard way, but the resentment from the abuse I dealt with really built-up. 

When I was 13 and we fought so much. She could no longer hurt me anymore without me hitting back. She took out a knife, stabbed into the kitchen counter to assert she was ready to use it, and chased me down and tried to kill me. I ran for my life straight down to the basement to my dad and my mom tried to make her great escape to the car. It's turned into a thing every couple of months since then.

 Not to mention to she used to lock my dog outside in below 0 temperatures. My mom was so explosive even my dog couldn't stand her and refused to come inside after my mom locked her out.

180,"I (25y) live with my mom (58y), and she has a weird problem where she will stop eating for days, getting progressively weaker until she finally goes back to normal. It doesn't seem like a conscious decision to stop. From what she tells me, she will ""forget"" to eat one day, and then she ends up getting nauseous instead of hungry, making it harder and harder for her to eat and keep the food down. It's just a vicious cycle.

Whenever this happens, I try and make her food that I think she can handle, like egg drop soup, but it doesn't always work. She's pretty stubborn, too, so it's hard to actually help her by taking her to the doctor or something. I do have her taking Geritol multivitamins with iron, but she needs actual food.

It's kind of bad this time. She's been sleeping way more than normal, seems constantly nauseous especially if she can smell food. I've given her little things like a piece of toast just to see if she can keep it down, and she ate maybe 3/4 of it. Today I gave her a small dose of kratom because I've noticed that increases my appetite, but it didn't seem to do much for her.

184,"So I’m pretty sure what I have is misophonia. I really hate the sound of people chewing, eating, drinking water, etc. Some people are worse than others, some I really don’t have a problem with, but my GOD I can’t stand the way my mother eats. Does anyone have any advice on how to personally deal with it? Whenever I hear her eating crunchy food or drink water its like nails on a chalkboard for me. I cant stand the sound it occasionally makes me want to cry and/or get irrationally angry. I love my mama to to bits and I always feel really bad every time I involuntarily express irritation at her eating. Its just that she smacks her food against her tongue and its so loud and when she drinks water it sounds like she’s swallowing a brick. Like holy shit its so bad. (For me personally my dad thinks its kind of annoying but not to the extent that I do) The reason I’m asking here is because it’s legitimately not her fault whatsoever and it’s not fair for me to ask her to never eat in front of me again that’s ridiculous. But she doesn’t really make much effort to minimize it. I’ve asked before that if she’s gonna eat something to please sit on the other side of the living room or turn up the volume on something or play some music. She usually doesn’t care and wont do anything to help me even after I’ve asked so many times so usually I’ll do something. Either I move away, or turn up my movie, or put in earbuds.

My mother writes in journal, and before anyone says it, yes, this was a shitty thing for me to do, and I read it. I found page after page about what a horrible child I am. How much she wishes I would be like and act like her other children and how horrible I am. It broke me. I love her so much. I love her with such an incredibly beautiful love but deep down she hates me. It hurts me to even write this because writing this, is coming to terms with the fact that what I write is true. She claims I only ever talk about what I’m interested in and that, that makes me a poor conversationalist and a person she doesn’t want to talk to, but the thing is, she has nothing else to talk about instead besides complaining. I have tried to talk to her about different things but she keeps everything in her life “mysterious” and in the shadows for no reason. I ask her about her childhood stories and she goes “oh.. I dunno, nothing I can tell you.” I ask her about her favorite books, her favorite sports teams, her wedding, her music tastes, her most cherished childhood pet and the answer is always the same “oh [short answer that leaves no room for me to start a conversation off of]” it hurts me. Deeply. Because I love her and I know she’s been through a lot in her life. I cherish her more than anything in the world but she hates me. I just don’t know what to do.

188,"Title essentially sums it up. My roommate moved out, but didn't clean his room or disgusting bathroom and left random items of his behind, including furniture and perishable food. He messaged me saying I could keep it or throw it out. We never agreed it was my responsibility to deal with. I was obviously irate and responded by calmly explaining as much and that he would have to come back and clean and deal with his stuff or we would be fined, in which case I would make sure management knew to charge only him. Messaged me back saying he thought everything was clean and that dealing with the mess was on me since I'm moving out after him. Oh and he couldn't come back because had flown (yup, during the pandemic) out of the state to go on vacation (he doesn't work or go to school). 

I don't expect him to come back and it doesn't seem like he's even willing to accept responsibility for his lazy and inconsiderate behavior. I might have been willing to help him out a bit if he had asked before leaving, but thrusting it on me with zero communication is inexcusable.

193,"I have lived in a shared building with two other people (one male and one other female) for two years. The gender ratios have remained the same whenever people have moved out in the past. The female tenant is now moving out, and the landlords have found a prospective male tenant. I requested that they advertise for a female housemate because I am uncomfortable living with two males. In a condescending e-mail, my landlords explain that advertising for a female tenant is illegal (despite telling me when I moved in that they were looking for a woman because they try to keep the gender ratios the same). My landlords replied that my request is inappropriate (along with other behaviors or requests I’ve made, although I do not think that those requests have are inappropriate; described in parenthesis:

“nms-h:

[...] We are required to run ads that do not discriminate in any way.

[...]

Speaking frankly, you have often been a thorn in our sides, with more inappropriate requests and behaviors than any other tenant we have had in more than twenty years. (e.g., requesting permission to paint the walls, moving or requesting to throw away old and unused furniture—one of those requests was accepted because the outdoor furniture attracted homeless people, asking for permission to garden, and asking to watch my moms 10 lb dog for a few days due to a family emergency)

In view of this and past problems, perhaps it is time for you to move on.

I acknowledge that I may have been fussier than other tenants, but I do not think that my past behavior has been inappropriate. I don’t think that my request to live with another woman is inappropriate or unreasonable at all, and I’m not sure how to respond. It’s clear from the condescension in their e-mail that they do not like me. They basically said that if I’m not comfortable living with two guys that I can find somewhere else to live and go fuck myself. Do I kiss their ass and apologize for being a nuisance? Do I thank them for the (condescending) clarification? Whats the best way to respond and still sound professional? I don’t want the tensions with my landlords to continue.",16May2020,1
194,"Hi, I'm new here and this is my last resort to figure out how to solve my pickle. I'm 17 (F) and bisexual. I am in a navy program outside of school, and I met both of the people in my story through it.  

Almost a year ago, I started dating my now-boyfriend, we'll call him Bob. I've known him for 4 years, and we were best friends for a LONG time before we started dating. While I was at boot camp 3 years ago, I met a girl. We'll call her Jane. (Bob and Jane have never met, and he doesn't know how I felt for her) 

I fell *hard* for this girl. She lives very far from me, but that didn't stop me from develop the biggest crush my little 8th grade heart had ever felt. Once we graduated, I wen't home and so did she. We tried to keep up over text but we weren't very good at that. I never told her how I felt, but I thought about her every day for a long time. 

Time passed, and I managed to almost move on. I haven't talked to her in about a year and a half, until 1 week ago when she reached out and said she wanted to check in. I felt a huge wave of emotions sweep me off my feet. I had no idea what to say or what I was feeling. She's just as funny as I remember, and even more kind. As we've chatted, I get this feeling in my belly. I don't know if it's guilt for not telling Bob about her, or if it's the remainder of my first love trying to claw its way back to the surface. Whatever it is, I don't know what to do. Should I continue talking to her to see what these feelings are, or should I leave it alone and tell Bob that there was more to the story about my best friend from boot camp who's name keeps popping up on my phone?

196,"Okay.

Here's my dilemma. Sorry it's a bit long, a lot to explain. 

I have had a crush on a college professor for the duration of my college career. We have an age difference of \~15 years. While in school we were always friendly and casual and he taught me when I was a freshman but other than that our relationship was mostly about hobbies and just general kindness. Other students *thought* that there was something going on because him and I were so close but nothing happened while in school. We were literally just friends. Something in our personalities just *clicked.* 

I graduated last year and he attended the party, gave me his number, and said that if I wanted to meet up at all over the summer he would be nearby (we lived in the same state, \~2 hours away). 

Fast forward to the summer and he and I have gone on several 'excursions' but nothing happened on either, we were just pals hanging out (or so I thought). He visited me about 3 times, I think. I visited him once in addition and we played some drinking games to movies 

I moved away at the end of the summer, he stayed in that town. We fell out of touch until I returned home for Christmas and we met up again at an old haunt. He talked about a girlfriend he had, I told him about the job I landed. 

 A few weeks later he visited my new city to job hunt (he is originally from the new city and wanted to see friends as well) and I picked him up from the airport. We spent the day together (not alone, with a few friends we met up with) and everything was fun and casual.   


Fast forward to la Corona. 

 Him and I have been keeping in touch through text for the last year. He is an awful tester and has a habit of never responding, or responding days later. I don't want to seem annoying and I also don't really like texting as a form of communication so I don't reach out, cue me trying to move on and live my life. 

Out of the blue he texts asking if I'm okay at the beginning of the pandemic (normal, got this from other professors) and then if we can Skype. Weird. We've never done that for the last year. 

 I'm like- sure, of course, all my plans are cancelled!

We Skype about once a week for about a month and  just talk about hobbies, and habits, and find out that we are really similar. Like, crazy similar. He would come up with reasons to schedule the calls like helping with projects and stuff but we would only talk about that briefly and then stay on the call for hours just bullshitting around. 

 I find out that he's had two ex wives and a string of ex lovers (relevant later) but like, whatever that doesn't bother me. He ends the last Skype of that month saying he has to go to his gfs and I get a bit torn up b/c I'm wondering why he keeps seeking me out all of a sudden. I feel like I keep getting mixed vibes. I'm sad about it for a maybe a day, talk to some friends who tell me to buck up, and then push it out of my mind. 

Fast forward to a month later. I am living my best Corona life, working from home and wandering around the neighborhood aimlessly. He texts me out of the blue stating that he wants to Skype.

I'm like sure. I'm not doing anything else. 

We chat and once again immediately click intellectually about our hobbies and he starts bringing up past relationships and about taking a road trip with me if he is able to come to my city over the summer and all sorts of wild fantasies. We're sharing books and celebrity crushes and our first impressions of one another. Then he asks me if I want to do a wine and Skype with him later that week.

I agree, I love wine and I love talking to him. 

Well, on that night we both get very drunk and play Red Flags (a game where you give two good  traits and one bad trait and the person has to decide if they would still go on that date) and he is chatting a lot about his preferences and I'm talking about mine and it's going really well. Like so well that, despite the time difference, he is up till the wee hours of his morning. We're taking personality tests for shits and giggles and he is asking if were compatible and talking about past trauma, etc. We're really vibing, imo. Ends with him asking to do it again.

Which brings me to the present. We have another one of these sessions set up for this upcoming week.

But wait.

There's more. 

I have never had sex and am overall, fairly inexperienced in that field. I mean, I've hooked up with guys in the past but have never done / received oral or had actually vaginal intercourse. I am no saint, and have experimented with my body myself and am quite familiar with what I like and don't like both physically and in terms of situations / etc but I have never found a partner that I really connected with. I was so focused on getting my dream job (I did) after college and my high school boyfriend was gay and I didn't want to lose it to a hookup at a bar. 

But now I'm feeling like it makes me a liability. I am really interested in this guy but he has decades of experience on me and seems to like experienced women from our conversations and I don't even know how to approach the topic. 

I'm aware I'm jumping the gun, nothing has happened between us yet (and may never), but I'm self conscious about my inexperience and don't know what the best course of action should be. Should I just throw caution to the wind and have sex with a stranger and try to gain experience? I considered some close guy friends but since I'm in the new city, I have none in the area. 

My virginity has never bothered me before. I'm not saving it or anything like that. I just haven't met a person who I was interested in long enough and okay with my crazy schedule to pursue and didn't want a one night stand. 

I basically have two questions: 

1. Is he giving me signs, or am I overthinking and he just wants to be friends?
2. Is my experience going to seriously turn off not only him, but in general future romantic relationships? Do older/experienced guys care if you are a virgin or not? At what age do you want to stop being the 'teacher' in the bedroom?",16May2020,1

It’s my dream to be able to play in a band. I watch gigs somewhat frequently and I’ve been wanting to do this for about a year now. I’m falling under the wrong mindset though. I’ve been playing guitar lately, and have really enjoyed it, but the past few days I’ve been feeling a lot less motivation because I feel like it’d be harder for me to find a band as a guitar player. I’m 17 and a lot of ppl my age who play  have more experience than me and I hardly know anyone who is interested in music. I also kind of want to learn bass, and I know that it’s a lot more useful when it comes to finding a band. But now I’m just stressing and overthinking this, I’ve lost track of what I actually want to play and have shifted my focus to how easy it’ll be for me to find a band depending on what instrument I choose to learn. 

Now it’s like I’m back to square one and have no idea where to start. I’ve been teaching myself guitar (electric) for only two months.",16May2020,1
199,"I don’t know how to say this without sounding like a horrible person, so I’m just going to be as honest as possible. 

Background: I’m 19 and I’ve lived with my grandmother since I was two or three, along with my older sister, who moved out of the house a couple of years ago. I hope to move out by fall, but, obviously, nothing is certain right now. 

I’m not really sure why I hate my grandmother as much as I do. Hate is a strong word that I don’t think I would use for literally anyone else, but I *hate* hate her. Growing up with her as a parent definitely wasn’t a party, but it wasn’t completely awful, either. I’m definitely grateful for everything she did for me, and my sister. 

But, to my grandmother, I was never grateful *enough.* She has always told me (and my sister) how ungrateful we are and how disrespectful we are, and how much she does for us and sacrifices for us. As appreciative as I am, it’s kind of hard to feel grateful when she holds everything over my head and demands some kind of reward. We had a conversation a while back (sometime in the past six months or so) where she said I was spoiled and I asked what she did that “spoiled” me. She said, “I love you, I feed you, I never hit you.” I said, “You mean, the bare minimum of being a parent?” 

She would tell me and my sister that we were going to end up in foster care because we were so horrible and no one else wanted to take care of us. Actually, she would talk extremely often about how she was the *only* one that was willing to take care of us, and the only one that truly cared about us or loved us, and the only person we could really trust. 

There’s quite a bit more stuff I could list, but this post is going to be long enough already. I think if I had to sum it up, my main problem with her is that she *demands* not only adoration and praise, but love and affection too. She gets offended and angry if I flinch away from a hug or some other kind of physical affection, or when I’ll ask her as politely as I know how to to leave me alone because I don’t feel like talking. She’ll ask things like “Do you not love me anymore?” “Why do you hate me?” “Why are you so cruel to me?” Nearly. Every. Single. Day. 

And I’m *trying* not to be mean. I really am. But the way in which this woman infuriates me is unparalleled. Just her voice alone causes me a rage I would otherwise think impossible. And I don’t know why. I know that I have valid reasons to not feel super warmly disposed towards her, but this hate is surely at least a little excessive. I truly cannot stand her. I can’t even look at her when I say “love you too.” I respond out of anger without thinking a lot of times, unnecessarily hostile.

I feel really guilty about it. For one, she’s my *grandmother.* Two, I live in her house even though I’m old enough to live on my own. 

And, oh yeah, we’re quarantined together. Y’all. Everything I said above was a problem *well* before quarantine, and now we’re trapped in a house together. I know that she’s lonely, and I know that I’m literally the only other person around, but having a conversation with her is torture. 

I don’t know what to do! I genuinely don’t know how much longer I can stand living like this. Help?

p.s. maybe i should mention: she raised us as jehovah’s witnesses. i’m not one anymore, but she still is, and i haven’t told her i’m not one anymore, but i’m pretty obviously disinterested in all things watchtower.",16May2020,1

I'm 22 (F) but I never felt genuinely happy with my life. I'm in college studying something worthless, even if I graduate I won't get a job. I liked it for 1 year but now my teachers just make me feel stupid, so what I thought was my passion turned into my personal nightmare.
I'm not american so my studies ain't that expensive but I still feel guilty for spending my parents money in something that doesn't make me happy. Plus, they advised me I shouldn't study what I am studying and they were fucking right.

I stopped smoking weed 1 month ago so I feel kind of better with how I deal with cash. I only expend their money in basic needs now but I basically been high for 4 years straight thanks to my parents and I'm deeply embarrassed for this.
If I continue like this I will never be a truly independent person, I can't see myself as one, it's a problem and I don't know wtf to do. How do you become an economicly independent person? I don't know what to do, no one hires people in Spain if you have no experience and I have studied 4 years (and massively failed) of an useless carreer. 

Emotionally I'm shit. I can't hide my anger and I always project it into my friends and family, I'm an asshole, basically. I tried to manage it but I can't help it, I'm one of those people that thinks out loud. My love life is shit, being an asshole and objectively ugly does not help when you want to get laid (yes, virgin alert). Yes, I kissed people and have done a few sexy things but it was years ago, I have not kissed a person in 2 years. I never had a teenage love or something like that. I tried tinder but it's just weird for me, but I want a love life :(

Right now I feel like I met all the people that could be a part of my life (romantically or not) and lived in all places I could afford, does this make any  sense? And it just makes me sad. I also feel like I won't make it any further if I tried, like this is peak is my life and I hate it.

207,"So my sister (22) has been dating a soon-to-be 19 year old for a while now, and as much as I’ve tried to be supportive of their relationship, his behavior has become more and more concerning to me over the past few months, and every time I try to gently bring it to my sister or my mother’s attention, they get annoyed with me and act as if I’m jealous of him or their relationship. 

Ever since covid caused school to be online and they’ve come home for the semester, they’ve been spending nearly every day at our tiny apartment (family of four here) for hours and hours at a time. On the off day he’s not coming over, he’ll come up with some excuse to “stop by,” like bringing small presents, and then stays the rest of the day. He also always asks my sister if she wants him to stay when he’s about to walk out the door, which always ends with him staying at least an hour longer. 

A surprise visit for a gift is all well and and good, but in the past two weeks he’s done it five times. One of these times was in the middle of the night, and he was with his friend, supposedly so concerned with our safety because my sister didn’t answer a call due to being asleep that he just HAD to swing by and check on us. He stayed knocking at our door for about five minutes before leaving and then waking up my mother to give a whole speech about why he came. I was the only one awake at the time with the light on downstairs, and I couldn’t see him and didn’t open the door. It honestly scared the crap out of me because he started knocking pretty hard and made no attempt to make himself known at the door like he usually does. 

The next day he came over for another surprise visit and found out from my dad that she and I were out for the day, but he didn’t know where. So he leaves and calls my sister while we’re in the car. The first thing he does is ask if he’s on speaker, then proceeds to say hello to me and pleasantly grills my sister on where and what exactly we are doing. He then subtly tried to invite himself by bringing up the food he wanted to bring her, but she declines and he says he just wanted to see what was up, even though he already knew we were out for the day and wouldn’t be home. Even today it appears he managed to convince my sister to let him hang out in our bedroom even though he was supposed to go home and she was just going to say bye to him outside, even though I’ve already expressed to her that I’m uncomfortable with them hanging out in our bedroom (I’m 20F, I just don’t like some dude hanging out where I sleep where we sometimes have intimate things out in the open, especially since I can’t exactly predict when he’s coming)

They’ve also been doing things like taking showers together while other people are in the house and similar more mature things, which I also find concerning because this is the guy’s first relationship and he and my sister have different levels of maturity. My mother also treats him like an angel because he’ll do things like wash our dishes and, in comparison to her last boyfriend, treats her a lot better. 

There have been more concerning behaviors from him but I’m trying to keep this short. I’m just afraid that he’s slowly becoming possessive and controlling, and that my sister and mother are too absorbed in the relationship that it’ll be too late by the time they see it for themselves. Talking to them has proven futile, but I don’t want my sister to be in danger or have issues down the road if things don’t work out. Is there anything I can do outside of sitting in the sidelines and watching this all unfold? Any thoughts would be appreciated.",16May2020,1
208,"I was leaving for work and almost stepped on a bag that was left at my door. I thought it was a present for a kids birthday or something because it’s in a minions bag but there’s wine and coolers in it. There’s also bath/spa stuff and a local news t-shirt. I spent time looking over my local news webs but didn’t see any kind of contest or anything. 



There’s no name on the bag or any kind of identity all. I think I heard whoever left it earlier in the day because my dog barked but he always barks. I usually wait until he barks a second time to check if I didn’t hear the door.

the pros are that i love performing &amp; it’s something i love and would make me stand out for med school applications
the cons are that it’s far and gas money to go to &amp; from the school 3 times a week would be expensive.

We live in a small gated community and our houses are right near each others with a small bit of property between, like 6 steps his and ours combined between. Well first thing he's been doing is shooting arrows at our fence telling other neighbors we gave him permission when we didn't and we have asked him to stop but hasn't making holes in our fence and we think was a reason our dog got badly injured one night, I woke up one morning where her side had a clean cut and you could see her intestines. We talked to the sheriff and was told we have to wait for one of his arrows to be in our yard to take it to them before they could do anything. We then have where they would make fires and head inside without putting them out that risks him setting the whole neighborhood on fire as well we talked to them about it and it was just ignored. Lastly he throws parties that last all the way to 1 AM where they have a fire, drink, and play loud music where my two month old and even me and my husband cant sleep. Not just us but the rest of the neighbors asked them to stop since even they have kids and it's to loud but they ignore or are so drunk they get violent, last week being so drunk they tazed theirselves.

216,"I guess for a bit of context, my cousin and I are the same age and we’ve been best friends for as long as I can remember. We grew up together, we graduated together, we went to university an hour away from each other. We would had classes together in high school, we celebrated birthdays together, we went on vacations together. We promised to be each other’s maids of honour, we told the others person everything, and we made sure to see each other at least once a month no matter what. 

Last summer she was sitting in her moped (we both ended up getting one as a cheaper alternative to a car) and she was hit by a drunk driver at 7 am while she was on her way to work. Obviously this has been a huge impact on my family. She wasn’t killed in the crash, but she feels like a complete shell of who she was. 

It’s been ten months and I feel like I still just can’t handle any of it. I go home for major holidays and I visit her, and seeing her lying there alive but not conscious is the most painful thing. I visit with her and put on a movie but at best all she does is stare at me. I started seeing a therapist again in January but I don’t even know how to begin to talk about what I feel about this. How am I able to be drinking and laughing and enjoying the weather while she’s in a hospital bed celebrating that she can eat apple sauce without a feeding tube? How can I be happy the term is over when she has a lung infection? 

I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s my boyfriends dads birthday and I’m celebrating by eating cake and drinking whine while my mom texts me about how it’s amazing because my cousin ate some food all by herself. Nothing will ever be the same and I feel Ike such a piece of shit for a) putting myself when her life is so incredibly difficult and b) for being able to enjoy things that realistically she’ll never be able to. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to talk to anyone about this, including my therapist. I don’t know how to grieve when she’s not even gone.

221,"I'm a senior in high school, which at this time is pretty fucking weird and honestly kind of scary/very depressing.

Anyways, I graduate next week and the way our school is doing graduation is basically in groups that students would get to choose. Due to a series of odd and very particularly timed events, I got put in a group with lots of people I've known since middle school, people who I've spent so much time with...my former group of friends (let's call them group A).

So over the last year-ish I sort of got divorced out of group A (If I had to guess: I have a very harsh personality, I take a lot of energy from people, and people could only take so much of it). It started with one person during may 2019, but after one of their birthday dinners over the summer where they invited everyone but me (I saw a picture on one of their Instagram posts and eventually played dumb/guilt tripped a friend to tell me the truth). I began to notice that they were beginning to distance themselves from me (at lunch, group chats and whatnot). I still have really good relations with 3 of them (out of 8 or 9), but even they still distanced themselves from me.

I didn't realize how bad the situation was until I got dumped and couldn't talk to any of my friends about it or get comforted it by it... and then after two weeks, my ex seemingly took my place in that group which I saw was coming since our mutual friends were leaning towards his side in the break up (despite pretending to be neutral). and I assume then spilled the tea about our relationship to them because after that they all grew even further than before, like noticeably further. But it's fine, I grew closer with two other people and now we're an inseparable trio (let's call it group B).

I mention all this because I am now going to be graduating with those people... against my will. I couldn't sign up to be with group b, and someone from group a signed me up to graduate with them. I don't know how to feel because I can't wait to see two of them, I don't know if I can't see the others knowing that they hate me, or if I can even face my Ex (that's a whole thing). The one who I'm closest with (also the one who signed me up) insists that everybody including my ex agreed that they want me there, and they want to host a get together afterwards as a last hurrah together before some move out of state... and at the risk of sounding redundant... THAT FEELS REALLY FUCKING WEIRD. Like people who hate me deciding that I am worthy enough to be around them, it's terrible... right or am I just petty? And this moment is supposed to mean a lot, but the entire time I'm just going to feel so uncomfortable or angry or I don't know.

I don't know how to deal with any of this in the coming days (the ceremony is next week) or even the future when I know I'll have to deal with some of them. How do you face people who you still kinda like, but they hate you back?

tl;dr: I'm going to be graduating and spending time with my old friends who don't like me and I don't know how to handle it",16May2020,1

Anyway -- I'm moving this weekend, and then aiming to walk through my old apartment with the landlord the week after (5/22ish).

225,"Most of our office is currently teleworking, and we can safely do most of our work that way.

Our boss well we'll call them micro manager was scheduling a job for us to train some employees of an old work acquaintance, which could be done remotely.

 Then my coworker and I were called into a video conference where micro manager wanted to ask us ""how comfortable we were to do it"". 

No mention of protection being provided to safely do the job, I assumed we would have to provide our own. But I  immediately said nope not comfortable, not gonna do it, my coworker however hesitantly agreed, and then I said he should not go either. He then sighed with relief.

Micro manager supposedly said they were going to say "" No"" but wanted to check with us first.

 Why even ask us? No is no right?  Why even entertain the idea?

My co-worker honestly is a people pleaser and would have done it. 

My guess is micro manager knew my coworker would say yes, and assumed I would too since we work closely. I almost said ""Hell No"".

227,"Hi redditors, thank you for taking the time out to read this. 

So as the title says I feel very unwelcomed when I go to visit my adopted mother by her biological son.

Backstory: I was adopted my by Cousin (37F) when I was in the 2nd grade for purely financial reasons. If she adopted me I could get better healthcare as I was a very sick child and my Grandmother could not afford to pay for all of that out of pocket (and other little academic and financial reasons but you get the point. It is also important to note that I am from a third world country and not America as most redditors assume that everyone is from there, with my experience on this platform).

 My Mother and Father are completely out of the picture, but I lived in a pretty large household for most of my life, I lived with my 2 cousins (adopted mom and her son), 4 aunts and my Grandma, so most if my life I basically lived with my everyone. 

However, about a year ago my Cousin and her son moved to a different house about 10 mins away. She offered for me to come love with her, but I turned down the offer and opted to alternate between the two homes because I didn't want to be a burden, but when I go over there I am treated like one by her son.

Her son and I were pretty close growing up, we did everything together and now I am kinda taken aback from how he's been acting. When I go over there he never misses a chance to let me know that he likes when I'm not there because he doesn't like sharing his bed, I quickly adapted and respected his wishes and just sleep on the couch whenever I go over there to visit. 

But he finds more things to complain about to his mother about me. He tells her that when I'm there all their bills go up and their food finishes faster, when he tells her this it's kinda awkward for her because it is true but I get the feeling that she knows it's true, but she has never said anything on the matter and always makes me feel welcomed, it's just her son.

I visit her house every two weeks because my Grandma is not in the best financial situation and food is kinda scare there and I'm often times hungry when I'm there, my other 4 aunts are still kids so they rely on my Grandma. My living situation at my Grandma's is not ideal, I have no privacy or anything like that.

So, how can I deal with this? I really enjoy going to her place to get away from my reality and when I'm there I'm not really hungry. It just takes a huge toll on me mentally to feel like a burden.

TL;DR: I am told I'm a burden by my adopted brother when I visit my adopted Mom.",16May2020,1
228,"I met one of my best friends about 9-10 years ago. His name isn't important but to avoid confusion I'll call him Daniel. He's currently 20 years old, he's both my boss, my future roomate, and one of if not my closest friend. About a year ago I went through a really bad break up. I was 17 at the time and it shattered me. The story about that isn't important, but what is important is that I was able to move on because the girl involved moved to a different country. I find it difficult to get over girls unless they are out of sight out of mind. When I was still hurting I met another girl. Lets call her Lyn. Lyn at the time of me meeting her had just turned 15. As I said before I was in a really bad place at the time and I began to onjectify girls. I wanted to just get into a relationshio so I could feel happy again, and Lyn was one of the girls I asked out. She liked me and we were doing fine. I didn't think that she was going to stick arond and actually like me, and I was stupid. She told me some of her insecurities and I joked about them later on. She felt very hurt and lost feelings. I've since apologized and am striving to be more positive than destructive. I hadn't moved on though. I introduced Lyn to my close friend group (currently 4 people total counting Lyn and Daniel). At the time I hadn't really grown feelings for her, but I did see myself in her. You see my mom has been mentally abusive my whole life. She's narcisistic and arrogant. Lyns dad has been battling cancer for years, and he's also mentally abusive. Lyn has been having to take care and help a man who constantly berates her and humiliates her while he's slowly dying. And this year is likely to be his last. I saw a girl who was like me. Someone who had become depressed because one of the people they love the most and look up to most is attacking them mentally. But Lyn handled it differently. I had let my mom drag me down my whole life, and when I was younger, I didn't think I'd live past 15, and never planned for the future. Lyn was the opposite, she learned as much as possible, matured quickly, and tried her best to get out of her house as fast as possible even with her shackles. I wanted to be like her. And I could tell she needed a friend. So I wanted her to become one of my closest friends so that I could help her, and so that I could learn to be like her. And I fell for her, hard. I asked her out a few times and got rejected every time. And this is the part Daniel comes in. He had given me advice the whole time, when I was asking her out, how to get over her, and how to win her back. None of it really worked. But I kept coming back to him for help and advice. They way he put it, he sees me as his little brother, and he wants to help me out as best as possible. About 5 months in Daniel told me that ""He would no longer date minors (He's 19 and I was 18 at the time of saying this idk if that's important) and that I shouldn't either."" I still wanted to be with Lyn so I didn't agree. About 9 months in or, 4 months ago, we all had the idea of going to the beach. I was working so I couldn't go. Lyn wanted to go even if no one else would, so she planned on going alone. Daniel said he would go with her. That's when my jealousy started. I began to mistrust Daniel. I started teasing him more often, to the point where he pulled me aside and asked me if there was a problem. I told him the truth. He told me these exact words. ""I don't like Lyn, and I'm pretty sure I'm not even her type. I promise you I will never date her."" And I trusted him. Sure at times I felt jealous whenever they interacted with each other, but I ignored them because I trusted him. He told me that I could check his phone and text messages if I didn't trust him, but I didn't because I did trust him. And then, suddenly, about a month ago. Both Daniel and Lyn started to become distant. They both gave me valid reasons why so I didn't become suspicious. Any time I felt a hint of suspicion I chalked it up to insecurity and trusted my friend. Until May 7th, which was Lyns birthday, she turned 16 and we were all there. Except Lyn and Daniel were interacting with each other a lot, but I trusted Daniel. 5 days later was Daniels birthday. He was turning 20. There was music and I was elected ""DJ."" Daniels phone was the only one connected to the speakers and when I went to change the song I noticed he had changed his password for the first time since I've met him. I didn't think anything of it because I trusted him. Later on I walked outside and saw him on one knee in front of her as she laid down in a hamock. I couldn't see their faces but I thought he was talking to her notmally because I trusted him. About a couple hours later Lyns dad called her and was having a freak out episode, so Daniel opted to drive her home. I felt a little jealous, but I trusted him. Just to clarify there is now only 4 people at the party (The extra 2 were people we had never met irl but knew online). I was in Daniel room playing League of Legends on his pc. I was growing a little worried because they were taking a while, but I didn't think much of it. Until I decided to read the DM history between Daniel and Lyn. It was the most painful thing I've ever had to read. They were flirting, talking about cuddling, kissing, how ""he's still trying to get over you :p"". I started to freak out. I called in the other friend from our friend group and showed him the messages, he simply covered his mouth. He told me to not making any rash decisions and to calm down before I do anything or call anyone. I didn't listen. I was seeing red. I wanted answers and I called him immediately. The first thing I said when I picked up the phone was ""How long have you to been dating? How long have you been lying to me?"" I don't remember what he said right away, just that he asked me to wait for him to get home so we could talk. I asked my other friend on what to do. Daniel and I were going to move in together. He got me a job at his nail salon and I was making good money. I didn't think I could ever look at him again. But I knew that if I were to beat the shit out of him and throw it all away I would be stuck again at my house. With my abusive mom. My other friend told me to be patient. And so that's what I did. I heard out Daniels side of the story when he got back and just listened. He called Lyn and they explained to me that they hid it from me becasue they were scared if what I would do. They knew that as a person I would blame myself and maybe kill myself. Daniel broke up with her that night. It's been 3-4 days since and we've been trying to work past it. I'm trying forgive Daniel, I've already forgiven Lyn. I don't blame her for liking him. But Daniels different. He promised me he would never date her. He played off of my insecurities and trust. Even past all that I still wanted them to be happy. I asked him that night if he loves her, he said that he does, but not as much as I do. Today I asked him again and if he meant it, he said ""I meant that you have an obsession, and I actually love her, your obsession is stronger than my love."" I disagreed because I've been obsessed with a girl before, and then I just wanted her for myself, but with Lyn I wanted her to be happy. The only reason it's a problem she was dating someone was that it was Daniel. He promised me he wouldn't date her until I get over her. I told him multiple times that it not about wether or not I'm over her, It's that he's breaking his promise to me of never dating her. But he kept asking for a compromise where I would let him date her. I don't want to agree because if I do I know that I'll have to see them interact every day at the apartment and it'll tear me apart. I talked to Lyn and she made it clear to me that she doesn't think she'll ever see me in the same way she sees Daniel. What should I do moving forward? Should I never give him my blessing, or should I try to learn how to live with the fact that they like eachother? I included the ages because I was told by other people that they're important even though I don't agree :p",16May2020,1

Anyways a long long time back I met a girl in my physics class in college and we hit it off, been friends for a couple years. I also have a main friend group at college that she’s not associated with(my university has 40k students, so at the least it’s highly unlikely). Apparently I was wrong about that. So Sally(the girl) was talking with me and I ranted to her a bit about a guy in my main friend group for a while, I just wanted to blow of steam. Well apparently she met the person I was ranting about a little later on our university discord and decided to tell him all about how I didn’t like him. He comes to me and starts yelling at me for backbiting (which, ok. I did do, but I was under the impression that she’s an outside person and I just needed to vent. How would I know she’d meet him later and tell him everything?) and then started arguing with me about basically everything I was ranting about to Sally. Eventually he got angry and just refused to reconcile, but that’s made it really awkward for me in our friend group. Other people don’t really message me or respond to what I say on our group discord and I just feel weird and awkward and I want to just stop feeling this way, even if they still don’t like me. I just can’t figure out how to move on. 

In case you’re wondering, he blocked me on the one platform where I have contact with him, so it’s not like I can talk to him and try to fix things.

I’m almost 21, and up until recently I had convinced myself that I was still being a healthy person.

Now since I have a girlfriend, am hundreds of miles away now, and need to work to keep my apartment, I’ve had a hard time getting back into all the outdoor stuff and the healthier diets I loved back then. I’m in a great area for outdoor stuff (Colorado), but I always end up slumping into another video game session or YouTube binge and I hate it. I have thousands of dollars of nice equipment (bikes, skis, clothes, etc.) that I busted my ass to get and I don’t use any of it.

And two, is this array of painted wires leading to a ground? My plan is to mount the antenna in the attic, run coax to an exit point and split it to the two pre-wired cables.",16May2020,1
234,"So I (M, 14) have been in a friend group with a couple girls and one of my guy friends for a while now. When I was 12/13, at the peak of my awkward phase, I think the girls in my friend group lost respect for me due to me being awkward. I was always Mr. Nice Guy. I liked one of the girls at the time as well. This made me be 10x more awkward, because I was always trying to be so nice to her. I was being called cringy and not cool along with other derogatory terms. They weren’t trying to be mean but they really did think I was cringy and not cool. They still call me this now even though I’m not cringy anymore and have changed a lot. When I was younger I feel I lost their respect and I am wondering how do I get it back?",16May2020,1
235,"This is extremely long. I’m writing for 26 years of trauma. But I apologize and understand if no one reads this to the end. But I need advice from non-biased people. 

TL;DR mother is toxic. Should I have a relationship after years and years of trying. 

For reference I’m 26f and my mother just turned 52. I had a decent childhood when both my parents were together. But after they split when I was about 7 years old, I grew up in poverty when I lived with just my mother. For some other background info, my mother has never wanted to work in her life. Even according to her parents and her siblings. From what I remember as a child she never left her bedroom. She always wanted to just lay down and read her book or watch her daytime dramas. I was always forced to look after and care for my older brother who is only 11 months old and my younger sister who is 4 years younger. I started changing diapers when I was 5. As I aged, I was forced to do all the cleaning and laundry. Then cook whenever I could. I was always the last to eat, which would be scraps. My mother was always somewhat physically abusive. But as I became a tween and young teenager it became very bad physical abuse and mental abuse as well. I would get comments about being fat (when looking back I was a 00 until junior year). I was constantly made to feel like I was stupid and had no future to look forward to. I always got back grade and I honestly don’t know how I made it through most of my classes. The abuse just seemed to get worse and worse. For example one very vivid memory was how I was supposed to cook dinner. And before I sat to eat I had to rip up news paper to put in the kitty litter boxes because we didn’t have money for kitty litter and they needed clean boxes. Apparently I wasn’t cooking right. Idk really remember why she took over cooking. But I remember her snatching the cooking utensils out of my hand and yelling at me to do the boxes. So I did. Well apparently I wasn’t ripping the paper correctly? I mean what did you expect from a 10/11 year old. She got so upset she slapped me right across the face so hard I fell to the ground and was dazed. When I finally was able to get up as she was screaming at me to get out of the kitchen I looked in my dresser mirror and saw the mark on my cheek. It was welted and was there for several hours. I couldn’t stop crying so I got yelled at to stop. I couldn’t eat because I was so distraught and then got my food taken away and was forced to bed without eating. I remember sitting in bed holding my mouth, trying not to make a peep. I just wanted life to be over. I dealt with similar outbursts until I was 14 and “ran away”. There was another fight where my sister, about 10 at the time, also was yelling at screaming and degrade me. I went outside to sit on the front steps and I remember my mother telling my sister to get my “fat, nasty ass” in the house before she “beat my ass”. Right then I just started running. Without hesitation I waited at a bus stop, got one and I went to find my dad. I didn’t have a phone at the time and seems crazy I made it to my dads house without any issues. I was pounding on his door and screaming. But it seemed like he wasn’t home. I sat there for what seemed like 30 mins before I tried one last time. He finally opened the door looking like he saw a ghost.  But he took me in with open arms. (We’re dealing with some problems right now, but that’s a different story. Possible another toxic relationship). When I stayed the night I pleaded with my dad not to tell my mother where I was. And he agreed. It took a week before my mother told him I was “missing”. That hurt a lot. I always had love for my mother. Probably instinct. But even after everything I loved her and thought one day, when I was old and more mature, that we would get along. I honesty thought I was the problem when it came to our relationship. But eventually my mother found out that I was with my dad (I think my dad told her to not get in legal trouble) and demanded I come home instantly. I refused and told her we need time apart. I ended up staying with him until I moved out with a bf when I was 17 and graduated high school. But for the first time I felt so loved. I was always able to eat. My dad didn’t have much money but he made sure I had some money for female items. It was also the first time I got on the honor roll. It’s crazy what a little love can do. I ate right and finally gained some healthy weight. I was on the honor roll. I started joining sports and was able to have friends. After I graduated hs I worked for a bit. I was making 15/hr which was a lot for a 17 year old. Somehow she found out and tried to weasel her way into my life again. But I longed for that relationship. So I allowed it. I helped her when I could. There would be some times when I would drive and see her walking in the cold and I would pick her up and take her to her destination. Well I moved into my own apartment with my then bf and decided to go to school full time and work full time. Well me and the bf split and he left. I had roommates move in but the bounced without paying rent. I was afraid of being homeless (didn’t want to live with my mother, couldn’t afford the apartment myself , dad had family problems and had a bunch of people move in his place). At the time my mother came into a settlement. I swallowed my pride and asked for a loan of 1,000 and when I graduated and got my first professional job I would pay her back ASAP. I was only 2 months from graduation. But as said I graduated in May and got my first job in November. My first check I paid her 300 bucks. She was thrilled. But I had to commute to this job that was an hour and a half way. I told her I got paid on a certain day and I would have her money but I would be away for work for about 5 days (stayed with a family member on the days I worked) and I would bring it back when I was back in town. Well we got a snow storm, but that wouldn’t be a problem from when I would be driving home. Well she started blowing my phone up telling me she needed her money now. I told her I was an hour and a half away and it was a snow storm. She flipped shit. Say I was stealing from her. And it go to the point my sister was messaging me saying they were going to “sue” me and I was a low life. And I was a failure because I borrowed money. And the list goes on and on. I was at work and hysterical. My boss, being as nice as she was, let me leave. So I drove home. In the middle of a snow storm. Almost died but almost going of the road multiple times. It took me almost 4 hours to get home. All the while they were still constantly blowing my phone up. I finally had it. When I got to her house I blew up at both of them and told them they were toxic and never contact me again. Of course she couldn’t see her wrong and tell her I’m worthless and I’ll never become anything. I felt so free. I cried for hours, but it seemed like it was relief. I didn’t speak to her for over 3 years. She tried talking to me around Christmas time 2018. She said she was in counseling and she knew she messed up. And she wanted a relationship. But I said fine. Let’s talk. I asked her if she remember anything she did to me. She said no. I said do you remember physically and mentally hurting me, she said no. But I chose not to talk to her because she refused to own up to the mistakes of her past. But then my grandmother passed away in March 2019. The funeral was a fiasco, as you would suspect. (Another story for another day). She tried her manipulative ways at my grandmothers funeral! I just stayed to the side and ignored it. I wasn’t going to make a scene at a funeral. She contacted me a few times since her funeral, but I let it be short and sweet. But then the most important person in my life, my grandfather, passed away in November 2019. I was devastated. So I seen her again at his funeral and she did the same shit that she pulled at my grandmothers. I couldn’t handle it. But I didn’t stay in contact and message her every once in awhile to check in to see how’s she’s doing with the loss of her father. I’ve been struggling for months. I’m a healthcare worker who works in a hospital and with everything going on, the overtime, the long hours, haven’t had time to cope with my grandfathers passing. Maybe I’m using the world as an excuse, but just saying grandpa puts a lump in my throat. But my mom is still trying to have a relationship. Especially since I’m supposed to get married in October. (Obviously who knows with Covid19). But I can’t help but not want to pursue the relationship. I tried for years. I helped her when she was down. I gave her money and paid some of her bills and bought her groceries. I even bought her 30 cats, food and litter at least once a month for almost a year. Yes thirty! But the one time in my life I needed help so I could focus on school, she used it as a way to be nasty to me and controlling. She used it as a way to tell her she helped me and I wouldn’t be who I am without her. I tried to be “perfect” for her. I always thought I was wrong when I was a kid and deserved the treatment. I just wanted a mother’s love. And I never got it. I tried helping her out when I could and never got a single thank you. I can’t help but feel like my life has always been better when I had no contact with her. Is it okay to not want that relationship anymore. Is it okay to tell her I tried for so long and she’s too late. Is it okay to admit to her that’s she’s toxic to me and I don’t want that energy in my life?

Basically we broke up and said that we could end as friends, surely he will still care for me even if we're not dating, right? But every time I approach him he'll talk to me in a condescending manner, and I must admit that just fires me up and then he blames me for still creating fights even after we broke up. He'd then say we shouldn't be talking but he'd hit me up the second day after a fight and him saying that. It got too annoying and I ended up blocking him, I just couldn't handle too much stress.

With the whole COVID situation everything became so difficult, mainly because we broke up by phone and well, it's been well over 2 months now that we haven't seen each other. We broke up one month ago.

And now, the only way in which he can talk to me is via this class group chat, in which he will just deny my opinions or shut me down. I'm on the verge of failing a class and I'd like to have the final exam ""to go"", but he says it's too scary and blabla. I'm still angry with the way he was treating me. I want to convince the classroom to actually have final exam ""to go"" and possibly make him look bad.

243,"Hi there. I've mostly worked in a restaurant, just mostly making pizzas. I started as busser then I got moved into kitchen. I'm technically a manager but I don't really do anything manager like, just counting tills when it's needed. I love this job but I realize it's not really ideal. I live in the Midwest and make 13.50 which isn't horrible but not what I'd like to make. 

When I graduated high school I quit after working there for 2 years or so. I went to an factory just as a production line guy. Just made sure food looked good and was right temp and whatnot. I hated the paperwork that would be rotated for people. One day your on the line next you could be doing paperwork (doing checks every hour or half hour). I ended up quitting after around 8months and going back to pizza again after feeling like I was horrible at my job there. Everyone told me I was doing great but I just felt sick every shift when I had any chance of messing things up. 

I was at the pizza place again for another year, then I got someone to help me out getting a job at another factory. Amazing pay, benefits. 4 12hr days on then 4 days off. Then 4 12 nights then 4 nights off. Kinda hard to work with but I tried to stick it out. 

I ended up crying/breaking down before every shift and ended up having to quit before being fired from missing so much work. I just felt like I couldn't do it. I was an owner operator and did maintenance and repairs on machinery to make sure it went up and down nicely and I felt so brainless when doing anything. Ended up going back to pizza place again after 6 months and have been there for about a year again. And here I am now.

I feel like I am going to be working at this pizza place the rest of my life and I don't want that. I'm too scared to work a different job and feel too stupid to do it anyways.

In high school, my friends and I would talk about our issues and we would all help each other out. But after our first year at college with my closest friends going to different colleges, they all had a blast and made new friends.

I do fear change, and seeing them have fun makes me realize that they are having fun without needing me, that they don’t need me anymore to have fun. And relating to the title, they don’t come to me to talk about issues anymore. We just talk about what we did at college and stuff and how our day was. I’m struggling with so many issues that cloud my mind each day and I have no one to talk about it with mainly because I’m pushing my high school friends away from this topic of discussion because I believe they don’t need someone dragging them down from their happiness.

252,"Hey everyone! My (28f) wife (28f) have decided to move from an East Coast state to a Midwest state (the Midwest being where we’re originally from) about 2 years ago. We signed a 2-year-lease for our current apartment after our decision, which is up 08/31/2020. However, we are concerned about a particular virus’s impact on our ability to move. I need advice from a non-biased party.

Background information: My wife is a nurse (RN specifically) and will likely have no trouble finding a job no matter what. My profession is a slightly different story, though. I’m a substance abuse counselor, and my current company is losing around $1million/monthly because people are afraid to attend treatment under the scope of this virus. I’m concerned about my ability to find a job regarding when we decide to move. The state we are trying to move to is NOT the state we are from, though it is very close. We have considered the possibility of moving back to our home state for a SHORT (neither of us really wants to live there) period of time until we can find jobs in the state we intend to move to. Because of my upbringing, living in our home state for an extended period of time may prove quite detrimental for me.

I believe that it is more beneficial to ask to extend our lease for 6 months (until 02/28/2021) due to the projections that said virus may see improvements over the summer and have a serious uptick in the fall and winter. I’m concerned that I will be unable to find a job that pays more than minimum wage due to companies looking at the projections and feeling that it’s not worth it to hire new employees when clients in my field may be expected to decrease. I feel that if we move when our lease is up, we will have to go back to our home state and stay with family for a longer period of time until my industry feels more confident in hiring more professionals.

My wife believes that moving at the end of August will have no difference, or that we may be able to find jobs in our desired fields sooner, due to the fact that the end of August is still summer, when there’s expected to be a downtrend if cases of the virus. She doesn’t think companies will look at projections, and that we may be considering life with this virus on-and-off for several years, and waiting 6 months is, essentially, an indefinite extension of moving to the state we really want to live in.

Obviously, I feel more strongly about waiting until the end of February, but I’m open to suggestions. Does anyone have any good evidence/links/advice about which way is going to be less detrimental to proceed? 

TIA.",16May2020,1
253,"Hi, F(19) redittor here, and my parents recently got divorced. I wish I could say the divorce was due to just falling out of love and arguments, but I sadly found out some pretty horrible things about my dad. My mom heavily bases her decisions on her children, and she seemed really upset when she told my sister they were having issues and my sister cried (sister is 25).

I have kept myself from expressing emotions that relate to sadness in front of her, bc I didn’t want to sway her decision about whether or not she should stay with my dad (I know it isn’t healthy to keep things in but I had very good suspicion that if both my sister and I seemed sad she would have stayed with my dad, which is not what I wanted). 

How does one deal with her family falling a part? I know this happens and effects many people, but that still doesn’t make it sad for me. It’s going to be a rough summer in a way bc I have to live with my dad and my sister isn’t being very supportive, so I can’t turn to her for any support, even though we are going through the same thing. 

I just want to deal with this in a healthy way bc I don’t want this to negatively effect how I have relationships with people in the future. Things can’t get better with my dad bc he doesn’t know I know these things about him, and now I know he never wanted my sister or I to know about them in the first place.

255,"I had a falling out with my parents that, to be honest, was decades in the making.  There was a lot of emotional abuse involved, inflicted by my mother.  And my father?  Well, for my entire childhood it always seemed like he hated the sight of me.  He’d do things with my older brother and I was always left with my mom.  The first words I remember her saying to me were, “You were a mistake.”  It was her excuse to force to be molested by my paternal grandfather for five years.  After all, mistakes can’t stand up for themselves.

Well, as an adult, those words came back to me; those words I heard every month my entire life.  So I took a DNA test.  For the record, my dad’s family name is a very unusual name of Welsh origin.  I figured I’d match at least ONE.  So I spit into a tube, sealed up the box, and sent my DNA on its way.  I just got the results.  They’re quite....informative.  My DNA is majority IRISH instead of Welsh, and there isn’t a single person who matches with me that shares my unique last name.  Several of my mom’s relations are there, but none of his.  I’ve even gotten a little stalker-ish and matched these people on Facebook (didn’t tell them I was snooping).  No unique last names in their friends lists.  

It feels like a puzzle piece that I’m so close to placing in the finished puzzle.  But I want solid proof.  I can’t get my mom or dad to take the test, especially if my suspicions are true.  I thought about asking a cousin, but because of the feud, I’ve landed squarely in black sheep territory.  Any ideas on how I can resolve this issue, short of calling Maury?

On cycle days 11-13 i had sharp pains in my left ovary area and some cramping off and on (Could have been ovulation pains idk) 
Starting on cycle day 22 i started to have minor pregnancy symptoms, heartburn, irritably, cravings etc.
On cycle day 28 i took a POSITIVE pregnancy test 
Could you tell me who you think is most likely the father? Guy 1 or guy 2?",16May2020,1
257,"Won't discuss what I actually do for work for privacy reasons, but I work for a very small company (6 people) remotely on a 1099. I've had this job for about 2 years and it was my first ""career"" job out of college. I make an hourly rate that allows me to pay the bills with some left over to save or spend how I want (within reason). I also get a very generous bonus at the end of the year (about 7k).

However, since I'm not technically an employee (even though I basically am, since I work for this company and no one else full-time), I get no employee benefits. I pay my taxes quarterly since they're not taken out, and when 2021 comes around I will be responsible for providing my own health insurance since I will age out of my parents' plan. This is something I am especially worried about in the age of COVID for obvious reasons, but I also have several pre-existing conditions that are managed with medications. I also need dental care for a cavity, and I wear glasses. 

I recently moved to a major city (US) where health insurance is extremely expensive for one person, at least if you want full coverage. I am not in the position to leave this city at this time. My boss obviously knows where I live, and they used to live there too so they know what it's like. However, they and my coworkers are spread out in other states where the cost of living is way less. My boss even lives in a state with no income tax. There have been ups and downs with the company but I would be skeptical that they could not afford benefits for me and the 2 other full time employees, especially since the company is continuously growing (it's in a sector relatively unaffected by COVID). 

My bosses are very nice people but sometimes I wonder if my working situation is more for their benefit than for mine. I was looking for a new job before the pandemic hit, which may have been a blessing after all since I am still employed now. I don't want to leave the company if I don't have to. If I did leave my other coworkers would be extremely overloaded with work, so I do have some leverage I guess. 

Should I broach the subject of switching to a W2, and if so, how do I do that tactfully so it doesn't bite me in the ass? Or should I just tell them I'll have to leave to get health insurance and see how they respond? This negotiation stuff is totally new territory for me.

258,"This has a bit of a complicated back story and I'm not a native English speaker, so please bear with me (and if you have questions to make the situation clearer, ask away).

The names will be fake. 

A while ago, my fiancė Chris (27M) commissioned three art pieces from a friend of ours, Jessica (an absolutely fantastic artist), for my birthday. She delivered these pieces in time, and I was in awe at how wonderful her art is. I still have them on my wall! 

A year later (last year in April), I decided to commission Jessica for my niece's birthday in July.

Jessica had raised her prices by then and I decided to tip her as well, before she delivered (my bad, I know I screwed up) the art, so I payed a pretty big chunk of money for that commission. The art and her time was absolutely worth the money, but I need to point out that I had to save up my allowance to be able to afford it as I do not work.

A month after I made my order, Jessica's parent passed away. I assured her that it was okay and that she should take her time with it. I waited about eight months, and one day I went on Facebook and saw that Jessica had been posting art pieces that she had completed for the past few months.

So I reached out to her and asked her kindly how she was and whether she was willing to do my commission still. She saw my message and ignored it. Twice.

I told my boyfriend who then proceeded to message her kindly and she responded to him saying she was sorry and she would definitely get on it.

Another three months pass and she posts more art pieces she has completed so I kindly message her again and she ignores me again. I leave it for another month and then my boyfriend asks me whether I got that art yet. I told him no and that I'm considering asking for a refund because I'm struggling with medical payments as I just had a dental procedure done that drained my bank account. 

So with my permission he messaged her and asked her politely to give me my money back. She said she absolutely will. 

She then messages me and asks me for a week to return my money as she is kind of struggling right now and can't afford to give it back. I say alright because what am I supposed to do?? I can't put someone in a bad financial position. 

Well, it's been around a month now. No word from her. I understand she's struggling but so am I. I do not know what to do. I don't want to be mean but I did pay a pretty large (for me) sum of money. My niece's birthday is coming up again and I certainly cannot afford a gift this year.

262,"Throwaway for privacy. I just finished my junior year of undergrad and am looking for a summer internship. I'm studying entrepreneurship, computer science, and data analytics and have excellent grades. The quarantine is undoubtedly making this more difficult, but there are still plenty of job listings in my area and many of my friends have gotten internships. I've been applying quite adamantly since January, easily between 150-200 total applications. I've had a handful of interviews, but my only ""offer"" was from a company that wanted me to work unpaid even though the listing said $15/hr. I have a lease for the next school year for about $850/mo and I've budgeted that I need about $1100/mo to get by. It feels like summer is already going by super fast, and I have nothing in place for making it through next year. I'm not normally an anxious person but I've recently been staying up late at night filling out job applications and emailing local businesses asking for an internship. I've considered the following options but am not sure how to proceed:

* Keep looking for internships. Maybe something will open up as the quarantine lifts over the next few weeks.
* Expand my job search to any entry-level job (fast-food, grocery store, etc.). I've been a waiter and worked in a factory before. Both jobs made me extremely depressed and I'd really like to start getting experience that applies (and pays in accordance with) my skills.
* Take more student loans to cover living expenses (my current loans are at about $12k; cap is $31k). I've worked hard and made sacrifices to keep my student debt low, so financing this semester would double my debt. But if my pay is higher after graduation, this might outweigh the extra interest.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated—either on my current ideas or potential new ideas. I'm on track for my hair to fall out before barbers open up again.",16May2020,1
263,"Recently I got hired at Panda Express, and I start on May 21st, 2020. I worked at Arbys from Jan 2019 to Feb 2020.   


I'm a hard worker, a recently naturalized foreigner (South Africa), and a natural when it comes to interviews I've received 2nd in the state for interview for my GPA range ( I am afraid though that interviews may get harder as you get more ""real jobs"")   


First off, the views expressed in this post are my own. They have not been reviewed or approved by Panda or Arbys.  


Arby's left a bad taste in my mouth, and my resources felt limited. I felt trapped. I left without notice, on the onset of corona, and after countless moral and mental conflicts regarding the running of the store and the staff; I pushed through it, in hindsight even though I didn't have to, but regardless I felt I couldn't do it any other way. I haven't spoken to them since.  
I had $500 saved and $300 from my paycheck. Living with my parents helps, and I'm thankful and, at times, resentful. After I started going into my savings, I started looking for jobs again, I applied to 5 or so places and gave up after those 5 because of the pandemic and depression. Luckily a month later, panda called for an interview. I aced it, and now I'm here.  


I just read the handbook I want to applaud how upfront Panda in comparison to Arbys. I feel safer as a worker, and my heart feels warm, just seeing the word ethics in the handbook. I also feel confident knowing that I have all the forums I could need in case of an issue, but I am confused—legal terms, benefit terms, retirement terms, etc. Navigating new ""adult"" ideas and terms that I heard in the past is something I need help with, and frankly, I'm not comfortable talking to my parents about this.

265,"So I’ve been planning a backpacking trip with one of my close friends for a awhile now. I had just finished purchasing all my gear for the trip. I go to tell my friend I bought my gear and gear for us to share but that she has to get a few of her own items for herself and that I’ll help her make a list of items that she needs to get. She then goes to ignore me for few hours.


Also I had been helping her with the process of picking out her 1st gun. So after the fact she hasn’t answered for a few hours she then proceeded to msg and ask me for help with her gun again. Now when I saw this I felt disrespected. I then went ahead and decided to tell her that a no would’ve worked and that I wouldn’t mind planning out my own trip. And that by her not answering then asking me to help that it honestly just doesn’t make me want to help. She then opened the message quickly, and told me that she was busy and that she already told me she had agreed already but that it’s okay. 

Now I’m always willing to help her no matter what. But I just felt disrespected by her not answering then asking for help. A simple no, or I don’t got the money for it right now would’ve been just fine with me. But she just completely like disregarded me then comes for help then gives me some excuse. Her and I we’re planning this trip with in the next couple of weeks and that is why I decided to tell her about getting her gear. 

I’m honestly just getting the feeling she uses me is certain ways at this point. I’m constantly being there for her and try to help her but I’m starting to feel like I need to help myself as i just keep getting dragged into her drama with her ex girlfriend. It isn’t just this situation making me feel used.

267,"Hi reddit

Amid covid my wife and I have moved in with my parents for more space, and other people. We're having a good time isolating, and are observing ultra strict social distancing rules. We do click and collect, and no one goes anywhere without a mask.

My brother and his girlfriend are staying at her cottage and not leaving. They are also being ultra protective about covid and not seeing anyone and sanitizing everything they touch. 

My dad has started to feel some serious anxiety because of covid and has fallen into a depression. I've never seen him like this, it's awful to see. He is worried about getting sick and dying and my brother and I (me more self sufficient than he is) my grandma and my mom not being taken care of. He does do much for our family and we lean on him a lot. He's said that he has been having nightmares about my brother because he's not in school, doesn't have a job, and has sworn off visiting us indefinitely with his long time girlfriend.

I just want to help my dad because I know seeing my brother would make him feel better. I suggested a way for him to visit and maintain necessary social distancing guidelines of over 12ft of space but he still says no. He won't come home. He says it's because of safety reasons but also says the method I've suggested would be safe. I don't want to have to guilt trip him into coming home but I really want my dad to feel better.

How can I make my brother come home for a visit without playing the ultra guilt card?

I do think his gf is behind the resistance. She's lovely and I know she likes my family but I could see her being a germaphobe. If I make all precautions about distancing can she overcome her fear?

270,"So I’ve had my very own car for not even a week. It has gotten me to work, I got to show it to my family for the first time today. It’s been a blessing to get this car. Recently though , the light for service engine soon has come on. I went to the mechanic that gave me the car, and he said “ if the light comes back on let him know”. The light came back on that very same day. He informed me that if the light came on again, I’d have to go see him again and fix the wires no big deal right. Wrong! Tonight while driving home, I got to a red light and my engine stopped running. The battery light came on along with the light beside it. Luckily no one was behind me, the roads were clear for one the red light was not even red till I got there. Weird. But I’ve had a car that did this same thing where it would just quit running while I was at a red light or a standstill. I lost that one due to overheating. Could this possibly happen to my car that I have now. This ones only been around for 10 years. I’m so worried I’ll lose this one or not be able to have it ready for me to leave town with next weekend. This really upsets me. Has this ever happened to your car? How did you fix it? How long did it take? Did you have to get another car, cause you just avoided the engine stopping like that and caused more damage by not getting it taken care of. Please hope and pray that I can have my car fixed before I have to go out of town. And that my work week will be smooth because of having to get it fixed please!!",16May2020,1
271,"So, me and my friend have known each other since high school, about 15 years or so. We're good friends, talk almost every day, life/work/random stuff/sports, etc. 

I've always been into baseball (LA Dodgers), he just got into it a few years ago but is hardcore into it now. He had a favorite team but now roots for like 5-6 teams due to different favorite players. For example, in 2018 he was a big Indians fan, but when they lost, he pivoted to the Red Sox (his #2 or #3 team, i forget) and he took the World Series very personally rooting for the Red Sox. 

Its never fun having your favorite team lose the championship, which is what happened to me. He needled me endlessly the day the Dodgers lost the series and how it was the best day of his life that the Dodgers lost, etc, even after i said good series &amp; congrats. He apologized the next day.  However he randomly will talk about the Dodgers or certain players on the team are trash. It continued into the next season, usually on Sunday's as thats when he has free time to watch the game.  And he'll randomly rub in my face that they lost to his team, even though when he got into the sport, he began rooting for the Cincinnati Reds (he liked their uniform i think).

Sometimes its in good fun and we'll banter but sometimes its intense, annoying, and seems to border on obsessive to me. While i'm a big fan of the team &amp; sport, it doesn't rule my life like it does his. He buys multiple jerseys for example, even on a relatively low income. To each their own, but i'm just illustrating that its a huge passion.  

However, the last couple of days were a boiling point. As those who follow the NFL know, the Rams released new uniforms. I'm personally not a fan...so i sent him a text at 11 PM couple of days ago saying that i didn't like the uniforms, then sent him another text of the dodgers uniforms, talking about how i like those instead. He proceeded to text me at 5 am telling how me the dodgers were trash, and then texted me on and off for the next 12 hours about how the Dodgers are trash, Kershaw is trash, the team are trash, they lost the championship, etc. He also texted me videos of the last outs of the 2018 &amp; 2019 WS with the Dodgers losing to stick it to me how they suck. It really annoyed me because he knows i like the team and took the losses personally...i've moved on of course, but it still hurts to shove it in my face, right? So i bantered a little thinking maybe he's just kidding, i'll give the benefit of the doubt. Then he said he's annoyed when i send him dodger stuff so this is his way of showing he doesn't appreciate it and to never send him that stuff again, and he had fun doing it. Keep in mind...we trade baseball posts, pics, memes, highlights all the time with no issue before. 

I told him how he sends me intense trash talk all the time and i never complain when he trolls me, spanning back a year, but he apparently flipped off the deep end over a uniform pic. Even if it was a joke, it went too far with the videos. So i told him he's an idiot and to grow up. He just said ok and that was a couple of days ago. 

Even though he's one of my oldest and closest friends, i feel his sport obsession is a little too much. As i alluded to before, i know him and his job well, we share everything, and he spends a LOT more money than a normal person would on jerseys and sports gear. And constantly talks about it, trash talks, etc. I'll ask him to chill with friends for drinks, lunch/dinner, movies, events, etc. Usually he just wants to meet up to watch baseball at a bar. I think he might just be too into the sport. But regardless, i don't appreciate his attitude. He's also not involved in any of my other friend groups, although i try to include him from time to time in our real life meetups before, and virtual meetups now, to middling success. 

Am i justified in feeling like my friend is being unreasonable? I have no intention of texting him until he apologizes, and if he never does, i'll never text him again. That's how annoyed i am. He's not my only friend, i'm not desperate, and i don't need the negative his trash talk brings. 

TL;DR old friend trash talks me consistently about how my favorite team sucks and rubs it in my face that they lost a championship. Is it worth never talking to him again over?",16May2020,1
272,"Td;dr, A ton of things went wrong in the weeks leading up to and following our wedding, including the wedding, reception, and honeymoon themselves. How do I make up for or move on from this?
I (21F) married my husband (21M) in May of 2019. We were 20 at the time and have been together since freshman year of high school. I want to start this out by saying that we've had a wonderful relationship and a beautiful marriage and I love him more than anything. But our wedding was so beyond flawed that it makes me upset even thinking about it.
The first mistake we made was not saving up more money to make everything exactly the way we wanted it. I truly believe that if we had saved up $2-3000 more, almost double what we actually spent, and hired a few actual professionals then it wouldn't have been so much of a disaster.
The problems started about two weeks before the wedding, when my 24NB sibling and I were texting about the wedding. They asked me to remind them what day it was on. Annoying, but they were definitely not the first person to ask, so I reminded them. They then told me that they didn't realize it was so soon and they never requested the day off of work and would get fired if they missed their crucial Walmart manager training day a few cities over. I was pissed, but we were never super close, so I just brushed it off and continied on with the last minute planning.
The next problems occured about three days before the wedding. A woman from our church (we'll call her Rachel) offered to make us our wedding cake for free as a wedding cake. She has her own bakery business run out of her kitchen and had beautiful pictures on her website, so we happily accepted and were really excited to save some money. Three days before the wedding, she took pictures of the cake layers in her fridge and sent them to us, saying how they turned out bad and she was really embarassed, etc. going on and on like she was looking for sympathy? I didn't really think my cake was a big deal, so I just said it looks fine and moved on. She wanted to bring the cake to the reception venue (the backyard of another woman from our church who we'll call Mabel) the night before and put the cake in Mabel's fridge so that she wouldn't have to worry about it on the wedding day. Mabel said no as she didn't have enough space in her fridge, so Rachel decided she wanted to assemble it the night before, outside, and just leave it there overnight. Still not caring about the cake, I basically said sure whatever and decided to let her do her thing.
The day before the wedding, we needed to set up the reception venue with tents, tables and chairs, plates, decorations, etc. We figured this would take two or three hours and we booked a mani pedi appointment for six hours after we got started. Basically what happened is that the tarps for the tents we ordered were shorter than the poles and we weren't able to get them set up in any presentable way. We had to call a ""real adult"" (a grown man with children from our church) to come help us figure out a solution. We eventually decided to saw about an inch off the length of the tent poles so that the tarps would fit. We were still setting up the tents when my younger sister, maid of honor and I had to leave for our nail appointment, leaving my husband, his best man, and the ""real adult"" to continue with reception set up.
The nail appointment itself went pretty well. We got the colors we wanted and relaxed and everything turned out nice. However, during the nail appointment, Rachel was texting me about how she needed someone to transport her and her cake to the reception venue because her car wasn't big enough. What kind of woman who runs her own bakery isn't capable of transporting her own cakes? Fine, whatever. My maid of honor (we'll call her Kayla and she was the absolute mvp for my wedding) agrees to go pick up Rachel and the cake and bring them to the reception venue as soon as we're done getting it set up.
When we get back to the reception venue it's like 8 PM and the only thing that was fully finished was the tents. So we all got to work setting up tables, chairs, tablecloths, decorations, and so on. All the while Rachel is texting us complaining that it's getting late and she wants to come set up the cake so that she csn go home and spend time with her husband. Knowing how late it is and not wanting to hear her bitch anymore, Kayla finally just tells her that she'll get up at 7 AM on the morning of my wedding to drive Rachel and the cake to the venue just to shut her up and take some stress off of me. 
Mabel had previously told us not to worry about banquet tables for the food or cake, insisting that she had some tables we could use. So we only rented tables to sit at and bought tablecloths for those tables and the supposed banquet tables. Turns out she didn't have any banquet tables at all, only a small table with a leg missing that we had to balance on a bird bath. Fine, whatever. There's a place for food, that's what matters.
We get back to Kayla's house, where I was staying the night, at like 11 PM, both exhausted and ready to go to sleep. This is when I discovered that I had smudged my fresh manicure while finishing set up for the reception. Fine, whatever, it is what it is. 
Next morning I get up and Kayla and Rachel are at the reception venue FINALLY putting the cake together. Wedding is at 4:30 PM and this was at 10 AM. I later found out that she had assembled the cake in the middle of the head table and put fliers for her bakery at every place setting.When Kayla comes back, she picks me and my younger sister up and we swing by my house to pick up the marriage certificate since my husband forgot it, then we head to the ceremony site, my church. I've managed to shake off all the hiccups and am still in a good mood. We get everyone into their dresses and get hair and make up done for Kayla and my other bridesmaid, as well as my flower girl and mother-in-law. We got a few good pictures from my younger sister, who at the time was an aspiring photographer (still in high school) and we paid her $50 to take pictures for us. 
I asked my parents and other essential people to show up at 3 PM since not everyone was available for the rehearsal we had a few days prior and we needed to run it one or two more times. 3 PM rolls around and it seems everyone who should be here is here except for my parents. I didn't want to worry about it, so I just assumed they were running late as per usual and would at least be there on time for the ceremony. I was wrong. My parents showed up 15 minutes late to the ceremony and an hour and 45 minutes later than when I told them to be there. Their lateness delayed our ceremony and made my husband really anxious. My mother wanted to livestream the wedding for the out-of-state family members who couldn't make it and I was totally fine with that, but because of how late they were, she wasn't able to set that up and I now have no video of my ceremony because of it.
The ceremony itself was beautiful and I have absolutely no complaints about how it went down, which I think is the only thing that keeps me from breaking down and crying when I think about the wedding. We have a few beautiful pictures from various people's cell phones and I am SO thankful for that because my sister's formally set up pictures, with an actual camera she borrowed from her school's photography class, were mostly really bad with red eye and bad lighting and such and apparently she doesn't know how to edit photos because she just gave us the raw originals. 
My husband and I made our rounds at the church and got some of those pictures taken and then headed to the reception site about 5 minutes away. A few people were already there, but we were some of the first to arrive. We got the ""DJ"" (the best man with some good music and a decent speaker) set up and he started playing music. People started trickling in and finding their seats. My sister-in-law decided that she didn't want to sit her son at the kids table and instead messed up the entire seating chart, including my little sister's seat which was taken by Mabel. She was so upset that she had a meltdown and had to go sit in the car, so we got very few pictures of the reception. My husband had to go calm her down.
We paid Mabel to do our catering and she gave us a discounted ""friends and family"" rate at $10 per person. We had high expectations because she had catered several really large church events I had been to and I had never been disappointed. We asked for fettucine noodles with alfredo sauce and red sauce, chicken and meat balls, and a salad bar with some fruit options. We decided on the menu and seperation of food components because of a few family allergies we needed to work around. When Mabel brought out the food, NONE of what was asked for was on the table. She made swedish meat balls, a terrible broccoli salad, a fruit salad with cool whip, and some basic dinner rolls with butter. I was really looking forward to my fettucine alfredo and was extremely disappointed. Two of my husband's family members couldn't eat ANY of the food because of their allergies and had long drives ahead of them to get home. There was not enough food for every guest.
One car full of people, including Rachel, my great aunt and my grandma, were an hour late to the reception because they got hopelessly lost and were meant to follow my grandpa to the venue, but he took off without them. We were about to say screw it and cut the cake, but Rachel flipped out about wanting to be there for the cake cutting because it was her cake. Kayla talked on the phone with her for a solid 15 minutes trying to calm her down and get that missing car of people to the reception. I should mention that the cake was lopsided and leaning this entire time. We were afraid that it was going to fall over it we didn't start serving it soon. But we waited regardless trying to make people happy. When they finally showed up, my great aunt loudly and disruptively yelled at my grandpa about leaving them in the dust and again my husband had to intervene to difuse the situation.
There was no microphone and no speeches at the reception, even though there were a couple speeches planned. People started wanting to leave before we got our first dance in, so we had to stop people from leaving so they could see it before they took off. My mom got a video of the dance and I hate that video because of the poor quality, bad angle and red eye.
Once the guests were all gone, we got started breaking everything down because Mabel insisted it all be gone before the morning. My husband and I, as well as Kayla and the best man, broke things down and shoved things into cars until our limo showed up around 9 PM to take us to the hotel where we were going to spend three nights. Nothing fancy, but we have a more official honeymoon vacation planned for this August. We later found out that Kayla and the best man were there until midnight breaking everything down and I felt so bad for them.
When we got to the hotel, they almost didn't let us check in. We called several hotels in the area to make sure they would let 20 year olds check in and this particular hotel was the only one we got a yes from. Apparently the person on the phone was wrong and they have a 21+ check in policy. I think they took pity on us standing there in a wedding dress and a tux, so they bent the rules for us and told us not to tell anyone, but not until after a lot of anxiety, anger and back and forth.
We thought it would be all over after this, but one more thing had to go wrong. Rachel started going through our friend lists on Facebook and messaging people pictures of our cake, which included my little sister (she was 16, so a minor). She did not have permission to share pictures with my sister and she did not have permission to message our friends. She bothered a LOT of people with her messages and asking people if they wanted to buy cakes from her. Nobody wanted to buy cakes from her because the cake was lopsided and two out of the three layers didn't even taste good. We finally decided to message her detailing how we felt about her services. We got the cake for free, so we weren't expecting much, but we felt that since she runs a business she should know how negative our experience was. She responded by lashing out like a child and telling us that we shouldn't be friends anymore if that's what we think. She deleted the cake pictures and blocked us. She had previously offered to make us a first anniversary cake, so we didn't freeze any of our wedding cake and now we have no cake for our first anniversary.
At this point, I think I'm the most disappointed at the lack of good pictures to look back on, but so many things went wrong that I don't even know what to think. Is there any way to make up for this disaster of a wedding? Or should I just accept that it is what it is and move on from it?",16May2020,1

Sometimes though I get panic attacks about the most ridiculous things. As weird as it sounds, my birthday *always* does this to me. Today is my birthday, and now there is no escaping my own thoughts because of this quarantine. I've tried drawing, listening to music, playing Xbox with a couple friends but I can't shake this overwhelming feeling of dread like I'm going to die and my life is almost over. I've felt this way since about 16, every year I can't help but think ""Wow, you're x years old and you haven't done anything with your life still. You're a failure and you'll never do the things you want. By the time you have the money to do them you'll be too old"", or something along those lines. I can't stop thinking about how another year has gone by, and now Im only focusing on what went wrong this year and last year that contributed to me not being able to start college. I feel like my life is basically over, I know it isn't, but I'm so scared I'm going to be 25 and still completely lost working a dead end job in some town I hate. I feel like every year I miss so many opportunities, it's driving me insane. To top it off, I feel super lonely because I can't actually go and see anyone and my parents are constantly mad/disappointed with me since I've become an adult. I just don't know what to do, I don't want to be miserable all day, it's such a waste. I have this feeling randomly throughout the year too, but it's always worst on my birthday. Does anyone know how I can cope with this? I know it's irrational but a small part of me kinda believes it's true.",16May2020,1

(First I would like to say that I do not have insomnia according to my doctor, and I will not take sleeping pills because that is not really a fix)

I cannot do anything to relax, I mean nothing works. Books? Podcasts? Music? Meditation? No, not even close. No matter what I do, I suppose my brain just takes too much interest and starts to get invested with whatever I may be doing. I actually can meditate, and I will tell you that it is a great way to clear your mind, but not a great way to relax. I can sit for hours in meditation (I mean a really, really long while if I made time for that), but I suppose that only gives me more energy after I finish.

278,"Hey everyone I’m a 21 year old guy and I’ve been with my girlfriend since I was 15, she’s my absolute world.

My mom says that she does not want her child to sleep next to me cause I am a bad influence. Now they are planning on giving her sleep meds every night just so she can sleep but still have sex. All of this could easily be solved if they would just wait and do it another time. These meds will cause my sister to be unable to sleep without them. Does anyone know how I can start up a talk or have a way I can tell them without confrontation? I have tried mentioning it but she brushed it off and said mind my business but I deeply care for my sister's physical and mental health. Sometimes she only has a little nap every now and then. I strongly feel they dont need meds for this at her age. Any advice? Sorry, this is long just needed to give most of the story.

280,"Long story but I'll try to summarize as much as possible. Me and this girl started texting around the turn of the new year, I told her from the start that I was interested in her in a romantic sense and that I would like to get to know her better with the intention of engagement (here in an Islamic environment we're not allowed to date, it's basically engagement and then marriage). Her response at the time was ""ok we can be friends and get to know each other's personalities and if all goes well, then we take the next step together""

Months pass by and we text pretty much every single day, we went on a date/hangout (idk) but it sure felt like a date because although there was no touching or anything sexual from either side, she was asking me extremely personal questions and general questions about marriage. It sure felt like she was talking to me as a potential partner. She even asked to see a picture of my mum and dad, went to see my aunt for driving lessons and even agreed to meet my mother (before I scraped that). And the big one is she agreed to go out with me and get to know me even though she said that she doesn't go out with any male friend. After some time she says herself that I'm her type and that I would make a great partner. But then a few disagreements happen between us and she changed her opinion about me as a partner and just wants to be friends. I wanted to make it up, but then she says that all she's ever seen me was only a mere friend and totally backtracks on things she said, like now she denies saying that I was her type, and said that from the first time she spoke to me she made it clear to me that we're just friends, and says now that she doesn't want any compliments from me because we're just friends and she doesn't want to see me because she doesn't go out with male friends. I accused her of leading me on and then she got mad.


I write this while fully realizing that I'm in the wrong in many ways here, but surely I can't be the only one thinking she's a hypocrite and she simply can't admit that she strung me along all this time? If I was just a friend all this time, then why would you let me take you out (even though she said herself that she doesn't go out with any male friend), why would you give me the space to compliment and flirt with you, shower you with attention and gifts etc etc...What do you think?",16May2020,1

282," To preface the story, I (29) currently live with my friend (29) and his girlfriend (26). My friend bought a house back in ‘17 and I moved in with him upon returning from living in Colorado for a few years. After about 18 months, he began dating his current girlfriend. The relationship moved rather quickly and before I knew it, she was staying over at our house more often than not. She began staying at our house while he was at work and this is when the behaviors began. 
 When I would come into the kitchen while she was around and he was at work, she would ignore me completely. No greetings, no conversation, no acknowledgement of any kind. After awhile, I became fed up and confronted my friend about it and then confronted his girlfriend about it directly. She essentially conceded to her actions and apologized with some half-hearted explanation but things got better between us...for awhile. 
 For the past couple of months, his girlfriend has been undermining anything I say or do in a way that made me question my perception of the situation. For example- a few weeks back, I bought bratwurst to cook for all three of us and wheat brat buns. Food was done, she was preparing her food, looked at the buns and said “did you buy THESE on purpose?” Insinuating that I lacked the knowledge to know the difference between wheat and white bread. She made the condescending remark, ate her food and never thanked me. The remarks she makes are very subtle and are very dismissive to anyone else in the sense that her comments could be taken as sarcasm, while the true intentions are malicious and indicative of a covert narcissist. This is how she invokes confusion and causes me to rethink my perceptions of her as well as the conversation.  
 Today, things came to a head, once again when I was calmly trying to latch the gate on the deck and it wasn’t latching and she condescendingly said “uhhh,  you’re doing it wrong, ya gotta push the gate from the bottom for it to latch...” and repeated it 3 times until I erupted and began slamming the gate until it shut, breaking a potted plant that fell off the railing and then yelling at her that I knew how to close a gate. About an hour after, my roommate asked me if I was okay and I went off on a tangent about how she constantly belittles me and constantly undermines anything I say or do in her presence. Soon after that, I left to a different friends house who knows of the situation between the girlfriend and I, cooled off and talked everything over with him. When I came home, it was a little awkward and I really wanted to say something to her directly, but she wouldn’t even look at me in passing.

285,"So when I was 7-8 we went to my aunt’s BD party in a small town on a farm. I had 2 cousins and they were allowed to bring 1 friend each. My cousins had also built a tree house in the woods on the farm. This was the most amazing thing to me, because I lived in the city and had never seen a real tree house before. So I spent all of my time in the treehouse.
Cue dinner time, I’m eating my hot dog, somewhat sad because I had to leave the treehouse to eat when my cousin’s friend ( 12 years old) comes and asked me if I want to go to the tree house to play a game. I eagerly said yes and ran off to go to the tree house. 
So we got in the treehouse and I ask him what game we should play and he says ‘Hotdog’. I asked him how to play and he said that i had to lay down and he would massage me and then I would flip over, like a hotdog. I didn’t think anything of it and wanted to play simply because we were in a treehouse. I don’t remember much of the first few minutes but eventually he tells me to flip over and I do, so that I’m on my back, he then reached into my pants, in my underwear and started touching  my butt. I immediately bolted up got out of the treehouse as quick as I could and bolted out of the woods and across the field where everyone was eating and jumped into our family’s car and started bawling. My mom and sister (18) came to find me and I told them what happened and they immediately rounded up the family and headed home. My mom said after that she told my aunt and my aunt told the boy’s mom and she explained to him that that’s not ok.
Years later I told my best friend about it when she asked what my most embarrassing moment was. She told me it was sexual harassment ( or something like that, we were only 11) and I never thought about it like that until then, but now that’s what I label it in my head.

The day before he came over my parents asked who I was hanging out with and my mum said ""oh yeah he's nice"" but my dad said he thinks he is a man whore. I thought that was a little mean but i didnt think much more of it.

When my friend came over to hang out he asked me if my parents knew he was there (they were at work) I told him of course they knew but then he asked what my parents said about us hanging out and I said ""haha well my dad said your a man whore"" not thinking it would be that big of a deal but my friend got quite upset, despite trying not to show it. Anyway the hole time we hung out was pretty akward after that as you'd expect.

298,"My husband (38 years old) had a stroke 2 weeks ago, you can see my post history for details. He's now minimally conscious. I got to see him for the first time today for 5 hours. He didn't seem aware of what was going on most of the time, except he hugged me each time I leaned over him and ask, and for the first time he showed emotion when I prayed for him. I had to stop because he got the most anguished look on his face and stated to cry.

He's going to be admitted into a rehabilitation hospital /nursing home for a couple of months in hopes that as hus grain swelling goes down he'll be able to start talking, sitting up and maybe even walking. Once his medicaid is approved he'll be coming home so I can try and take care of him.

He's my best friend and life. We've both worked from home the past few years and spend about 20 hours a day together, and we love every minute of it. We don't have any children (I'm unable to get pregnant) so it's just been us and our dog.

Going from constant companionship.. Talking about dumb stuff for hours, Puzzles, playing video games and just cuddling and hanging out, to him not being here and not being able to see him again until visiting restrictions are lifted seems like hell on earth. He has always spent every minute making me feel loved and cared for. I know he still feels that way, but every time I have to do something he would handle, it's a reminder that he's not here and I can't stop crying. 

I would love to just end things, going peacefully in my sleep, but as long as he's still alive, I will be too.

I don't know how to make ends meet financially since I haven't worked since a week or so before this happened (when my mom had a massive stroke), thankfully I got enough from my go fund me to pay electric, but I don't know how I'll be able to pay rent next month. I will be starting work again next week, but I don't know how I'll handle that either. Everything feels so overwhelming. I don't have health insurance, so seeing a therapist isn't an option.

299,"I've known my friend (let's call her Ally) for two years now, and since I became friends with her, I joined her friend group. I never really kept in touch with her other friends, but me and Ally talk together the most. Lately, the only reason Ally has been texting me is for help. That help being that she wants advice on her sexuality. I'm straight and she's a lesbian and is now dating somebody else in our friend group (we'll call her Katie). I gave her my full support and helped her make sure if this is right for her. But ever since we spoke about that, we became super distant, and any conversation we do have, she always ghosts me suddenly. I'm always worried that I'm interrupting any conversations she could be having with Katie. I also have a feeling that she's trying to get me to say something homophobic which I'd never do because she's constantly throwing things at me reminding me that she's a lesbian. For example, on Snapchat she sent me a snap in rainbow writing, saying that she's gonna get a pride flag in her room, and every time we talk about a movie or video she always points out a female character and calls her hot. I'm accepting her for who she is, and I do not discriminate, but I feel like she's constantly bringing it up in hopes that I say something homophobic so she can hold it against me and make me look bad. I feel like I'm holding on to something that doesn't exist here, and I don't know what to do. I feel like after this whole quarantine thing is over and we go back to school we'll reconnect, but I'm not sure if our friendship will hold up until then. What do I do?

We started dating and it wasn’t intended to be super serious, but we both really liked each other. After a while, it got more and more serious and we told each other we loved each other. A week after that, we were talking about our relationship and he tells me that he can’t be with me. The reason? He’s Mormon and I’m not religious, and he says his parents would never speak to him again if they found out. He said he’s in love with me, and he really cares about me, but it’s not going to work because he thinks it won’t be able to work with someone who has different beliefs than him. 

This happened a while ago, but I’m still devastated. I never felt the way I feel about him about anyone before. I’m crying while writing this and I really don’t know what to do. We understood each other on so many levels, we really had a true connection. I really saw a future with him. He checked in on me a few times and I realized I miss him so much.

306,"For context: I recently made a new friend (who's parents are friends with my parents) and we made plans to hang out a few weeks ago. The day before however my parents asked who I was hanging out with and when I told them my dad said he thinks (my friend) is a man whore. I thought that was a bit ridiculous but didnt think anything more of it.

So when my friend came over to hang he asked if my parents knew we were hanging out and what they said when I told them and I blerted out ""well my dad said he thinks you're a man whore"" not thinking that it would upset him. Which it did, a lot. he tried not to show it, but the whole time we hung out was pretty awkward after that.

So fast forward to last night my dad sat me down and said that my friend had told his parents what I told him my dad said and now his parents were quite upset as well. In the weeks between when Ive been talking to my friend he has seemed distant like he doesnt really want to talk to me, he wont reply for hours and he'll be online but won't ever open my message, So I thought he probs doesnt like me so I stoped talking to him. But when my dad told me this I messaged him apologising but all he said was that he wasnt upset...

My dad ended up going around to their house and apologising to him and his parents but he still hasn't tried talking to me.

Im angry with myself for not thinking how hearing that could have made him feel and Im angry that I didnt just keep my stupid mouth shut.

I dont know what to say now to talk to him, I want to hang out again because hes a really good dude but I feel like this has messed up our chances at a friendship beyond repair.

I (M16) don't really have friends, I just know a lot of people. I don't know if it's my fault or not, which it probably is but the thought really just hit me.

I mean I see everyone with tight friend groups, and group chats and having people they can talk to openly as friends, and I'm not even bitter at the fact that I'm left out but my question is, 

Why

I mean, I don't see any glaring issues with me, I would never hurt anyone for the world ir vetray anyone's trust, I have always been the nice guy that everyone thinks is caring and trustworthy, and people always tell me I'm a great guy and all, still am pretty much left in the dust. So it just leaves me confused when people who can be assholes can have so many friends that actually care about them, but somone who is kind and cares for others can be left in the dust.

(This is irrelevant info actually, just trying to find out a reason *why*, sorry) I mean I don't think the issue is with appearances either because I am.a 6'2 vasity athlete and relatively good looking.

Also, I really hit it off with people in person, and everything goes great and all, but when the day comes to an end, no one ever reaches out to be a friend.

310,"Me and my brother are trauma victims. 4 years ago our mom and sister (lived with our mom, sister and stepdad at the time) began to rapidly decline mentally due to heavy drug use and our sisters BPD diagnosis. We moved in with our Dad and he was emotionally and verbally abusive. We moved back home and our family hadn't improved. Our stepdad, the only sane person in our home, had moved out. We lived in a basement and only left to eat or use the bathroom for fear of getting yelled at for almost a year.

That whole sequence took 4 years. Last month I decided enough was enough. I moved me and my brother into a studio apartment, but old experiences have hit us hard and we just keep fighting. He has trouble getting things done because of his anxiety and I just want him to be productive because I can't handle holding his hand. He says that I'm controlling and I don't know if I disagree with him. We're both bipolar, both high functioning autistics, both adhd, both just fucking tired.

I just want us to be happy. I'm at my wit's end and I really just want to stop fighting with him. There's fault on both sides and I just don't know how to navigate it mentally.

313,"Tried to keep this short but it got kind of lengthy, my apologies.

 I (30f) had a huge fight with a guy (31m) I had just recently started dating. Things went too fast too soon emotionally, meaning we showed each other our bad sides too quickly. Basically, he would shut down after I did something he didn’t like, and when I picked up on it I asked him what was bothering him, he’d give me vague answers like the coronavirus or he would just be silent. I have ADD and emotion regulation is something I struggle with a lot, just recently found out it’s tied to it. So I yell a lot when I get upset, I know it’s not right or healthy but if I get upset I can’t help it. 

I kept badgering him and asking him what I did wrong, and he eventually said something about me rejecting him for sex. This happened twice, he would immediately try to fool around with me the second he walked in the door (this was after we had already had sex on other occasions) and all I was trying to do was slow things down so I could get on his level. I really wasn’t in the mood but I didn’t flat out reject him, and the second time this happened I was trying to not fight with him and just go along with whatever he wanted. This resulted in a fight with me crying and him saying he should just leave and then me crying more and begging him not to leave. He ended up staying but was cold to me the whole night, I had to pause the movie and ask him why he was acting like this to me, more crying and yelling. I tried to initiate sex at night and in the morning, both times he would lock his arms like he wasn’t into it and then when he did he would be really aggressive with me, so of course that made me upset, resulting in more fighting. I acted so childish, threatening if he left I’d never speak to him again, yelling at him when he wouldn’t hug me goodbye, then refusing it when he angrily stormed up the stairs to hug me. He kept saying he needed space and I knew I wasn’t allowing him to have any but I couldn’t control my emotions. I really never act like this, when I told my friend what happened she said she was shocked because it didn’t sound like me. He slammed the door in my face saying he’d call when he got home, but he ended up blocking me, it’s been three weeks.

We’ve been good friends for a few years but only just started dating recently. He’s told me he has depression issues that are very apparent (I don’t know a lot about it, I’m pretty sure I have issues with it too) but he hasn’t gotten help for it, and he’s mentioned that he has had suicidal thoughts. He’s also told me in past relationships he just pushes people away.

 I am just so distraught over everything that happened. Even if he’s not “into” me romantically, I thought he respected me and genuinely cared about me and our friendship. I feel so hurt and angry, his behavior was so toxic and I’m not 21 anymore, I don’t put up with things like this anymore. If anyone tries to force me to do something I don’t like or treat me with disrespect at all I kick them out immediately. I don’t know why I tried to force a resolution in all of this. It just didnt feel right, I’m still confused. But I know that he’s suffering a lot with depression, and I’m worried that he’s going to do something to himself. I have no way of finding out, I’ve never met his family and he blocked me on everything.

How do you get over someone hurting you this much, when maybe something else was actually the cause of it? Let’s say it’s not his fault and something else was actually bothering him but he took it out on me. But the pain is still real. All I want is an apology and an explanation, just something that he shows he has remorse, idk. I just need closure. Time heals all, and I just need to forget about him and move on, but it’s hurting me so much right now.",16May2020,1
314,"Me (16M) and my sister (19F) live at home with our parents, though my sister is in college with a dorm, so if she's there she gets to be in her own space, away from my mom (50) and my dad (51). We're all immigrants from Europe to the US. Due to current circumstances, she's been living at home since this whole thing escalated about 3-4 months ago.

My parents are not abusive in any way, but we feel like they treat us like we're still children. One of the main problems is that they often times crack jokes and expect us to cheer up if we're in a bad mood. In my experience, that has never worked, since they always make the same jokes over and over again. My dad often does some cross eyed faces, or looks slightly above my eyeline to try to get me to laugh, but he's done that so many times that there is no conceivable way I'd ever laugh. It feels like they just can't read our mood, and that makes me feel very annoyed at them. I've never been angry at them, but I don't want to confront them on the fact that I get annoyed, since that would guilt-trip me into oblivion. 

My mom also does similar things, except she shows me Facebook memes that I don't find funny. This is a little smaller of an issue for me, but my sister is much more passionate about this. The problem that I have with this whole thing is that my parents clearly aren't doing anything wrong, but it bothers the hell out of the both of us that we're not being treated right for who we are.

Both of our parents don't seem to take interest in what we do either. They don't know who my favorite musician is, and even if I told them, they would forget in a week. We've had to explain the same things over and over again because they keep forgetting. An example of this is that they still don't know how high school exams work in America, even though they've heard us explain it every single year. 

Another thing is that my dad ironically enough places his interests on us. Me and my sister would never extensively talk about a subject we're interested in unless we're asked to explain it. My dad is a musician in a small band, and he constantly talks about it to us at dinner. We're all open to listen to whatever he's talking about. If we go downstairs to get some food while he's playing video games for an example, he'll subtly try to get us to look at what he's doing by exclaiming some crap when he gets a kill in the game he's playing. I've always tried to ignore it, but it still bothers me. Despite the fact that I almost always ignore it, he never takes the hint that I don't want to watch him play his games. We have nothing against his interests, but he constantly reminds us of what he likes, but proceeds to never ask about what we like to do in our free time.

We feel like they don't self-reflect at all to try to see how to get better with us as people. It always feels like they're trying to entertain a couple of babies with the way they act around us. These are all tiny details that piled up over time, and we're not very confrontational people. What do we do here?",16May2020,1

I have been flirting with a friend and I explained I wanted a one night stand.  Which I do want to do, and it would help me not wanna go crying back to my ex. Well, Tonight this friend says he wants to hook up but it has to be now, I just got out of the shower, I was in baby Yoda shirt, and not in the mood for sex, and I said what about tomorrow? because the way we flirted it was like we could be just kinda hook up when we wanted, but if he said it wasn't tonight, it would never happen and he kept being like ""whatever, have a nice life"" and I was like why can we have some wine, shoot the shit, and then do it ) (lol)  but it had to be tonight, and I've been so stressed about moving to NYC, and I've been having anxiety shakes and I felt like I couldn't do it, I wanted too, but I was scared and I turned him down and now I feel like a loser.

319,"I dated my ex boyfriend all 4 years of high school. He was my first everything and we were in love. At the end of our senior year we broke up. Long story short, he was going into the marines and I was going to college and we knew it wasn't going to work out, we were young and parted ways. We have always stayed in touch (lightly), on birthdays and holidays just a text catching up. It has been 11 years and we have both moved on with our lives. I have a long time boyfriend who I am crazy in love with and he has been married, has a child, and got divorced a few years ago and is living back in our home city.

I have been best friends with my best friend for 25 years (I was 4 and she was 3). She went into a different branch of the military after she graduated high school, got married, has a kid, and is now divorced. She is also back home. I am very close to her son and we have always had a really good and fun friendship. 

About a month ago, she texted me to let me know that her and my ex were just friends nothing more and that he had been helping her with some school work and giving her advice and that she just wanted to let me know. I told her that I am fine with them being friends because him and I have been friendly for all this time. She assured me it was just a friendship. 
2 weeks pass and I get another text from her saying that things might be turning into something more between them and that she just wanted to let me know. Not asking how I felt at all. I didnt message back right away so I could process how I actually felt and I told her the next day that I wouldn't be comfortable with it. (It wouldn't be possible to go on double dates, to comfortably hang out with them, or to have to explain that to my family or hers). 

All she said was that she understands where I am coming from. I am just looking for other people's opinions on this. I honestly feel betrayed that she would even think it would be okay. I get that they have a lot in common with being in the military and I don't care if they are friends. I just cant seen to get past the idea of them even being together. I really want to be mature because it has been so long since him and I were together but, we were together for a long time and I dont think it's right. 

Opinions? Was I wrong for telling her how I actually felt about it? We generally talk every day but since then she barely texts.",16May2020,1
320,"So yeah, this entire year I've (19F, senior) been taking an AP European class. And I'm about to fail it. This year was not a good one for me, that's for sure. Basically, I got told I had to take some sort of advanced class, preferably two, in school to satisfy my parents because they felt like I was not putting forty effort in school.
Last year I had a horrible teacher who taught the only other subject that I was willing to take advanced classes for, English. And she taught ALL the advanced English courses available at my school. So I settled on taking A college credit course, even though I was not planning on college. 
It was a very rough year for me and my household. I think I have reached my lowest low. My parents were constantly fighting, there was talk of divorce, my mom started self-harming, my health reached it's worst, an animal of mine might have been dying, my friend had more health issues than I want to count, and the list goes on, all before we had reached 2020. Needless to say my mind was anywhere but school. I couldn't focus anywhere. Most classes were easy, and didn't require too much brainpower other than my AP class. And my grade suffered. 
Before my school went into quarantine, I had talked with my guidance counselor, during midterm of our third quarter, about an extra class to make up my social studies credit and got told that I would have to wait and see. In quarantine, I cannot log into the website the teacher has ALL of the work on for AP European in. Sat unfixed for about four weeks. I get an email saying that I don't need an extra class, and I just need to pass the quarter with a higher grade.
Well, I'm trying to catch up but there's still a lot of work that I have not been told about, as well as other classes and other factors like work, doing chores we don't normally do, and other distracting factors o can't help, I'm failing at the lowest grade I have been all year.

I wasn't comfortable with it at all, and I didn't oblige to R's request, out of respect for L's privacy, and for my own sanity. R kept making comments about it, and it was kinda gross. 

If i wear clothes that is anything besides a baggy t shirt that covers my entire body, R has a sleazy comment about it. 

he also has this nickname for me that i dont feel comfortable repeating here. I've asked him very seriously on multiple occasions to stop referring to me as that name and he just laughs. he goes so far as to comment it under my social medias. (i delete his comments every time). 

Not a lot of people like R, and i've heard some shit about him, but i didnt believe it because when i first met him, he seemed super sweet. now i understand. I'm not interested in him at all, and i never have been. 

i also currently am in a relationship, but my bf doesn't know what to do. He wants to say something to R, but i feel weird about having people stick up for me, and i don't know if im overreacting. i also dont know if it's a joke or not. everybody ive spoken to about R has been like ""yep that's just R for ya."". so i don't know if i should just ignore him and leave it, or if i should confront him. 

this kid clearly doesn't take no for an answer from me, so should i allow my bf to say something? what should i say? i've never been in a situation like this, and i also feel odd because we're friends kinda. (not sure how much i consider R a friend anymore thought honestly). sorry if im rambling, or if this doesn't make sense, i'm just not sure what the right course of action is here.",16May2020,1

334,"I was giving something to my brother and when he grabbed it from me he accidentally brushed my nipple. I wear no bra at home and I know he felt it but he didn’t say sorry or anything. I was immediately uncomfortable and angry especially because he didn’t say sorry and I am very sensitive when it comes to situations like that so I went back to my room and was angry and cried.

One part of me is like it was an accident he didn’t mean to do that so let it go stop thinking of him negatively but another part of me is so angry that he didn’t say sorry about it, just acted like it didn’t happen because maybe he felt awkward to acknowledge it. It scares me because what if this ever happens to another girl he’s around and if he accidentally were to touch them somewhere he wouldn’t say sorry to them? That girl would feel violated? I feel like it’s best to say sorry to someone when you touch a part of them by mistake like a private part. It’s common courtesy especially being that I’m a girl. Another time he tried to be nice by putting my watch on for me but my arm was close to my chest and he was standing way too close and accidentally touched the side of my boob when he was putting my watch on. I feel like he doesn’t realize these things like boundaries of when he’s standing too close to someone or doing the wrong thing.

When he brushed my nipple by mistake I wanted to be like “you’re not gonna say sorry? you say sorry if you ever touch someone by accident” but i didn’t because it was so awkward and i was angry and felt violated. Am I overthinking or is this something to feel bad about? He genuinely doesn’t have bad intentions and isn’t a creep because he doesn’t do this on purpose I just think he’s bad with boundaries and doesn’t know better. He wouldn’t touch a girl on purpose but I’m scared for if a girl were to ever feel uncomfortable in that situation like I did.

I feel bad because I feel like i’m overreacting because I’ve never seen him be inappropriate to anyone and never get a creep vibe from him. I guess I feel this way because one time we were drunk and he got too touchy like kept hugging me and was standing too close to me, I feel like it was because he wanted brother-sister emotional connection when we were partying drunk together but he just didn’t understand the boundary of how you’re supposed to give every single woman physical space. I don’t wanna make him out to be a bad person in my mind over something that he didn’t mean to do. Because of this I don’t like to hug him anymore and I wish I can tell him “please be more attentive around women” but I don’t want to make it a big deal if it’s not. Am I overreacting for looking at him this way or feeling this way? He’s older than me and i’m 22.",16May2020,1
335,"I have already been accepted into my top choice university and I'm just about to sign up for classes through online sessions. However, money has been on my mind, so I'm delaying the process.

Background: no matter where I go, I will always pay out-of-state since my family has no established residency in the states. My dad is in the military and intends to establish residency in his home country when he retires. The cost of going to this uni would be around $50k a year and I don't have scholarships or enough aid to even cover half of that. My original plan was to live with my cousin for a year and then switch my residency status to become in-state. However, obviously I'll still need to pay off that one $50k no matter what.

How else can I tackle this situation?

My plan b (which I'm starting to lean more towards to) is to go to a local CC, establish my own residency, and then apply as a transfer student. The only reason why I'm hesitating is because I *really* want to go to my top choice, and I'm not sure if they will accept me again. It's the best in the state, it has a beautifully diverse community that has other Pacific Islanders, specially where I am from, and wonderful internships and plenty of work opportunities after graduation.

If I apply as a transfer, will it be harder for them to accept me again? Will it look bad? Any advice will seriously help. Thank you.",16May2020,1

It’s like I fast forwarded into the part where I was preparing to go to school before I did the part where I decided if it was the best choice. I would be going for studio art. Why? Because it’s the one thing I’m kinda good at I guess. I’m not even sure If it would get me anywhere in life. I’m not sure I’d be able to repay my loans. Everything that could go wrong pretty much did  go wrong concerning fafsa/scholarships/and deadlines. Getting my mother to fill out anything was like pulling teeth (but that’s a whole other advice post). 

Despite that the aid package covered most of the cost  but I’d have to take out about 5,000 dollars worth of loans (unsub/subbed). I’m scared. That with an arts degree I won’t be able to repay this. I know that if I wait a year and have everything in on time, the state will pay for everything if I got my papers in on time next year. 

A year is so long though. What would I even do in that time? How would I tell my family? How do I know it’s the right choice? Can I even do it this far in?",16May2020,1

She has a horrible habit of eating just about any food that's given to her while my family has a habit of giving her any meat that they have. (KFC chicken, burgers, etc.) I've asked them multiple times to stop but they think I'm uptight or being dramatic.

She is a very small dog (toy poodle) and she can't digest a lot of the things they give her. Multiple times I've had to care for her as her body rejected everything. But it seems they always have an excuse for why else she might be sick. For instance last time my sister gave her chicken and the same day she also got into the bathroom trash, she loves tearing apart tissue. No matter what I said they brushed it off as her probably accidentally injecting a used pad or something.

And now today while I was busy, they set up a bbq and gave her some. I usually keep her in my room but didn't think anything of it when my mom asked for her since it was nice outside.

340,"I’m a female, almost turning 17 and clearly confused about my sexuality. When I was younger (around 12-13) I found myself being sexually intrigued in girls. But I never really took notice of it. I’ve only ever had a real life “crush” with a distant friend (who’s also female) but it never really lasted long enough for me to be emotionally into her in any way.  

I always brushed it off, because I don’t feel as if I could have a romantic connection to another girl. Only a temporary sexual one. 
I’ve also talked to a close friend about it and she suggested I should try and “experiment” these feelings. But I’m also not comfortable doing anything sexual with a girl🤨 

I’ve talked with bi-sexual/lesbian girls worldwide online. In my form of “experimenting” so I’m not having to do anything physical with a female (as I’m not comfortable with it) but I only find myself being interested for a few hours/days. 

(I’m also not just wanting/finding a partner or something sexually active, as when I was with an ex-boyfriend for just over a year. I continued to feel this way, and wanted to still talk and “experiment” with females)

I’ve had romantic/sexual attractions to guys before and can only see myself being with a guy, but as I said. I still feel like I want one with a female some times.

351,"Hello, and thank you for reading my post and offering me this advice. 

I am anonymously posting because I want brutally true responses. 

I am a homeowner. During the installation of a swimming pool last summer, I found a European coin buried in the dirt dated 1970. So this coin is 50 years old. 

I know that I am the third owner in total of my home, and that the (now elderly) woman I purchased the house from 20 years ago, purchased it from the original owners 35 years ago. So from 1970 when the house was built, until 1985, the original family called this their home. 

I don’t know how likely it is to find a foreign coin buried in your backyard. 

Perhaps it was buried as a memorial of some kind?

Or perhaps it was lost and I should return it to the original owner’s family?

Through doing research I discovered publically available names, and addresses, and that the daughter of the original owner (who sadly has since passed), is a semi-public figure. 

So this is my question? Should I put the coin back in the ground and let things be? Because maybe I disturbed it somehow. 

Or should I write a letter and send it to the pubically available mailing address of the original’ homeowners only child? (I don’t want to stalk anybody but if they are in the white pages, does that make it okay to write a letter out of the blue to a stranger)? 

I don’t know what I should do. What I wanted to do was write a thoughtful letter and send it off to this stranger whose family I think it may have once belonged to.

I also think perhaps I should stop thinking about it and just let it be, and perhaps rebury it where it was found in a respectful ceremony of sorts. 

Edit: no the coin is not valuable. It’s the equivalent of a  US dollar in face value. There’s no reason a Swiss franc should be in my rural backyard. It was minted in 1970 therefore it had to have been in the possession of someone after 1970, thus my hunch it belonged to the original homeowner when the house was purchased after build in 1970.",16May2020,1

354,"Okay So i just want to start off by saying english is not my fisrt language, im from El Salvador in Central America. and i never posted never on any subreddit i literaly just typed in advise and this one popped up so here i go.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently broke up with the girlfriend of one year, on the surface o at least on social media if you saw us we were the dream couple, y was always nice to her, loyal, i spoiled her and gaver her my all because i really tought she was an amazing strong women, and i really wasn´t a good strong men at least thats the image i had of me.

I met her and all of the sudden i wanted to even better on college, and i wanted to get a job to start saving for our future, and she was on the same page. if anything she was way more into the idea of building a life together than me. but with to months into our relationship we had a fight wich wass the worst fight i experienced in my life, i was never used to shouting or getting slapped by my so.

and that turned the tide of the whole relationship, it started becoming toxic. She was more insecure everyday even tho i did everything to make her fel secure, and loved. and not only that she started demanding more of my time, and more of me. she wanted to be everything in my life, and i would have loved that but all the time we spent toghether was wasted in fights. everything was awful, and her family was een worse, her mom was a proud, rude and no filtered karen, i never had any problem with any ""in laws"" never but she was always intervening in the relationship, blaming their in house issues and fights on me. when i was never one to even say anything about her family. 

okay, this is messy ill take a pause. its just that everything seems like a blur in my mind. so after 11 months of relationshit let me explan to you my general feeling and overview on my life:

I prayed every day for her to die, or for her to cheat on me and find a good man that treats her right like i did, or anything to make her go away from me. because she destroyed my life i had no one left, I wasnt going to my band rehearsals because she did not like them, and they had been my friend for over 10 years, i could´nt speak or tell her about anything that involved a woman because she would get weird and when i asked her whats happening she said things like "" nothing, at the end of the day we all know you´ll end up cheating on me so im ready for it i wont phase me"" (EVEN THO I WAS ALWAYS LOYAL TO HER AND SHOWER HER OFF ON MY SOCIAL MEDIA,  LITERALLY HAD MORE PICTURES OF HER IN IG THAN MINE).

or time to be toghether was on the weekends (even tho we spent almost each day of teh week toghether) but on the weekends she had made and schedule we would spent from 2pm to 11:30pm together on saturdays and from 10:00am to 10:00pm on sundays. if i said i was tired she would say i did not give a fuck about her so iwas forced to spent all that time with her going out, because she did not like being at my house and we couldn´t be at hers. and let me remind you im in college and have a 6:00am to 3:00pm work on weekdays and went to classes tuesday and thursdays at night. i was spent i couldnt catch a break, i couldnt breathe! and i couldnt do anything i enjoyed because i was forced to spent my weekends fighting with her. we tried and i let her know multiple times how i felt and i also tried leaving her multiple times but she begged an covinced me. but now i told her its over for real and did not let her convince me, i blocked on everything so she can´t reach me even by phone call, but i know that if she could she would keep begging, i know i meant to world to her and at a point she did to me aswell, but y hate my life when i was with her, and i normally feel guilty not because i miss her but because i know shes broken, and i know she is crying, and she is alone, i fear for her future i want her to be well, but i just cannot keep her in my life. i cry something well cry a lor because it eats me alive that she is suffering, and going through it alone. should i try to reach her? should i just keep my distance? im 22 am i dumb to let a 1 year relationship go? even tho it was chernobyl levels of toxic- or am still too young to worry about this?  
I know i do not love her, i dont even feel attracted to her anymore, but im really worried about her, and i care about her well being. i dont know what to do. should i just let time heal this? please ask me more info or i dont know just give me advise.",16May2020,1
355,"I’m new to the AR world and I’m looking for something to just always use for hog hunting that’ll take them down in 1 shot from at most 250 yards assuming I hit them where it would. My friends family owns a farm over in Texas so he travels there every couple months to go visit family and shoot some hogs. It’s became a tradition with him and his friends to all go and they’re wanting me to come with them. I want to build an AR for this but also to use at the range as well unless the ammo is stupid pricey to just shoot all the time at the range. I am completely lost in all these products and where to start. Ideal budget would be 1500 or less. Should I just BUY a actual AR for that price or do you think I can BUILD a better AR for this price as well? This is also NOT including any sights, I just want a fully functional AR that I can customize. I’m left handed but I think having an ambi charge handle is all I need really. I’m planning to use either 308 Winchester, 458 Socom, or 6.8 spc. I do need a Fixed stock for sure so I was gonna go with the A2, and my grip I plan on smacking a fin grip to make it FEATURELESS in Cali but if theirs better ideas that’s awesome and I appreciate all input.",16May2020,1
356,"I'm 24F, FWB is 33M. We've been seeing each other on almost a weekly basis for over 2 years. Usual routine: I go over to his place, we catch up for 5-10 minutes, have sex for 1-2 hours, talk for another 20 minutes, then I leave. It is hands down the best sex of my life. It's 10/10 every time and he makes me cum at least 5 times per ""session"".
We have undeniable sexual chemistry. He's an incredible lover, not to mention sexy as hell, intelligent, and witty. I've been overweight most of my life and am still deeply insecure with my body, but whenever I'm naked with him, he kisses me everywhere and lights up when I stand in front of him. I don't overthink how my body looks (as I always have done with other lovers), and am fully relaxed.

I think I've finally acknowledged to myself I've caught the feelers. I want to tell him, but I'm afraid it'll all be for nothing and ruin this easy ""thing"" we have. I'm moving to a different state in August for school, so broaching the subject of dating would be unrealistic. I will be coming back home for breaks and do want to see him when I'm in town. I don't want me speaking up to be what ends this, but I don't want to regret not ever telling him.
We do have our differences: At 33, he's quite articulate and assured of himself, while I'm quiet and still figuring myself out. Our conversations flow smoothly and we make each other laugh--but I feel slightly inferior whenever I leave, only because I'm not as confident or well-versed as he is.

Lately, he's been texting and saying things to me in person and in bed that make me think he feels the same way: ""You're an amazing person"", ""You're so beautiful"", etc. While he has been complimentary in the past, it's never been verbalized as much until now.

Last night in bed, it felt different. I hate the phrase ""love making"", but it felt more heightened, passionate, and connected. When we were kissing/snuggling after we both finished, he immediately asked me ""What are you doing this Friday?"".
A part of me thinks that if he ever felt the same about me, the subject of dating would've come up long ago. There is the possibility we've both been afraid to broach the subject to each other. About a year ago, he said something along the lines of, ""I really should take you to dinner."" My instinctual reaction was, ""Knahhhh! It's all good.""
He told me a few days ago he's had no one else as a sexual partner in the two years we've been hooking up. We've made it a rule to tell each other if we sleep with other people for protection sake. I've had 2 other partners, which I've been honest to him about, and he's had no other. (EDIT: Failed to mention these other 2 partners were unplanned hookups and didn't even compare. I've had almost 30 in my life, and my FWB is easily the best.)

WHAT DO I DO REDDIT?

**Tl;dr: Should I tell my FWB of two years I have feelings for him before I'm about to move with the possibility it could ruin what we have, or should I keep quiet with the possibility of regret?**",16May2020,1
357,"hey guys, feeling down, advice?

So to put it short, its just me and my mum in our house here in Australia. She works most days so Im usually always at home alone, especially now cause of quarantine. Lately her words and small comments here and there start to make me sad and annoyed a lot more than it usually has. She’s been making comments like these for a long time, nothing new. Basically she always assumes im being lazy or doing the wrong thing. Example, today I spent around less than an hour in the morning playing a video game, I had time to kill before I had to get onto some homework that wasn’t even that hefty. She comes home and her first comment is “so you havent finished your work because youve been playing all day?”. As usual I deny it and say I played for only a little bit and then got on with it. This goes back and forth for a few minutes before she eventually leaves. Usually this comment wouldnt have hurt me, I would just forget about it and move on. But lately ive found it hard to. Its just been happening for so long anf so often and im kinda tired of it. Its made my mental health go down so much, and she makes me feel like a failure who cant do anything right. She always somehow manages to make almost everything my fault. Anytime I try to confront her about something wherein she is obviously wrong, it always comes around to me. Its hard to explain, but having to keep up with her and how she treats me sometimes gets a bit too much. Should I just stick it out and wait 2 years before i can legally move out? 

If youve made it this far, thank you for reading it. What should I do?

360,"A little context: In the past 4 years I’ve picked up distance running as a hobby. I do races every now and then with friends and relatives, and have even completed a few marathons. I really love what it has contributed to my life, and am excited to continue running hopefully we’ll into my 50s like my dad, who is in his mid 50s and recently completed a half marathon with me.

Recently (and in large part due to Covid-19) I have entered unprecedented phase of blazing the fuck out, a couple nights a week. I’d say I’m getting high 3 nights a week on average. And about half of the time I take edibles instead of smoke. Though lately, I’ve been smoking an increasing amount since I like the high a bit more.

364,"A part of me is writing this as release.

To start here is a little background, since I entered my mental development at around 11-13 years old I've suffered from severe depression and anxiety. I've made a lot of progress in facing fears and now lead a relatively normal life. However, I'm still haunted by lingering depression. 

I cant stop looking at the past, I mean I do it and have been doing it at every stage of my life. I just graduated high school this academic year and we are, virtually, looking back at our four years. Looking back, there is so much more I could've done. I wish I had excelled in a sport, founded more clubs, took harder class, so much more. We just recently had our senior awards and seeing everyone make such great successes only made me feel much more worse. A lot of these awards were chosen by teachers/staff, all this shows me is that I made no impact on them. 

All of this points to me being extremely negative, and I can see that. Where I have a problem is that I can't acknowledge my own success. I on paper, did a lot; I turned around and turned my 3.1 GPA to a 4.6, founded and became president of a major health club, at the start of the corona virus I organized a student body to help transition our staff into an online setting. Why can't I feel the pride in these successes, I only wish I could do more. As much as I try I can't feel any sort of pride. What am I doing wrong. I'm just so tired of feeling this way. 

I hope I don't come off as a big baby or inconsiderate, but y'all haven't even heard the best part. I don't talk to about this to anyone, I keep it bottled inside and I KNOW its unhealthy but I don't want to talk about it, in a social settings I feel it comes off as arrogant, ""wow he wishes he could be more successful."" I'm just coming on here as a platform to rant, and let loose. Not a single soul in my personal life knows I feel this way. But now you do.

 I just wish I could sit down and be happy at what I've done but instead feel unaccomplished.",16May2020,1

A few days after my rough patch ended, she told me she felt like she didn’t look after herself enough as she was helping me, and now that im okay, she realised how bad she had gotten. This is all okay, i understand it and im currently helping her to get through her own rough patch. Now for my main question, I can feel myself slowy going back into a rough patch, not as big as last time, but still rough. I dont know whether I should tell her how bad it is and possibly risk her going back into her previous state. I want to keep helping her and I am doing the best that I can.

hey, I usually wouldn’t do this but quarantine has been really fucking me over.

i’ve been struggling with schoolwork my entire life, I never saw a point in it other than to graduate. I always did the bare minimum to pass each class (like over here if you get a C or higher on an exam, you get the credit for that class) and it’s been getting me by so far, but at the cost of a low GPA. It’s just so frustrating, I can’t focus at all during classes. I constantly feel like i’m in a dream, in a way? I either feel like i’m floating while i’m standing up, or sinking when i’m sitting down. Everything feels fake. I can see and hear the teachers talking, but it’s just complete gibberish. This has caused me to just absolutely give up. 

This doesn’t happen ALL the time, 24/7, the days I feel grounded is when I can actually get work done, if i have the motivation. But when it hits, it usually hits really hard. Either it lasting for a couple hours or up to a whole week.

I’m not going to get into detail about this, but i think it’s important for context.
I was sexually assaulted (I didn’t say yes or no, i was just spaced out the whole time and let it happen. She followed me everywhere and cut herself in front of me when I wouldn’t give her attention.) on my birthday at age 12, which my family knows nothing about. I have/had to constantly deal with my dad bashing me down for the tinniest things and endure it all. I’m not enrolled in therapy or have seen anyone about this and everything else due to the expenses, but mainly I just dont want to bother. 

The thing is, I know I’m smart. I can go on and on about various topics that i’m invested in, and i’m quite opinionated. People usually come to me for advice too! I’m very artistic as well, preforming and visual arts, and quite good at it. Fuck math though.

It makes me so upset and angry because nobody seems to understand and I hate how my intelligence is based off of a letter grade. When literally the entire education system is based off of memorization instead of learning.


My question is, could I make it without going to college? could I survive off of 15 dollars per hour if I work my ass off? or just advice in general?? Do I sound like a lost cause?


I’m currently working a part-time job and I just want to move out as soon as I can. I want to be independent and alone so I can work on and focus on myself.

I will be a Financial Economics and Business Management dual degree graduate in De La Salle University, Philippines in 2023. My grades are good and I will graduate with latin honours, magna or summa cum laude at best. I plan to have a career in asset management or investment banking.

I plan to migrate to the U.S. and start a career there in the Financial Services industry after I graduate. I plan to do this by getting a job here in the Philippines first in a international company such as Mckinsey or JP Morgan because they have branches here. However my end goal has always been to be located and migrated in the U.S. and be in companies like Goldman Sachs, Blackrock and Bridgewater Associates.

I was wondering what are my odds of having a successful financial/asset management/investment banking career in the U.S. as a graduate from a non U.S. school? And do they accept graduates from the Philippines?

Do big companies like Goldman Sachs, Blackrock &amp; Bridgewater and other U.S. based financial firms accept graduates from the Philippines?

And what are the opportunities I have and don't have in the U.S. knowing my life situation?

Does my undergraduate school really matter?

Will me being a graduate in the Philippines affect my career in the U.S. in the financial industry?

Will me being a graduate in the Philippines affect my salary in the financial services industry?

And is there any advice you would like to give me regarding my desired career or any advice to expedite the process? So that I can start as early as I can.

I planned to apply for Harvard or other top notch schools in the U.S. however I have family and responsibilities here, the Philippines is a place with very little opportunity beyond its state.

P.S. this is my endeavor because I want to earn a lot of money and be affluent enough to provide for my family, and also to provide for my second family who are the street children of a particular sector in the Philippines. This is the case because I have never had money my whole life or in other words the financial power to provide and help myself and others. All I have is my intellect.

I would love to hear from an actual associate or alumni from these companies I mentioned to answer my questions.",16May2020,1

don't get me wrong, I had sex with a lot of people, my body count is 29 (males and females). but idk, the thing is I never had a SO because of my self-esteem problems, I never thought someone would like me for myself and not just for sex. it's just weird for me, how can I have a relationship if I never had one? I'm sorry if don't make any sense but I'm just shocked, I have this friend since high school, we have talked a few times since then. but suddenly we started talking in a different way like at first I was, ""well maybe he just wants to fuck"" and I was down for it! but then I started to have feelings for him and I was like ahahah what? me? and then he told me he liked me back high school! like wow! someone liked me back then? I had problems with body dysmorphia back then (and i still kinda do)

lets put it this way, the first time I had sex was because I just wanted to do it, it wasn't with love, it wasn't with someone i really liked, ever since that time I just had sex, I never have done it with love.

he makes me feel pretty, sexy, hot, and secure. i never felt like this before.

376,"Hi Reddit-

i’m 22 and have a 22 year old boyfriend who I’ve been with for about a year. I moved in with him 2.5 months ago (at the beginning of lockdown) and have been going crazy since. 

I would really appreciate advice because i am becoming toxic to my boyfriend and other roommates and don’t know what to do to fix my behavior.

For starters, I am full time (senior) in University and worked full time at a daycare. I’ll be starting work in a few weeks and have been fortunate to be paid in the meantime. I moved in mostly because I missed him, but also because i would be helping him with rent.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, wasn’t as fortunate and lost his job at a car dealership and does not do absolute shit all day. His everyday reality is: waking up, smoking weed, playing video games, and drinking before bed. Usually nothing else unless I ask or we run for errands.


This was fine for the couple weeks of him being laid off, but now he’s financially struggling and he’s becoming reliant on me to make sure he’s eating and has transportation. I almost feel like a teen mom.

in some bullet points:

- he tells me he has plans to do things and never does ( building stuff he wants to build, cleaning his broken car to sell it, cleaning his closet, cleaning the house, writing contracts, getting a car, looking for jobs....important things)


- he asked me for 14$ today so he could buy a piece for his bong. i asked why he couldn’t buy it and said he didn’t have enough money.


- claims to have applied for 80+ jobs, but hasn’t gone to a single interview. won’t take jobs seriously because he doesn’t have a car (he hasn’t in 8 months and knows i will help him out with transportation)


- has a free ride to college but will not take it because he’s dyslexic


- doesn’t take care of his house. i’ve had to drastically change living standards. clean entire home/buy basic furniture on my own accord



- had his jackass, loser friend move in and is giving him his first month of rent “free” because his friend needs “birthday money” to pay 350$ of rent. 



- his friend constantly brags infront of my boyfriend how much money he’s making from his delivery driver job.


- his friend ALSO moved in his girlfriend and their pet behind our backs. i found out due to both of them completely obliterating the bathroom. i told both my boyfriend and his friend she can’t stay more than 4 nights a week or his rent would double, and he agreed. girlfriend is here every night.


- his girlfriend used to have a crush on my boyfriend. they all hang out in his friends room to avoid me now.


- some one came into our room and stole my boyfriends Nintendo Switch (he got a “stolen” email). I’m almost positive it was his friend. 


- offers my groceries to his friend



- had 2 random foreign exchange Chinese kids move in for a week and disappear without paying. 



- he’s not taking care of himself (i.e his clothes smell awful, wears same things over and over). rarely showers. i’ve done his laundry for him 2-3 times.



I am completely over it. This is not what I signed up for moving in. I can’t stand he won’t do anything and cries if I ask him why he won’t just get a job as he’s fully capable of working. He’s taking advantage of me getting paid, and assuming I will help him out. I have been but it’s getting extremely old.

378,"On mobile, sorry for the formatting. I've been getting conflicting advice from others, so I've decided to post here. Sorry if this is all over the place!

  I've been working at this restaurant for about three years. They like to say that they're a 'family', but most of the workers are only there because of nepotism or family/friend referrals. Everything was fine until the management shifted.

My current boss has always been critical of my work, she'll constantly rearrange the seating or make comments about my work. At first, I was okay with this, as I am relatively new to arranging the seating at a restaurant. However, I always felt that I couldn't 'do' my job to the fullest. When they appointed a new manager, I would come in to see half of my work already done for me, so I began to become upset and I felt that I wasn't really working and that my work was so bad that they had to constantly do it for me. However, when I would question them about this, they would tell me that my work was stellar. I noticed that they never did this as often to other workers, though.

The atmosphere really began to change when my manager brought in a new worker. I have no ill feelings towards them, as I know this is the management's fault. They would constantly shower praise on the new person, and my other coworkers began to become distant towards me, so I felt confused. I began to see the cliquey manner of the managers, as they only really scheduled the people that they like. This led me to start to become disillusioned with working there, and I would constantly think about how much better I would feel if I quit, but the money was the only thing keeping me there. 

Recently, I have noticed that with the change in management, this favoritism has really started to show. They schedule some of us less and give the ones that they don't like the shitty hours or sections. The real advice that I need is based on recent events. Our restaurant recently reopened, and at first, it was only me and another person. However, I only had 1 day and they had 6. I felt conflicted, but I was ok with this as I knew they might be in a tough spot financially. I talked to a manager and told them that I would be unable to work on ONE day next week, but that I was available to work every other day. I believed that the schedule would be worked out and that I would have had more days. I would have been ok with 2 days. However, I looked on the schedule and they brought another worker back, and they have split the days with the original worker and the one that they brought back. I have NO days for next week.

 This has led me into a fury. This is not the first time that they have given the worker more days, and the manager has a bias towards them, constantly saying that they are her favorite and that she will pay their way through college. The worker and I are the same age but I've worked there longer, so there's no age or seniority bias there. I am worried because this is a tough time economically, but I am deeply hurt by this scheduling favoritism. I do understand that the other worker could be in a tough spot, but I feel that I could have at least gotten another day or at least an explanation of why i was getting less days. I would have gladly accepted two days a week, but to go from 1 day a week to 0 has me really hurt and confused. I texted my boss about my hours and told them that I was available to work, and while they usually reply instantly, they have not responded. I've been advised to go look for other jobs and see what happens, and I have, but I am divided on whether i should hold on to this job or wait out the storm.

Should I quit?",16May2020,1

384,"I (20) is currently on a preparatory course for uni in Germany and I’m considering dropping out. My grade is good but I can’t imagine myself studying for the next 3 or even 5 years in Germany. I’ve reached the level B2 but tbh I only understand about 30% what people said (since each German region has a different dialect...) and If I plan to graduate here, I have to be consistent with learning German. And I can’t picture me for the next 3 to 5 years only learning German and not actual scientific knowledge, plus I’ve heard that German unis have a knack for failling students in 1st years. That resulted in that many students from my countries took 5 years or more just to finish Bachelor. My neighbor is a German and it took him about 7 years to complete both Bachelor and Master.
The problem is, I’m too old for colleges in my home country in Asia.
If I drop out here and return to my country, I will have to either sit for the exam in the country to university or go to a private university that does not exactly have a good reputation since there are too many rich kids there, who did bad on the entrance exam but still got in. There’s also that problem with the entrance exam is that the form of the entrance exam form changes every year, literally EVERY year so it’s very cruesome to readapt to the exam back home and tbh the HS students back home even don‘t know exactly what they‘re supposed to learn...
I also want to do a Bachelor program in English, because after the time I learn German, I realize I cannot get far with academics here with the language German.

393,"Don't get me wrong, I know life's reaaally freaking expensive, but I just can't believe it's as expensive as my parents say it is.

Ever since I got engaged, my parents have been telling me how it's a bad idea to get married because marriage is so expensive and will send me into crippling debt. My dad got married right out of high school and immediately went into debt, then divorced his wife when she stole all of his remaining money to run off with someone else. My mom and he got married after being together for 15 years and he immediately lost his job afterward and they went into debt. They're still in debt ($30,000 due at the end of the month). So, I wonder if it's true that getting married, even at my age (20), would put me in debt. I have a stable job, my fiance and I are working on getting a house, we're already saving up what little money we have and taking care of everything financially.

They told me that if I got married, I wouldn't have any insurance. I'm currently on my parents' insurance plan through Farmers and Blue Cross/Blue Shield. My dad, despite insisting my mom deal with everything involving money, insists that I won't be able to pay for essentials like car insurance and utilities if I leave and get married now. He also says that I wouldn't be able to afford dog food if I had a dog (not a responsibility thing, I've lived with dogs all my life and know how to take care of one just fine and he recognizes that). I only earn minimum wage as a part-time employee, but next school year I'll be working full-time. 

So, my question is: is life really so expensive? My parents pay $3,000 every six months on car insurance for three cars (only one with full coverage). Is car insurance really that expensive? Would I really be paying $250+ a month? They said that if I stay with them, I'd be grandfathered in and get a better price, but that's not grandfathering means. Progressive offers $90 a month or less for my driving record, but my parents insist I shouldn't switch companies. Once I get married, I won't have BC/BS anymore, but I think that'll be for the better. I can't go to the ER with BC/BS, but I'll be with Trillium. My parents insist OHP is not nearly as good as BC/BS and that I shouldn't take government money, not even food stamps.

So, is car insurance really $250+ a month? Is electricity really $600 a month? Are utilities really $1,000+ a month? Are OHP and Trillium really that bad? And food stamps? Am I really going to go into crippling debt for marrying my fiance? I don't feel like I am, I feel like everything is set in place. About $700 a month (net) just by myself, not to mention my fiance. $90 for car insurance, trillium would be free, and food stamps. I feel like I'd be okay, especially with my fiance. I know my parents are trying to control me, but I worry that they might be right about some things... are they right?",16May2020,1

Everyday I dread the fact that I haven’t lived my childhood right or “good”. I haven’t tbh. Anyone I have befriended has beytrayed, I’ve rushed through school, and i have so many mental struggles that a lot of my life has been focused on that! I’ve never really found the time to cherish it while it lasts... soooo, what should i do before i go off to college? What should i do before my childhood is over; Cause i know i can never get it back. 

Btw I have no friends at the current time and idk what to do social wise. I might be able to join a youth group...? But besides the point I just want to enjoy this summer (C virus aside) I want to finally enjoy some damn moments and have fun but idk how to.

CONCLUSION:

So I’m going to make a bucket list for summer. What are things you wish you did over summer or as a child that you miss doing or missed out on? I will do them. And hopefully they’ll help me fulfill my wish of not wasting my childhood on bad people and poor mental health.

*He kinda insulted my Instagram post by saying ""Dressing like a prossie i see🤡🤡🤡"" which made me have a flashback to the time i got bullied and called that even though at the time I was 9 years old and also I thought it looked good fashion and looks wise because I thought it did, I didn't delete the post because of the comment and just left it there

*On his anonymous meme account he posted a meme and his caption was ""makeup is for sluts"" which I find highly offensive and I usually don't easily get offended but that's what pissed me off because I don't wear makeup for boys attention, I wear it on myself like a personalised mask for myself to feel more comfortable in public, unfortunately I didn't confront him about it

*He insults me sometimes and mostly others due to his insecurity and lack of empathy

*When he was in an argument with someone he blamed it on me when I didn't really have anything to do with it

*He Tags me in weird posts and says some shit about me

*He doesn't have an ego but I know that he is the biggest hypocrite that I've met and whenever someone points it out and tries to tell him, he always denies it and says ""I'm not a hypocrite""

*He's extremely competitive whenever we play xbox together on COD, he'll always complain about not winning or rage-quit because he isn't winning or on top of the leaderboard and complain about other people doing the things that he exactly does himself!
 
*He also made an account and I reported it to Instagram because he was pretending to be me, he had pictures of me and I don't know after 2 years and he still has Screenshots of me, I already told him to delete them because it's making me uncomfortable and yet he lies and says he has when he hasn't, the account he made was private and i tried to get accepted to see what he posted but I got declined and now I'm wondering wtf did he post to try and pretend to be me (Instagram didn't report back after reporting the account pretending to be me) 


He had done many things that made me question our friendship, time means nothing to me I've cut off an ex-best friend for being an absolute snake when I didnt do anything wrong and even if I did I would admit it but I swear down i didn't do anything bad, I hope there's someone to me what to do on this situation, it's been confusing me a lot and I'm thinking about exposing him on my Instagram story to prove people that it's actually him, I don't know why he's being like that, he's been like that for years but recently he's gotten worse and worse by the months, I have no idea if it's because of Bitchy Boris' lockdown or he's just showing more of his worst personality traits.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm normally not one for depression, but I just don't know what's come over me lately. I used to be a really gifted child, always being amongst top students, having lots of friends and hobbies and so on. Ever since I've become older, I found myself losing focus on things - work, friends, activities, myself - you name it. I've gained tons of weight because I lack the motivation to do anything about it. I'm struggling at my job because I'm a lazy piece of shit who will only do the absolute bare minimum so I can go home as soon as possible. The worst god damn thing is my room. I live in a real depression cave. Junk lies around everywhere. I look at it and say to myself ""you are going to throw that away. You'll stand up right now and throw that junk away"" and then I find myself on my phone or on YouTube for 2h. I can't get out of bed. I look outside the window and think to myself ""you have such a beautiful garden. Go out and cut the roses"" but it's the same thing as with the junk. 

I'm addicted to the internet and worst of all, I'm a compulsive online shopper without self restraint. I could be down on my last penny and I'd still order some random shit that gives me a hoop of joy the second I press ""order now"" and that I will regret the minute the package arrives at my house. But like the junk and the roses, I don't send the stuff back. I have so much stuff in my home. It keeps piling up and I can't throw it away or gift it to someone because a little voice in my head keeps telling me ""what if you'll need it next week? You've already spent the money. Don't throw it away"". I've started to order packages to post boxes so my parents don't notice just how much I order. I've moved in with them again because I just finished my degree and will (hopefully) start my masters in another town this fall, meaning that I am staying only temporary. Still, the move back home was an absolute nightmare. I didn't realize just how much stuff I've piled up in my student housing. I know they judge me for my behavior, but they restrain themselves from saying anything because I told them it was because I was so stressed out from my Bachelor's thesis. 

I'm so damn afraid I will end up as a compulsive hoarder. Like, I know I'm running into my own demise eyes wide open but I can't stop myself from doing it. 

I don't think that I have depression. There's been some shit in my life but I wouldn't consider myself depressed or overly anxious or in need of therapy. I'm just a horribly lazy slob lacking any work ethic. Please, please, please...I wan't to change that!! My parent's are at their wits end. My sister is the complete opposite - successful, healthy and has her life under control. She earns promotion after promotion, works out 3x a week and has an equally successful boyfriend. I want to be more like her. I don't need to be exactly like her, but I just want to know how I can make the first few steps into her direction. She couldn't really give me any advice on this. She's just always been like this and never really thinks about doing something. She just does it. 

Please, if you have any advice on how to get started... I'm willing to learn.

410,"So, I have this group of friends who i've been together since 3rd grade elementary. There are 5 of us and are completely inseparable. We're still communicating and calling each other even now except for our one friend, let's call her Carla. She's the kind who can't stand the idea of being single. Ever since high school the moment she breaks up with this guy, a week later she'd talking to another guy who she claims as her ""friend"" then tells us 2 weeks later that they're together. Yes, she's incredibly attractive.

3 years ago, Carla got married to her boyfriend who lives in the US. We were very happy for her because the guy was super nice and absolutely cares for her. 6 months into the marriage, she called saying that they were going to get a divorce and that she's coming home. She said, her now ex-husband hasn't been taking care of her properly. He always work and gets angry whenever she couldn't do the household chores ""properly"". 4 months after Carla arrived home, we found out that she's been talking to her guy ""friend"" online who also lived in the US, let's call him Dave. We sat her down and asked her if she likes Dave and if they're gonna start dating. She said no and does not want to get married again. Next month, she went to the states for ""work"" and when she arrived 2 months later, she said that her and Dave are officially dating. We were obviously against this seeing that she just recently got divorced. She told us not to worry about her and she knows what she's doing. For 2 years she's been going to and fro to the US to visit him. All her money is spent on travelling expenses. She would stay in the US for 3 months, come back home then stay only for a month or less before going back. Every time she's here, she would have so much anxiety about Dave. Saying what if he doesn't love her anymore or they couldn't communicate properly because they're in 2 different countries and would always get inti fights. Last year Dave, bought a house ""for them"".  When she told us this we immediately asked her if they have plans on getting married and she once again denied it. Months before we found out that Dave quit his job to focus on his hobby and that she's been paying rent for the both of them. So we were immediately against this but once again she said not to worry about her. Last week, while she was in the US visiting her boyfriend they got married. We found out via twitter from her sister who told us because none of us have twitter except for her. 

Today, she told us that they got married and are now planning their big church wedding (no date yet because of the circumstances). She wants us to be her bridesmaids and is now telling us to save money because the wedding will be in the US. Now, none of us have replied to her yet. We're all incredibly angry and saving money and getting a US visa seems like too much trouble for a stranger we never met (yes, we haven't even talked to Dave).

415,"So my brother 15M has been doing school work from home for the past 2 months and he's found it very difficult. He can spend around 15-20 minutes doing his school work before he shuts down, making mistakes he wouldnt normally make, he goes really quiet, starts to shed tears and writes really messy. He says he can't do it anymore, then spends an hour relaxing. This problem has gotten worse over lockdown as the work has gotten harder.

He's been diagnosed with dyslexia, mum thought he had it when he was 4 and pressured the school into testing him for it for years, eventually he got tested and she was right.

From a quick Google search (very scientific I know) I've seen he has quite a few of the other symptoms of ADHD. My parents will obviously be going to get him tested for it soon. Tomorrow is his last day of school at home before school goes back in my country.

Does anyone have any advice on how to help him with his school work?",16May2020,1
416,"Hi Reddit, I was wondering if you could offer some other options I can try to get through my friend. Here's the context:

My friend Jamie (not real name) is one of those persons that can't seem to get a break in life, the long list of mishappenings include:

* Falling for the wrong person (several times)
* Discrimination in school (all the way through college)
* Unwanted pregnancy (extra messed up fights with partner)
* Early family deaths
* Etc, etc

This has understandably affected Jamie in many ways, and their survival instincts activated in a way that I personally feel is not the best option... Jamie has decided to simply hold everything in, and just ""keep pushing"" no matter what. They have convinced themselves that it's ok to be miserable and that's the only way they can get ""happy moments"" (getting drunk every chance they get).

Now, I've lived enough and listened to enough people to know that, the more you keep your feelings in, the bigger the reaction will be when they finally come out, and that usually, the thing you're focusing on not to show is the one that manifests more if you have a meltdown (for example, if you don't talk about you're feelings you end up yelling like crazy, or if you're trying to avoid eye contact you cry like there's no tomorrow, stuff like that)... And Jamie is putting all that energy on their body, if you could feel how tense that body is, you'll be amazed, their body feels like it was made out of rulers, just straight lines of tension everywhere.

It worries me that Jamie may be reaching the tipping point and if all that tension is going to release out of control they might do something really stupid, and not even to themselves. Jamie is a really strong person and could easily harm someone if they blackout. I've tried different approaches with them:

*  I've tried convincing them that they need to let those feelings out instead of carrying them around, even if it wasn't to me. They said that wasn't a good idea because ""full depressed"" Jamie wasn't fun, I told them they didn't need to be fun or good, they just needed to be real, it didn't work.
* I've reminded them of all the people around them and what we can offer, and how willing we are to carry them around while they recover. Jamie acknowledged our presence but insisted on the ""big difference"" in our situations and how that difference makes it impossible for them to reach us
* I've reminded them of all the obstacles they've overcome and listed the things I knew about them that made them valuable. They rejected all of them.
* I've asked the hard questions when the conversation started going in circles. Jaime got mad (stopped talking to me for like a month)

So as you can see, none of that has worked, and I only see Jamie getting worse every day. I'd like to know if there's some other approach I haven't tried yet that could help me get Jamie to at least think about looking for help. Any advice is appreciated.",16May2020,1

My problem is that whenever I want to buy something and my shopping cart is over $50, or some sale ends without me noticing (even if it's only a $15 difference)  I get so anxious I literally can't sleep. I can buy really anything (within reason) I feel like, like certain foods to keep in my dorm or electronics, collectables - whatever - but almost every time I try to get something that I've had my eye on for awhile I find it really difficult to just, do so. I have no idea why I can't shake the feeling of guilt before and after.

422,"My ex girlfriend broke up with me earlier this year because she just thought it was really hard going to colleges on opposite sides of the country (me in California, she in New York) and I agreed because it was really hard for me too and we always talked about it and tried to make it work but I assumed she just couldn’t take it anymore. We kinda had a friends-with-benefits thing going for about a month after she went back to school after winter break and eventually she got kinda distant out of nowhere and I couldn’t seem to get her to talk about it which was very strange because we had very good communication ever since we met and it only got better after we started dating; it was even good after we broke up. Eventually I told her that I was starting to think she was getting too busy with school and her other responsibilities and that it felt like I was holding her back from enjoying her life out there because I knew how much she loved her life out there. On top of that, I told her the state of my mental health was getting pretty low and it felt like I was constantly putting it on her because she was the only one that could really help me feel better and I felt guilty because I know it affected her hearing how sad I was all the time. She took about two weeks to reply and it was only cause a mutual friend kept telling her to just talk to me about the things bothering her instead of asking him what she should do (the mutual friend goes to the same college as me). I told him that I preferred to let her take her time and didn’t want to hear what they were talking about because i didn’t think it was my business, so he told me “I think you should just know that the next time you two talk, it’s probably gonna be the last”. She eventually called and we had this long conversation where she said that she doesn’t think she can help me as well as a professional might be able to and that she really just wants me to get better and be happy but that she doesn’t know what else to do. I understood and told her that I didn’t hold it against her. She later said that she thought it would help if we went out separate ways because she also felt like she was holding me back. Again, I told her I understood and really just wanted her to enjoy herself over there. We kept talking and eventually she told me she had something else to tell me and it took a lot of convincing to finally get her to tell me but she said that she had cheated on me toward the end of last year. I took a few moments to process it but I told her that I’m not upset with her and even told her that I still loved her, she said it back. We stayed on the phone just kind of thanking each other for everything, also crying, and I just stayed on the phone and let her fall asleep because she didn’t want to hang up. It’s been about 3 months now and last week I got a request from her younger sister to follow me on Snapchat. I accepted it but I’ve been having this internal battle about whether or not to tell her sister that I don’t want to cause any more trouble for her family (her parents found out about the relationship eventually and got very very upset and I’m pretty sure they still hate me). I really got along with her family back when we were just friends and she even said that I was the first person she’s dated that her sisters actually liked. I even find myself missing her family at times because I thought they were so great. Do I tell her sister that it wouldn’t be a good idea to stay in contact? Do I unfollow her without saying anything?? Do I leave things as they are and just wait??? I haven’t messaged her sister at all but I really don’t know what to do.

428,"Hi,

I grew up in an Islamic family. Despite the many negative connotations associated with the religion, my experience with it has been phenomenal. The mosque I go to is diverse, and the community is great. I have never been told to force my religion on others nor to give others harm. I have only been told to keep to maintain my prayers, to be a good human being, and spread kindness through the world. I feel like the relations with my extended family has stayed intact and strong because of Islam. I have nothing bad to say about it based on my experience, and if anything, it has enhanced my life, giving me motivation to be better, and to make individual sacrifices for the better of a community.

It just doesn't make any sense to me. Religion just doesn't make sense to me. Every night I pray to Allah for a sign that all of my praying and reading a language that don't understand isn't going to waste, to no answer. A major premise of Islam is to act on faith, and that expecting signs transgresses it. To me, it makes too much sense for religion to exist in the same way as a governance, it's a way to control people, to make people behave in a way deemed ""socially acceptable"" and ""moral"". I think I'm a decent enough person not to rely on religion for that. If religion is real, wouldn't most people be destined for damnation then?

I previously was studying it as a dual degree with education (teaching) and I hated it. So I dropped the teaching and took my chances with the general arts degree. 

I love history and have wanted to work in a museum since I was little. However, I feel as though this degree has diminished my love for history and can't stand researching and writing essays and the job market within museums is so limited, I have doubts that i'll even get a chance to work in one.

441,"Hello,

I am a ""Muslim"" student set to begin my first few years in my own in college soon, and the whole religion thing is driving me crazy. While there are many negative connotations with Islam, I have had no issues with it. I have always been told to be a good person and to be accepting of other people's choices. The mosque I go to is very diverse, and everybody is super accepting and welcoming to each other, it's very wholesome. I honestly believe that my family is knit together based on religion, we all pray together, discuss Islam, etc. everyday. I think that in general, my family has done a great job in creating an atmosphere where religion isn't a burden on me. It's just that, none of it makes any logical sense to me.

Every night I pray, ""O Allah, give me a sign, and make sure this sign enlightens me to the truth, please show me that Islam is the true religion of this world"" I have received no signs that religion exists, and honestly, I've known that it doesn't, but if I get that sign, believe me when I say I will commit my life to it. To me, religion is important in the same way that a governance is in that its a method to control people, to create these artificial morals so that we don't go batshit crazy. It just makes too much sense for it to be man-made to me, the idea that if ""I sin then I will perish in hellfire for eternity"" just seems like a scare tactic to prevent people from doing things objectively immoral. There's just so many contradictory beliefs out there that there's no way just one of them is right. I believe that when you die, there is no heaven or hell, there is no reincarnation nor Nirvana or any of that shit, I just think that we go back into the same state as we were before we lived. Simple as that.

That aside, here is the issue. Culturally, my family being strong-believing Muslims will adjust how I will have to handle my life in the future. I love my family, and for the same of them, I pray, fast, and read, but my heart isn't there, I am agnostic. We do arranged marriages, and my parents are already looking for a wife for me. I don't want that, I want to find my own path in life and take what it gives me. I want to try alcohol, I want to fornicate, I don't want to have to marry a Muslim, I don't want to teach my kids Islam. But I do want to stay with my family and make them happy, it's just that how I want to approach life will contradict my relationship with them. I think they would exile me if I they found out I had a girlfriend or something like that. I want independence, but I don't want to make my family sad.

He wanted to drive to her house, but coz of Corona and shit he couldnt. He said he didnt want to walk in on something and put himself and E in more danger, or find her... dead 
Im so worried about her. I texted her a few days ago, and yesterday, but she hasn't responded. I cant sleep at night. J also feels so guilty and that it's his fault (which it isnt, not E's fault either, that stupid son of a bitch boyfriend who cant control him fucking self).

450,"I honestly know I can turn things around, but I’m not sure how.

First of all, I’m fat. I don’t know how to diet properly, and I can’t keep a constant exercise routine during quarantine. I do some cardio every week, but it only ever adds up to 30 minutes worth. My diet is garbage, and I don’t know how to change it if I just get hungry all the time. I weigh 250lbs at  just 17 years old and I still want to have a future. I need to lose weight. I need to be healthy.

Second of all, I need to work harder. I keep getting distracted by events in life (especially video games) and have a massive procrastination issue. I put off everything to the last possible minute and I study the least amount possible for each class. I want to have a future that leads me in the right direction. I don’t want to be a low quality person that never does his best. I only have one more full year of high school before I can’t turn around my teenager mistakes.

Third, I have a massive ego. I get mad for no reason except just to “exert dominance” over others. I feel as if I am impolite to people and as if I should be a better person, but always get cocky and act like a total asshole to people.  I don’t really understand why I am like this, but I want to change. I want to become a better human, not a trash-mouthed young adult who can’t control their temper or emotions. 

Any suggestions on how to turn my life around? It’s something I have really been struggling with and I don’t even know what to do anymore. I really want to have a good future and not be stuck as a bad human forever.

Every fucking day, instead of listening to the voice in my head that tells me to watch porn, play video games and take a nasty depression nap I put on my stinky gym clothes and go lift weights or swing a kettle-bell. It's great to be in shape, but I feel as if I'm still shackled and the evil gatekeeper just loosened the chains a bit to give me the illusion of freedom.

I still wake up and say 'what the fuck', I still can't go an entire day without a suicidal thought, I still can't go to sleep without dreading the next day. I can't seem to answer the riddle that every single day asks me - ""why live?"". I can't built a single damn friendship or relationship because I hate myself so much. I haven't had a sincere conversation since I can remember, it's all ironic memespeak and half-truths. I can't speak with innocence and authenticity because I have no idea who I am, so I think thrice before I say something, so everything is a kind of theatrical act. 

I could go on like this for hours probably. My mind is overgrown with weeds and it's just a parasitic forest now. I imagined my conversation with a therapist and I can't even begin to image how an hour a week will suffice to spill out all my issues before even getting to any kind of therapy. It just seems easier to kill myself and be at peace. People told me that it gets better and that one day I will look back and laugh at myself for having such thoughts but I'm 25 now and I look back at the last 7 years and all I could think to myself is that it would be better if I had died when I was 18.

Every time I had a job I would get told to smile more, which was fine because I was working jobs with customer contact so in that context it makes sense.
But now I have an internship  at the place where I will work in a few months, and being an intern, I do the stuff that interns do.. organising shelves, washing up, counting candy (don't ask) that kind of stuff. I really don't mind it, but when I am concentrating, I, as I said, I look like I don't want to be there. I tried paying attention to my face but whenever my attention shifts to something else my face goes back to bitch mode. 
Now people at work notice that I look pissed and  I am so scared that my boss will tell me off because of that. (He's made a few comments) It happened before at other jobs.
I thought having a job without customer contact would make that issue go away but now my co-workers may think the new girl hates it there.

I told him I didn't want to- I ended up going to 5 different animal shelters with him and went to the last shelter about 3-4 times after that. We eventually got a 4 months old puppy and I ended taking care of the puppy and it was very difficult- since I have never taken care of a puppy before. Our good went through different training from basic to even seeing a behaviorist because she chewed her crate/our floors/ has separation anxiety and all types of things. 

Now my S/O wants to give our dog away- so he put me through almost 2 years of hell just to give this dog away. Even though before getting this dog I said I didn't want a dog because I knew the responsibility of having one. 
The reason we have to give her away because she needs someone who are not full-time workers- someone with a high active lifestyle. 

The thing is I am emotionally attached to my dog and I am scared of adopting her to some random person. And when that times comes that she leaves us- I know I will feel guilty for awhile for giving her away.

Back around maybe 6-8 years ago (I can't remember, my memory is garbage) I was living with 2 roommates, one was my boyfriend at the time. It wasn't a great relationship, not my worst though. We were intimate frequently, and I was not keeping up with my medication if you know what I mean. Early 20s so drinking a lot, very frequently. Anyways, my ""time of the month"" was late- I was not keeping track of it but I knew something was off and I was too scared of being judged to go into a store and buy a test. Well one day soon after I started bleeding- the whole event I won't go into details but was pretty traumatic for me at the time, wanted to go to the hospital, but didn't out of how people would see me and just trying to dismiss it all. Only people that knew the situation were bf at the time and 1 friend. I have mentioned it in passing to current bf- I shut down emotionally and as neither of us want kids, like ever, I feel it would be a waste of time to discuss unless he asked. A lot in my mind has been popping up with regards to my late teens/early 20s and this event and what followed is causing some internal distress but I am not sure who, if anyone, I should talk about it with. I could mention it to counselor- in 5 days, but it may not be an issue anymore. Also don't know if I should mention it to my gyno, as she doesn't know- none of my Dr's know.

I told her I didn’t think we were friends because she told me once she didn’t care about when I said she’s not being a good friend or being rude. She then said she didn’t say she didn’t care she just thought it made me look like a bitch. I then told her she never takes my feelings into consideration so she said she was gonna be brutally honest and told me I was too soft and a pussy. I then told her somethings I thought were honest about her I’d never think I’d say. It got real ugly and at the end of it she said were never speaking again and she blocked me on everything.

A friend recently told me that they liked being around me because my energy was always so positive. I was greatful to hear that but all I could think of was how much that wasn't true. I would say my life is good. I have a family, friends, no monetary problems or illness. On paper, I have nothing to worry about but why do I find it so hard to be happy with myself and my life? When I'm around other people I smile and laugh but when once I'm alone I realise how fake and alone I am. It's hard to explain but even when I'm surrounded with people, I always manage to find myself thinking about how lonely I am and how I'm the only person I have.

470,"This needs some background information. When I was 15, I met a new group of friends. Since I am from a rural area, friends are limited. Most members of the group were male and much older than me, some of them were older than 20.

As a teenager, I wasn't very good-looking (I still am not, but at least I have a taste in clothes etc now), so the thought that any person might like me more than just a friend never crossed my mind. One guy of this was 8 years older and like the older brother I never had. As soon as I was 16 (the age of consent in my country btw), he started to become very touchy and complimented my looks a lot. I didn't realize that he might be into me, my self-esteem was sh*t and he was 24 at that time.

Once, I was wearing a t-shirt that showed maybe an inch of skin, but really nothing revealing. Me and my friends were hanging out at a local river for swimming. As I was sitting on the lawn at the riverbank, he sat next to me. Then, he just bit me in my stomach and placed his head on my lap. When I tried to move, he complained that it was comfortable and I should stop being so prudish. I thought I was the weird one because I hated anything that involves body contact and have been teased about that several times already.

Once when we were camping, there was not enough space for all girls to sleep in one tent, so I agreed to go to the boy's tent. I fell asleep with at least 60cm (~2') distance to the others. When I woke up, the guy from before was spooning me. We were sleeping in sleeping bags, but it was very uncomfortable nevertheless. I tried to get up without having to move him, I didn't want him to wake up. He still woke up and got annoyed because ""I was cold, that's why I came so close, stay here or I'll freeze"". I got up nevertheless, I had to go to the toilet.

This new year's eve, we were partying. At that time, I had a boyfriend and brought him along to meet my friends. The guy decided to touch my inner thigh while I was sitting on my boyfriend's lap. My boyfriend got up immediately, went to another room with the guy and told him to never do anything like this again. He apologized profusely to my boyfriend, but not to me.

He once confessed his love to me, and when I said that I just see him as a friend, he said ""Don't worry, I'll just get you drunk, then you will kiss me eventually"". I tried to avoid him as much as possible afterwards.

I was too afraid to say anything at all these occasions because he had manipulated me so much that I believed it was my fault for being bothered by it. But after my boyfriend talked to him, I realized that it was, in fact, his fault and he had no right to do that. The day after, I wrote him a long message where I explained that I don't want him to ever ignore my boundaries again and that he behaved very disrespectfully towards me. He abnswered that he was very sorry, but that I should've communicated whenever I was uncomfortable. I tried to explain why I never said something, but he continued telling me that it was my responsibility to tell him when he was overstepping boundaries.

We also found out that he was a convicted child molester. He didn't bother to tell us, we found out about it because it was in a newspaper. When we asked him why he never told us, he said because he ""wasn't like this anymore"" and because ""we wouldn't have understood anyways"".

I texted some of my friends from that group what had happened and that I won't join the group whenever this guy would be with them. They didn't know what had happened because I never told them. They were really concerned and told me they would tell me whenever he would be there too. They also excluded him when they knew I would be coming.

One night, I met this guy in a bar, coincidentally. We talked about what had happened. He apologized again and told me that he thinks I should forgive him because he now knows that it was wrong what he did and that he will better himself. I told him that I'm not ready, but maybe in the future, I will forgive him. He said that we should stay in contact nevertheless because I couldn't throw away the ""great friendship"" we had formed.

When I told my friends about it, they said I should forgive him because he realised what he had done wrong and he apologized. They think he deserves another chance and that, if I don't want to see him ever again, he might start using hard drugs more frequently. Also, it would rip our group apart. Some of them know him since kindergarten, and they somehow think he will better himself eventually.

Tl;dr A friend if mine overstepped my boundaries several times. We found out he was a convicted child molester and he never told us. He apologized to me and now, my friends think I should accept his apology, especially because ""nothing really bad happened"". Do I have to accept it?",16May2020,1

I've four younger siblings I've been helping homeschool and look after (as my parent works) and on top of that my sister broke her foot this week and can't walk on her own so I've had to be at her service too.

Our uni's carried on as normal with lots of tight deadlines, I just about made the previous ones (mostly because I'd started the work before lockdown) for two modules so thankfully they'll go well (got full marks on one coursework even). However the next two projects are due next week and I've barely been able to make a start. (We also have a final online exam right after but I haven't had time to look at a single lecture since the lockdown - no clue if I'll even have time to sit down and do the exam on time let alone learn the content for it.)

Our department's already said this semester doesn't count towards our degree classification but the grades will still appear on our transcript. Still I'm stressed as hell and haven't been able to sleep at night (so I'm tired as fuck all day), I have no idea how I'm supposed to juggle caring/household responsibilities with uni work. It took me all morning just to write this post as I couldn't sit down at the computer for more than two minutes without being called away/having to attend to my siblings...

All he pays for is his car insurance (which is on my parents policy) and whatever him and his gross girlfriend do. My parents will ask me for money and I will begrudgingly give them some of my $9.50 an hour paycheck and in exchange they let me borrow their car while I try to save up for a used one, but since they take my money it’s a sort of cycle. They don’t ask my brother for ANYTHING and basically call me a loser for not having a car and tell me I should be moved out by now and guilt me. BUT THEY DONT SAY THIS TO MY BROTHER. His girlfriend is 20, works as a cashier, complains about her home life and is over at my house almost every single day. My brother and his gf will cook in my parents kitchen and not clean up after themselves and when I tell my mom to tell them to clean them up she gets mad at ME and says “don’t tell me how to parent”. And I’m like?! I also was dating a guy for a minute and when I asked my parents to meet him they refused, the same people who let my brother and his girlfriend have “sleepovers” which is basically his nasty gf saying that her dad and stepmom are assholes and she doesn’t want to go home. I don’t like my brothers girlfriend and frankly am confused as to why they can’t save enough to move in together. My parents know that a used condom was from them and my kid sister found it and they still let this girl sleep over. Yet they won’t even meet a date of mine. Since then I didn’t like her. This has been going on for a year now and my parents enable it. We have younger siblings and my parents let my brother and his gf (again not 21) drink in their home because her parents actually care and set boundaries.

478,"So I liked my friend since the first time we talked. He liked me as well. We are on good terms right now. I dialed down the chatter with him since it bothers him so I’ll be making him do the communication. 

And the days that pass with no taking is making it easier for me to move in from this crush on liking him romantically so it’s a win win for me. For him not so much since he wants to be friends and I’m not communicating at all. But he envies me...he’s a competitive person, I chooses to play the instrument he plays...it affected his dumb little ego. Which made him not want to be my friend and along with these moods I have. Which I never ever showed, I just have resting both face. 

He’s all about these crap but wants to be friends? I will admit our friendship is a little bit toxic. When we texted the other day I felt this vibe that we hated eachother low key but we liked talking. It’s weird. 
But anyways he tells me “I don’t want you to like me because I don’t like you.” That sounds like me that he is telling me to stop liking him cuz I’ll only get hurt in the end and he won’t reciprocate the feelings. But I can’t control my feelings, I’m trying and it’s slowly going away. 
He told me it feels weird. Apparently he gets uncomfortable when I text him cuz he thinks I’m flirting when It wasn’t my intention I wasn’t even using any flirting banter so him knowing that I like him is making him think I’m flirting with him. So yeah I just really chilled out on eveything with him but we still tlak but he will do the chatter. 

I find it fascinating that he still wants to be my friend after everything we went through. I don’t know, my friends say it seems like he still wants to be in my life.

I was sat in one of our dining rooms eating a lunch our maid had made for me, and I hear Brocky and Sophia coming in, and talking with some old dude, firstly I inexplicably thought my grandpa had come to visit, but he lives in Hinsdale, IL and runs a large business so he wouldn’t have dropped by announced. I leave the room and see it’s some kind of vagrant or something, either that or he was attacked by a pack of hippies, or coyotes or something. I yanked Brock aside, and asked him what the fuck was happening. He tells me some confabulation about “helping the ‘poor’ and ‘moral duty’” I walked off and went and sat in the poolhouse (my room until September) 

A few hours later Marisa (the maid) tells me that “we’ve a guest for dinner, be ready for 7” I comply and showered and changed into some nice clothes. I walk to the main dining room for a little after six, and see my parents and siblings, looking at this old probably homeless guy and they look awestruck. I must have interrupted them as they all greeted me and idled me with chitchat. I let them do their thing (whatever the fuck that is, exactly) and went to our kitchen to help Marissa with dinner (I’m a great cook and learned from her). 

Dinner is served and we all dish and plate up, the family and this ..dude are all engaging in some kind of idle chitchat. So anyway this guy starts telling us all a story about how “he runs a ‘group’ and thinks my (barely) teen siblings would be a “good fit” for this, he rambles on and on about “spiritual enlightenment, moral and ethical duty, removing hedonistic traits) and a whole bunch of other crap. He gives my folks some flyers, a book, some kind of catalog and a flash drive, as well as some personality test thing, that they’re meant to “mail off”. They ask me if I wanna go to our movie room and look at this, but I passed and helped clear dinner up and returned to my room. 

I’m sat in one of the loungers by the pool, smoking a joint and Sophia comes out to me. She tells me that she had to pee while out with my brother and while she went inside, Brock either started to talk to this guy or was approached by him. She goes on to say that she “has no idea what he wants but he keeps talking about his group” I told her I’d deal with it, and we finished my joint and she went to bed (or wherever) 

Anyway flash forward a couple days, I’m getting some laps in the pool in and my mom and brother come get me and call for a “family meeting” like we’re in some 90s sitcom or something. My mom says that she and Brock are following this guy “Karl” to his group for “enlightenment month” and won’t be back until the end of June. They “ship out to Florida” next weekend. 

My dad, Sophia and I think they’re retarded but they won’t listen, I’m pretty sure it’s either a cult of some kind or a scam and they targeted my family as we’re pretty well off. Me and my father have talked to them endlessly but they refuse to listen and spout the same crap that has been spoon fed to them about the “curing them of their sins, the path to enlightenment” etc. 

They refuse to talk about the subject further. Sophia is upset by all, and my father just says “let them do their thing” which I kinda agree with, there’s nit much else I can do. 

They refuse to tell me where it is exactly they’re going, just that it’s a town in Florida. And won’t leave any contact details or emergency numbers, cell phones are apparently “discouraged” and they say they can find us when needed. 

So yeah, any advice Reddit?

481," I am currently a senior in high school and for my college path I have decided to go to community college and transfer. However, since I am doing this I suddenly have more time to think about the career path I want to follow or my college major. Personally, I am certain I want to major in engineering, but I can't decide what kind. I really value job security and want a steady income, so computer engineering would work really well for that. Also, I am part of an engineering academy at my school, and the computer engineering related topics we have covered, I didn't hate them. For bioeningeering, I enjoy bio and I also have a dream tucked inside my brain somewhere of becoming a doctor and going to medical school, but after reading posts about it, I worry about being able to find a job and how other engineering majors would be a better choice. I also personally don't know much about bioeningeering, I have don't research on it, but it honestly isn't that specific. For computer engineering, another reason I am conflicted against it, this is dumb, but its just kind of expected and idk I want to rebel or I feel like I am losing something if I choose it. Anyways, I am not sure what path I should go with. Basically I worry about being able to find a job and the competitiveness, I knew STEM is just competitive, and jobs aren't guaranteed but I am worried about not having a starting chance at all.",16May2020,1
482,"I feel like he is constantly annoyed with me, like my wife Donna is and I can’t shake the feeling that he doesn’t want to be around me. And I don’t understand why. Everything I do is to get closer to him. 

I try to emulate his behavior. For example I be talkin’ slang with him on a daily basis. I sometimes flash him gang signs and when I skateboard I say “skrrrt skrrrt” every time I move. I also wear an adidas cap backwards cuz’ I’ve been told I look cool like that.

484,"In December I finally left an abusive household. Me and my ex split in August but we lived together so I could find somewhere to stay. Between the two of us things were left terrible.

My ex all his family is mostly still alive. I know his grandfather is his first major family death. I’m not sure if I should unblock him and text him my condolences since I frequently met his grandfather.

486,"So I previously posted this on r/transadvice but I guess the comunity is a little  small. Also, others might have good ideas as well, so here it goes: I just found out through Reddit that my (now) sister is trans, too. Yes, too, because I'm a transguy myself.

For quite some time now I thought my (as I used to think) ""brother"" experimented with ""his"" gender expression because due to me not being cis ""he"" discovered this part of ""himself"" or even as a way to cope with me being trans. Today, I looked up her usual net name and found her Reddit account. It's 100% her account. The use of words and -god- the *aesthetic™*. Looking through the most recent posts it was pretty clear she identifies as MtF, she even tags herself as such. The ""about"" pretty much says: ""If you know me don't act as if you didn't notice"".

I must admit, I feel pretty lost now. I can't help but doubt this all, what are the odds? But I know it's possible and I feel so guilty for thinking this. Despite any suspicions, she's old enough to know what's the best for herself and had an example in me to see that trans* doesn't equal attention. I also took her to every pride event she wanted to go to. That's why I can't imagine she does it for attention, I'm sure she really thinks she's trans and as long as she doesn't revoke this statement I'll support her transition in every way. I'm the last to call someone a transtrender  if there's no reason.

Now, after I got my fears off my chest, I want to show my support. I commented on one of her posts (without directly identifying myself) and she immediately followed me. It's likely she knows it's me if she also went through my posts, so she might already know I know. Now I'm assembling a little gift box that tells her between the lines that I know but doesn't say ""I know you're a girl/woman now, admit it already""; I want her to have the chance of coming out on her own terms but give her the security that I know and won't be mad.

If you couldn't tell I'm looking for items that are slightly feminine but not girly. I don't know how to explain this right, she already wears some traditionally female items around the house, e.g. night gowns and has shoulder-length hair that she even had dyed pink for a while. I need things a transgirl would like that don't scream TRANS (so no tucking underwear, etc.) and can pass as ""provocatively female"" towards our parents who are the classic queer-yes-but-not-in-my-family kind.

As an inspiration, I'll start with feminine swim shorts and a feminine rash guard (or do you have a better suggestion for swimwear?). Maybe a little make-up (What basic product can I get?). Have any of you other ideas?",16May2020,1

I work as a visual effects artist and I used to love what I do, I had many personal projects I would do outside of work and enjoy every minute of it. But now I can't find the drive to do anything.

That night she probably kissed me around 20 times. I searched “sexual assault” and it said, “when someone sexually touches someone without permission” which she did.

493,"I'm 22 soon to be 23m in Germany, gay, depressed, suffering from anxiety due to an ongoing daily alcohol addiction (I've been drinking myself to sleep every day for the past 2 years) with a father that is not understanding with very eccentric behavioral traits.

I'm a college student, and most likely I won't be able to pass my last exams. My university is not helpful at all and does everything to kick us out. I'm not that good at engineering...and even though I loved Germany, As someone from southern Europe people can be really cold and cruel here...and besides I can't seem to find anyone to date, I'm not the type for Germans. So as a closeted person even though I have a lot of stupid friends I feel lonely.

I don't have a private sphere since I live with my parents, my father works 24/7 from home and our health insurance goes over his work. My father does not recognize depression as an illness but rather as a mindset. I can't get help, and I can't afford to pay for it by myself. (E.g. Two months ago I did a long and tiring 7 hours drive, half an hour before getting home I had to stop, call an ambulance due to severe anxiety attack on the motorway at night, my father got mad at me because he had to pay a 400 euros bill before we got reimbursed. We're well off, we have money). My parents have the upper hand on everything in my life and I can't afford to move out.

I don't know what to do, talking about doesn't help, it doesn't change anything, people don't change and it doesn't change my situation. I help everyone, I do everything for everyone just to see them smile...that's not fulfilling anymore....and people often abused My kindness...I've had suicidal phases, some harsher than others. But I just want my peace, I want to live and I want to be happy.. but the world is just so cruel.

If you have any advice for me feel free. I've taken a lot critics in life so you don't have to sugarcoat. I just want honest and genuine advice.

Thank you stranger.",16May2020,1
494,"I (19M) have been depressed for a few years, but until now I didn't really have any ""real life"" problems, everything was going relatively well aside from the depression. I was tired all the time, had no joy in life, a hard time focusing on university, etc... But at least I knew that once I ""fixed"" it, everything would be going smooth. I still could get decent grades, my social life was ok, I actually had lots of hobbies and traveled a lot.

Throwback to last November, I woke up with chest pain and got sent to the hospital with myocarditis. I was 100% healthy before, and very fit, so it was pretty much just bad luck (the doctor told me that himself). I was told I couldn't exercise for 6 months, and that they couldn't guarantee I'd ever be healthy again. The 6 months passed, but my appointment and heart exam were rescheduled because of corona.

In January I went to Vienna with a friend for a few days, to celebrate NYE (I'm from Portugal). On the 1st of January I got sick of him (depression makes me get bored of people easily), walked around on my own and met this girl from Azerbaijan. We ended up spending 9 hours together (from 7 pm to 4 am) just talking and walking, our chemistry was amazing. We met again the next day and spent another 9 hours. She didn't let me kiss her though, because she ""thought I was amazing and didn't want to be just a travel fling"". A relationship wasn't an option, as she was living in germany at the time.

In march, I started thinking of her again and we started texting, then talking on the phone every single day. She was coming to Portugal in April, but then the lockdown started. We kept talking everyday, but she told me that her europe visa will end in August, and that she might be deported (she was supposed to go to the US, but her application was denied because of corona). Her family is really bad (her father used to beat her and her mom, even threatened to go to Germany and find her), so she really can't go back.

Knowing that it was a completely crazy decision, I asked her if she wanted to marry me. I guess depression made me stop giving a fuck about what's sane or not. She told me no, as she didn't want to put me in a bad position by marrying for visa. I asked her ""what if it wasn't for the visa, what if I really wanted to marry you?"". She started crying, said yes and told me she loved me. I had no idea how we would actually pull it off though before August though.

I started taking the marriage thing serious, looking up the procedure, searching for houses to rent, etc. Mind you, I'm just a 19 years old college kid. Meanwhile, my parents are actually getting divorced, and my dad wasn't taking it well. He seemed sad and was acting weird, but nothing extreme. 2 days ago though, out of nowhere, he started crying and pulled out a gun to kill himself. I had to wrestle the gun out of my own dad's hands. Guns are COMPLETELY illegal in portugal, I have no idea where he might have gotten it. I don't know what to do now, my family says that we should let him calm down, I think we should call the police and put him into a mental ward or something. The gun is in a safe place now, by the way.

In the middle of all this shit, I still have to focus on university, though I'm seriously thinking about forgetting about this semester and doing it next year. I have so much shit to study, and I'm not in the right mental state for it. My grandma is also in the hospital today with a kidney infection, as if it wasn't enough.

My friends tell me that marrying that girl at my age is absolutely insane, but right now she's the only person I care about, we actually talked about my depression and she was always so supportive, she asks me if I'm feeling alright everyday and actually senses it in my voice when I'm not. I feel like she's the only person who really loves me. And since she declined my first suggestion (marrying for visa), I know she's not just using me.

It's just too much right now, my health, my family, my fiancee, university... I don't know what to do.",16May2020,1

497,"My boyfriend (21M) and I (21F) had planned on renting an apartment for next school year and living together for the whole school year. We figured if our relationship survived a long distance spring semester it would be a cool experience to live together before moving on to grad school. I now seem to be getting cold feet. 

My family lives ~8hrs away from my college while his is only 2 (This is important). During the whole pandemic both of our income sources, on campus jobs, have been suspended so both of our parents have agreed to assist with finances (food/rent). We would move in during the summer and stay until school started and determine our plan following the determination of school being online. 

I am unsure if I want to move in and stay over the summer anymore. I have enjoyed the time with my family, the lack of worrying about buying food/expenses, and I live somewhere there are plenty of hiking trails to keep me busy. And the added bonus of tutoring/babysitting in my community for super easy money once things start to open up. I want to see my boyfriend but I also don’t want to sacrifice the nice backyard and deck my family has that I can spend time in. Our college apartment isn’t as luxurious and the town isn’t very safe. That being said it IS in the wilderness so hiking is more intense.

Both of our parents have said that they would support our decisions if we decided to stay or not and that we could take “vacations” to see them and get away from the college town. I also have a bit of money saved up so it’s possible to do a couple of road trips to the beach/mountains but nothing wildly nice or expensive. 

What would you do/ what is your advice?

He started screaming even more when I defended myself and my sister came to the room, telling me to shut up and stop. I told her what our brother did, but she decided to call me a psychopath and hit me in the head many times and really hard. I told her to back off multiple times, but then she started threatening me and again, out of anger, I kicked the toys even harder.

508,"First of all I am not from a english speaking country so please excuse any grammatical errors. Autocorrect in another language is also on with my mobile phone but I'll try to find all the butchered words. 

I (21) am worried about my 13 year old brother because I feel like my family (mother, aunt, grandma) is making big mistakes with the way they are raising him. I'm naming some every day examples:

1. He plays video games until 5 am in the morning and then sleeps til 5 pm. During gaming he gets very agressive and screams loudly. My mother doesn't really say much and when she does he hits her hard. He once destoyed his TV by punching it in anger and no one said anything. He just played in the living room from then on and no one else was allowed to watch TV all day (all my parents do in their free time is watching TV so this was horrible for them).
My brother can also get very nasty and disrespectful with words when he's angry and everybody just laughs it off for the most part.

2. They force my brother to go to a sports club when he doesn't even want to go. I get it sometimes, because it's the only time he gets out of the house and is in contact with boys and father figures (our father is mentally ill and never took part in raising us) so I can see why. 
But it's always auch a hassle to get him to go and when he gets home after he is in a bad mood because he's almost always last place and is singled out by the other boys.

3. We always have to force him to do his homework. And when he doesn't do it my aunt just does it for him and then he has to write it in his own writing (so the teachers don't notice). But he doesn't even do that. This is one of the reasons why he is behind in grammar and basic mathematics. 

4. I know that this comes with puberty and it's normal but my brother almost never brushes his teeth, changes his clothes, takes a shower or uses deodorant. The guys in our family can get very hairy at a young age so his evebrows have already grown together.. I got bullied in school  for these kinds of things. I didn't notice my body changing and no one taught me to groom myself. Now I feel like the same thing is happening to him and I want to prevent it.

5. They have no hopes for him. And they say that infront of him too. Like they don't expert him to do his best they are just glad that he's doing anything at all.
 They don't believe that he can be good at school or successful in life because ""he just isn't like that"" and they always say ""your  sister (me) can do this but I dont think you can but that's ok""... No, he could do so much better! Can they not see that they are setting him up to fail?
They  also never make him do even the most basic chores like doing his own bed, getting a glas of water, cleaning the table after eating something or throwing away his trash. Their reason: He's young and a boy so he doesn't need to.

... these are the things that come into my mind first.

Whenever I say something they get mad at me and tell me that it's not my business or laugh at me and tell me I'm dramatic. They say that it's a hard time (puberty) for my brother right now and that we should just let him do what we wants...
What can I even do to better this situation? No one listens to me. I think it's important to correct these things before he cannot be changed but no one shares my opinion.

Or from an outside perspective: do you guys think that I am being overdramatic?

I'm just afraid that my brother will end up becoming a manchild like my father and uncle :( they did it twice and they'll do it again with my brother.",16May2020,1

How do we get a mortgage, what are the requirements? do I have to get an ID in his state so I can stay there permanently? how many years do I have to work in my job in order to be referred to a company in his country? are there lots of other stuff about immigrating that I’m not even aware of? please help if anybody has knowledge :( I have no idea how to be an adult, and where to start",16May2020,1
511,"I am worried that my roommate’s cat may not be getting the best care and it is affecting her health. The litter isn’t kept clean. When I moved in there was a discussion about her litter box because of the smell and I then learned she cleaned it every few weeks. I read up on a dirty litter box and what could happen and many articles mentioned cats getting UTIs because of them having to hold their urine if they don’t want to go in their dirty boxes. Anyway, skip to a few months later and the cat gets kidney stones, which can be caused by UTIs. I can’t say for certain that that was related to the litter box, but it seems likely. If I ever have to go in her room (the laundry machines are in there) 9 times out of 10 her water bowl is dirty (usually with food it looks like). Regardless of the kidney stones, I feel like the cats overall health isn’t great. She is very inactive (and although she is 4, I’ve known plenty of cats that were at least somewhat active and playful up until their later years), she doesn’t eat much, but she is slightly overweight. I don’t want to make accusations, but I also want this cat to get good care if it is affecting her. Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. As well as how/if I should mention anything to my roommate. Also, I’m not too sure if there are any kinds of cat food out there that would make a cat less active, but she eats Purina and I’ve always read bad things about it. So if anyone knows for certain that Purina can even affect a cat’s health negatively I would appreciate it!",16May2020,1

Over time I moved out of that fandom and so we don't really chat anymore - but one day I see a post from her about how her mother is kicking her out of the house. 

I messaged her as soon as I saw that and told her to go to the police for help. I knew she was unhappy at home but I didn't expect this to happen. 

It's been a few days now and there's no sign of her online and no replies to messages, but none of her fandom friends are saying anything and that whole group is just tweeting etc as normal. So now idk what to do.

514,"Im about to finish high school, after high school comes college (which Im not sure means the same thing here in Serbia as across the world, but I hope you get the point) and for a long time I didnt care much which ""college"" Im gonna go to, as none of the state (or ""public"") collages had any themes I was interested in, I always wanted to work in movie and filmmaking industry and none of the colleges really taught that (hope Im wording it right), but recently I found out about a private college which teaches exactly that.

The problem is

The school is pretty expensive for my families economic status, to afford it I would have to get a job myself (which I insist upon doing) to help pay for it, but even then its pretty shaky, considering I have a sister who will also be going to college next year. I will insist as much as I can on getting a job and helping pay it as much as I can, but it looks grim. I never cared much about school and was always looking forward to pursuing filmmaking no matter which school I finished, but this now seems like it could severely change the direction of my life in a positive way, and I dont want to give it up, not without trying my best.

After looking this school up on forums and whatnot, I stumbled upon several posts from years ago, in which students agreed that price was high, but said they paid only half due to having a scholarship. Now I never cared about anything school related before (although I am about to finish a highly thought of high school with very good grades), so I have no idea what the word scholarship covers, other than paying less for college.

This is where I need advice.

How does one get his hands on a scholarship? 

I will finish high school in June, and enrollment deadline for this collage will be during September, am I too late?

524,"Hi, I posted on AITA about a situation concerning a co worker and I now want to see where I should go about this as this is my first job experiencing such craziness.

I have a coworker who uses her pregnancy as an excuse to slack off entirely during her work shift. She gets paid, of course. She complains about everything such as nausea being too overwhelmed. She wasn’t the best coworker to begin with in general.

Examples would be that she would go on her personal email and uses the work computer to online shop. She would have actual documents and work related things on the computer but the moment when the supervisor leaves for a quick minute, she’s back to “fashion nova”or some sort. This would go on for 4 hours from the start of her shift. Then when there is only 4 hours left on the 10 hour shift, she then starts doing work. Leaving us to wait for her knowing that it won’t take her 4 hours to do the assigned task due to safety reasons.

My coworker and I, who are directly affected, already told two supervisors. Unfortunately, one supervisor just told us to “drop it” or “just be patient with her”. This shenanigans started in January. The coworker only found out she was pregnant three weeks ago.


Now we are expected to pick up her slack because no one wants to listen to our concerns and complaints. I’m not sure who to contact to next when supervisors aren’t doing anything about it.",16May2020,1
525,"Context

He is my best friend, we hang out all the time, he picked up smoking maybe 3 years ago and whenever we're in the car he smokes pretty much majority of the time, he lets the windows down but I still get a whiff of smoke every time I breathe and it's unavoidable. See about 2 years ago he would ask me if I'm cool with him smoking in the car, not wanting to be dissapointing to the other 2 people in the car who also would smoke (who also hang out with us a lot) I said it was fine, even though secretly I hated it. Now since we hang out all the time, I find myself in his car a lot if we're driving somewhere and hes smoking and Im actually starting to worry about how much secondhand smoke i'm breathing in but heres where my problem lies

1. its his car, he can smoke in it if he wants
2. i said i was cool with it so this is partially my fault
3. i feel like a dick asking someone to not smoke in their car especially one of my best friends who is actually a really cool person

528,"Hello,

The title seems dumb enough to make it an obvious answer, probably, so let me explain.

I study in Belgium, I am in last year of bachelor in Psychology and Educational Sciences. With the lockdown, organization has been disastrous at my university, and despite it being in less than two weeks, I still don't have a confirmed examen schedule, only provisional. All examens are online, despite everyone's advice to not do that.

The idea of doing my examen then going to her place is not doable ; I can't afford a car, public transport will take 2h37 (+ walking time between stations, and waiting for the bi-hourly bus). Unless my mother would need help only past 18h (6pm), I'd arrive too late.

&amp;#x200B;

The part worrying me about the examens is that they do require us to be alone, without any outside communication, during the entire test. These examens also use negative scoring (you pick wrong, you get negative points), do not allow me to view all questions at once, neither to change my mind on a previous answer. For this reason, passing the examen with anything else going on seems disastrously stressful to me.

In the meantime, my mother told this morning she'd get a surgery for her shoulder, this 25th of May. It will cause her to be 'immobilized', and that is why she is asking for my help ; the only other options are her brother, who is probably working and very busy due to corona, and her father, who is obviously kinda old to help with everything, and for that reason she doesn't want his help.

I didn't really have a good past with my mother ; I kind of ran away last year, due to her not accepting me being transgender. With the distance, she relatively got over it, and we kept some kind of contact. We only saw each other once twice, and it wasn't for any holiday, to give you an idea.  
Anyway, because of *all* of that, I am still extremely scared to the idea of being around her again, like, y'know, fear she didn't actually get over it and that kind of stuff. Could break my stuff again, I don't know.

On the 25th, I do have an exam in the plain middle of the day, *Statistics (Software)*, which will require me to bring my larger (and more fragile) laptop. I don't know yet if it'll be at the time she'd be in the surgery room or something, the exact hour isn't scheduled yet either. I don't know if it's even worth to come, if it's to be busy with that examen ; it's already very stressful by itself, I don't know if I'd handle the pressure if she happened to call for help at the same time. If she actually needs it and can't wait.  
I also just am trash at math. This course is the actual worst of this entire year, for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, in short, that's the conflict. I don't think I can do both helping her and doing my examen. Helping her would also remove study time for the next examens, the following days. I never had an online examen, I don't even know how that's gonna work. I don't know either how a shoulder surgery works, I don't know what it needs.

I would like exterior opinions on what you would think is the good solution, or compromises, other ideas. I have to admit I mostly am in the unknown, about all of this.

Thank you.",16May2020,1
529,"I live in Portugal and recently got my master's degree in mechanical engineering.

Started working as a process engineer in a factory right away (this was at the end of January), was really motivated and eager to learn but that changed very quickly given how my boss is one of the rudest and most hateful people I have ever known. He is literally a bully, curses at everybody and speaks in an aggresive manner 90% of the time, but everyone around seems to find it normal and just accept their fate.

He is also constantly forcing me to work until late, by phoning me or messaging me via Whatsapp telling me to do this and that, always intimidating me with words. I have already complained to a superior but nothing changed.

The company also doesn't pay transport allowance because they have buses, but my boss keeps harassing me to use my car so I can get in the factory earlier and stay until late. They obviously don't pay overtime, it's ridiculous, specially given how much money the company generates. Meanwhile I have to pay for my gas, tolls, travel 80km in total and still pay my bills and rent (currently a tiny apartment costs between 500 and 600€ in my area, thankfully I'm splitting it with my gf) while earning 955€ per month after taxes.

You could think that at least I am learning and acquiring unvaluable knowledge, but no, I have learned close to nothing, nobody is teaching me anything, they just throw me stuff to do that nobody has time to do because we are very few for the amount of work needed. 

I feel like given how expensive life got in Portugal for locals, people are becoming modern slaves who will endure and work as much as their bosses force them to in fear of losing their slim income.

Right now I feel an urge to travel somewhere else, learn and be respected while being able to save a reasonable amount of money after expenses.

My only requirement is being able to surf at least once per week since it's my favorite thing in the world and what's been keeping me sane.
I can speak english, french and portuguese fluently, and my mother is Australian but I haven't applied for australian citizenship yet.

What are my best options? Or what would you do in my shoes after the COVID-19 situation improves?

Thank you in advance!

Tl;dr: wages in Portugal are miserable compared to the cost of life, we are forced to work overtime without being paid for it in fear of losing our jobs.

530,"Hi, I'm wondering if can give me a second opinion on this. 

About a week ago my sister, who works as a counselor, made a home visit to someone who had a family member get tested for corona-virus. The child was running a fever and was tested for both corona and strep throat, she was working with a sibling of the child in their home. None of the family members besides the child are showing symptoms.

Yesterday I learned that she got a call from her work saying the child was tested 4 days ago from today. The area that the child lives is kind of a hot bed, infected at a rate of 2% of the population, something like 1,400 cases in a small city/town of 63,000 approximate, our town is 1%, in line with the state average.

My sister is kind of stubborn and does not think it's a big deal, she wont take her temperature or quarantine. Her only symptoms are a runny nose and sneezing from allergies. 

Our family is currently in quarantine awaiting the test results from this child but everyone is interacting normally, except sterilizing surfaces more. My instinct tells me I should quarantine myself and my son away from the family, but my mom doesn't want to make a big deal about it because she thinks it would make my son nervous.

The issue is, the more time I spend in my room, the more my parents get annoyed at me for it. They claim that they're worried about me because if I don't move around I'll get fat, which to them is like the worst crime a person can commit (also note that because of our location we can go out for walks whenever as we live in a super rural area, so my parents make us go for a 30 minute minimum walk every weekday morning, so it's not even like I'm not exercising).

532,"Before I start, I wanna take this time to say that if you wanna hit me with extreme moral judgement on me or argue on my behalf, please refrain. I don't wanna talk about the ethics of cheating during a pandemic, I just want to know what other people think is the best move for me, selfishly speaking. 

I recently took my last final. Final final, as it were. Obviously, because of quarantine, I'm at home taking my classes online, and, as the title suggests, I cheated. I looked at my notes the whole time, which was prohibited. A day later, I (and everyone else in my class) got this email from my professor talking about how it's very clear most of the class used the internet, notes, etc. to get a good score on the exam. He said that he suspected something similar happened on the first exam in the quarantine (guilty of that as well), that they have concluded which answers were cheated, and that they will dock your semester grade a full grade if you don't come forward before next Friday morning, but only half a grade if you do.

I distinctly remember being asked a hypothetical like this in a high school seminar, and I never thought it would happen to me.

So, the question must be asked; how likely is it that I am to get spotted? 

We had 3 tests. I scored a 72 on the first one (which was before quarantine), and an 85 on the second (during). My best guess as to my score on the final would be somewhere between these two, C+ to B-. Given my grade on the homework, quizzes, participation, and group project, I estimate my grade to be about a C+. Me pulling a C+ wouldn't be terribly unexpected by any stretch. Also of note, my grade on both of the first two tests was significantly lower than the rest of the class. The professor gives us the distribution of our grade, and I came up low. I fully expect to have a lower grade once again, yes, even with the cheating. I'm a bad test-taker.

However, there's a big problem, that being I don't know what he means by ""answers were cheated."" Not ""who cheated,"" but ""what were cheated."" Did he examine every student's answers, or did he look at those who scored the highest? If the latter, then I'm most likely safe, but if the former, I have to count on my answers being clean as hell. I would like to believe that my answers are safe and that my poor academic performance would also dissuade someone from thinking I cheated, but that's a lot to bet on. 

Now, you may be asking ""Why don't you just take the hit to your grade? It's not very big."" I agree 100%. However, he didn't mention anything about how the tests get graded. If you admit to cheating, do they give your tests 0's as well? How does he grade something that was cheated?

There's a large chance that I'm severely overthinking everything, so I figured I should ask other people. Lemme know what you think.",16May2020,1

535,"So, my life is in a weird position right now. I graduated college last May and moved back home, as most of my friends did. I knew I wanted to go to grad school, but I decided I'd take a year in between to focus on other things. I got a part time job last summer and planned out my grad school applications so I'd be ready to apply when the time came.

Around the end of 2019 I ended up leaving the job I was working at, for several reasons. I wasn't particularly happy there (there were a fair amount of issues that I'd been dealing with and was looking for an excuse to leave), and decided I'd saved up a decent chunk of money and would be safe focusing entirely on my grad school applications for the time being. Apparently that paid off, and by the end of February I'd been accepted to several different schools. I decided on a program to attend and began looking out for interesting work or internships that could bring in a decent amount of money until I left in August.

Needless to say, I've been forced to reevaluate my plans over the past month or so due to the... well, you know. Anyway, I wasn't able to find anything before, and I'm certainly having a hard time finding something now. I'm in a weird position where any job I take is going to have to know that I'll be gone by August, so getting a ""real, adult"" job is probably not going to happen. I'm also on the lookout for more part time work, but obviously most businesses aren't in any real rush to be hiring new people right now. I'm going to try to find work while in grad school, obviously, but the problem with that is I'm going to school in another country, and from what I've seen most part time jobs there are restricted to people who speak the native language (I'm trying to learn, but it's not easy!).

I know I could always go to a grocery store or something, but the problem with that is I live in the same house as my 80 year old grandmother and my almost 60 year old parents, so getting a job at a grocery store seems kind of risky, especially since I live in one of the virus hotspots right now. I'd be genuinely worried about carrying something home to my family, and they're stressed out enough as it is right now.

I'm extremely privileged and fortunate enough right now to not be worrying about rent and food, like so many other people in the country. But I do also know that I'm likely going to need at least a bit more money by the time August roles around (grad school is expensive). Does anyone have any advice on what I could do? I'm going to keep looking at job postings, but I also want to prepare myself for if I can't find anything that would fit my timeframe.

536,"My boyfriend broke up with me yesterday. 

We called everyday, and when I called him yesterday, he told me that we should break up. 

I was shocked and I’m still in shock. 

He said we weren’t a 100% compatible. But who is? We have had small issues here and there. We could’ve talked about them. 

I asked him how long he’s been thinking about this. He thought about this for a few days. We’ve been together for nine months, and I was just hurt at the fact that it only took him a few days to end things on his end. He reassured me that he never took anything lightly regarding this. I’m not sure if I was reassured. 

he is quarantining alone and I am quarantining with my family. I wanted to stay where I was, instead of returning home. But I made the decision to go home, and maybe that was the wrong decision. I went home because my parents were not supposed to know about him, and they were beginning to be increasingly suspicious that I was unwilling to leave. I left because I wanted to continue the relationship. I figured it would be best to protect the relationship, continue on during quarantine, and get back together. 

(I kept this relationship from my family because they are extremely religious, and they would object and deny him. I didn’t want him to experience the hostility and estrangement I have felt at time with them)

He was struggling because he was alone. He thrives off of in-person interactions and he was alone. He started to lose who he was because of the anxieties of quarantine, and I felt the shift. Maybe I should’ve demanded us to talk about it. Maybe things would’ve been different. I wanted to be there, to constantly call and text and be in touch. But there are limitations to that, I guess. 

The least he could have done was to simply tell me that he feels like the relationship isn’t working, and that he wants to work together to make it work, right?
Am I too naive to believe that the least we could’ve done was to talk?

I have struggled with mental health for some time, and whenever he wanted to help me out during rough days, I refused because I didn’t want to be another burden he has to carry. I didn’t talk to him when things were rough for me, because I was scared that something would happen to our relationship if I did. I have a hard time trusting anyone fully because of past trauma. He felt helpless that he couldn’t help me, and I hurt him by pushing him away. 

He said there was nothing I could’ve done. I was not at fault, nobody was at fault, according to him. But I disagree. Yes, nobody was at fault, but there was something we could’ve done all along. 

I’m hurt at that he wasn’t even willing to try to make things work. I’m hurt that all of this was so sudden, and even though we “talked things out”, I am still confused, angry, and sad. 

When we had our last conversation yesterday, we talked about everything — issues that I’ve had, issues that he’s had, good times, bad times, how we feel about each other, everything. But why couldn’t that be the case before we broke up? If we had talked the same way we did yesterday, without the premise of breaking up, maybe things would’ve been different. 

I don’t know. I didn’t stop him from breaking up with me. Maybe I should have. I wanted to. But I am just so devastated that he didn’t even try to work the relationship through at his end. He simply gave up. 

When we talked it over, I realized we were honestly just thinking of each other had had each other’s best interest at heart the whole time. And in that way, we are very similar. I guess our considerations were at odds with each other. 

I want to call him and ask if it was even an option for me to object to this breakup. That’s probably a bad idea, right?",16May2020,1

Background information: My wife is a nurse (RN specifically) and will likely have no trouble finding a job no matter what. My profession is a slightly different story, though. I’m a substance abuse counselor, and my current company is losing around $1million/monthly because people are afraid to attend treatment under the scope of this virus. I’m concerned about my ability to find a job regarding when we decide to move. The state we are trying to move to is NOT the state we are from, though it is very close. We have considered the possibility of moving back to our home state for a SHORT (neither of us really wants to live there) period of time until we can find jobs in the state we intend to move to. Because of my upbringing, living in our home state for an extended period of time may prove quite detrimental for me.

I believe that it is more beneficial to ask to extend our lease for 6 months (until 02/28/2021) due to the projections that said virus may see improvements over the summer and have a serious uptick in the fall and winter. I’m concerned that I will be unable to find a job that pays more than minimum wage due to companies looking at the projections and feeling that it’s not worth it to hire new employees when clients in my field may be expected to decrease. I feel that if we move when our lease is up, we will have to go back to our home state and stay with family for a longer period of time until my industry feels more confident in hiring more professionals.

My wife believes that moving at the end of August will have no difference, or that we may be able to find jobs in our desired fields sooner, due to the fact that the end of August is still summer, when there’s expected to be a downtrend if cases of the virus. She doesn’t think companies will look at projections, and that we may be considering life with this virus on-and-off for several years, and waiting 6 months is, essentially, an indefinite extension of moving to the state we really want to live in.

Obviously, I feel more strongly about waiting until the end of February, but I’m open to suggestions. Does anyone have any good evidence/links/advice about which way is going to be less detrimental to proceed?

540,"So last night I was sitting in the backyard with my dog and he runs up to our back fence and starts barking at someone who is standing near it on the other side. I see through the fence that this person has a bag of something she is pouring up against the fence that my dog could easily put his nose under and eat.

So I said, ""Hi there, I'm sorry but what are you putting on the ground."" No answer, so I repeat myself and the woman keeps doing it. This goes on, and she keeps ignoring me so I walk up to the fence and I said ""excuse me but what is that you're putting on the lawn?"" Right to her face.

She goes, ""it's none of your business what I do on my own property."" I said I was concerned about my dog eating whatever it was and she goes ""Well I'm soooo sorry I disturbed your dog."" Really rudely. So I was just like, ""whatever have a good night."" And she's tells me that I'm unbelievable??

Anyways I bring my dog inside and get my husband and we go back out to see what it was and it was a bag of nasty moldy shredded cheese (which my dog could easily get to and eat). So we put some barricades up but I'm a little nervous now.

Why would this person pour moldy cheese up against our fence? Was she actually feeding my dog or just dumping out cheese (and our garbage day was yesterday) What should I do if anything?",16May2020,1
541,"Feels weird to write it since it completely forgot about this or rather supressed this memory. Recent stuff made it pop up again and I feel really bad about it becouse it's something the man I am or should be rather shouldnt do. Also English is not my primary language and im not in the best state rn. Also while reading this I feel dumber than ever. 

Short backround story: my ex gf (then 15) and me (then 17) were together for 3 months, was first relationship for both of us. We weren't perfect, she cheated, I was a dick and didnt understand her issues, ultimately broke up becouse she had some issues and didnt want anyone close to her. Still had a great time together.

Like year later we randomly met and decided to walk a while together since we live really close. Ended with is making out and got touchy. Yes im dumb, we were both lonely. We both didnt intend this originally but took the risk basically. Nothing more happened though 

Later again something similar happened. At least that's what I thought. While cuddling she started to feel my abs, now knowing without any sexual interest. I though of it differntly and assumed she wants to repeat it. I was down for that so thought I could do so too. She said she didnt want to. I was fine with that too but then she cant touch me. Went back and forth etc. 

Ultimately I just touched her boobs although she said she didnt want to. She tried to take my hands away but I said if you keep touching me I ll touch you too and put my hands back. Idk if you can call it physically overpowering but I guess so. I was significantly stronger and at least 40kg heavier. Could say she isnt better but on the other hand I didnt mind to be touched in contrast to her. We never made a big deal about it or even mention it again. We had some small talk since then but never met again either. Never really seemed hostile or did she sound offended or anything at all. So I didnt think it was a big deal, we just forget about it. 

Now 2 years later recently had a talk with a friend, basically how common sexual harassment is for young women. She said everyone experiences it,  even if it's "" just"" some guy grabbing her ass. Take it and move becouse they cant do anything about it anyway and it just is what it is. That is just sad. Thinking if something like that happens to a friend of mine that guy has a serious problem and some teeth less. This shouldnt be common. It shouldnt be a case of take it and move on. That's exactly why it happens that much. There's no consequences for the guys doing that. 

But then I remembered that incident... Am I a part of the problem? Probably. At least that one time. And I cant take it back again. This isnt a question of am I the asshole. I am. But should I just let it be and dont remember her or text her (personal meeting isnt possible) bring it up, discuss what happened and apologize? 


Tl,dr: ex gf sexually harrassed each other? Idk it was weird but I was worse, possibly quite a bit. So especially asking for womens opinion, let it be or contact her and say something?",16May2020,1
542,"I am autistic and was diagnosed very late in my life. I am unable to understand social cues, facial expressions, and Micro expressions. 

My interests and work are also cubicle based. So it never pushed me to interact with people. 

I also has a fall out with my friends because while comforting them when they were recovering from a loss (before quarantine), I ended up sounding sarcastic / creepy which angered them instead. They lashed out at me real bad. I had no idea I was coming across so off putting and felt horrible about it. 
So I severed all ties with them (not their fault) because I was ashamed and embarrassed of facing them. 

What's done is done now. But going forward, I need guidance as to how can I improve myself and my social skills. How to read micro expressions and develop emotional intelligence as an autistic person.

543,"I work for a princess party business, where I act as various Disney princesses for birthday parties and events. For some reason, a rival party company has made it their goal to try and discredit my company, which is very disheartening because we’re brand new and I’m the ONLY princess currently in employment. The owner of the rival company started out just posting statuses on her own Facebook feed about us, which was fine because only her friends could see that, but last night she made a fake Facebook account and went onto my business’s page to leave a nasty review (dropping our ratings), recommending everyone go to her party place instead, and then began arguing with people in the comments who had actually booked events with us and were offended by the review. Both my boss and I tried reporting the fake account, but Facebook responded with an automatic form claiming the user “did not violate community guidelines.” Also, my boss blocked her but somehow she could continue commenting. The review and subsequent arguments look extremely unprofessional, our ratings dropped from the 0-star review, Facebook seemingly won’t do anything about it, and I’m sure she’ll continue to make fake accounts and try to discredit us.

546,"im going thru lots of emotions right now

mixed feeling about everything

&amp;#x200B;

seeing her pictures fuck me up tbh.

not my ex or anything

not even my crush

i dont even know

&amp;#x200B;

basically it fucks me up mentally

she looks so fucking bad (in the best way possible) on her instagram

&amp;#x200B;

it makes me feel weird

&amp;#x200B;

backstory: kinda liked her, she liked me back. but nothing verbal. (things take place at college btw)

everything was going on nonverbally

first of all, she DEF like me, like, just so yall know, cuz you might think that im being delusional.

used to look at me, when i wasnt looking. used to put herself in a spot were i could look at her. once even responded to my question, which wasn't even directed to her. was pretty awkward ngl. used to brush against me while walking by when there was tons of fucking space. whenever i used to look at her she felt flattered, like used to walk more confidently, etc. tho, sometimes couldn't even look my way, was just shy.

basically, now that im seeing her pics, its fucking me up.

im sure that she's not that hot IRL, cause i would 100% know, trust me.

but, it doesnt help

&amp;#x200B;

it feels like i shouldn't have missed that opportunity. 

but honestly, i've felt like this a lot. feelings used to brew up, then i'd see her in real life, and ""meh"". all the feelings were gone in a fucking second. that's what fucks  me up. i know that i'll be dissapointed, so i dont want to go crazy over her.

obviously, havent seen her in a while, cause of quarantine.

i do share one class with her, but, its hard to pick up on any ""signal"" online. 

basically, i dont even know how she feels about me anymore. and ngl, if she don't care, its gonna fuck me up. and that thought fucks me up.

at this point, and i think in general too, i think its not even about her, but my ego. i just want to be liked by everyone. and the thought that she may not even like me anymore triggers me so much. makes me angry.

i dont even know

sometimes, well, rn, i even think that im not good enough.

i am btw, but yea, instagram aint REAL life, so whatever.

but again, its not about her, but me, i know sounds kinda out of place. but, its about my ego..

&amp;#x200B;

then another thing kicks in, which i know might sound stupid. but sometimes i think that she only liked me cause i looked at her, or just made her feel pretty. which, again, doesnt sit well with my ego. tbh, i kinda doubt it, but if its the case, nah, im good. 

and, basically, yea, that shit does trigger me. like, it still goes down to no one gives a fuck about me type of feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

honestly, i've ended up alone.

im known and shit, pretty social

but still lonely asf

havent been hit up by anyone in so long.

god, im confused asf

i dont even know what to feel",16May2020,1

549,"Hi guys,

my shift work has 3 shifts (6 to 14, 14 to 22, 21.30 to 5.30) but it has no shift cycle! 

Thus: no week is the same as the other one, it's just random with some rules in the planing software but basically feels like RNG. Also, best case I know my working days 3 month prior; worst case 1 month prior (but for sure you have to use all your vacation days at the start of the year based on a yet non-existing plan) 

3 shifts from Monday to Friday; and then 2 shifts for Saturday/Sunday (no night shifts). One of the reasons why we can't put up a cycling shift schedule. 

The company is based in Germany, pharma industry. 

No cycle feels like a big no-go for me. You never know what to expect. How do you guys think about it? Any advice? I can't assess how much protest this is worth for since we're all first time shift-workers in the operating group.

550,"Hey there. So even before covid I lived on a yacht with just my partner and our cats traveling. It can be quite isolating at times. Much like that everyone is going through at the moment.
Anyway. Due to covid, and not being able to sail and see sights it's become quite mundane. We got stranded in quite a boring metropolitan port. My partner has also unfortunately developed depression which he is dealing with.
Due to these reasons I find myself quite lonely without much to do socially. I study French and croation, meditate, make movies, paint, garden, fish etc. I have many hobbies I still continue to do, but it's the lack of healthy socialization that is starting to weigh on me.

551,"So about 2 years ago I broke up with my boyfriend but I still feel absolutely terrible about it. I was planning on breaking up with him for a while when I realized I wasn’t truly satisfied with the relationship but I don’t know why it’s so complicated just to be honest for me, I guess I didn’t want to hurt his feelings but it was something I was gonna have to do eventually anyways. Instead of outright telling him that I didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore, I redownloaded all my dating apps and started talking to other guys. I didn’t have plans to talk to other guys actively while still dating him, I guess I just wanted to be on the next boat with a relationship fresh out of this one although that’s still shitty now that I think about it. Long story short, he found out and I can tell that it hurt him and that he was upset about it, we talked for a while and ended it. Fast forward to now I still talk to him and he talks to me about his new boyfriend who is very problematic but that’s none of my business. He told me that he downloads dating apps frequently to see if his man is on there and it absolutely hurts me to the core that I’m most likely the reason for him doing that. Everytime I talk to him I’m reminded of the way that I hurt him and the way I handled the situation poorly but I don’t want to stop talking to him, because he did absolutely nothing wrong and it’d be fucked up to just dip out of nowhere. I guess the advice I need is how do I forgive myself because clearly it doesn’t bother him anymore but I can’t stop thinking about the way I did him.",16May2020,1

555,"This is a problem that has been on my mind for a long, long time. Last year, I met these two friends online and we clicked quite well. They were already friends a few months prior to meeting me but they still accepted me and we all simply started to talk like that pretty much everyday. However, personally, I suffer with a few mental illnesses such as anxiety/social anxiety disorder as well as depression (my anxiety is a lot more prominent, however) so often I would take breaks when I didn’t feel okay about something or just to let my mind calm down and feel fine again. They were supportive of me and still are to this day. I can see the love they have for me and I have a lot of love for them, too. They’ve always respected my boundaries as well such as when I say I don’t want to join in on phone calls due to my anxiety over phone calls/video calls.

It’s just that, recently, things have changed. I’ve noticed some toxic patterns in their behaviour but, at the same time, I don’t know if it’s toxic and I’m just overreacting or something. Keep in mind, I’m not saying that THEY are toxic I simply mean that their certain behaviours are.

I have this certain group of artist that I love and adore. They’ve changed my world, their music has helped me in endless ways possible and even though people have differing views, it never stopped me from disliking or drawing away from their sound and message. My friends, however, used to be a fan of this certain artist but isn’t anymore yet I always see them saying toxic shit and always bringing them up in a negative light (even when they know that I still love this group). 

They always compare them to certain artists that they enjoy and say “___ is so much uglier than ___.” or “why are they so ugly now?”. I’ve even heard them say hurtful things to an artist they claim to enjoy saying that their face looks “starved to the bone” and proceeding to laugh at it. I told them it wasn’t right and that body shaming is fucked up. By body shaming, I don’t even mean JUST the body. The face is a part of the body and making fun of appearances is just fucked up overall. When I tried calling them out on it they simply told me I was overreacting and that I needed to chill.

That hurt me a lot. I was just trying to say that what they were doing and saying wasn’t nice at all but I got pushed back down and it made me feel like shit. I still stand by my own words — jokes to do with appearances aren’t funny at all. 

Sometimes they’re hypocritical about things. There was someone shaming a famous person for her body saying she was flat and shit and my two friends were getting angry at how this person was shaming a girl for their body when they LITERALLY just done it but with a male; comparing them to another celebrity, calling them ugly and shit.

I’ve cried over this multiple times. I feel as if it has a negative impact on me when they say these things about other people.. even unconsciously. As someone who suffers and has severely suffered from self image, this sort of atmosphere makes me feel low and my mental health has been all over the place; I really don’t know what to do.

Another thing is that they handle conflict in a negative way. They always get aggressive at other people because they can’t control their own emotions which is triggering for someone like me (I like to stay calm in these situations) because I dislike it when people argue back and forth as I have experienced a bad home life with this sort of behaviour. They’re always trying to involve themselves in some sort of conflict which I understand because I would try and stand up for something I believed in, however, they always use irrational ways to get their points across. I dislike that a lot.

If you haven’t noticed, the certain group I’ve been talking about is very popular right now. They have many talented members, however, it is also known that their vocal line is not the best in this industry. I know that; I’m not a delusion fan who won’t accept things that are true. However, their rap line is amazing so it does add up to the balance. 

This isn’t the member’s fault. Their company doesn’t allow them to get proper vocal training and it really worries me especially one certain member as he often becomes unstable during live performances (they have to sing and dance) and I feel scared that his vocal chords could become very damaged one day.

That being said, he is not a bad singer at all. I adore his voice. He has a very unique vocal colour (even if his technique may not be the best) and I usually go more for softer voices that make me feel a certain way than a strong powerhouse which may not give me that sort of effect. 

Those two friends are constantly negative about this group and this certain member saying he can’t sing, he can’t dance etc.. which is a stretch because he CAN sing he just may not be the best vocalist in the entire industry. His dance, however, is phenomenal so I feel as if they just nitpick at every bad thing all the time rather than saying something good and positive. They always bring this group up and their fans even when the topic doesn’t surround them and they then  become passive aggressive which hurts me so much because they know I still like this group. I can’t even express my own love for the artists to them anymore because I’m afraid of the judgement and afraid of each back handed compliment. 

I just feel so uncomfortable around them recently and I don’t understand if I’m overreacting or not. Every person I’ve shared my concern to has told me to cut them off. Do I message them first? Or do I just completely block them out without a word? I don’t know.

I’m sorry that this is getting so long but there is just one last thing; the three of us know a certain girl and my friends don’t particularly like her because of what she done to me and one out of my friends. I don’t dislike her because even if she confused me and I didn’t understand some of her actions, I still trusted her in a friend ship way. She never disrespected me for what I enjoy. She never made fun of people’s looks or degraded people so I found myself finding comfort in her in that manner. She did something crappy (which I don’t think she ever did on purpose although it still doesn’t make it right) but i also could see the good side in her. 

Again, she never degraded anyone for their appearance, never said something passive aggressive about something that I love so O found trust in her in that aspect. I didn’t have anyone to go to or share my problems to. she was the last straw and i was having such a crappy time, my mental health being at the lowest that I kind of just had to tell her; I had to tell someone and she was the only one I could tell that actually know my two friends and have interacted. please don’t think i was betraying anyone. It still makes me feel as if I betrayed my friends though and I don’t know how to feel about it. I just had to tell someone otherwise I think i’d lose it and feel worse. 

What should I do?",16May2020,1

557,"Hey, I'm new here, my name is Hayden (15m). This morning I wanted to go out for a run, to practice for cross-country over the summer. I was putting my shoes and running attire on, and she said nothing about it (She was talking about something else we had a disagreement on.) Only when I said ""I'll be right back"" and she noticed my clothes, is when she said something about it. I just told her that I wanted to run around the neighborhood a bit, by myself. In short, she didn't like it one bit. She suggested that I could run while she followed me in a car, or just let her run with me. I've never asked her if I could go running alone before, so I understand her suspicion on that front, BUT we live in a very large and SAFE neighborhood, and she knows I have friends who run alone that are female and much smaller than me! (not to be disrespectful) My mom picked up on my anger and said: ""It was too close to the last time I told you no."" What she meant by that was: Our little disagreement was because she thought I was lying to her about buying a game (even though I showed her pictures, a screen recording of me buying it and what it does AND the receipts)
I mention over and over that I show her everything and she still thinks I'm lying to her because shes uneducated about technology (she's purchased it at least 5 times prior)

558,"I hope the title isn't misleading but I wanted to keep it short and concise:

So yesterday my dad who lives overseas requested that I buy him these glucose blood test strips that he can't find where he lives, and to bring them when I next come visit. He sent me a picture of the packaging and I thought nothing of it and said sure. Anytime I go visit I always bring various pharmacy items for him and my mom so it was nothing out of the ordinary.

That evening I was just having casual conversation with my husband and I mentioned I had to go to the pharmacy to get them, and he looked at me kind of weird and said he didn't realize my dad was diabetic. So I looked at him kind of weird and asked what he meant by that? Apparently my dummy ass didn't realize that those strips are to test blood sugar levels and that they're primarily used for diabetics. I've always known high blood pressure runs in the family on my paternal side so he checks his pressure a lot at home, but he's never told us he has diabetes, nor do I think that's something he would hide from his family.

So I guess I need advice on if I should say anything to him? I feel stupid for not realizing and just carrying on the conversation as normal but maybe he didn't want me to say anything? Is this something I can talk to my siblings about, I mean should I even be worried? 

I'm trying not to freak out but I don't know a lot about diabetes or how severe it is or how it will impact his life, so I just need to know if I even need to make it a big deal in my head.",16May2020,1

560,"Hi, I am on mobile, sorry for that in advance. Any grammar errors in general, that’s my bad. 


No idea, if y’all do TW’s here, but if you do; Trauma, Abuse, mention of PTSD

Hi, this might be long, I apologize. I guess for context I start by telling you why I am feeling the way I am feeling. 3-4 years ago I was abused, mentally, emotionally, physically, sexually, by my now-ex boyfriend. He’s a sex-offender now but not by my doing, and because I didn’t report when it happened I have feelings of guilt and like what I went through with him isn’t as bad as others have went through with him. I bottled all that up and continued high school and then I graduated and started college. I was fine until last year when ex had tried to hurt someone new and they pressed charges and now he’s a free individual labeled as a sex offender. Since that happened, in November, I have since lost a best friend I had for 13 years because they kept making posts about me and mutual old coworkers and now I barely have a conversation with anyone else two times a week. This has caused me to start feeling like the 3 friends I do have left, or had, don’t actually care about me or just don’t want to deal with me anymore, causing thoughts that I normally wouldn’t have, outside of having flashbacks. 

Forgot to mention, I started therapy late March, early April. It feels like we haven’t made any progress at all and my therapist is only telling me things that I am already aware of. 

Any and all advice is helpful. If you need any more information to help me further, within reason, I’ll be happy to give more. Thanks in advance.",16May2020,1

562,"I'm female and 16 (youngest of 2 children). Since I was around 7 my mum and and dad wpuld yell at me constantly for the smallest things and blame the arguements on me. At around 14 yrs old my dad stopped yelling at me but my mum continued. She also yelled at my brother but no where near as much as she does to me. Aside from yelling and argueing with me constantly, she also treats me like she's a school girl. The other days we were on a skype call with my grandmother and i would say something and my mum woukd say stuff to my grandmother which would make my statement negative if that makes sense. I woukd say i went for a walk and my mum woukd say something like yeah but you've only been on 1 walk whilst i've gone for a walk everyday.

I play for a football club and my mum comes very rarely. At the beginning of the sessions we have to do laps and of course i'm panting after all of that and after the session my mum woukd boast about how she runs way more than me at the gym and is completely fine. She'll also say things which she knows will annoy me but knows I can't say anything back and she'll do this with an exageratted smile on her face.

Earlier we got into a screaming match because i accidently left some water drops on the floor in the bathroom and I tried following some advice my friend gave me to give my mother neutral answers like ""okay"" or agreeing with my mum even when she's wrong but my mum still continued to scream at me.

My brother has pointed out several times about how toxic our famiky is but our parents deny it.

What can I do to stop this because at this point I'm tempted to just walk out of the house.",16May2020,1

564,"I’m wearing a wrist brace on the worse one atm, but it’s making me realize how aching/dull the other wrist feels. 

I made a huge mistake, but if I don’t keep this job I’m in serious trouble.  It’s seasonal, and ends in September, but I’ve been told they’ll probably keep me on. The problem is, I’m working in a department where I’m constantly lifting half or more of my body weight... and I’m not very strong. 

I want to ask for a department transfer, although I’ve come to like and appreciate the department I’m in. However I do not think they will need/approve of me asking this, considering I was hired to fill a seasonal role in the first place. I’m looking for new employment but it’s always been hard for me to secure a job. 


Anyway, I really need some advice. I’ve told no one that my wrists are hurt, although I’m sure someone is going to ask today. I do not know what I will say. I do not know how to proceed, either. All I know is that I probably can’t keep throwing around concrete bags for very long.",16May2020,1
565,"I've wanted to become a programmer/software engineer since I discovered my passion and talent for it in year 9. At that time it was the only subject I was actually good at (that actually had job prospects) so I decided that was what I wanted to do. I have ADHD predominantly inattentive and was only diagnosed in the last semester of year 12, so I had serious issues with procrastination, concentration and disorganisation, so I was doing poorly in all my classes despite being a bright kid. I only did well in classes that I enjoyed, so when I got an amazing maths teacher in year 9, my grades for maths went from Ds to As. Ever since, I've been a math boi. I took a double major of the two hardest math courses in years 11&amp;12, partly because it boosted my grades, and partly because I ""enjoyed"" it. By the end of year 12 I was a maths tutor and my passions had expanded to maths, programming, teaching and psychology. Psychology and teaching are heavily involved as one is studying the brain and the other is teaching the brain.

&amp;#x200B;

I never really considered maths teaching. I just always thought of maths as a subject that I like that gets me phat grades. It carried me into the best university in my country. I'm now almost finished with my first semester and I want out honestly. I'm very good at avoiding thinking about things I don't want to think about, but 4 all-nighters in a row broke that down. I decided to question everything and I truly realised that I'm not that likely to enjoy being a programmer. With this pandemic I've been sitting at a computer for 7-8 hours a day and I do not like it. The more I look into what it's like, the less I want to do it. I'd much rather walk from class to class, stand in a classroom talking to students, get fresh air, have regular holidays etc. I'm actually a maths tutor and I really enjoy it. I know it's not the exact same and I don't think every step will be a breeze, but I actually know what being a maths teacher is like because I've been around them. An added benefit is that my tutoring and my teaching degree would benefit eachother. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also suddenly went ""wait a second, why do I care how much money I make?"" There's no scoreboard at the end of life, the only thing that matters is that you had fun, and if the extra money you make doesn't make you as happy as getting that money made you unhappy, I don't see any point. Maths teachers are paid more than enough to get by easily, and past that point, who cares? Until I realised I could be a maths teacher, my main reason for trying to make a lot of money was that I could work less. I was just watching youtube and the guy I was watching mentioned he wanted to become a maths teacher purely for the holidays and then it hit me. My uni doesn't offer education degrees, but the regional uni where I live (which has better employment rates and, from what I've heard, better teaching) offers a double degree of seconday education / maths and IT which is literally a perfect fit for me. More or less my four biggest passions in one job that pays well, has lots of holidays and doesn't require you to be in an office all day.

&amp;#x200B;

They always say ""the grass is always greener on the other side"" but I think it should be taken as a cautionary saying, rather than ""never change anything."" My friends are supportive of my change but I know my parents won't be. I talked to my mum about it and she thinks I should stick to it, but honestly, I do not want to spend another 3.5 years going through this hell if I'm even slightly confident that I'll enjoy it. Obviously I'm going to finish this semester and cool off before I make any big decisions but I'd like to hear your guys' opinions on it.",16May2020,1
566,"A few months ago my roommate and I had a discussion about who would stay in the apartment and who would leave when we decide to go our separate ways this year. I told them when they first moved in that our agreement to live together would probably be 3-4 years, until I was ready to live on my own again or with my partner. It will be three years by September, which is when I’d like to live with my partner. 

Last my roommate and I discussed this, they said it was too early to tell what they wanted to do. I told them if they absolutely needed a place to stay, they could use the apartment and I would move out. My roommate reassured me that they probably wouldn’t need to stay here as they also have family and a partner to stay with, but they thanked me for offering and said we could talk about it closer to the date we discussed. 

Since this conversation, my partner and I realized it would be best for us to stay in my apartment, and the date set has moved up to August. I have about three months left to either find an apartment elsewhere (so far no luck, nothing close enough to my employer or affordable enough since I have pets). 

My roommate doesn’t seem like they’ve been looking for a new residence either. How do I tell them I’d like to keep the apartment after I’ve already given them a choice? More importantly, how do I do it without sounding like a dick?",16May2020,1
567,"This started off great slowly has taken a huge dive. So some of the back story my friend ""claims"" to work all these hours but our friends group reaches out to me to ask why I'm not hanging out with them all (because I go home and take care of my house) next he's become fixed on a gym down the street I understand hobbies but all of this has taken a priority over our house. He doesn't clean at all he just finally started taking the trash out because I told him it's not fair he doesn't do anything which he won't unless he's told by me to do it. I pretty much did the entire process of getting the house aside from his signatures even our realtor commented on how scary it was he didn't care. It's so bad he's ruined his bedroom carpet and probably hasn't cleaned it in the 13 months we've lived here. At the beginning his mom was coming here and cleaning his room/Bathroom doing his laundry and he was bragging about it which should've been a red flag.
I had to ask one of roommates to leave because he refused to clean because ""the other home owner never did and was dirty""
He now doesn't help with the yard we have a lot of weed problems and our flower beds are fucked. We have a gaint hole in the back yard full of water for a concrete footer that was supposed to be poured last year because he didn't wanna pay someone to do it but I'm at my wit's end he doesn't clean while my roommate and girlfriend started a full scrub of the house and he proceeded to tell us he's going to get a dirt bike this weekend. I CANT DO IT 

The reason I'm here is because technically I could take the house from him and cut him a check for ""the financial parts he's helped with. (AKA down payment and monthly mortgage"" which is what I really want to do to give him a wake up call. But I can't bring my self to fuck over a friend but I can't deal with the bullshit from him I need out of this situation it's causing too much extra stress if I had known he was gonna lie through his teeth I wouldn't have done it. 

Please give me honest thoughts.",16May2020,1
568,"Lost my job and will lose my apartment, as I cannot pay rent anymore. My boyfriend immediately offered to let me stay with him, at no cost, as I'd be out on the streets otherwise and would have to live in my car. Due to the circumstances I don't qualify for any kind of financial aid.

Thankfully my boyfriend has a well-paying job and a house - helping me out won't put a financial strain on him and he is glad to be able to help. I'm very grateful. 

The problem is, we aren't exactly good at living together and we will most likely not survive a single week. I'm wondering if someone has been in a similar situation and could share some tips on how they managed not to murder each other? 

We don't have a conventional relationship. We don't usually spend a lot of time together because after like 2 days we get on each other's nerves. He has issues with impulse control and I can get impatient, and the fights we have over stupid things then are not fun at all even though we love each other. Since we are aware of this though, we've somehow managed to spend 3 wonderful years together - by carefully managing the amount of time we spend together. 

Ok, so the following are the main issues.  
\- Food:  
He usually doesn't eat during the day and he doesn't stock up on food items. He goes grocery shopping every evening and then decides what he wants to have for dinner, and then cooks at night. All attempts at getting him to eat at more socially acceptable times have failed. I could of course just make lunch by myself in theory, but during the day he doesn't have groceries at home, and I don't have money to buy my own groceries, so I can only have dinner when he shares with me.   
He doesn't have food at home during the day because he tends to simply eat everything within an hour if it's there. So even if I could get my own groceries, I'd have to hide them from him and that seems awfully terrible. Plus, I don't want to be ungrateful by asking if he'll give me money to buy my own groceries. Any ideas? 

And then, even when he does make dinner, he often forgets about me or can't stop himself from eating everything. It's not that he minds sharing. Quite the opposite. But if I'm not right there to remind him that I'm hungry too he'll completely forget. So when I stay with him I'm usually at the point of starving, which is both really funny and sad. He doesn't do it on purpose but it's still a problem.  
For example last night I accidentally fell asleep while he was making dinner. He woke me up an hour later to apologize for eating all of it before he woke me up.

\- Sleep / personal space:  
We have very different ideas about the importance of uninterrupted sleep and alone time. When I'm around he only sleeps around 3-4 hours max and sometimes not at all. But I need a solid 8 hours to be a useful human being. Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but he wants all of my attention at pretty much all times and gets so excited that me sleeping soundly doesn't stop him from waking me up to tell me he just saw a squirrel outside. Sometimes he lets me nap in peace, but an actual good night's rest is impossible. I can only go so long on 20-minute naps though before I start to get cranky.

Any ideas to make living together go smoother?

569,"My life sucks, I feel so horrible. Just this year I was diagnosed with melanoma, but I can’t go into the dermatologist to get the surgery because of corona. I started to get an unhealthy mindset of someone. And just today I had to help hold down my cat as we euthanized her. I’m not a good person. My mom fell down off a lager and broke her shoulder, it was a lot of money, money that was hard to get. Money that I used up too, if I wasn’t here they wouldn’t have to pay for so much food or haircuts or anything for me. I feel so guilty. My mom already has a bad neck and needed surgery for it by putting in screw supports, they all broke. 

In sixth grade I was a bully, and to the day I still regret it, I feel so horrible about myself. I bullied that kid everyday to the point where he didn’t come back in seventh grade. He had a friend in sixth grade that I was friends with for a long time too, she hates me now. I can’t even bring myself to talk to her to explain myself, there’s really no point. In seventh grade I blew everything off and tried shutting people out because I knew I was a horrible person. In eight grade I started a migraine medicine that completely changed my personality. I was like sixth grade me all over again but worse. I remember throwing a rock at a sixth grader head. Getting in fights, and even breaking some kids glasses when he stole my watch. That was bad because he was blind without them, so they were expensive that I had to pay for. I almost got kicked out of school and my high school before I even went. But at least they took me off the medicine. 

In my freshman year I made friends with an old friend from my elementary. We talked a lot and it was nice getting connected again. But her best friend was the friend that didn’t like me because of what I did in sixth grade. So I think she thinks I’m a bad person. When I was really feeling down I asked her out because I just wanted someone in my life who I knew I could rely on. She turned me down, and she should have, I’m not a good person. I’m so selfish through all of that, I took took took. I feel horrible. I know I’m not depressed, but I’m always so tired. I just want to sleep and never wake up, be in a dream forever.",16May2020,1

It's like i have all the information I need to know but I can't remember it. It feels like im in a game that I am an unknowing participant of. It goes through all these steps and think I'm going through them too. It was like an intro to the game and how to tell the signs uf you're a player and if others are players. These thoughts and so many more have been in my head for the past month. I feel like the girl I'm with I don't love but I moved here for her and college. I feel disconnected from her. I think the song said something about how the first one hurts the worst. I need help, I've been stuck in that trip and i can't get out of it. I feel like I'm a mimic trying to persuade people to trust me so i can betray them later after i get what i want.

Now I’m asking help in deciding what type of desk to get. I know I’d prefer a wood color over white. I’ve added some photos to show everyone what I am working around. The bedside stand is likely to end up going, it’s there temporarily until I restrain another stand (same color as dresser). So keep that in mind. Please don’t judge my room and it’s clutter ness 😂😂. 

I currently like my room set up with bed where it is, and mirror where it is (I get great lighting over there). I also need certain things next to outlets. Only have 2. So when I get a desk, it will go under my window likely. I’d like it to match the chair I already have.

575,"So basically, I had a biology exam at home since my exam was cancelled and they need to provide evidence to the exam board. We did this on google docs. I submitted the file, downloading it as a docx file.

I realise 3 days after that I missed a question in the version that I submitted. I completed the sub question on my docx file in that moment, which made me even more angry at myself. So, I unsubmitted my paper and reuploaded the docx file, editing the google docs file to match.

I then feel immediately guilty. Literally immediately. I felt so bad, but I didn't know what to do. I removed the edit from all versions and submit the original but still as a docx file with a small message explaining the situation and for him to give me zero marks on that sub question. However, I wanted to resubmit the docx file, but then he'd see my attempt at cheating in the document history. I restored the previous version of the file as proof.

However, my school is strict and I have never cheated before. My grades are fairly high. I feel like calling my teacher and telling him that I feel guilty, and that for him to give me zero marks just to drive it home and get it off my chest, but knowing the teacher I messed with, he will email my parents and two other teachers involved with me.

What do I do? I'm scared to death, my heart is heavy. I never did that before. I swear on my life. Every past exam I've ever done, I did it legitimately. I feel so bad, and so guilty, but it's so silly. I risked everything for four marks. I feel so shit, I don't know what to do. Help? Please? Should I call him?

I never had sex before due to alot of insecurities about my body and how I look, I used to be alot fatter than I'm now so I have stretch marks and black thighs which is very embarrassing for me.. 

So, one day she invited me over to have sex and I wasn't sure what to do, I came in like a minute or a little bit longer and I was so embarrassed and I just wanted to hide... 

We did it like 2-3 times and we were both a little bit tipsy, afterwards she was turned off nd then we cuddled until she fell asleep but I was just laying there and wishing if I could disappear... 

So, we talked about it, I apologised many times and then in Feb I had my friend's house keys and we sneaked there, I was even more nervous than the first time because we had to sneak and everything was as scary as it could get, we started with some foreplay and then I got her really horny that she was dripping, then once I'm in I came in a couple of seconds and god I hoped at that moment that I would just die... 

Afterwards she tried to BJ me, I tried to do everything but I couldn't get a hard on until she fell asleep... when she slept I just watched some porn and here I am with a boner again and then I started rubbing my D against her she woke up and started sucking me off, I came again so fast and I lost my boner.. couldn't get it back, the whole experience was in a very nerve wracking situation and she wouldn't just slow it down... 

She ended up cheating on me and we broke up.. 

However, ever since I have been feeling devastated and my self-esteem has crumbled.

Fortunately, my boyfriend does not reciprocate in any suggestive way and I am very grateful for that. 

I guess I’m still insecure though because this was the straw that broke the camels back. Lol. And now I can’t stop seeing all the pretty girls at work and I guess...getting jealous?

Of course there are attractive people out there in the world and I can’t forbid him from looking around him LOL. But the idea of him seeing soooo many other beautiful girls honestly hurts me.

Right away, I knew I was going to want a fur buddy soon because the loneliness was weird and depressing. I was so fortunate to have a connection to an adoption center where a sweet girl cat was recommended to me. I picked her up yesterday. She is 10 or 11 years old, not entirely sure.

We had a family kitty for the last few years that I lived at my mom's house, and I loved her to death (still do of course). So cats are by no means foreign to me, but I'm still pretty anxious about my new life as a pet-owner.

Back home, the family cat slept in the garage most of the time, so having a cat sleep in my room with me is very new. She stayed under the bed for the entirety of daylight hours yesterday, but emerged for some exploring right as I was getting in bed.

I already have some sleeping issues due to anxiety, and this was made much worse by her prowling around. It's not only physically disruptive, but I just worry about her causing trouble when she moves around the room. I'm worried that she will throw up or potty somewhere on my bed or floor. I know those are pretty much irrational concerns, especially since she has access to her litter box in the bathroom (which I leave open). But I'm very afraid of a mess being made of my new apartment, and of being kept up every single night when I need good sleep now more than I ever have.

Over the course of time, I have learnt to discard my sorrow but it has come at a cost. My emotional threshold has expanded although now when I reach a breaking point, I don't recede into myself and cry but rather snap more aggressively.

I wanted to knock him out bad but I don’t want to go to jail. 

So I got up and left. My friend, Jeff just sat there. Didn’t say a word. The next day Jeff and I were in class and I didn’t mention anything. We were normal. But again we ran into Lyell and I told him how gross it was for him to say something like that and wanted an apology. Now whenever I confront someone and am trying my best not to snap my hand becomes shaky. I don’t like fighting like I used to when I was younger. I hurt a kid bad and I just don’t like it. However Lyell was laughing and caught my hand shaking. He thought I was scared of him. I just cussed him out and that was the end of that. Anytime I saw him after that I would ignore. 

About a week later me and Jeff were talking and Lyell and another friend of Jeff’s asked him to go to lunch with them. So he took off and went with them. That stung pretty bad. 

However I let that go. Jeff and I were partners and I needed to think about my grade. But throughout the year anytime I would see Lyell he would try to mess with me. I just ignored. I even told Jeff that “I just feel bad for the lad. He’s not going anywhere in life”

Anyways I transferred to a school north east the following semester. While Jeff moved to a new good school. Lyell still stayed in the old school. 

We stayed in contact after we left. However Lyell would visit Jeff a lot. And Jeff would tell me this a lot. It got to the point where I asked him not to talk to me anymore about him. But he didn’t get the message and would still post snaps about Lyell visiting him. Or tell me about him. 

I had enough. I told him that I don’t feel comfy being friends with someone with bad friends. He told me he wouldn’t choose friends over someone cause I didn’t like them. And that’s not for me to decide. I told him “fair enough. I’ll make your decision easier then. Wish you all the best, bud” 

I blocked him. I didn’t think much about him. I continued school till one day I got a snap from him. Even though I had blocked him it just appeared. 

When I opened it I saw snaps from the past after I had blocked him. Just of him asking how I was and all. The most recent being days prior. So I responded and he replied. We talked but I didn’t feel comfy so I told him he made his choice. 

He began getting remorseful and said that he was sorry and to “please take him back” and that he wants to “show me how he’s changed” he also mentioned how him and Lyell fell apart since Lyell was very disrespectful towards his other friends. He told me “I tried to make you both like eachother but in the process I lost two good friends” further saying “he knows who his good friends are and won’t let me down” 

I told him I’d think about it. Couple days later I decided to forgive. We have begun talking as usual and even met up for dinner. He is always very respectful to me now. 

But for some reason I still feel like I’m not being a good brother if I continue being friends. 

Am I overthinking?

TLDR: has a fight with a friend. He apologized yet I don’t feel good talking to him.",16May2020,1
587,"Hiya,

I'm a confident, decent 15 Year old guy and I by no means live a bad life. However, I feel like I'm not fully in with my friendship group, and I'd like some advice on how to work on it.

To give some context - growing up I generally hung with the less popular kids, we were all happy with each other and had a very fun time. Unlike at some schools, the less popular kids weren't bullied or anything, we were just treated the same as the others.

Towards the end of my education at my first school, I started hanging with the more popular kids, who accepted my with them. This also led to becoming best friends with the most popular girl in the school.

I then moved school in Sept. 2018, and closed up. I just wanted to leave school life at school, so didn't bother making many friends, although I did make three or four good ones.

In about May 2019 I started to hang with some of the popular kids from my house (we have a house system at school). This was all good, and really enjoyable.

I reinvented myself into a brilliant person over the summer holidays, and in Sept. 2019 went back to school for the new term with a brilliant set of friends.

Despite this, I've only just realised that I haven't made enough of an effort. Whilst I go around with them at school, I'm always one of the most quiet out of them. I also never get invited into town by any of them, not out of malice or anything, I'm just generally forgotten.

I'd really like this to stop, and for me to be invited into town with them, stuff like that. Any ideas on how I can maybe reach out a little more, without it being awkward? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",16May2020,1

I don’t do it for attention, I’m really worried about what people will think of me if I do have those.

602,"My cousin was in an on again off again relationship for awhile with a guy who left a Catholic Seminary to be with her. Several months after one of their breakups, she decided to become a Catholic missionary. The main reason they kept breaking up was that he said he wanted a housewife that takes care of everything and has lots of kids, and she didn't want that and felt he was being controlling.

She signed a contract to work with a missionary company for 2 years in Southeast Asia, Stipulations being she would not be allowed to date for 2 years and she could only use her phone on Sundays.

Apparently right before leaving she was prescribed anti-anxiety medication. She had really bad side effects (not sleeping, not showering, suicidal) but as she was around all new people, no one noticed her difference in personality until her older sister traveled there to visit her 8 months later.

After this my cousin decided to come back to the US and she went to stay in a recovery center for a few months.

The week after she got out, her old boyfriend heard about this and came back to the area to get back together with her. ( Since their breakup he had found a new girlfriend and was moving with the new GF to California at the time. When he found out my cousin was back and not restricted from dating ditched his new GF he signed a lease with in CA )

Once they reunited, they dated for 3 months before getting engaged.

Since the engagement he has made ""jokes"" about her needing life insurance before they get married saying ""What happens if something happens to you? Who would cook for me?""

The family was concerned but resigned to her decision. She asked me to be a bridesmaid along with her 2 sisters. However a month ago, the wedding was suddenly called off. She quit her job and decided to move back home (3 hrs away) over the course of a weekend.

Apparently, she had called her older sister and said that her bf had sexually assaulted her. Her sister immediately drove home to help her, but by the time she got there my cousin went back on what she said and said it wasn't that bad after talking with the BF and the priest that is going to officiate the wedding.

Everyone is still concerned but she is adamant that the only reason she said anything was because she was off her medication. I've tried talking with her but she is very determined to marry him.

She called me to ask if I was still going to be a bridesmaid, and when I told her I was undecided, she said it didn't matter what I decided. She said ""In the end I know you will always support me and that you will come around to it eventually""

However this is not a light decision for me, if I decide not to be a bridesmaid I am also likely deciding not to be around them going forward. I explained that and she said ""He is a good guy, I'm not going to tell him he isn't worthy of marrying me based on this. I have forgiven him, and my older sister exaggerated it anyway""

She doesn't seem to care about the people that were just months ago important enough to be chosen as her bridesmaids. Most of her family is now in support of the wedding except her bridesmaids.

What can else can I do to help her? Is it wrong to accept her first account of the assault as truth since she said it was caused by being off her meds? Should I be a bridesmaid?

TLDR: They are both really catholic and the BF is a sexist who proposed right after she got out of a rehabilitation center. He raped her, she moved away from him and quit her job, called off the wedding. But now she says the wedding is back on after talking with him and their officiating priest.",16May2020,1

She has a boss who isn't exactly the best guy out there, for 2 main reasons. Firstly, he only hires females, which might be illigal in the US, and kinda sucks if you're a male who wants to work there when you turn 16, like me. My sister actually heard him admit this, buit she didn't record him, sadly. Secondly, my sister believes that he pockets a percent of the tips. She estimates 40-60%.

Is any of that illigal and, if so, what can my sister do about it? Also, if you're gunna say ""It's not your problem,"" I'm posting this because i want to be hired there at 16 without getting a sex change.

605,"Disclaimer: I love my father, and I know that his heart is in the right place, regardless of this. 

I always feel like I am walking on eggshells when I am around him/talking with him, which happens maybe once or twice per day. 

There has been several times, when I and him were having a discussion about something, our plans, etc. When suddenly, he proposes something, which I nicely decline, and explain why.  Only for him to raise his voice at me, and say something like ""well, then we're not doing anything"". Then, I ask him why, and he just ignores me like a little child, and does not talk to me anymore. - It happens really often. 

And, when I make some mistake like, spilling a glass of water by accident, he proceeds to get mad, cuss, and overreact, and say ""now the whole fucking table is soaked"" in a really aggressive and threatening way, when I am already cleaning it up. 

And when he's helping me with for example, mathematics, and I ask him something, when I don't understand it, he gets mad/aggressive at me, sighs, and when I ask him why he's so mad, he says ""these are simple mathematics, why can't you just learn it!?"" And leaves. 

There has been many instances, where we've been arguing, where he has said the most terrible things that can be said, like:  ""I can't believe that you are my son"", and "" why are you so stupid, and ""you are a 0"" and ""you're going to end up like some fucking garbageman"", ""I get really mad when I even see you"" -- And, when I ask him what his problem is, he answers ""you are my problem"". Which makes me feel like I am shit, and not worth anything. 

He has also said ""well, you should not have ate yourself that fat"" (I have lots of self-esteem issues, and that really hurt me a lot) 

When he has broke a few things in the past, while we have been arguing, he tries to guilt me, and say ""why did you fucking break this"". 

After these happen, he does not talk to me, respond to me, stomps, slams doors, acts aggressively, and pretends to be sad, until I apologize to him because I feel guilty, and everything is magically fine again. But in reality, I am really hurt, and he does not see that. 

When he really hurts me, he never apologizes to me, and everything is magically fine the next morning.  

When I ask my mother something, when I am too scared to ask him, he seems to get jealous, and says things like ""he's not going to learn anything"", ""don't even try helping him"" and then puts me on a guilt trip by saying ""why do you hate me"", which really really fucks with my mind.

Every conversation with him is like walking on eggshells. One moment he seems happy, the next moment, he is furious, ignores me, and cusses me out like a child. 

I can not have a proper discussion with him, because, he usually says that my ideas and suggestions are shitty.

606,"What are your thoughts on “standing up to the man”? I am currently in a disagreement with my employer regarding their demand that I break osha regulations and repackage isopropyl alcohol into a container that was previously filled with isopropyl alcohol from a different manufacturer. Osha states that no container of hazardous materials (ie flammable liquid) should be defaced, so peeling the old label off will violate that regulation. It also states that any secondary or repacked containers should possess all labels and warning from the original container, so I would need to deface the container to reuse and refill the containers. 

I presented my employer with a viable alternative to refilling these bottles, as we stock empty 1 liter bottles which I can label with the correct information. They are still pushing the issue that I should be refilling the used containers. 
I don’t feel that there is an imminent danger in doing this, it simply opens the door to be coerced to break similar regulation in the future and I don’t want to open that door.

610,"This is very embarrassing to open up about so please don't make fun of me. I also have misophonia so I don't know if that ties into this weird fear of mine, but I absolutely cannot clear my throat, sneeze, cough, or burp or make any sort of bodily noise in front of other people. I have a phobia of it.


I know it is not polite to burp in front of others but I have acid reflux and so when I hold my burps in they come back up and make a loud growling noise in my throat and it is extremely humiliating and I know other people can hear. It makes me want to crawl into a hole and cry.


When I need to blow my nose I go into the bathroom and try to blow as quietly as possible so nobody can hear me. I can't blow my nose in front of others. 


When I need to clear my throat (which happens a lot because, acid reflux) I try to clear it as silently as possible  by ""popping"" my throat in tiny increments until whatever's in there gets knocked loose and I can exhale it out. If it's really stubborn I go to the bathroom and lean against the wall and try to bring it up super quietly.


I cannot cough in front of others. I just can't do it. It's like I'm terrified of drawing attention to myself. No one has ever heard me cough and I keep it that way. When I was a child I would run and go into an empty room and hide in the closet to cough. Or bury myself in the bed and put a pillow over my mouth. 


What causes this? It is posing so much anxiety for me because I have a job where I sit next to someone and it's pretty quiet and so any noise my body makes feels amplified x100. Any stomach rumble, any sigh, it all is heard and it embarrasses me and makes me feel heavily self conscious.

615,"So, i've been in a long-distance relationship with a guy I thought was great. Everything was fine until January of this year. He started being distant, and asked for large sum of money I didn't give him. He was pursuing a girl behind my back and as I later found out, asked me for money to give to her. And he told his friends about her BEFORE he ever told me. Still ending our calls with 'I love you'. I even made plans to see him around February and he was on board despite entertaining another relationship. When he broke up with me or at least starting acting really cold towards me, I swear to God I lost my mind. I wanted to die. I felt so hurt. I cried almost every. single. day. I started taking Xanax.

Long story short, he and this girl hooked up, and she basically wanted to keep it casual and see other people. He couldn't take it. He drove all the way up to her house 7 hours away, booked a hotel and told her that if she didn't see him, he would leak her nudes everywhere. He basically raped her and extorted her. So she ends up pressing charges, and its still pending but its possible that he might face jail time. On one hand, this feels like karma, and I don't feel bad about it. But on the other hand, I feel like he's had bad mental health for a long ass time, and his actions reflect that somewhat.

This guy has been suicidal for quite a long time, but I always felt like I wanted to help him, fix him so I've been talking to him despite everything he's put me through. He tried to commit suicide after hearing that she was pressing charges. 

He calls me non-stop. He doesn't sleep at night and has night sweats. He cries and says he's sorry for all he's done. He's hurt a lot of people - friends, family, me, some girl. I feel sorry but I just...I don't know. He says he loves me and always have. And he wants to work things out. I feel so confused. A part of me wonders if me being nice to him is saying something more telling about me.  Is me being nice and offering my help and support mean mean I might have low self-esteem or low self worth? Should I start seeing a therapist?

Sex has always made me feel somewhat insecure, and he's the only person I've ever done it with. And I just always felt like I wasn't good enough because I lacked experience. I feel so embarrassed and confused about what to do and how to move forward. I spent my entire college career talking/dating this guy long distance and I can't help but feel like I've wasted so much time. Every time I think about what he did, I feel YUCK.

Every few weeks for the past 7 or so years I've tried to look him up online and just see for myself that he is happy, or at least alive. Problem is his social media accounts stopped updating around when we broke up. His LinkdIn also hasn't updated in many years. His is no where in his field. He has a very common name so searching obituaries doesn't work. The few common friends we had haven't heard from him in many years, starting from soon after we stopped dating. I'm good at searching for things. It's related to my field.

I keep thinking that he killed himself and that I was the cause. That sounds full of myself, I know, to think I would be the cause. But i did a number on him emotionally by using him to get over an ex.

So my early life is not good. still now. my younger days im been bully alot. due to. im not tall. still now 160 cm. ive try hard to fit on the class. but no luck. i dont know why. im nice to other people. still i feel rejected by others. from time to time i always skip school just to avoid being bullied. on my way school. there a cemetery. so when i dont feel going to school. i just stay there. i just on tree's due to there alot of people passing there. they might see me. so i prefer to hide. life goes this way from years and years. i just use to it.

btw where not rich or what ever. we didnt even fit in to middle class family. where pretty much in poverty line. my father work as a seaman. but decided to resign. the room he's sleeping in has poor air ventilation. my father is not a smoker. and there's 4 of them in that room. 3 of the people on that room are hard smoker.

After he leave he fine a work as a security guard. salary is low. but you need to work it out. if u want to survive they said. where 3 siblings btw in the youngest. the oldest is taking education. want to be a teacher. and the middle is want to be architect that time. and me. youngest but im on my High school that time. age gap between them is big. my sister is around 10 years older than me.

So i thought even life is hard. it will pay off after my sister and brother had finish school. i had this plan in my mind that. for now is hard. but just hold on. every thing will be fine

So things getting fuck up after that. we use to live in my uncle property. we build the house. a small house. but we dont own the land. due to we can afford it. banks wont allow us to loan money to buy a land. due to our income is to low. so are uncle said. go build a small house there. no problem. so my father have alot of skills. he knew how to wire a house. put a door. he can basically build a house on her own. not the prettiest. but you can call it a home. use to remember. my father save money just to buy some floor tiles. slowly house is getting pretty. we had a tv back then. even dow it's black and white. floor got white tiles. so fancy back then. it looks very cool.

Then problems hit. my uncles wife had history of schizophrenia. i remember that day. all of 3 siblings go to school. my father go to work. my mother work as a maid.

after school. i rush to home to eat. because my money every day is 50 pesos or 1$. and i need 25 pesos just for transportation. and my class start at 8 am up to 5 pm. when i got home that day. i still remember the pain. even dow wife's already died. i still have the anger towards her.

The wife's uncle destroy our house. she use a sledge hammer. broke inside. smash all the thing inside. all. even windows. door. every thing. when i got home im in shock. the door was smash. and its already fallen. i remember i have an aquarium back then even that is been smash. seeing all my fish on the ground dead. that time. i see my mom. was so mad. shes ready to kill the uncles mom. even the neighbors got involve just to stop us. trying to get that girl. where really mad that time.

same time same time. we destroy our house. even if its raining that time. all of our stuff that survive pick all of them. take it on the road. we literary destroy the house our self. the one we build.

we all pack our things. my fathers sister offer us a small ground in to there backyard. so we accept it. out of desperation. we just make a wall out of wood. put the roof. and we live there for years. now btw we still leave here. but the house is in decent shape.

years go by. slowly where building the house again. bit by bit. 1 day my father when so sick. we have no idea why. we rush him to the hospital. the diagnose is lung cancer. where so shock. how come. my father never touch a cigarette. and the doctor ask is there anyone smoking in your house. we said No. and my mother remember when he was working on the ship. and the doctor said. that's why. he's a 2nd hand smoker. at that time we dont have any idea what is that. he stay for about a week in hospital. and one day doctor said. he's in bad shape. you should bring him to philippine heart center. so my mom and my father go there. my sister and my brother mom to my auntie. so they can just walk to school. they can continue there studies. and me. i left in the house. to guard the house. the thing i remember. there a store next to the house. before my mom and father goes away. they said to the vendor. can you please give mark food every day. 2 pcs of can sardines everyday. ill pay you back when we got home. the vendor said yes. so i eat. every single day is a sardines. then weeks past by. the vendor said. mark i can not give you more food. because your mom didnt pay yet. i have to re stock my store. i dont have any extra money to restock my shop. so told here. yes its okay. ill just find a way. then one day. i stamble a friend in road. told him oh what are you u up to. he ask me. nothing i said. oh you want to work. in a heart bit a said yes. what kind of work. he said. u just play computer games. i said really. yes. i remember the game. its lineage 1 from korea. u play that. farm gold or gain level on the char. i survive that. i earn 2$ a day. with free lunch and dinner. for 12 hours of work.

months pass by. i think around 2 months. my mom and my father go home. my father cant work anymore. he cant even stand up. then he had a tube on her lungs. and a plastic. liquid triping in there. i dont know what was that. they said its the. how do i say this. its juice from the wound. life continue for us. we cant even afford to buy things. i ask my mom. i remember i try to ask my mom that can i buy a white tshirt for our school play. she said. sorry we cant. due to where paying debt. the company my father work for 25 years. loan us the money to admit him to the hospital in metro manila.

that day i never ask for money. from time to time i ask for small quick job. just to earn money. that time i dont want to stay at home. because if i stay at home. i just think all the problems we have. sometimes i go home around 1 in the morning. i want the feeling that. when i got home ill just fall a sleep fast. so i wont think anymore.

one day i heard my mom and my father arguing. i dont know whats the reason. but there a word my father said that my mom. burst into tears. he said. i see light. my father and my mother are calling me.

my mom said. dont come. dont join them. we need you. you have alot of things to fix.

the next day same things for me. i go out. for work. going home late. then my mom called on the phone. in my work. said. your dad. your dad. i already knew it. i just go out and said to my friend. i need to go home. when i got home my father died.

life goes on with us. now im married. for 3 years now. suffering from depression. you might ask why? so in the first year. every thing is going so well. oh btw she's an Australian PR. and im a filipino. we knew each other for almost 10 years. all good at the start. we can say its all rainbows and sunshine.

so. when you feel. that reality hitting you bit by bit. for example. we need to earn money for you to move here. around 10k AUD. oh yes. now im saving up. but due to my low income. about 8-10$ a day. for 12 hours of work. its really hard for me to save up. so she's saving u might ask. yes. i think. but from time to time. shes gonna spent the money. due to her debt. when we talk money. she always get mad very fast. then this year. last feb. she came back. with her father and mother. because her mother's sister died. i remember her father said. oh when u gonna go there? go take all your papers needed. i just said yes. there already okay that time. way back years ago.

they said. dont worry. we will help you etc etc. i really dont ask for help. but ask there new family member. im glad if they will do that. i sound like hypocrite right? im kinda felt bad. why? so one of the mortgage of my wife is a car. she's almost done with her car. i think less than a year. but she upgrade it to new one. now she's on a mortgage again for 7 years. and she's planing to study this coming school year. how can we save if she just spending money right? and btw i never ask for money. the whole year maybe she send me around 500$ AUD. for the duration of 12 months. yes im thankful of that. and our status is. where gonna do some video call. for about 1-2 hours. and she's gonna play on her other phone. u gonna ask her something. she's gonna answer yes or no. ur lucky if she answer you in a few words. or gonna tell something long.

i really love her to be honest. but most of the time. she didnt even care about me. i ask her many times. about this. specially now. i ask her do u still love me. she answer yes.

is this one sided love? im writing this due to i cant work right now. due to covid 19. its really hurting my mental health. i always feel pain in my head. so many things going in my mind. what will i do? what do i end up after this.

from the very start. i just want a family. a child. to be  happy. im not asking for a big house. tons of money.

622,"I’m 15 (F) and I’m in my last year in high school ( I’ll be in year 11 next week ). But I’ve always had issues with my friendship groups surrounding school; for example from one of my groups, i used to ( not sure now but i have my suspicions ) be talked about all the time, never got invited to anything. It’s especially difficult because i remember my parents talking about it to me how you didn’t even know if you were left out of something but now it’s painted all over social media 24/7. 
Another incident occurred with my old best friend ( she continues to try and text me to this day after being off and on with me so it ended but for others reasons besides this ). It would be some days she would talk to me and others blank me and i didn’t even know what i did. 
I won’t name every incident as we’d be here till Christmas but another one i will mention is that i gravitated into this group of 4, one of the girls let’s just call her Helen for the point if the story, is always nice and has rarely done anything unless somethings happened and then on occasions the other two blank 
me or talk about me. 

I just want to know if there is something wrong with me, i honestly can’t call anyone my best friend and have the rare people who have never ignored me. I’m that type of person who always checks of everyone’s ok and messages them first but I never got it in return. It got so bad that I would have panic attacks before break and lunch at school. 
Will I get better friends at college/ or are people like this forever?

TL;DR - why do i have such shitty friends, always the one putting in effort, never get any in return, get talked about, left out, have never really had a stable group in school. Is there something wrong with me? Will it get better in college and further on or are people like this forever.",16May2020,1

All was going well and we were having nice, friendly conversations, and he tells me we are communicating too much and he felt overwhelmed. Let me point out, this is a friend situation, not potential bf. He said he was afraid I’d get attached. What? I’m not into superficial friendships, so I thought I finally found a nice friend.

629,"I just told my partner that I’m drained talking about an “emotional infidelity” instance that happened around 6 months ago. 

WHAT HAPPENED 

Around 6-7 months ago, I met a woman in the Latin dance community who tried to shoot her shot with me. She was fully aware I am in a relationship, and it didn’t stop her. Neither did I, I just didn’t draw the boundary with her. I didn’t met up with her, we exchanged a few messages and that was the end of it. 

EDIT: When this happened, our relationship was at a bad point. We were arguing non-stop, we broke up, and I was gathering an escape plan. This woman was someone who I had ongoing conversations with about “getting lost in the moment” while dancing together. I showed her everything. All of the messages between her and this 2nd woman.

HER ACTION

I’ve been fully transparent, shown her my messages, introduced her to FEMALE friends, I’ve done separate counseling, we’ve done couples counseling, and she’s still “depressed,” and “triggered,” whenever we talk about this in our counseling sessions and outside. She’s talked about being depressed and also uncertain about the future. 

She even went as far as comparing what happened to rape, and saying it was a “traumatic experience,” because she was ramping herself up for our relationship to end and me to leave.

WHAT IS SHE REQUESTING 

She is now asking me to support her emotionally whenever she feels this way. Whenever she thinks about the emotional infidelity, she wants me to hug her and validate her feelings, and respect her emotions. 

MY THOUGHTS 

Comparing it to rape took it to another level. If she sees it that way, I can’t do anything to help her from feeling that way... she says it won’t be forever, but I am trying to do my part and be fully transparent with her. 

It just seems like this damage is irreparable because of her “analogies,” and anxiety inducing experience. 

I can accept her for feeling that way, but it’s also my decision on whether or not I want to tolerate this for much longer. It’s tiring when she’s crying and self medicating pills which makes it sound like it’s because of me.

I’m conflicted too because I don’t have a job and am depending on her right now. I’ve been invited to apply for jobs 100 miles back home and it’s on my mind now because the lease is also ending... 

What are your thoughts?

TL;DR - Emotional infidelity happened and my GF is still “triggered,” and “depressed,” and compares it to rape.",16May2020,2

632,"My husband (29m) recently had to replace his car.  I (32f) pretty much drained my savings (the savings is only in my name not my husbands) to use as a down payment to replace his car.  His car is titled to both of us as I co-signed for it.  We view the car as belonging to us both, although it’s his daily and I have my own daily.  

My husband’s cousin (22m) stays with us and has for the last year.  Like my husband, he’s a car guy and absolutely loves the new car.  However, I feel like he’s becoming obsessed with my husbands car.  The cousin is constantly cleaning and detailing it, talks to my husband about racing it, and has started taking pictures of it and posting it to social media.  On Facebook he tags my husband (although he doesn’t specify the car belongs to my husband), on Instagram he’s posting it like it’s his car.  For some reason the posts bother me.  It bothers me that he’s portraying something as his that’s not.  It bothers me that other people might think it’s his, especially when he’s had people dump sugar in his gas tank before because of whatever reason.  What if that happens to my husband’s car because of his cousin?  Honestly just the over all time he even spends on my husbands car bothers me.  He treats it almost like his and from a friend of theirs I’ve talked to, he puts it across to them that the car belongs to him and my husband. Their friend is also somewhat concerned because they’re worried that when/if the cousin drives it, something will happen to the car.  Either the cousin will wreck it or he’ll get it impounded.  I’ve talked to my husband about it and he doesn’t care and doesn’t think I should either and says he’s had talks with his cousin about if he drives it. 

So am I wrong to be bothered by this, especially since my husband isn’t?  Or am I just worrying over nothing?",16May2020,2
633,"Hi everyone! I am currently living in Spain as an English teacher during quarantine. I live in an apartment building of three apartments. Mine is on the bottom, there in one in the middle and one on top. My apartment has a patio that is enclosed in the building and the neighbour’s windows open onto this patio. I have lived here for nine months now. 

The people in the apartment above me are three or four girls who are in fashion school. They are always having people in and out even during this quarantine. They are always playing music and ALWAYS yelling, at all hours of the day. They have kept me up many a nights. Both my roommate and I have asked them to be quiet. They usually comply for an hour but then are back to their usual ways.

I am a teacher so I need to conduct class in my apartment but it’s difficult when their yelling and music can be heard in the background of my zoom chat. My Spanish is limited so my communication with them hasn’t been extensive, and while my (Spanish) roommate is also annoyed she is pretty non confrontational, so aside from the texting them a few times and going to speak to them once, she hasn’t done much. 

I have asked my roommate to speak with the landlord and she says she has, but nothing has changed. I’m truly going crazy and am unable to relax in my own home. Even watching tv is difficult with all this noise.

If anyone has any suggestions please let me know. I really can’t take it anymore.",16May2020,4
635,"Now this is a unique situation. Looks I’m a 8 and he’s a 4 but my insecurities and body dysmorphia has me believing I’m waaaaay uglier than I actually am. I am aware I am attractive. I see it in the attention I get, the type of attractive men I date and so on. But I don’t believe it. 

But I met a guy. I’m falling for him hard. But he’s not perfect. He’s newly separated going through a divorce. Still figuring out custody of his son, his living situation but one thing he is sure about is me. We’ve been taking it slow. First guy I’ve actually taken it slow with. Mainly due to the pandemic. At first I wanted to go fast. I like to go fast so I can crash and burn. Just sort of get it over with. I know, I’m mentally messed up. 

We had hung out a bit before the pandemic. The dates were nice. But then of course things slowed down. But strangely enough something I’ve never done before with any other guy. We talked the entire time during the quarantine. We FaceTimed and texted. All day everyday. Then we fell in love. 

We then decided since we’ve both been locked inside and have both been safe the entire time we should meet up and watch a movie. Well we didn’t even make it a few minutes. We ended up hooking up. It was the best sex of my life. I’ve had a lot of sexual partners. In fact I had sex right before the quarantine started. So it’s not like I was starving for sex that I forgot what good sex was. It was legit the best sex I ever had! I was shocked!! 

So here is this guy who’s not that good looking, has a lot going on in his life, too much to even entertain a relationship but somehow is juggling it all to fit me in and all I keep doing is pushing this man away and he finally “broke” and now is being distant. 

I know with time and space I can get things back on track but why can’t I just accept that a good man genuinely cares about me and wants to treat me right? How can I prove to him I’m a good woman? How can I be a good woman? He deserves the world and sometimes I don’t think I’m good enough for him!!",16May2020,2

Turns out he was a drug addict and manage to get in to the private community. But now only 1 year later people are stalking my home and my parents and other siblings house. I called the security again but the person drove off in a bike. 


They shot photos of my car area and my other siblings and parents cars and houses. I have no idea if they were planning to rob me or whatever but I’m feeling anxious and so are my parents. My siblings just took it as non serious. What could this potentially means?  And my cameras were not able to pick up a face just him his camera and his bike.

641,"I use to be in a circle of 3. They were both my best friends. One of them— we will call her Olivia— is still good friends with me. The other one—we will call her jasmin— and I are no longer friends. We had a fall out last summer because we had different points of views and just couldn’t get along anymore. We didn’t exactly end it in good terms but it’s whatever. I don’t have hate for her and wish her the best in her life! 

Since the beginning of our friendships, I always felt like I was always being left out. I ignored the fact that I was feeling like this for a long time. But after I had the fallout with Jasmin, I realized more that Olivia would always pick Jasmin over me. I know this sounds like some 5th grade shit but I really want to know what to do.

THere are many occasions but here are two examples of why I think Olivia picks Jasmin over me: 1) for my birthday this year (before covid-19) Jasmin asked Olivia to go to a concert with her and Olivia said yes &amp; then shortly after broke the news to me.
2) one day me &amp; my bf were arguing outside at a party and I asked Olivia if she can come outside and help me get home bc I was bit tipsy and she straight up said no. Meanwhile there were many occasions that this exact scenario happened with Jasmin and her boyfriend and Olivia helped them. I can go in detail but this post is already getting so long.

My boyfriend keeps begging me to cut Olivia off as well and just when I was about to, her dad passes away from COVID-19—May he Rest In Peace. I’ve been texting her to make sure she’s okay and got her a basket of goodies and donated money to her dads go fund me page. I wanted to be there for her like I always am. A couple days ago, I found out that she invited Jasmin to the funeral but didn’t ask me to go. I’m so confused on how to handle this bc it’s such a sensitive time. I am not gonna address this to Olivia because she just lost her father. But I am thinking of cutting her off once things get back to normal. Am I being reasonable or dramatic?",16May2020,2
643,"I'm a 27m, and I'm gay. There's this girl I know from high school, we'll call her Alyssa. Alyssa has a very obvious crush on me... She has sent me thousands of messages over time which I have put on mute and don't even see, but I've seen enough to know she occasionally is asking me out. She even creates multiple social media accounts to message me and some other guy, we'll call him Dan, just as much.

She doesn't bother me at work to much, thankfully. I think she has a doctor who told her not to, because she told me once she was going to give me ""space."" In general I treat the messages as an annoyance but I NEVER responded or even read the messages. It's at like 1000+ unread.

Today she found me at my new job. She told me the other guy Dan got a restraining order against her. She casually mentioned she knows where I lived, asked whether my number has changed, and all this stuff about information I DID NOT GIVE HER. I told her I was moving out soon, changed my number, etc. etc. etc., but that freaked me out. She was asking where I was moving, asked for my new number (I ""messed"" up by one digit, so sorry number neighbor!)

She was continuing to bring up the restraining order in front of other customers. It was extremely awkward. She asked me to call Dan and yell at him for her, right there and then. I managed to get out of it by telling her I couldn't do that at work I could get in trouble.

I just don't know how to deal with this. I know she's lonely and has had a difficult life because of her disability, but I'm very openly gay. The messages she sends me, from the little I can see, include asking whether I want to date. 

I'm starting to get major anxiety over this... But the unfortunate thing is that besides the messages, she hasn't stalked me in person... And I guess I just feel bad for her and her situation, so going the nuclear route of a legal response seems too far to me. I just don't know what to do

I feel really dishonest sometimes but I think telling her wouldn't do any good since she's in a relationship and I'm pretty sure she doesn't and hasn't ever thought of me that way. Will my feelings eventually go away?",16May2020,2
646,"Are there any surefire ways of telling if I am the way I am because of trauma? A lot of people have mistreated me, especially this year. And now my personality is almost completely opposite than it was last year. And I noticed I have more of a tendancy to zone out or distract myself in unhealthy ways when thinking about bad memories. 

But I can't tell if I was mentally abused because I cannot picture the people who did it admitting to it. 
For some reason I feel like I don't have a mind of my own.

 I cannot beleive something to be true unless someone points it out to where I see the situation as a ""textbook case"" if that makes sense. Plus I always see people talking about how they were abused or traumatized by something trivial and I just assume their being overdramatic. 

How do I know if i'm being overdramatic?",16May2020,2
647,"Hi, so basically I don’t know what to do anymore. My mom and dad have a really bad relationship. For the past ** years they have both endured each other. Yesterday they got into another argument, which ended in stuff being broken.  I’m aware that normal arguments between parents are normal, but I’m just scared. I’m scared for the well being of my mom and myself at times though I know that I am safe. I just want to know how I should approach the situation, I can’t talk to my dad cause he gets mad instantly because he feels as if he’s the one that does all the work in the house and that me and my mom are lazy. I argue that it’s corona time and there really is nothing to do. I also want to know how to calm my parents down quickly because these arguments happen at 12am and last for 2-3 hours. I also don’t know what I should do today, because I feel off. Especially once my dad comes home and I start to feel scared and anxious. 

Thank you.",16May2020,2

Yesterday, I had a hysterical laughing fit at my cat who was sitting on the floor. She wasn’t doing anything, literally just sitting. Weird thing is, every time she meowed, I laughed even harder.

He invited friends over every night.  2nd night my brother and his friends got stupidly drunk. I didn't tell my brother because I suspected they wouldn't get that drunk which was dumb on my part.
Last night. He had less friends over. Only like 2 at a time but I think I saw 3 different people. And keep in mind I don't have very good experience with his friends. Most of them are assholes or don't know their boundaries.
But I found out that one of his friends burnt the frogs in the pond alive. Just for entertainment. 
And we all know the saying ""snitches get stiches "" but I think there's times not to say anything and times to saying.
My brother on the other hand does not apperently. 
He refused to tell who did it. So my oldest brother told him to go home(my moms). And before he left he said to me ""you snitch and we're gonna have problems"" which I took as a threat. Which fucking hurt. We used to be so close but now his shitty friends are more important than family.

However, until now, I've wasted many good opportunities to get my hands on some UG research experience.

I still haven't decided yet, but I see most of my friends decided about their field of choice, and few even publishing papers with the help of seniors and professors. I wanted to work under a prof this summer, but Corona did not allow that. In the panic of seeing my friends get remote internships, I too applied and got a remote internship, but I am not sure how much of the work would be relevant down the line. I try to use my free time to learn new skills on Coursera and narrow down my career choices but I always end up procrastinating and wasting it on Anime and Reddit. I don't know what I should be doing. Since I don't know in what field I want to go into, there are lots of skills that could potentially come in handy, so I end up unable to decide what to practice. The sheer volume of knowledge and skills required in a field aways get me down and I feel I'll never be able to accomplish anything. The only thing I've managed is a decent GPA but I don't know how much that's gonna help me.

It’s a bit of an odd situation but basically my mother got pregnant with someone she probably didn’t know well and then moved away without telling him. So he has no idea I even exist. 

I took a dna test on ancestry so I might find him and was matched with my uncle (I’ll call him D), his brother. I messaged him but didn’t hear anything back. So I went digging from there and found T who had a brother named D and matched everything perfectly. He attended the same small college in a small town and graduated from the same program my mother enrolled in. Furthermore, he graduated the year I was born. It’s all too much of a coincidence for it to not be him. It’s such a small school and area in general, it has to be him. He even matched the theories my relatives told me about who they imagined he was.

So I found him on fb and created a fake account since I don’t use one. I finally got up the courage to message him with a very carefully written explanation of how I came across this information and that I’d like to do a paternity test if he was comfortable with it. That was a week ago and I still haven’t heard anything. I friend requested him but it still shows as pending and that he hasn’t seen the message.

687,"I (26M) dated this girl (27F) 5 years ago. Started off as good friends and ended up being an item. We’ve been on and off since 2015 , a lot has happened during that time (she cheated on me with her ex, she loved getting attention from other dudes etc etc) she was in a bad place for x amount of years before we met. I have left her 3 times due to the above reasons but never had that closure of ending it due to me just up and leaving (I was very childish and afraid to face negative situations , I’ve grown since then). It’s been a year since we haven’t spoken until a few weeks ago when she hit me up, and I realized then and there that I still had strong feelings for her and she “claims” to have the same for me yet still telling me that she “doesn’t know how she feels” towards me. I’ve realized that she only talks to me once in a while or if she needs something. I don’t answer her texts I just leave her on read nor do I ever go out of my way to help her with demands. My gut feeling is telling me that she’s using me for whatever reasons. I’ve spent the week before last, filled with anxiety and stress over not knowing where she stands with “us” to the point where now my gut feeling is telling me to cut her out , no friendship no nothing.

688,"When a family member repeatedly betrays your trust, what should you do ?

Growing up life wasn’t necessarily easy but I learned a lot. I have gone through many pains and oddly enough I’m glad because it allows me to better prepare and protect myself for when things go awry. Anyways, I have 5 siblings (1 older and 4 younger). My sister is 2 years older than me so growing up we experienced a lot of the same things. We were both treated like the oldest. From a young age, I felt some resentment towards my sister but I never gave it any attention because we were family. Later on as I was able to mature I started to come to realizations and I didn’t like the person my sister turned out to be. 

So growing up being one of the oldest, I tended to be the babysitter for the younger ones. I was essentially a mini version of my mom. I would be up early with my mom. She would make breakfast and I would make everyone’s lunch. I would wake up my siblings and we would all pack into our car every morning for my mom to drop us off at school. My sister always just slept in until the last minute. Always rushed at that point. That bothered me. She always said that she was going to change but she never did. Okay you’re not a morning person that’s fine. I can get over it. 

When my mom stopped having kids and went back to work, I would make dinner for the family by myself. I would do the laundry when my mom couldn’t. I would make sure the younger siblings wouldn’t fight all the time. My sister would hardly help. She never cooked. She said she didn’t like it. Okay fine. I loved cooking so I decided that I would rather do it myself than with someone who just be in the way. I hated laundry but there was no one else who could help. My younger siblings wouldn’t be strong enough to carry loads up and down flights of stairs. I would just have them help when it came to folding it and putting it away. I always had to find a way to not be overwhelmed with work. Years later she told me that she didn’t help me when we were growing up because she felt that out lol wasn’t doing enough. This made me upset because our mom was working. She was trying to give us so much. If she couldn’t do if for my mom, she could have done it for me. Or even if she couldn’t do it for me, then do it for our younger siblings who were literally babies. 

Time passed. My sister was going to college in state so she still lived at home. I was going to do the same just because we needed to save as much money as possible. During my senior year of high school, my sister started to make plans to move out and live in a house 5 minutes from her school. We lived only 20 minutes from the university so it’s wasn’t a far move. She told me that we should move out together. She looked for ways to convince me. I reluctantly said okay. I didn’t want to move until I felt ready. I know I could survive but the finances weren’t there but she said she would cover it. So my family felt more comfortable with my sister moving out if I went with her. She didn’t have a job yet so she asked different extended family members for some help in the beginning to afford the place she had in mind. She saved enough but when the time came to sign the lease, she told me that I couldn’t move with her. I didn’t let it affect me but I felt used. 

Anyways time goes by. I get myself a job and I start saving. I didn’t want to move out until after I graduated. I wanted to be sure that I could take care of myself. Right before my last year of college my sister hated her roommates and moved out. She asked me to move with her into an apartment. I told her that I didn’t want to. That she lied before. She assured me that she wanted to move with me. I told her that I wasn’t financially ready and that I can afford to pay any more bills ( I was paying for my own car, gas , phone and I was trying to save). She told me that she had everything covered. So I agreed. About a month before we move she tells me that she wants her boyfriend to move in with us. She asks me if I’m comfortable with that. I knew that she was going to do whatever she wanted so I told her that she had to tell our mom and that our mom had to meet him first. I wasn’t going to hold that big of a secret for her. My mom met him and she didn’t like him. She had a bad feeling about him. We still moved. 

I liked living there because it was close to school and not far from my job. I had a good time and loved the freedom of not living at home. We live there for a year. As the lease expired my sister says that she’s getting a house with her boyfriend. I didn’t like that. They wanted to move to house that was more than an hour from my job. But although I had already graduated I hadn’t found a full time job that would give me enough stability to live on my own. So I had planned to only live with them temporarily until I could find myself a job. I didn’t want to survive off money I had saved. I hated the house that they moved into. It was so far from everything i was familiar with. It took an hour to see my family. I didn’t like and I felt lonely. 

A couple months go by. I’m going on interviews and actively looking for a job but it takes time. I hardly spent anytime at that house. I never had anyone over at that house. I would literally only go there to sleep a few times a week. On days when I did sleep there, I would wake up and pack up my things for however long I planned to stay out. I would use the bathroom before I go every morning but only after my sister left for work. One day I get up thinking it’s just another normal day. As I finish finish with the bathroom, I find my sister’s boyfriend in the hall way wearing only a towel around his waist. He tells me that he wanted to have sex with me. I tell him no and lock myself in my room quickly. I frantically pack some of my stuff. I was prepared to jump out the window if he tried anything else. Within minutes I’m out the door and drive to my moms. Only one of my brothers is home. I tell him what happened. He tells our mom. He calls our older sister and she leaves work and tells us she would be right over. 

She doesn’t show up until 2 hours later. She tells me that she sorry that it was her fault. She says the reason he said that was because he didn’t want me living with them anymore and that he said that to scare me away. I felt most betrayed by her. She also told us that she had married him. That she married him because she loved him but that she would divorce him because she loved me.  I couldn’t live with her anymore and I went with a close friend to get the rest of my stuff. Ultimately she chose him. She didn’t kick him out. In fact she kicked me out by changing the locks right before I was able to get my stuff out of that house. She didn’t divorce him. She chose him. 

Now I’m a point where I don’t talk to her. I’m about to move out on my own with one of my brothers. I still see her frequently when she comes over to my moms house. We haven’t really talked about what happened. She just pretends that it never happened. I don’t know if I’m over exaggerating not wanting to do anything with her. She’s still my family and the rest of our family wants us to all stay close together. My mom has always wanted for us to have a close relationship with each other.

689,"I'm in college by the way.

A month ago, a teacher leaked his username and password to the Uni's system. Anyone who caught it has now access to his account and can change grades and stuff like that.

Here's the thing.

The only reason I know about this was because I was recording the class. Without permission.

We're having an exam Monday. I'm thinking of sending him an anonymous email warning him about this. But in order to do so I must admit to be recording the classes. EDIT: Reason for this being, it happened 2 weeks ago and I only checked the recording today.

Moral dilemma. If I do warn him, an investigation will be launched against me, for recording the classes. If I don't, I'm not sure whether someone else has access to that information and will use it to cheat and then he will be to blame and could lose his job.

(Right off the bat I know the unstable state of my mind is playing a big part in all this. As a manic depressive introvert who has a real problem socializing with normal people to the point of being borderline developmentally disabled  I know that I’m pushing the stress and anxiety farther than need be by any means. But a) i can’t help it b) I’m not making these issues for myself. Also it probably sounds like I’m taking this all wayyyyyy to seriously which certainly could be considered true but to me it’s big. It doesn’t help that I haven’t had much sleep and just walked back to my room from the last awkward cigarette I mention. Sorry for the novel long post)


This is a social situation that I’ve been tormented by since I first started smoking cigarettes, is it rude not to make small talk in a smoking section? I know it’s not an obligation or probably even an expectation but I sure feel like an ass when I don’t which sucks because I HATTTTTTTTE making small talk, especially with strangers and especially when going to have a smoke is something I do specifically to take a break to myself... 

This conundrum has become a daily struggle as of late and has literally worked its way into my home life which is starting to cause me a lot of unneeded un appreciated and unnecessary anxiety/drama. I’ll explain, I moved into an apartment about a year ago which is strictly non smoking inside and you can’t even smoke outside your door or anywhere near the complex itself. When I first moved in the rule was generally you were supposed to go out to the parking lot to smoke which was a pain when the weather was bad or when you wanted a place to sit but whatever no biggy. About 6 months in they built a small “smoking section” into the lawn in the middle of all of the buildings. This might seem silly to people who are more well adjusted to social interaction but as soon as I saw it my anxiety spiked.... in the middle of the lawn, smack dab between everyone’s front door and in the middle of all the intersecting pathways is this tiny rooom, probably 5’ by 8’, barely enough room to fit 4 chairs elbow to elbow and with walls made of clear plastic... like a small square fishbowl... I hate the thing, and as a heavy smoker with no employment for the past few months it is a real thorn in my paw. And it gets worse. As time goes on it quickly becomes apparent that there’s really only a handful of smokers in the complex. Once you introduce yourself to tour neighbor over a cigarette and get to know eachother a little thé already unpleasant act of not making conversation becomes borderline mandatory. Especially when sitting in such close proximities. To my horror the group of smokers begin to bond over shared addiction and time spent together in the fishbowl and worse I find most of them to be home all day too. I can tell it is quickly becoming a social gathering spot for them as much as anything. Neighbors will specifically come out to smoke and chat when one or more of the other smokers are out there sometimes staying for several cigarettes and socializing for long periods of time in the little room, making drinks to bring out and spending the evenings having little tobacco fueled parties. After realizing I couldn’t smoke at home without being caught up socializing I start to bail on the whole area all together, being forced to trudge around the block while I smoke just to avoid it not wanting them to think of me as rude for not wanting to participate in what was honestly feeling like forced friendship. It wasn’t the most convenient or comfortable but walking down the street worked for me.... at first. Then to my dismay I realized they had caught on to my avoidance and was now really becoming a whole thing. My roommate (an occasional smoker) would come back upstairs sometimes laughing and telling me they so-so ""misses seeing me down there! "" or that a neighbor ""hope he’s doing ok we never see him anymore"".... this has become a nightmare for my social anxiety, now an obligation that I’m not filling i feel guilty everytime I open my door and walk by without stopping to join in. And they just keep adding fuel to this anxiety and stress over such a menial thing, I’ll notice them fall silent when I step out the front door, feeling their eyes on me and knowing their now hushed conversation is solely about me as I walk away lighting a cigarette. There were instances that literally sent my nervous mind into a panic attack just over not sitting There to smoke.... them calling out down the street to me saying "" ohhhh ronaldreaganofficial we don’t have the virus yknow! You can come smoke here!"" Or as I’m locking my door one day I hear one couple saying slightly too loud for normal conversation and and in a teasing voice "" some people are just too good for our company I guess "" and gut wrenching moment where I stormed out of my apartment in a really terrible mood needing to get away from the roommate and spend some time on my own so I don’t totally lose it..... but ofcourse they’re all packed Into those plastic walls watching eagerly as I walk down the stair, jokingly shhh-ing eachother as I walk up and when I storm past, angry at the world and now annoyed by them they BURST into laughter that I could hear all the way down the street. 

I know for a fact they really just want to be friendly and enjoy my company but this whole scenario and their reaction is a literal nightmare that I thought  only my anxiety ridden and socially retarded brain could come up with. It’s my fault for not being normal but I despise them for putting me on the spot like this and a physical addiction I got myself hooked on forcing me to face it daily.... the last two mornings I’ve honestly just been too depressed to make the effort of walking anywhere and although dealing with them is the last thing I want to do after a night of no sleep, my mind a wreck and outwardly melancholy at best dressed half in dirty pajamas and completely unkempt, I made the quick walk to the dreaded fishbowl hoping that it was far too early for anyone to see me from their. Window hurrying to come catchup and it’s me before I book it back inside... but nope... low and behold both mornings I am joined about 2 minutes after sitting down, by the neighbor around my age also a male. I’ve taken up a new tactic, I make eye contact and clearly greet him good morning with a smile and then look back to my phone not saying another word or even looking up once until I’m finished and while I stand and extinguish my cigarette I tell him to have a good one and that is that.... it is excruciatingly awkward in the moment. I can tell he feels a bit snubbed and the silence is filled with us cringing and trying not to breathe or swallow too loud. But it’s my last ditch option and although uncomfortable not as terrible as anything else I can think of. Plus I feel like whole not outwardly rude(maybe?) it might stop them from coming out specifically when I do... 

Idk obviously I’m over amplifying this situation because of my social/mental issues but whether consciously or not ththey are actively making whole interaction a worst possible scenario for me. But only by being friendly,good neighbors who enjoy spending time with me and eachother, realistically it’s hard to blame them for that... I don’t know hopefully someone understands my take enough to get invested and read through this fucking huge post about something most people would consider trivial and can assess all the details and tell me unbias whether I’m being the asshole. Thanks for reading and stay safe errryone!

694,"Before I was friends with them, I had always been super nerdy and what a lot of people would call innocent. I was  dedicated to school and spent most of my time at home studying or with my family. Before I became friends with the guy (called John from here on out) who sexually assaulted me, he asked my other friend about me. At one point, John visited my workplace (could be coincidence, but I noticed eventually he does this with all the people he is fascinated with). I was out as a lesbian, but he still chose to pursue me.
Whenever we became friends, John was intense from the beginning and I never thought anything of it back then, but he always wanted to hang out and no excuse was good enough. Through the rest of the school year and into the summer he would hangout with me daily, message me daily, etc. he was always trying to convince me that he (and his friends by extension) was cooler than myself and my friends. Shortly after we became friends, he started encouraging me and my two best friends (who became friends with him before I did) to drink alcohol and smoke weed. 

One of his friends (I will call her Jane) developed a crush on me and he tried everything to make me date her, despite no cues from me that this was something I wanted. He took matters into his own hands. At parties with his friends, my two best friends, and me, he would encourage me to drink a lot and kiss him, her, or other people. He would do this by making it into a game, so any refusal or hesitation to participate was mocked.

One night while I was drunk, John asked me to leave a pool party and go to his shower with Jane, when I said no he just kept pushing. He would tell me that it was to ""have fun"" and that ""nothing bad would happen,"" etc. he kept insisting and promising it would be okay. He then led me and my best friend into the bathroom, and he left with jane and returned after a few minutes. The assault didn't last a long time because his mom came in and made it stop. John and Jane were both really angry and left to have sex in his car while me and my best friend just got ready for bed. They never tried anything like this again, but they would make jokes about it often and mock me even more for being a virgin. I had an eating disorder but after this it worsened horribly. In addition to that I began to think I was asexual. I blamed myself. I also stayed friends with them for years afterwards, despite their controlling, harrassing, mean-spirited ways.
(Side note: I recently talked to my best friend about it for the first time, they admitted that it was similarly damaging to them).

Later context: they also encouraged my partner (I will call her Lea) and I to live with them a couple years later, and despite our unwillingness from the beginning we did. At one point, john even made me write an email to housing officals demanding they put Jane in our apartment, rather than the stranger who was assigned. While living with them, Jane would constantly invade the spaces I shared with my partner. She even got a job at my girlfriend's workplace of many years, which made Lea and I worried that Jane would get her fired. They would make fun of Lea's phobias, heart disease, etc. Lea had to go back on antidepressants because of the situation. We stopped going to class and Lea started missing work. John never took it seriously and told us everything was not a big deal. We tried to get out of the lease several times but were told by the building manager that we couldn't move unless we met with Jane and John first, to try and resolve things. when Lea and I decided to stop talking to/interacting with Jane, our mutual friends all took Jane's side and Jane later admitted privately that she had told them lies about us to get them to hate us. Jane also did this to Lea with their coworkers. We had to keep living with them for several more months. 

We both are now finally extricated from them. I am about to start specialized sexual trauma therapy, but since making strides in my recovery I have been almost completely unable to eat (my weight has gone from 118lbs to 100lbs in a couple weeks time), I also have trouble falling and staying asleep.

I don't know why she did so, although in retrospect now I know that something significant happened with her family/work during that time. And plus the fact that we live in different continents, so she may not want to pursue a long distance after all. We ceased contact for a while after that.

Since the quarantine, we have started speaking with each other again, to the point that we'd now text each other daily and call almost every couple of days. During the last few weeks, I think we've got to know each other much better and that we're feeling much more comfortable around each other now, albeit the distance.

703,"Sorry I just need someone to hear this because no one is listening to me and I am feeling hopeless.

I’ve had a lot happen a bit ago and I am unsure how to tell my parents. Before the quarantine started I had an issue with my friends causing me to lose most of them except 4. I was stressed with my grades (uni student) and the lose of most of my close friends, and trying to make sure everyone else was coping okay. I never drank before and my 3 close friends thought it was a good idea to let off the edge a bit so I joined them. In the process one of my friends sexually assaulted me and my other friends knew this and did nothing. While under the influence I called the guy I liked and told him I loved him basic drunk talk and he laughed at me and hung up. (It wasn’t a big deal but he later said he only liked me for my looks and wanted to be fwb)
After I sobered up my other friends went around bragging about the night. The situation didn’t hit me even though I remembered it all. I already felt uncomfortable with guys due to my younger experience with sexual assault. I already have personal issues with my body image, constant downgrading in my intelligence throughout K-12. But this situation and the other leading situations are making me believe it was my fault and if I never did what I did it would have never happened. I know it isn’t healthy to think this way but I can’t help feeling that is how it is. 

I want to tell my parents but they are going through a tough time as well. My mom has to go in and get a mastectomy after she just got her ovaries removed my dad is working overtime and he is stressed out with other issues. (We have been raising my baby cousin for 2 years and DCS is going against the judge putting the child in danger from his parents) so all this stress is over loading. I try to help my family out as much as I can and I have to act like the oldest even though I am the middle child. I am stressed out and I’m tired. I know most of the readers on here are complete strangers and my situation isn’t as big as everyone else’s so I don’t think this is a valid situation but I just want someone to listen and not just push me aside and tell me my problems aren’t allowed because it is small.

As nice as she is to me, I feel like she is idealizing me  and setting me up to be a replacement daughter for her own daughter that has a learning disability, who she is unsatisfied with.

My boyfriend and I are 22 and have been dating for 4 years. By now I would expect for her to treat me like family, which I appreciate but it feels like a lot of pressure.

She is constantly introducing me to people as her daughter, giving me clothes I don't really want, telling me that I belong to the family, not just my boyfriend, so I must spend my time with them and stay at their house frequently.

She tells me that I was meant to be her daughter and that her own daughter should have been my moms. She wanted me to spend half of mothers day with her but was confused when my boyfriend said he would then spend the other half with my mom.

She makes comments about how I am going to drive her around when shes older and take care of her. She excpects me to stay over at her house every weekend because ""I am their family now too"". She doesn't suggest this in an enforcing way but in a way that insinuiates that her life is better when I am there.

I feel like she is idealizing me into something that I am not. When i am polite about participating her religion she suddenly thinks that I am a very religious person who wants to do prayers with her every sunday morning.

I know that I tend to overthink things and get too paranoid but the reason I feel this way is because I feel like she is prepping me into becoming my boyfriends husband who lives with her and her family. She is very unhappy with her family and only finds happiness in her son... So she never wants him to leave. My boyfriend and I are still young and not even thinking about marriage and the long term but I know that I couldn't live with her doing things her way for the rest of my life.

I am so happy that she likes me. But I wish she saw me as her sons girlfriend instead of her own daughter. Sometimes I think she forgets I have my own family who I love and am loyal to.

My boyfriend doesn't want to live with her forever but I think he's too afraid too become independent and live his own life, because she has drilled it into his head that without him (and now me) she has no happiness.

I just feel so pressured and overwhelmed. And I am scared it will cause us to break up soon, when we feel we want to move on from our parents and be independent together.

722,"I get the whole thing is long-winded so TL/DR - basically I was in a great relationship but because it was new, social distancing meant we couldn't see each other the past 2 months and feeling have faded but everything that was the foundation for a relationship is still there (find each other attractive, like each other as people, etc.). Do I hold hope we can start over when I'm moved back in less than a month and can see her again or is a thing of the past or just move on?

So I started seeing this girl (we can call her Mia) at the beginning of the year and things were going great, like this was honestly the best start to a relationship I think I've ever had and probably will ever have in my life.

For me a big thing of it probably is that people don't usually start off liking me or getting crushes on me. I don't want to sound like I have low self esteem or anything like that, I definitely think I'm more than attractive enough and am smooth enough (god that sounds cringey but I don't know a better way of putting it) to have plenty of success, but it's more I'm just at that line where I still have to be the one to start things. And normally I have my best success when both parties are actively wanting and looking for something already.

But things were different with Mia. Neither of us were looking or wanting any kind of relationship or anything. She worked at the coffee shop/bakery across the road from where I worked and I would often go in and buy coffee for everyone at my work and see her, and since I worked at a cannabis store and she is a regular consumer she would often come into my work and I would run I to her there.

Because of circumstances involving another girl right before this, when things started I was actively avoiding all hitting on or being flirty with anyone. Since I kept going in and buying an order of like 12 different coffees from her on a weekly basis though, we ended up in the position of just getting to chat for a good few minutes regularly while she made the coffees and it was nice, but I just saw it as a regular interaction with a friendly barista. Fast forward a couple months though and she ends up in my store getting her greens and pulls me aside to see if I wanted her number and I don't know why but it was the sweetest and cutest moment I've shared with a person but anyways, that's not the point (probably worth noting this is only back in January). So I got her number but was still a little rattled by the girl before and I maintained a position of just acting like a friend and not being flirty unless she initiated things. Within a short amount of time we were going on dates and sleeping together and having a really nice and genuine start to a relationship.

I was absolutely content just liking Mia and keeping things casual and when I started work at my new job (a new dispensary just up the road that was opening up) I even had a little ""Woah no, we don't use that word"" moment with my new co-worker when he mentioned our ""girlfriends"" knew each other (his girlfriend was Mia's hairdresser) because it was too early. By the time another month or so later passed however, we were in early to mid March and things definitely felt early and rushed but they had also gone well enough and felt solid enough to feel okay using the boyfriend/girlfriend label so we talked and agreed and settled on that. 

As I'm sure most know though, things were shifting in the world and by the end of March the pandemic had hit, both of us were out of work and it was just not a good time (our relationship still felt solid, it was just not a good time with anything else). At this time I ended up moving in with my parents temporarily. It was an easy decision given everything, as this time last year I was doing chemotherapy to beat Hodgkins lymphoma (fully beat it, and 100% in the clear) but my parents live just outside the city where social distancing and steering clear of the virus are a lot easier. It also gave me a couple months without having to pay rent or utilities and am now in a position to have money saved to find a place on my own instead of having to live with 4 roommates. It was a spur of the moment decision moving though and I talked with Mia first but we both agreed that seeing each other regardless was not likely for a short bit but given my health issues from last year moving out here was a good decision and we liked each other and were confident we would be in each other's arms soon enough so a little distance and break was nothing to worry about.

Fast forward a little over a month and a half though and she has now broken up with me, but it's very clear that it is the distance and the pandemic which has caused this. We've talked a lot about it and it seems like she still likes me, she finds me attractive and wants me in her life and wants to be friends and talk and hang out but she says feeling aren't there anymore. And I get it, we never did anything to keep any ""sparks"" going the way they would if we could see each other naturally in the way they were and it's hard for those things as well. I just don't know if I should hold of to hope that we can try again after this is over. During our talking about this Mia has said that she thinks feelings wouldn't have faded if it hadn't become a long-distance thing and has said that she doesn't know whether or not they could come back once we are able to see each other and live normally again. From the sounds of it the base foundation for any kinds of feelings or romance is still there, we like each other, we find each other attractive, we just don't have the seeing each other that was a catalyst for those romantic feelings to be there which I totally get. Isolation is whack and this pandemic and the anxiety that comes with it something that I totally understand how with this going on everything it's impossible for us to stay together. But I also know that like everything it will be over eventually and it's a unique scenario where if it's not possible for us to see each other now it's due to circumstances that make it not possible for us to see and find romance with other people also. In addition, if things change and we are able to safely go out and start seeing other people it would also mean it's safe for us to see each other. 

I guess it seems like a no-brainer to think that, if everything was there for us to have a romance that was really going somewhere (like honestly it was such a great and healthy relationship), and it's only not there because of quarantine, it's easy to think it's not only possible but likely that once there is no quarantine everything will be there for us to have those sparks and feelings once more. But I'm worried that breaking up now has put us in a position where that can't happen now.

It's hard to formulate into words but basically I can see how we could end up where in one instance we look at the idea of ""the feelings are gone, and they could come back"" and focus on the ""could come back"" part or we could look at that idea and focus on the ""the feelings are gone part"". So in one instance we could hang out and feel open to things, and without any pressure on it we are still just open and if we find each other cute then sure, that hang-out could lean more towards a date vibe. I worry though about getting into a scenario where leaving things open like that feels a bit taboo because technically we've broken up and settled on things being over for now.

I don't know, it's really hard to explain and put into words but I just don't want to give up hope if there truly is hope left, and also if there is hope left but only under certain circumstances or if certain things are done then I just want to know those things so I don't have to permanently lose something that would otherwise have only been gone temporarily. I don't know, I still really like this girl.",16May2020,1

725,"I‘m 17/M, just for clarification. So I‘m extremely self conscious, especially regarding my looks. Aside from having been bullied at school (I was overweight at the time) my father wasn‘t of much help. Ever since I could think, he criticized me for everything, I can‘t really remember ever having a good moment with him. I‘d always fake being happy around him and it got to the point where I seriously don‘t like him anymore. 

My mom left him when I was 1, so I‘ve never really lived with him. He does call me every other day though, to see how I‘m doing. And this is where the problem is. He is so narcissistic that he always thinks he‘s in the right and treats me like an extention of himself. He couldn‘t achieve his dreamjob, so now I have to do it, for example. 

He doesnt trust me in any way (because he doesn‘t trust anybody, he‘s got a serious basic distrust.) and so he‘d often think that if I did show any sign of anger towards him, it‘s because my mother turned me against him (my mom is awesome btw). The issue with this is that he does genuinely care for me. 

He‘s an ass but he genuinely thinks he‘s doing the right thing, so I can‘t say he‘s a bad person because, again, he really does care and he really does think he‘s always right. I could make this post twenty pages long, but I think you get the gist of it, so now to the reason I‘m writing this post: 

Our whole family (from my father‘s side) had a meeting on zoom today. He didn‘t show up at first because he thought „they‘d“ be spying on him through zoom (again, basic distrust) but in the last five minutes he did show up and he saw me. Now, I wasn‘t able to shave because I‘d lost the charger for my razor. 

I got compliments from everyone in the family for my looks and (even over the last few years, since I‘ve lost weight basically, but also when they told me that today) I felt like I got a little more confident. 

To make this a bit clearer, I have depression and social anxiety (yes, I‘m in therapy and not self diagnosing) so I really am that self conscious and it‘s been hard for most of my life dealing with it. You‘d imagine my reaction when the zoom meeting was over and my dad called me privately, to tell me that, yes, I‘m quoting him now, I „look like shit“ and „I should go buy a new razor and shave immediately“. 

I haven‘t cried in two years but this shit broke me. After the call was over I went to my mom because I just had to tell someone and the tears just started flowing, not even I expected that. He said that anytime my mom would pick up „some random guy“ (her boyfriend is one of the best people I ever met in life) I would start „looking like a hobo“ and „he thought he brought me on the right track, especially when I was overweight, but now it‘s going downhill again“. 

Please note that he always gave me shit to eat as a kid, my mom was the one that put me into rehab because of my weight and helped me become who I am today and the rest of it was my own hard work. I completely cut out sugar and basically anything that was unhealthy and trained like hell, none of that came from him. 

I just don‘t know what to do and so I guess I‘m asking for advice? I‘m just so incredibly angry I don‘t know how to handle it. And I‘ve always felt guilty when I talked about his negative sides because again, he does care about me, but still. That‘s also why I can‘t stop being in touch with him + everyone else in my family is incredibly precious to me. I could complain about so many more things, I have barely scratched the surface, but I’ll leave it at that. 

I just had to get this out somehow, thanks for taking your time and reading this mess of a post.",16May2020,1
726,"This is going to be detailed and long, if you read through it all I greatly appreciate it. I’ll put a TL;DR at the bottom though. I’ve been with my job for 3 years, I absolutely LOVE my co-workers. In fact, they’re like 90% of the reason why I have stayed and also come back from other shitty jobs I’ve worked in between. My boss is an awesome guy but he “drinks the kool-aid” so he’s a completely different person in vs outside of work. Which is understandable, but it just adds to the stress of it all. I love talking to people but I feel like this job has contributed to a lot of my anxiety over the last few years. I LOVE talking to people, I hate selling to people. And it’s not like I can’t do the job, but some off form of social anxiety has set in the last year and it’s hindered my performance greatly. I also am just going to come out and say I fucking hate having to convince someone to buy something just so I can eat for the week. The thing that sucks is I have health insurance tied to this job, my 401K, stuff like that. But I live in a relatively small town where things are part time, which I can’t afford, or serving gigs. But I’m at the point where I’m sick and tired of relying on commission or having jobs where I have no set pay a week. And the jobs around here WITH set pay a week don’t pay enough. I know a lot of people deal with this issue as well. I just am sick and tired of my sales job and I don’t know what to do. I’d even take a work from home position at this point doing literally anything I can train in that pays well. I’m just completely at a loss and need some advice. I don’t even know what kind of advice, I just feel MISERABLE coming to work every single day. 

TL;DR I feel absolutely miserable at my sales job, I hate having to convince people to buy stuff just so I can eat for the week. Have health care tied to this job, 401K, and other jobs don’t pay enough or are part time. Will literally do work from home jobs if I get training and it pays decent, anything.

732,"It's a long one. I'm sorry. 

Almost 6 years ago I met the first person I had ever loved. I was an adult, though a youngish one. I fell for him so hard. It was sun, moon and stars type of a thing. Lots of unhealthy traits in my relationship with him - I had never been in a serious relationship, didn't have a lot of self esteem and also came from a really unstable home. He was a recovering drug addict - that shouldn't take away from him being a truly wonderful human being. 

He taught me so much about myself and life. After a couple of years of on and off, we ended for good. 

Since then, I have had another relationship that is now over(due to many reasons), has been for quite a few months. I have a child, who I love more than anything. 

The problem is - I still love this man. Right or wrong, I can't help it. I have thought of him every single day from the last time I saw him. 

I did love my ex, the father of my child, in a very different way, but it was love. 

I'm still in contact with him - although this is fairly recent. We've only spoken a few times in the past 3 years, apart from these past few months when it has been more often. 

I cannot be with him. I know that. My child and I are more important. He is a wonderful person but he is not in control when it comes to his addiction and while his intentions are always to love and heal I could never take the risk of having his drug use around my child. I also couldn't take another broken heart. 

I just don't know what to do. I could stop talking to him, that would be a start - but what then? 

I love him. Always have, from a few weeks after we met until today. I have really grown as a person in the past few years, taken big steps to better myself and be a good parent. I still cannot get him out of my heart though, and I fear it's going to affect and hinder any future relationships.",16May2020,1

737,"So I run a Monster of the Week group bi-weekly after 9pm. It had a weird start.  I invited 3 friends and one showed up at my door with two people I didn’t know with very little warning.

I’ve had some problems and I don’t know how to express them, I’ve gotten to the point that I don’t want to continue.
1) I don’t like the new people that were invited.  I let them join and wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but I just am not enjoying it anymore. One meta-gamed to be unkillable, the other is just a personality clash.  Their a fine person, I just don’t enjoy them.
2) I’m unhappy with my own story telling.  This system was not the right one for the story I wanted to tell and it got away from me.  I don’t know how to put it back on track.

745,"Hi, this is my first post and it's on mobile, so I'm sorry if you have formatting issues and if it is unorganized as hell, I'm in a very emotional state as I'm writing this. Also I don't know if this is the right place to post this but hey, why not. 

Okay, so this started about 4+ish days ago. I've (18f?) been questioning my gender identity and I've been having constant anxiety/depression from it. It k ijnda hit me like a freight train. Mainly because 1) I've never (that comes to mind quickly) ever questioned my gender before. I've just never really thought about it or even considered that I might be something other than female. 2) I'm worried about what if I am? I know in this day and age it should be fine but I'm concerned because idk, I've never thought about this before.

It really started to hit me when I cut my hair 4 days ago. I've had it short before, but this felt different. I don't know how to explain it. Since then, it's really started to affect how I'm thinking and feeling. A week or so prior to cutting my hair, I noticed I started dressing more masculine. I didnt really think much if this as I feel like I go through phases where I feel super masculine or feminine. Usually I joke with my friends that it is my sexuality showing (I'm pansexual, but I lean more towards feminine people).

Anyways, I have been embracing my more masculine side, if anything I look androgynous, which is what I am recently finding I feel really comfortable with. 

I've been thinking about how throughout my life I would have these intense moments that would last for a day where I'd dress stereotypically female, then when I was 10+ I would wear pants and hoodies because I felt uncomfortable with my body. I was paranoid of my breasts, so much so I would hate to participate in sports. There's be days where I'd want to have surgery to remove them, or if stand in front of the mirror and press them down to see what is look like with a flatter chest. I always put this down as my body was changing due to puberty and I just felt uncomfortable in general with my body. I would always wear jeans and baggy shirts and hoodies (still do) and I just felt really comfortable dressing like that. It was rare I would want to wear a dress, though I do love crop tops. I also remember when I was a kid, I hated the idea of being associated with being girly e.g. hated and refused any colour close to pink, wore my hair up constantly, never really wore dresses unless necessary, didn't watch girly kid shows, that type of thing.

But another thing I remember as I kid (12 and yo younger) is that I also loved makeup, 
 making my hair nice and taking a bit of pride in my appearance. These are all things that are still interests of mine to this day.

I became more accepting of my body since I got older and not as critical about my breasts, or other more female features/activities. I realised it was okay to like the colour pink and to openly talk about my love for Disney and musicals. I didn't have to feel like I had to hide them because they didn't make me feel ""weak"" anymore.

Now, for whole mental debacal in my head right now is ""you can't be genderfluid/non-binary, you need dysphoria for that"" or ""this is all in your head, you're faking it for attention"". I realise these are most likely manifestations of my anxiety and such, but I can't stop thinking it. I just don't know what to do from here.

I've tried downloading/going onto forums and theralt/counselling apps for this but so far I can't go further because of money or because they aren't related to what I'm asking. And for therapy, by the time I get a reference for a place, it takes 2+ months to get in, and with this Miss Rona around, it's been confirmed to be longer because of the people already there.

I haven't talked to anyone about this. I just feel so confused and scared to say anything because those little voices in my head saying ""it's fake, it's for attention, everyone will laugh at you, you need gender dysphoria for that"" etc. I know this is irrational and it's definitely my anxiety in overdrive. I would hope that of someone close to me felt this way, they'd come to me about because they know that I love them and would support them 100%. It's just my mind is like, nope those standards don't apply to you. I do have people close to me (my partner, and his family as I'm not close with mine) who I think would support but I'm so scared that what if it's not real and I'm taking away attention from others with issues. 

I don't expect anyone to have the grand answers I need about this, because it's a thing with me and need to figure that out on my own, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read this, I know it's a long one. 😊

It wasn’t there before and before I knew what was happening, the front of the car collided with my front bike tire. The next thing I knew I was on the ground in complete shock. 
The elderly woman in the car(about 60 or so)immediately stopped  and came rushing towards me, asking if I was ok and how she didn’t see me. I slowly got up as another woman (probably 30) came over to me asking if she needed to call an ambulance. I was fine (I thought) but my bike wasn’t. The front tire was dented and the bike chain had come loose, making it impossible to ride it. After telling the two ladies (absolute guardian angels) that I was fine, I picked up my bike and headed for home. Luckily The Road I was crossing was the way home so I only had to walk for about 5 minutes. When I got home I put my bike in the garage and told my mom that I had crashed into a curb at high speeds. If anyone is curious, yes it is possible to break a bike by crashing into a curb. That’s how I trashed my old one. 
While I was in my room, I noticed a pain on my right knee. When I looked down and rolled my pant leg, this is what I saw: a ripped left pocket, a bruised toe, a scratch on the left side of my foot, and about FIVE scrapes and scratches on my right led from my knee to my ankle. After telling my mom about my injuries and patching myself up,dad called me (he was on a business trip) asking if I was ok. I said yes and told him the same story that I had told my mom. 
He said that when he got back, he would get my bike fixed. Why didn’t I tell them about my bike? Because I knew what would happen if I did. My mom would give me a lecture about bike safety and would NEVER let me ride my bike alone. But that probably wouldn’t be a problem because my dad would most likely take my bike away. If it was just a simple accident then everything would be absolutely fine. But in a case of events like me, my parents’ one and only 11 year old daughter, getting hit by a car? Bad things would happen. So reddit, tell me: should I keep this a secret from my parents and get to keep biking by myself, or should I tell them and never be left alone until I move out?",16May2020,1
750,"Hello everyone. I’m 23(m), Greek.  Was struggling with a light form of depression in the last couple of years which got extremely better a few months ago after receiving medication (alongside the reply sessions).

I had always wanted to move out from Greece(was living on an isolated island). I managed to save up a good enough amount of money by literally doing nothing last year apart from saving my pathetic wage (Greek economy) and being mentally better, I decided to move to a Edinburgh to start a new life(my life so far in Greece was nowhere near what I wanted it to be).

Fast forward, moved to Edinburgh on February and after a month, the lockdown hits. 
I’m forced to work at a supermarket(I’m actually a beginner chef) which is extremely hectic, my flatmates that I was getting used to decided to leave(meaning that I’ll have to deal with new people), my few friends from Greece don’t give me the attention I’d like and generally don’t get enjoyment out of doing anything.
I wake up at 5:30 to go to work(though I can’t wait to finish), finish at 2 and then staying in bed all day doing nothing. 
I got my PC with me, but I’m not in the mood to play anything or even watch a movie anymore. I bought a Nintendo Switch cause I’d like to play something on there, instantly felt guilty of the big amount of money I spent(I’m not getting any financial help from family, have spent the money I’ve saved and am left with the money Im making) and canceled it. 

I honestly just feel very defeated by the lockdown. It’s not that I feel sad, sure I feel v disappointed but at the same time I’m not feeling anything. Everything feels pointless. And I don’t know what I’m gonna find after the lockdown.

Everything just sucks. I can’t help but feeling unlucky and f***ed by the universe.",16May2020,2

753,"I (24f) just graduated as a first generation college student, but it's been hard it is to be exited about this milestone because of the COVID-19 shut down/""postponed"" commencement ceremony. My brother(26) and his wife(22) offered to put together a small graduation dinner party with only my immediate family (Mom, Dad, and them), and one or two of my closest friends that have been extra cautious during this time.

My best friend (22f) hasn't taken any precautions during the pandemic. Even going so far as complaining about the lady that gave her crap for not wearing a mask at the post office. She and I have talked about it and she said that because no one she's close with is an at-risk individual, she doesn't care about taking precautions. She even admitted that she knew this was a selfish mindset. She's very self aware. 

Here's where it gets tricky. My mom (51f) has a brain tumor and her anticonvulsant medication puts her at risk. I'm my mom's full time caregiver during the week so my dad can go to work (he's still able to isolate at work), my dad has her on weekends, and I even quit my job to help keep her safe. I barely leave the house, and if I do I'm extremely careful.

I invited my best friend to my grad dinner that's a week from today, but I told her that I was only comfortable with her coming if she had been extra cautious for a couple weeks beforehand. She told me that she would take extra precautions to ensure the safety of my family. She loves my family and wouldn't want to put my mom at risk.

The problem is that I know she's still hanging out in groups. One of her friends even admitted she didn't care and wasn't going to stop seeing anyone just because of the pandemic. This is a group of people that I wouldn't trust with the health and safety of my mom, and she was with all of them last night. I really don't know what to do because it would break my heart to uninvite my best friend, but I did warn her...

755,"I got a call from my angry ex-husband a few nights ago -- we got a dissolution right before covid-19 hit the US. He is the hiring manager for a large local contracting company. He told me that he'd just had an interview with someone (he would not say their gender or name) who works at the same company I do(a large retailer). The person began to slander me almost immediately. 


He said they called me a slut, that I was a flirt who would spread her legs for anyone. (I think my ex may have made this part up, since he was  a jealous, controlling person who was always accusing me of this) 


But then, he claimed they said I was sleeping with one of the security guards (who we will call ""M"") and that we had been flirting for months before my divorce. I am not a slut, and I certainly don't flirt with everyone -- the only person I really have ever low key flirted with is M(we didn't even talk for nearly a year until my divorce started, just did body language flirting), but no one knows about it except my former frenemy and his former fellow security guard, unless someone really was watching M and I that closely, in which case it's honestly creepy as hell. 


I was thinking I would tell M about it but otherwise ignore it. It's really crushingly disappointing because I'm positive we have a mutual crush, and I'm planning on leaving the company anyway. 

The thing is, now my ex wants to beat up M, and has said he's going to hunt him down and beat his face in. I talked him down but I'm afraid of it happening anyway. That will ruin my professional reputation, I'll be fired, and my ex has told me repeatedly that ""the divorce is only a piece of paper. I want you back."" I'm honestly both scared and angry. Who would do something so terrible? I left my ex because he was controlling and abusive, and I told work because I had to. M escorted me to my car for a few weeks until I felt safe but that was never for more than a 2 minute walk in a lit, filmed parking lot, and this person claims we were banging and making out?! 


Edited to add: workplace dating is all right where I work as long as you're not dating your direct supervisor.

756,"I (M19) dated my then girlfriend (F18) for 1.5 years, but we were pretty close for about 2 years. These two years were great; we spent nearly every day together and got along really well. There was rarely conflict, and when there was, it was resolved. Nearly three months ago she cheated on me. I forgave her, for she wasn’t in a good head space. Following this she said she needed some time to think and get her head straight. Again, nearly three months later and I tried to message her to see if she was okay, to check in on her and see how things were going. She’d often tell me that “she could see us rekindling in the future” but whenever I messaged her she would also label it as “intrusive” and say that “I’m not respecting her boundaries”. I gave her space, I just want to resolve the problem; I don’t like to end things on a bitter note. She blocked me on all social media and earlier tonight I convinced her to unblock me. She said that “if I message her again that she will block me”; and it’s not even like

I’m extremely tempted to call her out for cheating on me and for being toxic.

757,"Hey Everyone - First time posting on this Subreddit, and hoping I might be able to get some advice. My situation isn't complicated, but all the same I'm having a hard time figuring out how to deal my current surroundings.

I live with my Girlfriend in a 2 Bedroom Apartment - We live alone, and have been here for a few years. About a month ago, my father, who is H.I.V. positive, moved in with us for the sake of his mental health, as he was living along and having a very hard time dealing with the current state of the world.

Since he has moved in, I have explained to my Girlfriend that, though we were already well prepared and being diligent in our safety, that we would need to step it up even further given the risks that come with my Dad sharing our apartment.

In this time, I have begun being a bit of a 'Fire Marshall' on this - Whenever anyone, father or Girlfriend, walks in the door, if I see them doing anything other than washing their hands, I'll shout out 'Oi! Wash yer hands!' as a security measure. Both of them are B-Type Extroverts, where as I am an A-Type Introvert. I'm super anal, OCD, and very organized in the way I do things, whereas they are much more relaxed in their routines and patterns.

In the past, I have had massive issues with my Girlfriend remembering certain requests. Obviously, we're all human - I leave my dishes in the sink un-rinsed like a twat, leave the shower curtain in the bathtub while running baths, all that good stuff. But with my Girlfriend, she is self-proclaimed ADHD, to the point the uses it as a defense in certain situations, which I completely understand.

Now, though, she's constantly frustrated with me for being diligent. She mentioned her father was traveling in the coming weeks for work, and I mentioned we should make sure to see him in the next little while, since we'll need to Quarantine from him entirely for 2 weeks after his return. Rather than agreeing, I was told 'I know, you don't need to tell me that', which I find incredibly juvenile from a mentally healthy adult.

We went on a walk in the forest with her parents today, and despite my pleas for smart decision making and safety, within 5 minutes they were swapping phones and sharing pictures. As I pointed out, that one decision completely made pointless all of the distancing practices we were putting in place. I'm well aware that this level of attention isn't easy for everyone to be mindful of, whereas for me, it's my bread and butter. This is proven by the phone exchange, as no one but me thought anything of it until I pointed out the issue.

I am having an incredibly hard time finding respect for my Girlfriend in this situation. I love her dearly, intend to propose (once her father says yes... Still Pending...) and have a full life with her, and none of this changes that, but I don't like being so resentful towards her because of this, nor do I like realizing the I've lost respect for her in this.

She believes that her sensitivity comes first, and that I should trust her rather than being anal and Fire Warden-y about it. While I understand the concept, I think that safety, particularly in a potentially life or death situation with my H.I.V. positive father, is so, so, so, so much more important than a 28 year old who gets offended by someone wanting to play it safe.

I've explained this to her repeatedly, and we've just had a large blow up over it. I'm trying to get advice on how to handle it, as well as to know if I'm out of place - Am I wrong in thinking safety, explained politely but regularly, is more important than what I perceive to be the massive over-sensitivity of an adult's emotional response to said safety?

Any and all advice is welcome.",16May2020,2
758,"I am worried that my roommate’s cat may not be getting the best care and it is affecting her health. The litter isn’t kept clean. When I moved in there was a discussion about her litter box because of the smell and I then learned she cleaned it every few weeks. I read up on a dirty litter box and what could happen and many articles mentioned cats getting UTIs because of them having to hold their urine if they don’t want to go in their dirty boxes. Anyway, skip to a few months later and the cat gets kidney stones, which can be caused by UTIs. I can’t say for certain that that was related to the litter box, but it seems likely. If I ever have to go in her room (the laundry machines are in there) 9 times out of 10 her water bowl is dirty (usually with food it looks like). Regardless of the kidney stones, I feel like the cats overall health isn’t great. She is very inactive (and although she is 4, I’ve known plenty of cats that were at least somewhat active and playful up until their later years), she doesn’t eat much, but she is slightly overweight. I don’t want to make accusations, but I also want this cat to get good care if it is affecting her. Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. As well as how/if I should mention anything to my roommate. Also, I’m not too sure if there are any kinds of cat food out there that would make a cat less active, but she eats Purina and I’ve always read bad things about it. So if anyone knows for certain that Purina can even affect a cat’s health negatively I would appreciate it!",16May2020,2
759,Hey everyone. I have a friend who’s really toxic. I know he says the things as jokes but it pisses me and my other friends off as well. We’re all very early teenagers so keep this in mind if it’s important. I’m young and I wrote and published a book and gave it for free to all my friends. Well this toxic friend tells me it’s an awful book and if he wanted to he could write it better. He said that there were lousy characters and no character development. I have pretty thick skin so I wasn’t offended by this. But then he starts telling me I’m worthless and I’m going to die being nothing in this world. Once again I just laugh it off and tell him he’s a dick bag. He constantly says these things every single day and also saying stuff like if we killer ourselves it would do the world a favor. When quarantine is over the first things I’m going to do is probably sock him. He says those things daily and it’s starting to piss me off. Any thoughts?,16May2020,1

I'm not saying she didn't do it, she's just not the type you'd expect to, and I know the most charming can be the most toxic underneath.

762,"Hey guys I never done this before I just need to hear what other people think because I don’t know what to do but here goes the semi long story 

Me and my girlfriend started dating in December of 2018 we are both seniors in high school and as to which we both claimed to be the best moment of our lives we spent all our time together doing everything and talking about everything. She was very depressed and she said I helped lift her out of that state we both helped each other. Then I started school again for hvac and I got a retail job instead of fast food.

 I think this is where it started to go downhill she started staying with me at my moms house and my moms house has some personal problems but we saw through them we got through it together. She also was there for me when my younger brother committed suicide. But with us being together all the time and my school that is hard for me and a shitty job with a asshole boss I think we normalized our life together she started to get bored and so I quit my job I was getting paid to go to school (that itself is a long story) but I quit to spend time with her but now I don’t have a job money isn’t a huge issue but it also is I find things for us to do and ask her what she wants to do and she always runs out of things to do. She slowly stopped doing the things she did when we first started dating.

 I tried to talk to her about it and she always pushed me away she never wanted to talk and everyday she grew more and more distant she promised to be my wife I’m saving up to get my own house after I graduate school me and her were supposed to move in together and get married her family loved me and my family loved her but within the last 2-3 weeks she says she’s gotten depressed again and needs her space so I let her leave to her moms house not like I had any choice anyway. And a few days go by and we are just talking now we aren’t seeing each other anymore and then the last day comes when she finally for no reason I can understand she said she can’t do this anymore. 

I miss her I love her and I understand she probably got bored and when I was going to school and had a job I was stressed out and we only hung out from around 9pm until she went to work in the morning I wasn’t the greatest I couldn’t afford flowers every week or something I still tried to do nice things for her she was my world she promised me forever she promised me she would be my wife and she gave me the best moments of my life and I don’t know how to move on I don’t know if I seriously did anything it seemed so fast we were perfectly fine a month ago but I’m sure she’ll claim it was all a facade just to make me happy but she did real things out of love she would really be interested she would write my name on the sidewalk and write it in her rear view mirror in her car I was her everything and I don’t understand where I went wrong or why she doesn’t want me anymore it’s completely destroyed me.

763,"I’m only 17 and I don’t want this post to come off as juvenile because of that. The friendship wasn’t very good with either Friend 1 or Friend 2 and the main reason I ended it with both of them was due to just being disregarded in a lot of ways and being generally unhappy. The biggest issue was that they both had these fixations with doing “fun” things. They would steal at every store they go to along with stealing and getting psychedelics, drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. And again with going to abandoned buildings, sneaking out and walking around at night, etc. They gave me a lot of experiences but I regret taking part in a lot of it and enabling them. After ending it I’m left feeling as though my life is boring without them, that I’m boring. Without my boyfriend whose been there for me throughout this, I have no other close relationships. I want to just enjoy my life for what it is now and embrace the fact that I have unlimited opportunities for new friends and better experiences.

764,"So I got a food delivery, took the bags upstairs to sit in the guest room and quarantined them.Some of them I left for 9+ days, most I took down after 9 days.Anyway, is it safe to consume the foods, considering they weren't exactly in a ""cool, dark place"" (like a cupboard) like most canned and glass jar goods state?

They were in the bags, in the bedroom kind of near to the window and at some points there probably would have been some sunlight on them. In the uk, so it's not crazy hot, but temperature got to about 24 degrees Celsius on some days (75.2 Fahrenheit)I don't know how long they would have been in or near sunlight or how long the temperatures were warm.

Anyway, is it a risk, or generally alright? Canned vegetables like carrots, peas, canned fruits like apricots and pineapple, cans of pasta, glass jars of pasta sauces, cuppa soups, packets of instant rice, cartons of almond milk, tins of beans, lentils, instant mash potato, tins of soup, etc.

765,"My parents woke me up today at 10:30 am, telling me it was noon and that I needed to be awake. I told them it wasn’t noon, and that I wanted to sleep for more time, which prompted my parents to take my phone and computer away. They read through my messages and my online journal. It felt horrible when they did that, even if I wasn’t hiding anything, but having my privacy invaded hurt me. My parents told me that I was wasting my life and that I should just pretend that I was living in a foster home, rather than feeling as if I live with parents who love me. 

I told my dad that what he said was hurtful, but he said it was the truth. My parents admitted that they didn’t really love me, and that they felt that all the effort they’ve put it in has been a failure. I struggle with depression, so whenever my parents tell me things that validate why I shouldn’t be alive, it really affects me. They’re the people that I love the most. I’m not a bad kid, I don’t smoke or do drugs, I get good grades, and I don’t break rules. I rarely talk back, even if I feel as if I’m being treated poorly. 

When I was in middle school, for around three years, I thought that I was trans. My parents didn’t support me and made me life horrible. There were times when their arguments got physical, and they never stopped my siblings from insulting me either. I’ve never felt supported by them, but I realized in high school that I wasn’t actually trans, and I started to get along with my parents better.

When I had my first big breakup, my parents continuously told me not to cry and would punish me if I would. They blamed the situation on me, saying I deserved the heartbreak. This happened again after a really abusive relationship I had, my parents told me I deserved how I had been treated. It extended to the sexual assault that happened to me when I was 13. Today they told me that they knew I had deserved the assault. 

All of these things have really destroyed me. I feel like a watered down version of who I used to be. I’m not happy, I don’t do what I love anymore. I can’t bring myself to do homework or spend time with others. My parents refuse to help me with therapy, so I feel as if my only options are to leave or to stay. If I stay, maybe I’ll get my parents to love me again. If I leave, maybe I’ll be happier and safer, but I’ll risk my relationship with them.

There’s a lot I don’t know, since I am just 16, and I don’t have too much money. I could stay with a friend, but it isn’t a long term solution. And I could afford housing for a little bit, but I wouldn’t even know where to start. I’m so scared to make such a big step, especially if staying at home would be easier.",16May2020,2
767,"I (25m) live in a flat together with my brother (20m). The flat belongs to my father who doesn't live here so we are not real flatmates but rather living together because that way we don't have to pay a lot of rent. 

Our childhood wasn't always easy. Our parents split when we were younger, we moved out of town with our mother, were pretty much poor and our parents couldn't give us enough attention. We had to move several times, change school. Our mother had babies with our stepfather and we were expected to act as grownups and do everything on our own. I only recently got into therapy. It helped me, but I was okay most of the time. 

I don't know that about my brother though. We don't really talk. He is isolating so much, we don't even meet in the flat. He avoids me. He has close to no friends and spends his life in front of the computer. Some nights I hear him talking playing games with a friend. Then while gaming he is very loud and sometimes very angry. But I am happy he interacts a little bit. He gained a lot of weight and when there is a family meeting , people comment on his body. 

I really love him. I remember the chidhood version of him. He was so energetic, climbing trees and walls and I sometimes still see him very much alive. But it makes me sad to no end that i don't know if and how much he suffers. 

It's not like I haven't tried to connect with him and try to talk to him about how he is doing, but that usually doesn't really lead anywhere so I rather talk to him about pc games or anything I think interests him. But right now he avoids me. 

He doesn't do many chores and I have to tell him to clean if I want help. I get angry when I have to do most of the cleaning by myself, but I don't want to be his parent. I can't kick him out. I can only move out and leave him even more alone. 

I am kind of desperate. This is my first post on reddit. Maybe someone has an idea of what I can do. 

My parents can't help him. My father is here sometimes but they simply have no connection. My mother has enough on her plate.

I think this all started a couple months ago, I had a crush back then, to this time I was just 17, and she already 20 I just loved every inch of her, every minute I saw her I thought damn I never want to loose her again, we hold hands, we talked hours kissed, but we never really were together, she said I would be the perfect guy for her, but she just don't want to attach to someone, I left her with that, with time and time she got more angry at me she wouldn't hold my hand, don't wanted to kiss me again, it just hurt a lot, to loose that what I once had, I broke down at  this point, trying to get ahead of myself and kept my head up again, accepting the way it went, sometime I blocked her everywhere I told her it's too hard for me to act like nothing happened at all, to look into her eyes and just see this endless hope I once had, that killed me..
So I blocked her, everywhere, this is now 5 months over, and still to this day she's in my head, yesterday I was dreaming about her, I saw her, she held my hand, I just didn't want to wake up there.. Still I got snapped back to reality and was again in my same boring room where I  wake up alone everyday.

Now I'm 18, and like I said I have no idea what to do, I want to love someone again, but i just can't let go of these stupid past that once happened. I need advice, of you guys, I heard this is a nice community, and so I think I'm in the right place,  I'm asking you guys how do you get past such things, and how do you learn to accept yourself the way you are, how does that all work, I need advice..

Thank you! Im up for every awnser you can give me",16May2020,1

775,"so my friend just told me that she was diagnosed with an eating disorder. she has told me that she will be getting help (!) and i could not be more proud of her.  however a lot of our friend activities involve buying a load of food and eating it in a very short space of time. she has previously told me that she wishes she had a metabolism like mine and has made remarks about my eating habits (not mean spirited btw!!)  so this has always been a road im hesitant to walk because more than anything i dont want her to feel like im judging her

i want to make sure that on her path to recovery she still feels supported and that this new development doesnt change anything about our friendship, but i don't want to accidentally trigger anything related to her ed and am worried that some of our activities might do this. 

im also worried that if i change our food rituals this might make her feel as though im being overly wary of her ed and accidentally draw it into the spotlight - as someone who's experienced disordered eating i want to make sure that she doesnt feel the way i felt when others noticed my behaviour

I went on a leave of absence from college last May due to some traumatic events that happened over the fall and spring semesters. I spent the past year recovering in therapy, as well as joining some 12-step programs for issues I realized I’ve had for a very long time. This recovery took up the majority of my first “semester” on leave, as I was very unstable, and for the second semester I enrolled in community college courses at home because I felt I needed a bit more time to figure out future plans while getting credits (went to a university out of state, but I’m thinking of going to a less expensive one in state now). 
Now, I feel more than ready to start working; I want to get started with my life again and save up for tuition costs. I’ve been applying to a lot of jobs the past few weeks and have an interview on Monday for this semi-professional job nearby. I’m really nervous about how to answer for the year-long gap in my resume... should I be completely honest? How much will I have to explain? I’m not sure how it will be taken if I explain the events that happened and the 12-step programs I’m a part of (or how I could really explain all of it anyway to an employer). 

What should I do?

781,"Hi, I (20f) felt a decline in my passion and ambition in school during middle school, high school, and the first couple of year of college. I actually did pretty well this past semester, but it’s bc I took some art classes, French class, and an entrepreneur class. In high school, I was pushed into focusing on STEM careers, but had no interest in them. I was told to only pursue traditionally stable paths. I always told myself that I could do these things until I saved enough money to pursue stuff I actually wanted to do, stuff more along the lines of fashion and beauty, but I realized this is no way to live. I can’t succeed in these more traditional &amp; stable college majors, simply because I have little to no interest in them. I’ve always love fashion/beauty/aesthetics, but the school I go to doesn’t offer anything in that area. I’m also two years into college, going into my third year. I can’t really transfer anywhere, although I did well this semester- my gpa is still embarrassingly low. I want to pursue this, it’s the only thing I’ve felt a deep interest in, but what can I do? I don’t even know how to use a sewing machine (I can see by hand though). I know people might say it’s not a smart idea, but doing well in something that I love will probably work out better for me than doing poorly in things I have no interest in.

He asked me to make him a coffee and to make my mom one. Our machine is simple and after putting the cup you just gotta chose between the button for the small coffee or big coffee. I assumed they wanted the small coffee cuz he said ""get us a little coffee"". So I made them a little coffee and when I gave it to them he was annoyed that it was the small one. He said he would explain to me how to make the coffee when I already knew how to do it. I told him I knew how to do it I just misunderstood how much they wanted but he kept insisting that he would 'teach me'. Even though I've done it so many times before with no problem. 

I was trying to explain that I knew how to do it, and he raised his voice. My mistake was that I raised it a bit too and so he was yelling at me that I always respond and never listen and that stuff. I get it, it must be annoying to have me respond whenever you tell me something that doesn't need a response, but he doesn't realize not only does he do this too, but I feel like he patronizes me whenever he's trying to ""teach me"". I tend to understand the mistakes that I've made them quickly and correct them. I quickly got the idea that I misunderstood the size but he kept telling me he will explain to me how to do something that I've been doing too much.

Hi! So I really liked this girl from my French class last year. She was really pretty, and funny, and we got along really well. She would drop a lot of mixed messages, i.e. having me walk her to class, asking to come to my after school stuff, stuff like that. She was also a bad tester (or she didn’t want to talk to me) so I wasn’t sure how she felt. Eventually I built up the courage to ask her out. I didn’t want to do it over text, but it was right before spring break and I didn’t want to wait 10 days to tell her. I didn’t even get a response. She didn’t come to the next few classes, and when she did come back she didn’t talk to me. After maybe a month, she’s try and talk to me a little bit, but not directly (like I’d make a joke in class and she’d quietly say “you’re funny, (my name)). I was trying to get over her so I didn’t entertain it. Summer came and went. I went on a few dates with other girls, but I wasn’t interested. School came around again, and I would see her in the halls. She would say hi, I would say hi, and that was about it. I was still trying to move on. I went on dates with two other girls during the year, and once again it went nowhere. Recently, she unfollowed me on Instagram. I don’t know why I can’t get over this girl who didn’t even have the time of day to give me a friend zone response or something.

796,"Hi guys, I would love to get some insight on a desicion I have to make. 

Its about moving back in with my parents. For the past two years I lived in a really nice city, awesome location and great space. (left home before this two years but this is the only living place I really like) However, during this time I met zero people and made no friends. Makes me pretty sad, however I also didn't try (I don't go out for parties or exersize and don't have free time on 'normal hours' to join a club orsomething like that) Also I have been trying to quit smoking weed and sigarets for longer then a year without succes... Am quite addicted (also went to therapy for it but honestly, wasn't worth the money, looking back at it). Im working part-time, a stressful job that I don't like and am very depend on it to pay my bills (like we all do I guess). I study full-time and have long commutes. So all I do is work, smoke, some school stuff and that's it. All my family lives quite far away and I can go for days, weeks without speaking to any of them, anyone for that matter. And this lifestyle is not normal. So my family would love to see me back at home. 

Here are my pros and cons 


Cons:

- Extremely rural area, need to get a driver's lisence and a car (so not cheap)

- No public transport nearby 

- Nearest 'good' city is 45 min away by car, double with public transport. 

- No people of my age in that small village

- Very catholic village 

- Feel like it's gonna be very hard to meet people and/or make friends

- Giving up a part of my self sufficientcy and freedom?

- My parents drink a lot every evening and I hate that. 

- Mom smokes sigarets and seeing here smoke really triggers me. 

- Don't want to get 'mothered' (about coming home late and whatnot) 

- Need to give up a well paying job (but I don't like my job so..) 



Pro:

- Giving up a job I don't like 

- More time with my dog 

- More time for personal development and school 

- Will be less lonely 

- No high rent

- Peaceful area with little noise and lots of nature 

- More space 

- Own bathroom 

- hopefully will improve my mental and psychical health...



Thanks anyways 🙏

805,"As I'm writing this the answer to this question becomes more clear, but I'll explain to you guys anyways.

Like most schools due to recent events we've switched to a credit/no-credit grading system where you either pass or fail the class. There's no letter grades. So for my 9th grade English class our final assignment for the last few weeks of school is to do these group debates. Now if you do everything required you pass the class and get the credit. However, if you're slacking off, not treating your teammates with respect or do really bad in the debate you don't get the credit. Pretty basic stuff. However, if you did not get the credit you can write an argumentative essay at the end if the year on a topic assigned by the teacher to get the credit. So I was thinking that I could just not due anything for the next 4 weeks and because I'm a pretty good writer I could write a decent essay to get the credit.

It seems much easier but the more I think about the consequences are going to be pretty bad. My parents who are really strict are gonna be informed, probably won't be able to get any recommendations for any advanced courses and my teammates would be pissed. Plus my teacher will make the topic really hard or grade really hard. Nevertheless it seems so much easier. Maybe I should convince everyone in my class to do the essay?

I’m going to join a home construction team and once I’m well read I’ll be apprenticing my friends parents as they are full time flippers... 

I’m also getting my real estate license this summer. 

I know house flipping isn’t easy but within two years I am confident I’ll be well read and experienced enough to buy my first property and flip. As I’ll have saved near 80K within a year and a half I will have more than enough for a small flip. 

I know I’ll need to essentially become a manager of a construction site but that’s why I will start by working for a contractor and start small with my own flips. 

But hell what’s easier? Getting a college degree and a shitty desk job? Or learning how to flip homes? 

I’d much rather be the boss of myself as I’ve already read my first flipping book I’m hungry for more, something I’ve never felt after being assigned a semester of reading about Ancient Rome or any bs like that lol.
Wish me luck. Yolo",16May2020,1
813,"Background: I lost 3 friends to suicide this year and visited another 2 after attempts on their life (even taking one to the hospital). My boyfriends friend (who I haven’t met a whole bunch) has been showing signs of a severe manic episode (like one of my friends who passed) and because he owns firearms, i’m very worried that he is a risk to himself. Earlier today, I messaged him and said “hey dude, you’re showing signs of a manic episode (extreme spending, impulsivity, self destructive behavior, etc) I’m worried about you, I think you should talk a therapist. I don’t know you super well, but you don’t seem to be ok.” 

He. Lashed. Out. He brought up my previous relationship (where my ex was physically abusive), called me crazy, and called my boyfriend to tell me I was out of control. Our relationship until now has mostly been memes and banter, but even if we aren’t super close, I don’t know if opening the dialogue in that context was wrong. I’m a health teacher and I teach classes on peer mental health interventions, but I didn’t begin to think this was a possibility. 

He thought it came off as condescending about his decisions, which I apologized for. He did not apologize for saying “(Ex’s name) must’ve hit your head too hard because you sound insane.” My boyfriend is annoyed I reached out to his friend without checking first and that he had to diffuse the situation. I don’t know how to move forward. Was I wrong in bringing it up?",16May2020,1

815,"I'll preface with this: my formal title is a receptionist. Up until I actually started my job, I thought all I would be doing is paperwork. Not working with the machines.

Ever since I was a child, I have had uncontrollable anxiety when being examined with the machines at the eye doctor's office. I squirm at the sheer concept of being dilated and having people put drops in my eyes. As a result I'm in my early twenties, have worn glasses since age four, and never even considered contacts. Again, I didn't think I would have any problems because I thought the doctors would work with all of that.

Turns out I'm expected to do things called ""Prechecks"" where I operate some of the basic machines, do the vision test with the letters, and worst of all, dilate and demonstrate how to wear contacts. I'm absolutely terrified of those last two. Like, I'd rather catch the flu than have my eyes dilated/ touched. 

I have a therapist who I plan on mentioning this to, but do you have any advice? I just graduated college but because of Covid, jobs are really scarce in my area. My friends who graduated with me are either still looking for a job or are settling with the same retail work they did earlier. The pay and the people here are great, and I don't know what to do. Do I quit? Do I tell my boss about my fears? How can I get over this?

817,"The local pond has close to 200 turtles of the exact same species ( Red Ear Slider), the water is filtered and the turtles are fed both by fish and by hand (some old dude comes and drops oatmeal into the pond every morning). The turtles lay eggs, have babies, etc. Its a beautiful pond surrounded by suburbs and roads, as well as a special fence, from which the turtles can’t escape. 

My turtle, Shelly, has grown quite a bit since we got her, and we’re looking for a bigger tank for her, but due to the virus it’s currently gone out the window. It’s been on my mind to put her into the turtle pond, where she can swim and live among the rest of her species. It breaks my heart to see her in her current tank that’s clearly too small for her and there’s not much I can do about it. So I want to give her her freedom and put her in this pond 

Would releasing her be a bad idea? I need some foreign advice on this

Edit: I would never consider putting her back into the wild. I’m only considering this specific pond because it’s not wild and there’s people there who already take care of the turtles",16May2020,1
818,"This is going to be pretty messy and cluttered due to me being stressed out but here we go.

My dad is a single dad with me, my older brother (moved out) and my younger brother who has autism. He is struggling with money and doesent have a job at the moment. We are renting a house right now because we aren't able to afford one at the moment. 

I (14) have had to watch my little brother (7) for four years now, morning to night all day every day besides for when im in school. Most people would probably compare it to watching three toddlers at once so I have had to do this for FOUR years. My dad refuses to watch him at all and rarely tries to find a nanny to help me watch him. Keep in mind professionals have trouble watching him as he's, ""one of the harder ones"" and I have been forced to take care of him for four years with no help.

My dad always says he is trying to find a job but never does, were about to be evicted due to not having the money to pay rent and instead of trying to find a new place to rent or trying to find a job, my dad has sex all day and spends time with his ex (they broke up but they still go out all the time and have sex, sounds like they're still dating to me) he will come crying saying they broke up and I need to take care of my little brother because he needs time to mourn, yet the very same day they still go out and have sex and are practically dating.

If I ever break down or object to watching my little brother because I'm stressed then he threatens to abandon me or leave, he goes on the explain how his life would be so much easier and if I keep making his life stressful he will leave. I'm approaching my fifth year of this and I honestly dont know what to do. It's every day and I'm stuck and can't do anything about it. If I tell anyone or a, ""trusted adult"" they will think I'm just being a teenage brat and making shit up despite me litteraly having proof of this.

next morning he calls me and asks me if i calmed down, to witch i said why should i, if you wanna talk we agreed on place and time, he told me he cant and said that at 7 pm we meet, so i wait all day, 6:30 i text him and ask if hes coming or not, he told me ofc man ill fuck you up and all that shit, 15 min later he says i wont come at 7 wait for me till 1 am and we'll talk, i asked him ""why your mom wont let you out till she falls asleep? or your friends finish work this late"" he got triggered af started threating me that hes going to stab me and shit, so for fun i said u got a few minutes to be at the location and im already there waiting for him, he said ""he dosent work for me"" w/e that means and i wont tell him when to come( even tho he set the time xd ) i got bored of him dodging second time in a row our meeting, and i explaind to him every thing in text, and said he can go fuck himself im not waiting 6 hours for him, he was with hes friends and started saying things like, at 1 am WE will he under your apartment, we will stab you in your heart and that kind of stuff(even tho there is no way he knows where im living)

The guy I'm talking to atm wants me to send a picture of my legs. It doesn't sound like that big of a deal, and I do have pictures of my legs that I could send, but the only reason I took them was to feel better about my body, nobody else has ever seen them. I know that they're just legs, and it's not that big of a deal. But i really don't wanna send them to him.

When I told him this, he pulled the classic 'you don't trust me' card. I do trust him, I just feel like the only reason he's talking to me is for pics, since he's being so demanding. I told him 'maybe later'. I never planned on sending them to him, I just waned to stall time. I went through the day being really scared, hoping he'd forget to ask again. But he made me promise to send them, and I know he's going to pull the 'you lied' card. I really love him and I don't want to upset him.

He messaged me when I got out of the shower saying 'your promise?'. I haven't opened the message yet. I don't know what to do. It's going to be really hard to break away from him and cut things off because he's helped me a lot. I don't know what to do.

edit: I told him 'I don't know. I don't feel comfortable but I don't want to upset you'. He then told me to 'forget it', then followed that up with 'Don't worry about ittttt' when I said sorry to him. I'm getting mixed signals and I'm honestly really confused.",16May2020,2

So naturally me and her have spent a lot of time together. Except for this week, she told me she wanted to spend today (Monday) hanging out with her sister. Not a problem with me, I get it. the day got shitty when my mother called me to let me know my Grandmother was in the hospital with heart problems. So I wasn't in the best mood that day. At the end of the day she asked me, ""Why are you always getting puffy and pissed off when I try to hangout with my sister, your making me feel boxed in."" I apologized and told her I got some bad news today. We made up and everything seemed okay. Except all this week shes been really distant and avoid/ignoring me which kinda hurts. She hasn't talked to me except maybe a few words, and will find a way to get as far away from me as she can. I'm not sure if I creeped her out or what.

I’m at home with my parents and my sister and my dog though, and nobody’s happy or even trying to keep calm. 

It’s all “my wife is a bitch” “my husband is a bastard” “I’m bored” “the dog is dying” “we’re going to have to put the dog down because we can’t afford surgery” (my dog hurt his back but he’s been getting better the past couple days but nobody can shake the “let’s put him down” mood) 

I went to my aunt’s house for a four day weekend with my mother because she was mad at my father - I half expected a girl’s weekend with wine and order in food and movies. It was a four day rant about all the awful things my father had done to my mother, from my mother’s point of view. 

I came home to my injured dog and my dad saying horrible things (that I think he doesn’t know is horrible) like “we could keep the dog alive for another six years or you could finish college.” (We haven’t even taken him to the vet yet so why say these things?) 

I’m smack dab in the middle of allergy season and I can’t breathe very well, so I can’t go out to get groceries at least, I have to stay in to avoid pollen bs. I can’t leave the house. 

I’m going to lose my mind with all the complaining. And here I am trying to do all the chores in the house, cook the dinners from scratch, bake desserts, and entertain everyone. I even went to the basement to get away from people and my sister found me just to tell me that my dog is dragging his back legs and can’t walk even though I just saw him strutting around a minute ago.

For context, I've (17F) been diagnosed with depression and PTSD around 2 years ago but I had to suddenly stop my treatment after around 6/7 months due to moving to a different city to get to my dream art school.
I was so excited about getting accepted that for the first 6 months without my meds I felt fine. However, after the emotions subsided, I started feeling worse and worse. I hoped that it was just due to my stress problems and overworking but it didn't stop. 

Around the beginning of this year I finally tried reaching for help again because I just couldn't cope with myself anymore. I got my appointment set and had a brief talk with my doctor just so she knew what was my situation and we were supposed to start working on my problems and then the quarantine hit. 

Even though I have a caring boyfriend and one friend, I just feel like a burden to everyone and I feel like they would be better without me despite what they say to me. I know I'm not thinking rationally but I can't help thinking that way. I've been getting barely any sleep lately because I'm so paranoid about both the fact that I'm a burden and the fact that I may be left alone. I'm scared to be alone but I don't want them to be sad because of my mental state. My next appointment is in July but it feels like eternity.

828,"So i’m currently 15, will be 16 in a few weeks. There was a girl in my gym class last year, we got really close and i started to develop feelings. My body was still developing, so I wasn’t gonna ask her out but I did really like her. I feel like she liked me, but was waiting for me to make a move.

 Towards the end of freshman year, she ended up dating another guy. i wasn’t too bothered by it because i figured it wouldn’t last too long, we talked a lot on snapchat over the summer until suddenly in august 2019, I was blocked on her snapchat, she had blocked and unblocked me and multiple others on her instagram account, since it was private I was no longer following it. 

 I ended up not talking to her anymore but I still liked her,she eventually accepted my follow but a day later I was blocked again, I was so confused and didn’t understand what was going on.

 Fast forward to a few weeks ago, Her and her boyfriend broke up, She followed me, and accepted my follow finally. Her boyfriend had been posting some stuff on his account complaining about her in pretty much all of his captions on his posts, so I figured he might have been really controlling and made her unfollow people. She posted on her story a few times and I finally felt comfortable to responde to them with some jokes, she seemed to like them but we still don’t talk like we used to.

 Last night, She unblocked me on her spam page and followed me and accepted my follow, she only has like 20 people following it now and I was shocked she followed me as we hardly talk anymore, Im still blocked on snap but I do wanna start talking to her more, and if there is feelings I want to make a move this time.

829,"At my apartment complex we have to mail in our rent, and I usually buy a money order and mail it to where it needs to go.

Yesterday, I get a call from my landlord and she says she hasn’t received my rent for the month of May. I was confused and told her I sent a money order around the middle of last month. I brought up by bank statements and told her that I paid it on April 15th. She told me to try and find the receipt and get back to her. 

So today, I go to my car and find the money order stub. I call the customer service number for western union and they tell me my money order was purchased April 15th, then cashed in on April 20th. 

What confuses me about the whole issue is anytime a tenant is late on rent, they do not hesitate to let you know. If we’re late, they put a notice on our doors on the 2nd of the month with a $20 fee. I never received that notice on my door earlier this month. 

Also she had called me earlier in the week to clarify that I’ll be moving when my lease ends in July, and told me to make sure my letter of intent to vacate is mailed in with my June rent. During this call she never said anything about rent being late for May. There is no way they’d let my rent slide this long without it being paid, so I’m pretty sure she would have mentioned it to me way before now. 

I’m kinda confused about everything right now and am trying to collect as much proof as possible before I call her on Monday so I can see where this check is. For it to be cashed that means they probably have it, and I don’t leave anything blank on a check or money order to avoid fraud activity.

834,"I originally went into college as a jazz studies major not having any particular career path in mind besides maybe as a professor. I soon realized I don't really want to be a music professor, nor do I want to try to live off of performing music, as I don't believe I have the social abilities/motivation required to network enough (social anxiety/aspie here). I'm still keeping music in my life no matter what, though, so I'm keeping the major even if I don't finish/graduate with it.

I've been trying dual majors now as a result. This past semester I tried computer science, and while coding itself was fun, I REALLY disliked how soul-sucking the math/science requirements were, so I decided to drop that major and do a coding bootcamp if I want to become a software guy. Next semester I'm going to be trying some journalism classes since the careers, while not as lucrative, do sound a bit more fun, as do the classes themselves to finish the degree.

My problem is that since I have no particular career goals in mind which correlate with a specific major, I'm wondering if I'm even ready to finish college now. I know it's not supposed to be a means to an end, but I'm sure this will be the only chance I get to have further education that's partially funded by my parents. I want to be able to take full advantage of the internships, major-specific societies/clubs and all that stuff which could help build a network and a decent resume for a recent graduate, but that seems pretty difficult when I don't actually know what I want to do!",16May2020,1

My partner helped her to move her BBQ into the unused parking area). the landords are very hands-off, so it's not possible for us to appeal to a higher authority.

837,"I’ve lived with my best friend for about 9 months. It was really cool the first 6 months, but ever since he started seeing this girl, it’s all gone downhill. 
For awhile, he helped with the chores, paid the utilities in his name on time, respected what we agreed on and did everything he was supposed to. It was really fun. Unfortunately, he met this girl 3-4 months ago, and she’s been a horrible influence on him. For lack of a better term, she’s a compete slob in every way. She leaves garbage all over the place (I.e half drank Starbucks, chip bags, half eaten things of soup), rarely showers or practices hygiene, and is all around just kind of gross. Her nasty lifestyle has rubbed off on him really badly, and now he helps with literally nothing around the house. They have pretty much comandeered the living room as their own personal pig sty, and it gets disgusting with garbage everywhere. The only cleaning they do is when the living room gets so bad, I get fed up and pretty much order them to clean it. Even then, she makes him do it, and he does a half ass job and goes right back to doing nothing. He’s gotten incredibly lazy and irresponsible since he met her. They both just smoke weed and watch cartoons all day long. He’s forgotten to pay the utility in his name two months a row now, and gotten it shut off twice. They also just have a total lack of respect for me. They smoke weed inside all the time, even though we agreed upon moving in he would do that outside. They blast music at 2am. And most annoyingly, she spends way too much time at my house. The problem is, I’ve talked to him about all this shit, and he always says sorry, but then comes up with some idiotic excuse and barely changes his behavior. 
With the weed, he was really good about going outside until he met her, then they started smoking inside exclusively. It makes the whole place REEK and dirty. I mopped the floors one day after they had the house to themselves, and the swiffer pad was jet black and reeked of weed resin they smoked so much inside. So I politely reminded him of our agreement, and he said he would now go back outside. I was happy to have an understanding, but not much changed. He goes outside to smoke maybe only like 1 out of every 6 times now, and ALWAYS had an excuse. The other day he claimed the “weather was too bad.” Well it was overcast and 61 degrees. Sure, maybe not paradise, but to act like it was too bad to go outside is just asinine. 
With her being over all the damn time, it’s the same problem. She spent the night like 15 consecutive days at one point, so I talked to him about it. I explained how that’s excessive, and we agreed to only have guests over 4-5 days a week. Well from there she stayed over 3 more days, so I asked him what the hell was going on and he said “She doesn’t want to be around her parents in case they get coronavirus, so she’s going to quarantine here until it’s over.” I immediately told him that wasn’t going to fly. This was an incredibly stupid excuse considering the same amount of people live at our house as hers, and he and her go out into public to buy food and/or weed 2-3 times every single day, so they’re not exactly sheltering in place. I told him no more, remained him of the agreement, and he was good about it for 2-3 weeks, but now she’s back to coming over 7-8 days at a time, spends maybe one night back at her place, and then back over again for 7-8 days.  And even then, she spends the entire day at our house, drives home at like 1am, and comes right back over the next day. They think they’re slick and have found a “loophole” to our agreement, but any normal person would consider this as the same shit as being over all time. Lastly, she’s also incredibly rude and unfriendly. You say hi to her and she just looks at you and walk away. Whenever guests come over, rather than be polite and introduce herself, as they introduce themselves, she doesn’t say anything back, walks away, and hides in his room until they’re gone like a 10 year old. She also has dipped into my food several times. I talked to him about her shitty attidue, and again like always, all I got was a ton of excuses. First it was “oh well she has anxiety.” One of my friends has crippling anxiety that she receives treatment for, and she’s not rude like that, so I don’t really buy that excuse. There’s a difference between being shy, and being rude. Hell im pretty shy and struggle with anxiety myself, but I’m not flat out rude to people like she is. And for the food, it’s the same thing. Always some dumb excuse or lie that only an imbecile would find acceptable or believe. 
My issue is, I’ve tried to be nice, I’ve tried to be stern. Being nice does nothing. Being stern gets *some* results but the change in his behavior is marginal at best, and she doesn’t change at all. Thing is, they are in violation of our lease. It clearly outlines in the lease that guests may not stay more than 7 consecutive days, and no more than 15 days in a calendar month. It also says that no smoking is allowed inside. I’ve reminded him of this when I’ve talked to him, and he totally agrees we should not violate the lease and vows to change, yet he continues to not really change shit. I don’t know what to do at this point. I don’t want to get our landlord involved or threaten to do that, but I feel like he’s starting to leave me no option. I’ve tried to be nice and talk to him about it 3-4 times and a couple times I’ve been no bullshit and stern with him, but either way he really doesn’t seem to give a shit.",16May2020,2

To get into it, I've battled with severe depression since I was a child. I left high school early because I couldn't cope. Over the years since then I have landed jobs in labor fields such as steel racking, tire shops, pallet truck operator, etc. Basic stuff due to lack of a diploma or direction in life. Without fail I have burnt out, and walked off these jobs without proper communication and slumped into unemployment for months or even years at a time. During these times I have contemplated taking my own life and had to go on welfare or stay with a family member. I have ZERO work contacts and dozens of unexplainable employment gaps at almost 30 years of age because of this.

Over the last year and a half or so, I have done a lot of healing and self growth. I want to move forward and get an education under my belt and actually do something with my life. However, from an employer or school's point of view, I look like a gigantic red flag. I'm not sure how to move past this point and explain to any future prospects why I dont have any solid work history or contacts. I have zero ways to prove, on paper, that I can be at all reliable as a student or employee.

Any help or even just a story of going through something similar would mean a lot to me. Thank you for reading.

tl;dr: I have no work contacts and and dozens of unexplainable employment gaps due to battling depression. How do I apply for work with a resume like this?",16May2020,3

841,"I'll keep it as brief as possible.
First some background, we've been dating for almost a year, we always hang out at his place because I still live with my parents, I'm in college and used to have a part time job (unemployed now because of pandemic), he still has a job and works with my best friend so I know for a fact that he makes good money.

At the beginning it wasn't an issue visiting him because it was very casual, every other weekend so I didn't mind paying an Uber (he lives somewhat far so taking the bus at night is dangerous and takes me around 1½ hours to get there because I'd have to take 2), I'd also help with the beers and food sometimes. 

Months go by and he obviously wants to see me more often and I ended up going 2 times a week, so I was spending like $60 every week just for my rides but then I started buying us food and beers as well because he never had food at home, the times we cooked I brought the stuff as well.

He lives right in the middle of the city so I know rent isn't cheap but I know he can pay it so I don't know where all his money goes because he always tells me that he's broke.
Also, we never go out, we've gone to the movies like 5 times in a year and just twice to a restaurant.

I've been looking for a job because I ""need"" money but I realized I only need it to visit him once pandemic is over because thankfully my parents have no problem with me not having a job and are paying for the things I used to pay around the house as well (phone bill, Netflix, water bill, etc)

He is a really good person and I love him but at this point I don't know what to do because it's been a year and half of my salary has gone there when I know I could've bought other stuff or simply put it in a savings account, I'm not sure how to discuss this with him because he can do whatever he wants with his money but it would be nice if he could visit me sometime (never have because no privacy at my parents house) or even pay food once in a while, he says it's temporary and that he'll take care of me in the future but I don't know.

Feel free to ask questions, any advice is well received!",16May2020,1

843,"Hello! Basically I (19F) have a crush (18F) on someone from school. Yes she is gay and to my knowledge, single. Anyway, I met her because we are in the same club. We are both really involved so we would see each other at every meeting/socials; it would amount to about 3 times a week. However, we've never really talked just us. I think I had a sustained conversation with just her once; she's closer with other people in the club. Soon enough I realized I maybe have a crush on her. It's not crazy; I just want to get to know her better. However, I have been thinking about her a lot lately. It would be a lot easier and smoother to talk to her if we were still at school, but now in quarantine I'm struggling. 

We are working on a project together with another person for the club, so that is a reason for us to talk at least, but I don't know how to steer the conversation away from just logistical things. I think the way we talk is comfortable and friendly without being overly polite, so we are out of that phase, but now I just need to change the subject matter. I sent her a meme yesterday (the ""oh yeah, it's all coming together"" one) when we were talking about the project lol (bc that is the universal love language) as an attempt to open things up a little. She just said something like ""hahahahaha love it."" So I guess she is not really interested in talking about other things? Or I didn't give her enough to work with? It's so hard; when we text about the project she is super nice and as personable as you can be when talking about a project, but I'm nervous she wouldn't want to talk about other things. We've never texted before this. I suppose I either have to go for it full send or just let it go. I just am having trouble finding a segue.

845,"So I'm writing this maybe half an hour after this happened. Me and my sister were carrying the groceries from the car to the house and there was a bag of chocolates that we fought over (childish i know). It ended up with the bad splitting open and all the contents inside scattering everywhere. My dad was BEYOND furious. He came running at me and I was scared. 

Now my dad had always been very violent, especially towards me as the eldest sibling of four, so in the back of my mind I could tell this wasn't going to end well. His history of violence has caused multiple CPS visits to our house after calls by my teachers had been made after I had gone through panic attacks at school. However, they never found any reason to think he was abusive as me and my sisters always undermined what he did. However, live in constant fear of my dad getting mad at me. But today it escalated past just slapping and kicking. He also has the tendency to hold grudges, which he does every time he gets mad. You do some minor thing wrong, he gets incredibly mad, yells, hits, takes your phone away (he really likes this punishment and usually doesn't give it back for weeks on end), and won't speak a word to you unless absolutely necessary for days, if not weeks. I find it ridiculously childish, as he does it so many times to the point where maybe a quarter of every year is spent in this silent treatment.

He pushed me upstairs into his room and began to yell. I, being quite used to this, automatically went into emotional dissociation. But then out of nowhere, he grabbed me by the throat and pushed me into the nearby bathroom and against the wall, where he continued to yell at me while he choked me. I was beyond terrified, as I was literally unable to breathe. I literally thought he was going to kill me. Once he let me go, he told me to go to my room and get changed for a workout (one of his less severe forms of punishment). Once I got to my room, I had a panic attack. He came in, took my phone, and left.

This has never happened before. He has never gone to this extent. I've come to notice a really scary trend in his behaviour though; as the years go by, his anger management gets worse, and his reactions become worse along with them. Each year he lashes out worse then the year before. Where it started out as an occasional slap, became kicking, which became using a belt, and on and on. Now today, it's become choking. What makes it worse is that my mom knows what happened and is acting like nothing happened. She came to me crying downstairs in literal shock and just told me ""stop crying"" as ""it was over now so there's nothing wrong"". I told her that I was in fear for my life, and she brushed it off and told me to come upstairs so that she ""could give me chocolate to feel better"". I couldn't believe it. The moment I threatened to call CPS, she freaked out, and told me that if I did that, it would get my dad arrested and ruin both their and my siblings lives.

I'm very tempted to call CPS but I'm terrified that it would ruin everything. Even if I did want to call CPS however, it would be impossible as I my dad took away my phone and all I have is a laptop. Any advice as to what should I do?",16May2020,5

I really want to but I don't know how to tell her i know about it and I'm afraid to open up old wounds because i know she is doing slightly better than she was when she told me.

848,"So I've basically been an anxious mess for the past two days about this but here goes:

When I was 16 ( I am currently 21) me and this girl who was 15 at the time began to essentially text each other pretty sexually charged messages after basically confessing feelings for each other. I know it was weird to just jump into that but I dont know why we were doing that. We agreed to meet up and like go for a walk around a park or whatever. On this date we pass by some wooded areas and agreed this would be a great place to stick around and kiss. So we begin kissing with both of us clearly into it and me being the hormonal idiot I was decided to try to escalate and grabbed her boob under her shirt. She clearly did not enjoy that, things became kinda awkward and we decided to cut the date short. I have to emphasize I stopped very quickly when I realized what had happened and did not try to force her or anything though it was still wrong for me to do that. So afterwards I apologize for what happened, she says it's fine and we continue to stay friends and still talked fairly often until college. However even in college we were always friendly we helped each other with classes here and there and she had even brought up what happened in a joking manner to which I would again apologize profusely.However, fast forward to now and the other day two of our mutual friends confront me telling me she told them that I sexually assaulted her and that they wanted my side of the story. I explain to them what happened and apparently she is telling people that I denied anything bad ever happened and that I did not apologize ever. Now my issue is I don't know how to deal with the fact that I caused her this pain, she has clearly been affected by it and I just feel like an awful human being. The past two days I have thought about ending my life more often and more thoroughly than ever before. I don't know what to do.",16May2020,1

853,"About a month ago, I was reading a random book on Wattpad and I commented something funny.
Soon after, the writer replied to my comment and we basically had a conversation in the comment section about various stuff. 

Two hours later the author (who I'll call Taylor) private messaged me. We talked a bit and we told each other our names. Not our real names. We agreed to use fake names for safety reasons. I know Taylor lives on a farm in the US (I know her state, but I won't say it for privacy reasons) and all she knows is that I live in a village in Germany. 

I've been worrying about what my parents would think about Taylor. They're very opposed to talking to strangers online.

Well, today I asked Taylor whether her parents knew about our friendship.
Here's our conversation:

Snail (me): Hey, Taylor. Can I ask you a question?

Taylor: Yeah?

Snail: Have you told your parents about our friendship?

Taylor: No..........Why?

Snail: I was just wondering. I haven't either and honestly, I'm scared because my mum would probably take away my social media and I love sharing my work online.

Taylor: Yeah....my mom has been scammed a lot and doesn't want me talking to anyone I don't know irl.

Snail: I'm also not sure how I'd ask persuade them to trust you.

Taylor: Same here. I don't think it would be as big of an issue if we'd been talking for years, but it's barely been a month....I think we should keep it a secret until we work out a solution.

Snail: yeah.....let's find a way to prove we're both really [our age]-year-old girls....

854,"I have just made a series of harsh decisions that are in my best interest (in every single way). I quit my job and terminated my tenancy contract and am getting ready to move home to pursue my true passion. I can’t help but feel extreme guilt over leaving the company, even for terminating my tenancy! But fact is this decision is good for me in literally every single way.

855,"What I mean by restarting is by deleting all my social media accounts and making new ones that don't have any link to the old ones, or blocking everyone on an app like Steam and changing my profile entirely so I can keep my games to avoid having to re-purchase all of them while also erasing my social presence.   


This is all because I believe that all my friends are just friends with me out of pity, and that they really just find me annoying. Also, I'm a furry and when people inevitably find out through other friends of mine who already know, that kind of turns them away automatically. However, by ""resetting"" everything online, and having no friends online anymore, I can start from scratch so I can hide my embarrassing interests from everyone I meet as well as ditching the current friends that I have doubts about and forming my personality into something more tolerable. Since I stream on Twitch as well, it'll give me a new complete starting point to re-brand, and stream something more specific instead of streaming variety, because streaming one thing and one thing only is how you gain an audience in the early stages, while variety is what you do later to expand even further.

856,"I have been making fairly decent progression through my current job; getting more responsibilities, better positions, raises, etc. I just have a lingering suspicion that I’m being too cutthroat about it.

I haven’t been stepping on heads, per se. But I have made a few of my own stepping stones of others who have been in a position I wanted, but that have also been on thin ice with management.

For example, one person who called out often and smelled of cigarettes and ammonia was in a position better than mine. I was speaking with a few of her coworkers that were complaining and instigated them to be more bothered by it. I mentioned to our immediate manager that I’d be interested in that position if they had any need for another to fill the schedule. 3 weeks later, I was in and she was gone.

My first position here was one in which I was able to socialize with and assist basically everyone at the company, so I’ve ingratiated myself to most of the staff here, including management.

My accomplishments and attendance speak for themselves, so I have that going for me. I just don’t want to back myself into a corner where people think I’m just a backstabbing opportunist. I’m contradicting myself because I know that I won’t let anything (or anyone) stand between myself and my career goals.

857,"I (22f) met this friend (22f) when I first went to college almost 4 years ago. We are part of a close friend group and share a lot of the same values, though I am an introvert while she likes to party and drink (not excessively) We’re good friends when we do things like shopping or brunch, she makes an effort for my birthday and I value her opinion.
We moved in together two years ago but it’s been going downhill from there. I don’t feel comfortable in the apartment anymore, because she does not clean or tidy up anything ever. I am not a super tidy person by any means, but every time I want to cook and eat I first have to hunt down tableware, pots and pants, etc. and clean them. The fridge contains her moldy leftovers from weeks ago and shared rooms have dirty laundry and other things piled up almost waist high. I have asked her to clean those things before but she always starts insulting me.

My stuff goes missing but she tells me it wasn’t her and starts to insult me or acts like I’m unfairly accusing her even when I find them in the trash and definitely haven’t thrown them away myself. (My family heirlooms, cutlery and other shared items I bought, my calculator, etc.)

When she drinks and our friends are there she starts making fun of my opinions and other things I say, basically tells my I’m ugly and talks about me as soon as I leave the room. 
She also sat me down a few weeks ago and basically told me that no one liked me and I should be glad she put up with me. She also told me I behaved like I was autistic (which is not shameful at all and the fact alone that she used that argument trying to tell me I needed to behave differently makes me so mad). My whole life I have always been good at communicating with people and was completely fine in social situations but now it has given me tremendous anxiety when interacting with others.

I can’t talk to her because she’ll deny everything and turn it around so I’m the bad guy. She’s always right. I’m also afraid to say anything to our friends because I’m sure she’ll turn them against me (what if they really don’t like me that much and she was the only brave one to tell me.)

862,"Let me start by saying I don’t want to sound ungrateful because I know a lot of people are struggling right now. 

TL;DR: I work managing the social media for 2 companies currently. I accepted a second position as an office admin 2 months ago from one of them that has nothing to do with my degree based on the assumption that it would pay more money/have additional benefits but this isn’t the case. They want me to do both jobs now for the same money, no benefits, and within the same hours aside from 2 more a day (essentially double the work in the same time frame). I haven’t started it yet because of COVID but once we’re able to return in the next few weeks I will be. The closer it gets the more I want to turn and run in the other direction. Last week I was offered a better position that makes more sense for my career choice and decided to possibly start my own business which could potentially mean a lot more money (and happiness and time to travel) but I won’t have time if I keep the one I don’t want out of obligation. What should I do? Is it possible to resend my acceptance of the second position and still keep them as a client (ie; not lose my current job with them)?

I manage the social media accounts for a successful real estate company in my area. I’ve been doing this for about 4 months now and since then I’ve taken on another client (local photographer) and manage his as well! I really love what I’m doing so far and think it’s really cool! I’m a marketing major in school with a concentration in social media marketing so it’s exactly the type of jobs I’ve been looking for. Both of those are part time and together average to about 20 hours. I wait tables on the side for the other 20 hours to supplement my income and make myself “full-time”. 

When COVID started I was really nervous. I had just started at the real estate place and was worried that I was going to be let go and labeled “non-essential” to their business. To my surprise, they had been looking for an Office Admin for one of their locations for a couple months and offered it to me over email. This was about a week after the stay at home order was declared where I live (around 2 months ago). My boss said in the Email that per my acceptance, we would “talk details” in a phone call on a separate occasion which I had assumed meant some kind of pay raise or added benefits, this call never happened. I accepted and the call was never made and now I’m thinking I assumed wrong and got myself into a sticky situation. The only pro about accepting this offer is that it is it’s 10 more hours a week so in theory it is more money, but not really because I would have made a lot more in those 10 hours waiting tables or with other clients. They also are not having me do all of the extra work at a separate time than what I’m doing now, but in addition during the same hours. If that sentence was confusing basically I mean they want me to do everything I do now PLUS everything this new position requires within the same hours, (current hours are 9-1, new ones are 9-3, 2 more hrs added a day but not much more), which means double the work for the same pay and no benefits. I haven’t started the position yet but they’re now expecting me to once we’re able to return to the office. Since I’m not getting a raise or any additional benefits (I have none, just making an hourly wage), I’m actually going to be losing money in the long run. 

Fast forward to this week, a contact of mine that owns her own dance studio is looking for a social media manager (*enter, me*) so I got in touch with her and am supposed to have a meeting to talk about the logistics of our professional relationship. It’s looking like she’s going to hire me. 

Now that I’ve been able to build up a bit of a client base I was thinking about renegotiating my position with the real estate company from an hourly wage to a package plan, creating a business and financial model, ordering some business merch (business cards, flyers, etc), and possibly starting my own little social media business. I want to take the leap, find some more clients, and possibly make this into a work from home situation full-time so I can also travel (my other passion+dream). I know it sounds crazy but it feels right and exciting and I’m learning so much. I’m stoked and all but I don’t know how I’m going to be able to swing everything. 

I don’t want this office admin job anymore and kind of feel like they’re talking advantage of my young age and exploiting me to save money. I feel a little “tricked” although Im fairly sure that wasn’t their intention, and in all just feel I accepted too quickly without thinking. I’m also nervous about taking this job because I’ve learned since accepting that the position never stays filled for longer than a few months and then people always quit. In my experience that’s a sign of less than desirable conditions and a flaw in the position. 

At this point I’m not sure what to do. Is there any way I can get out of this and resend my acceptance since I haven’t started yet while still keeping my social media job with them? I just think it’s smarter and makes more sense for me to continue with the path I’ve been on because it’s actually within my major than to take this position out of obligation, waste time, and potentially become resentful of my bosses due to this situation. I don’t want to waste 30 hours a week on this one company but still want to keep them as a client, what can I do?",16May2020,1

872,"So first post on this sub, on mobile so apologises for formatting

Anyway I’ve lived in an apartment complex for just over 4 months and all was going fine up until the lockdown now I’m stuck at home 24/7 as I’m having to WFH. Well my neighbours have become an absolute nightmare 2 in particular. The neighbours below me seem to be getting drunk most days this then causes fights which can get very loud as well as some smashing and banging this goes on until the early hours of the morning near every night, the fights eventually end and then I have the embarrassment of hearing their very loud making up!!!! And I mean LOUD!!!! Like these 2 are constantly at it and it’s like they are making the noise just to be heard by everyone and this isn’t just at night time this can be several times a day everyday and night. The other neighbours play heavy techno music all day long everyday again till the early hours. I’m at my wits end I haven’t slept properly in weeks and unlike me these people don’t have jobs to wake up early for because well lockdown!! So I want advice on how best to approach this subject with the neighbours about it and try to explain I need them to be more considerate. I’m just exhausted and my mental health is being affected by the lack of sleep and the sheer stress of having to put up with this day in day out and no way to get away from it!! Please reddit help me find my sanity again before I consider moving out and paying 2 rents as I’m still stuck in a lease for another 8 months

873,My friend which I'm going to keep anonymous has been being abused by her parents. Shes from Iraq and moved to America around 6 years ago with her family(with 2 younger brothers). Her parents constantly call her a failure to her face. She grows up In a Muslim house hold with super religious parents. Shes scared to do anything involving the police because her parents haven't gotten thier green card yet. So shes scared she might get them deported back to Iraq. She's shown me pictures of the bruises she gotten from being beaten and I dont know what to do. I hope i can get advice for this fucked up situation.,16May2020,1

If I could snap my fingers and have another child I would, but for both selfish and financial reasons it just doesn’t feel right. 

My brothers were both 9+ years older than me and they both moved out at 18 so I feel like I grew up semi-isolated and it did get lonely and I think I was a weird kid lol I didn’t really socialise well especially in big groups and big family gatherings still make me uncomfortable, I don’t want my daughter to experience this but I have other friends (who all have close siblings) telling me it’s fine

878,"Hey, I'm going to try and sum this up the best I can without getting into my feelings or anything. I don't want to sound biased. 

The relationship I'm in now was the best I had ever been in. Before this I had been with some really bad people, and went through some stuff I don't really like to talk about. This kind of makes me feel like my nervousness could be misguiding me. 

As I said, it was the best I had ever been in, up until March. Covid-19 came to my state, and it was his idea to not quarantine in the same house, as I work in a nursing home and he works with the public. I agreed, it's understandable and makes sense, BUT, I didn't realize that communication would stop almost completely. We've gotten into a lot of arguments about this since March. It really hurts my feelings that he seems to not care too much whether he even speaks to me or not now that we aren't physically together as much. 

I finally tried to explain to him that a bad ex used to hold communication above my head. He'd use lack of as a way to punish me when he didn't like something I said or did, really tiny things most people wouldn't bat an eye over. There's been a lack of communication between us for so long that I've gotten very stressed, and have started to be scared that he's doing the same thing, although I have no idea what I could've done. He said he felt bad, didn't mean to get me worked up like this, and is sorry. And sometimes now communication is better, but other times it's still the exact same. 

Should I just tough it out and hope things can get better again after covid-19 is all over, or should I maybe consider asking to take a break to help ease my stress until then? Like I said, communication has slightly improved, it's a big step from March and April's amount of communication. But I've just felt anxious, and am not sure what decision is the right one.

879,"I've always been a cynical person but it has always been more humor driven and when I'm just blowing off steam. I wouldn't say it was a prominent personality trait. I work in healthcare, it was never something I necessarily wanted to do but in my area that's really the only place with decent paying jobs. My plan was to do it until I was stable and go back to school. Well of course life happens, school got pushed off and I got stuck there. 

I finally got to a place where going back was an option. Then COVID happened, my SO lost their job and I'm the steady income. I still have the money in savings to start but obviously doing that right now isn't responsible. Everything is just crashing on me and making me so bitter and miserable. I tell myself ""at least you have a job"" or ""at least you aren't sick"" but it doesn't help. I've tried every healthy coping mechanism I can think of but nothing works.

The practice I work in is so incompetent it's borderline negligent. I never had an issue getting employment before I started there but apparently their reputation precedes me now. Everyone else I work with is stuck there too because of it, which of course makes it an insanely toxic environment. So I'm stuck, at least until I go back to school. 

I know this isn't unique to me. I know a lot of people feel this way and are able to push through it. I'm trying so hard but it just keeps getting harder everyday. I'm worried I may get fired if I don't get myself together. So, can anyone give me some advice on how to get through this?",16May2020,3
880,So I (14 yr female) have been spending a lot of time alone lately I don’t why because I’m usually an extrovert. I’ve been enjoying having my time alone because currently my nephews are staying at my house. I’m a very creative person I love to write and enjoy music and making edits of my OC. My mom says if I keep this up I’m going to become depressed.(I’m also a web and get absorbed in my shows I watch) I don’t know if I am spending too much time alone because I’m usually like this I have no idea why my mother has started having a problem with it. Both my mom and dad are working all the time (my mom works from home). My dad works himself to hard. When me and my brother want to have a family game night or something they say “no we are we relaxing”. I just want to know if I am spending to much time alone. So am I?,16May2020,4
882,So I recently stopped talking with a friend of mine. At first I planned to Only take a break and reevaluate things mainly my relationships with friends and family. After I told him that I won't talk to him for a while he made the biggest dick move IMO. He held some secrets I told him about against me and told me that other friends are talking behind my back which wasn't really a surprise since I was 90% sure they were doing that anyway. But the fact that he exposed them when they were also his friends just made me so disgusted that I decided to just stop talking to him. It's been two weeks now and none of them have talked to me. Those  five people were my friends for the better part of 10 years and in recent years I became so reclusive and socially awkward that I don't think making new friends is gonna be that easy for me. The only person i talk to is a friend who I'm only on friendly terms with. I'm not outgoing and I like having only 3 - 5 friends but having no one to talk to is stressing me out. Idk if it's important but I'm 22 M.,16May2020,2

887,"I have been lonely and neglected my entire life and If I ever received anything from my family then it would immediately be followed with shaming and Ultimatums. My family fell apart about 7 years ago and now my parents completely forgot that they had a child and that they are parents of that child. They now both live their lifes as teenagers and have zero intentions to fix the mess that they made and that mess is me.

If it were just one problem to fix then I would've helped myself a long time ago, but the reality is that there are a dozen problems.

I suffer from an Underactive thyroid, depression, psychological stress, Insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep deprivation, hallucinations and I have really bad habits of not brushing my teeth, not eating healthy, not exercising at all, and I would shower about once a week or two until I begin to smell like a wild animal. 

I have been suicidal for a long time and I have harmed myself a lot of times. I question my existence as the existential crisis engulfs me every time I wake up. I am filled with hatred and intense anger that gives me headaches as I daydream of how I kill my parents and then kill myself in public so that people can see the pain in my life.

I have zero friends and nobody I could talk to, as even my own mother prefers to be on Facebook than to talk to me for at least 5 minutes. She always ends up making herself the victim and starts to talk AT me , whenever we engage in communication even though that is very rare that we talk to one another. However when we are not talking she will always say in general to others as to how she does not victimize herself and how everything she has done has been right.

I currently have an uncomfortable pain in my jaw that makes me think that I have an infection as my left lower gums are red and not the same as the rest. I don't think that there is any point in checking it out as I just want to kill myself and on top of that I don't have any money.

I can't afford anything as I have never worked in my life and I don't have the basic merit for a basic job.

I also was withdrawn from college and ended up with a shameful Level 2 Business with grade pass.

I can't communicate with girls as I have never had a conversation with a girl for almost 12 years and now I just mumble under my nose as I have nothing to say or impress any girl with anything. The only thing that I have on my mind when seeing a girl or a cute boy is how I can fuck them until my dick falls off and then how I can kill them in variable ways.

I have no talents, interests, qualities or skills to contribute to society.

I hate and absolutely resent my shit ethnicity and the  nation that I come from as it is filled with extremely ignorant, double standard, hypocritical, narcissistic, people that are Full of shit and piss. That ends up making, hating myself and my own body.

I now absolutely hate humans and wish that they all died.

The only thing I ever liked is Japan and anime, but recently I don't think that I like even that as Japan is filled with quite a lot of darkness behind all of the positive and attractive things.

I am simply an emotionally damaged person who gets furious on the inside whenever I see injustice for people that deserve love and support. It does not matter who the victim is.. as I will always wish to be a person with incredible superpowers that can punish and kill the bad guys.. even if that makes me a bad guy.
If it were to me I wish to gain incredible powers beyond human comprehension so that I can kill every single leader, politician, billionaire, dictator, communist, mafia member, soldier, terrorist, drug dealer, paedophile, serial killer, bad parent, and shit people in general. I would give my entire life and soul if God ever gave me such powers and I don't care if that makes me the biggest villain and hated person in human history. As long as those bad people die then I would feel fulfilled, but that is quite flawed as there would be no one to take their place and do the right good things for the people. Thus all that there is left is just completely wipe out every single human or just erase myself from existence and never be reborn again.

I am simply way too fucking tired of human's bullshit",16May2020,1

Anyways I need advice on what to do so my mother didn’t finish a school cause she had my sis at a young age which obviously affected her regular life. Then there’s my dad who’s not in the picture so obviously it’s even harder for us to live. Anyways today my mom was watching a show and she saw how good the family was meaning living a good life with their dad siblings getting along and just the good stuff like that, and when I saw a tear fell from my mom eye that broke me tbh she was like “ I wish we had a house” and that even hurt me more...we do got a roof over our head and we live in nyc so it’s quite expensive here...anyways I can’t even help out cause I dropped out of school my sis got a job but that’s not enough and my two younger siblings obviously can’t work... so this is why I put the title as in -is this a good idea- so basically I want to pursue a career on acting I feel like I’ll be good at it and since I live in nyc there’s a lotttttt of opportunities here...I feel like if I do be successful at that then maybe just maybe I can’t turn our life around and make it better...obviously I doubt I’ll be noticed on a big screen but gotta start off slow like background characters and extras ... that’s a start so after this virus is over I’m going to try my best to get into acting Ik it’ll be hard but I do like challenges... so like I said is this a good idea?",16May2020,2
892,"Yes i know I'm an asshole and i don't deserve my sister. She's a sweetheart please don't think she's some kind of monster. 

My(19F) sister(12F) talks. A lot. I'm an introvert. I enjoy silence and being alone. We're the opposite. But at the same time we have a lot of things in common (we like the same games, youtubers, music, etc.).
She talks to me about roblox everyday. I don't know what this game is nor i care. But i know she loves it so i pretend i listen to her when I'm actually not. I tried telling her that im not interested so if she could please stop telling me about it. She seemed sad so i apologized. She said she's the only one she can talk to about this stuff. I told her that's not true, she can talk with our parents, her friends, our sister. But she just ignored me.
We share rooms so we basically are together 24/7. I don't have any ""alone"" time. 
Everytime she asks to play something with me, i say no because i find it a) boring or b) she asks in the worst time possible. I always feel horrible to say no to her.
Everytime she talks to me, i get irritated and just wish for her to finish fast. I don't know how to stop this feeling. I hate it. She hasn't done anything bad to me, she doesn't deserves a bad sister like me.
Also, this feeling only happens with her. It doesn't happens with my older sister

893,"Hiya. So I'm a fairly young guy (mid-teens, I don't wanna give out my age), and there's a girl whom I'm talking with a lot. I don't want to say her name, so I'll call her 'O'. We've been really good friends since before quarantine, but we've gotten a lot closer during the lockdown. We mainly talk over text, and occasionally call each other should our schedules allow it. Now, obviously, I have a huge thing for her, but (as every other guy with a crush) I don't know if she likes me back. We talk every single day for hours, and we talk about things that I would never even dream of sharing with anyone else: she knows me better than anyone else. We talk a lot about doing things like road trips across the country together or going for dinner together or watching a movie together or going to pace (mainly me though, it's my dream to become an astronaut), and we really get into it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have really low self-esteem and a diagnosis of major depression, so I couldn't ever imagine anyone even remotely liking me, let alone get in a relationship with me. 

So why am I writing here? Just to get a little bit of a push, I guess, From all y'all who have experience with this sorta thing, a little advice would do wonders. Given, of course, that this doesn't get buried under the bajillions of other posts. If someone's made it this far, hi!",16May2020,1
894,"Hi everyone, this is a long post and I'll try to include all the details without being too wordy. I did post this in relationship_advice, but i figured the more advice i could get, the better.I'm going to change names for some privacy. I may have left out some details. I'm feeling very overwhelmed right now and my mind is running a million miles a minute. 

I guess this all starts when I was around 9 years old, for some reason my mom thought it was appropriate to tell me that the man who I had been told was my father, was not in fact my actual father. He was however my two younger sisters' father. I had already had my suspicions-I don't really look much like my mother and I definitely don't look like my sisters or their father. She tells me that she met him(my father) at a bar with her friend and she didn't see him after that night. She also tells me that from what she can remember my dad told her that he was adopted, he worked for a beer company as a delivery driver, he had a young child, that he was going to school to be a lawyer, and where he attended high school. She could not remember his last name, but she remembered that his first name was Jeff.

Fast forward several years later-my mom is going to therapy for some memory issues she has and she tells her therapist about her situation with not remembering my dad's last name. He felt bad I guess and told her that his boss was capable of hypnotherapy and offered his services to my mother. She agreed and remembered my dad's last name. Huge breakthrough, right? I am 16 at the time and interested in finding my dad and sister. I started to look him up everywhere, I'm trying to go through old yearbooks of where he attended highschool and I just can't find him. I give up and years pass. Finding my dad is no longer all that important to me. I just want to know what I am, race wise and if I have any predisposition to any health issues.

SO, in March of this year my mom is on a dating app. She's lonely, I get it. She comes across a man's profile and his name is Jeff. They get to talking and the more my mom talks to him-she's convinced she's found my father. She tells me this after maybe a day of talking to him. She says all of the details line up, although some of the things are mixed up. He says he was adopted, he did work for the beer company, he did have a daughter. The only detail that's off is that he was going to school to be a law enforcement officer and now a lawyer. I tell her okay, that's cool but we don't know if this is the right guy and I don't really have a desire to get to know him if he is my father. I'm 24 now, I have a degree and a great job and I just bought a house recently with my boyfriend. I did all of this without a father and I don't see the need for one basically. She texts my boyfriend about the situation and tells him she would love for me to have a father in my life since I never had one. He tells her the same thing I did. She decided on her own to tell Jeff that she thinks he is my father.  He agrees to take a paternity test and sends my mom a bunch of photos of him, his daughter and his granddaughter. One of the photos had his last name in it-not the last name my mom told me. She eventually tells me the day she went under hypnosis she didn't actually remember anything but didn't want to come home empty handed. She said she felt a lot of guilt about me not knowing my father, since all of my other siblings know theirs.

Anyway, I look the guy up on Facebook and I am super disappointed in the type of person he is. He shares very sexual posts, things about drinking and smoking weed. It seems like he never grew past a 21 year old. He also overshares things. I found a huge post from the day my mom told him that she thought he was my father and he shared it on Facebook. He says that me and my mother have been looking for him for years-not true. It seems that my mom was being a little dramatic when she was talking to him. He keeps trying to reach out to me, to get to know me, but I make it clear I do not want to talk to him until the DNA test comes back.

This brings us to today-the results are back and there is a greater than a 99.9999% match. He's my biological father. I don't know what to do. He wants to have a relationship with me. He says had he known about me he would've been there. But, that's easy to say. I only blame him for being irresponsible. I blame my mom for not looking for him in the first place and lying to me about the last name. My mom wants to me to have a relationship with him, but says it's ultimately up to me. I don't believe that. She's lied about so much and now this man thinks I want him in my life and I just do not know what I want. I guess I'm just wondering what I should do from here? I'm a people pleaser by nature and part of me thinks I should just meet him and get it over with. But, I have so many other feelings and I'm very overwhelmed and angry. Any advice is appreciated.

900,"Hey guys,

My boyfriend does security and will soon be in security forces in the air force. Lately, he’s been working the overnight shift and therefore is sleeping during the day. When I’m not working I’ll stay in bed with him while he sleeps, and lately he has been waking up in full-on, high alert, almost panic mode, a handful of times while he sleeps. Sometimes it’s because I move in bed or I am getting up to go to the bathroom, other times its just out of nowhere. He just jolts up in bed, looks around for a second, and goes right back to sleep. He doesn’t remember having any particular dreams so I don’t think its related to that. But I’m not sure if working overnights are just getting to him? Or if he isn’t de-stressing enough from work and his guard is still up? I just don’t want this to become a worse problem that hinders him from getting a decent amount of sleep once he starts his job in the military since I’m sure that will be more stressful than his current one.

903,"I have a twin sister and we're both 17. Ever since quarantine (Even way long before quarantine), she has been hanging out with a lot of her friends everyday (8 people average). I do not have anything against those people whatsoever, what bothers me is that my sister is at risk of getting the Coronavirus and possibly infecting the lives of many others such as my family. It also bothers me that she's always out with her friends when she has responsibilities to take care of home (such as her dog, chores, school, cleaning her mess and etc) and depends on my parents for everything such as money.   
My sister is not independent. She depends on her friends for happiness and she can't stand being lonely, which is why she's out with her friends 24/7 and doesn't come back home until 3 am in the morning every night. She always asks my parents for gas and food money too. She doesn't listen to my parents either since they know that she's hardheaded and spoiled and never listens, so they get tired of having to put up with her so I have to step in and do my job. Every time my parents and I tell her to stay home, she always replies with, ""But there's nothing to do at home, so I'm going out!"" and walks out the door. And when she does stay home, she brings her friends over which is inconsiderate of her as well. I wish she knew how to be independent for once. She doesn't have any hobbies or jobs either.   


A little bit more about my sister, she is really close-minded and hard headed, and really sensitive. She is also very lazy. My sister and I are COMPLETE opposites. She never cleans her mess, she barely takes care of her dog, she doesn't do any chores around the house, and she doesn't work out which is why her doctor told us she is bound to get diabetes (She is very unhealthy and fat I'd hate to say). In conclusion, she's very irresponsible. Every time my parents and I try talking out my sister, she takes it as judgement and cries and forces her way out of things. It's annoying because I'll be trying to talk some sense into her in a genuine and nice way, but she's oversensitive so she can't take any pressure whatsoever. She is also very not smart with her decisions and school. Her friend always complains to me how my sister is retarded and she's tired of having my sister to depend on her for everything such as school work. Also she got caught doing some free illegal money method and when my dad caught her, she tried pretending she didn't know by crying. I know this is wrong of me, but I tend to go on social media and rant about her to release my anger. I also beat her up every once in a while. She is also heavily involved in drama and very problematic to many people (She gossips and rants to her group of friends every night, people always complain about her to me, people are always talking shit about her and the things she does that are bothersome and disrespectful, my family gets stressed out because of her, etc). She complains how stressed out she is because of school and how insecure she is of her body, but she doesn't do anything about it and finds an excuse for everything.  


Things she always says to me in an argument:  
\-'You're just jealous I have more friends than you and I have friends to hang out with everyday!"" (I have more friends than her, I just don't hang out with them as often because I enjoy having me-time and I don't feel the need to be with my friends for everything I do.)  
\-'I have a job and I use my own money, you just don't know what it is so I don't know what you're talking about."" (Most likely the illegal free money method my dad caught her doing. She also doesn't have an actual job because she's always out with her friends.)  
\-""Shut up! You're making me go mentally crazy. Dad, I'm going to runaway because I can't take this anymore!""  
\-""This is why everybody doesn't like you and talks shit about you.""  


Some things she has done that aren't normal for a 17 year old:  
\-She broke down my bedroom door because I used her footage of ME in a YouTube video  
\-She broke down the bathroom door while I was taking a shower because she had to use the shower  
\-Whenever she asked my dad to buy her a personal fitness trainer, she had a mental breakdown and threatened that she is never going to workout.  
\-She always asks my parents for money to buy fast food because she doesn't like eating the food my parents cook for her although in my opinion, I think the food is really good. She's just really spoiled and ungrateful. She cries and complains when my parents put vegetables in her food too.  
\-She cries and forces her way out of everything rather than putting in the work and doing it herself.   


If she won't listen to me or my family members, I hope that she'll listen to the anonymous people under this post. If you'd like her phone number to send her a friendly message, message me for it. 

I apologize if I sound like a Karen. The only time I'm like this is with my sister, and she has exceeded the boundaries way too many times which is why I'm doing this. Keep in mind my parents are aware of my sister and her doings, but they don't take any action and just threaten her which she knows won't happen. Honest to God, everything I am saying is the truth and I would not like about my sister just to make her look bad.   


If you've made it this far, what action should I take? Going to my parents could be an option, but I've went to them many times already and it seems like they won't listen to me or consider my options.",16May2020,1

907,"So I'm (M) in college and I've run into a problem with the girls I've managed to take back to my apartment.

I have a very specific fetish. On a broader scale, I'm into female humiliation. And unfortunately, I'm into female ABDL. Its a fucking terrible fetish and I wish I didn't have it, but unfortunately its the case. If I could get rid of it, I would do it in a heartbeat When I was hitting puberty I didn't watch much regular porn, I mainly stuck to my fetishes.

I believe this has created a problem for me in that now I struggle to get hard watching porn or even with a girl. I have gotten into lesbian porn recently but its just not the same. And on the occasions where I should be getting hard and having sex, it just doesn't come, even though I was extremely attracted to the girls. This has led to me still being a virgin and not even ever receiving a real blowjob, something I'm definitely self-conscious about even though I know its not that big of a deal. It's just embarrassing.

Alcohol may have been a factor, but I don't think I was that drunk on any of those occasions to really alter anything. Nerves probably played a part, but I still think it may be the fetish issue.

My question is, what do I do? How can I overcome this problem? Does anyone have any similar experience with this and how did you overcome it?",16May2020,0
908,"Morning peeps, this is in the military context. I’ll be changing a lot of words so that people who haven’t been in the military are able to understand etc. 

Okay so this dude worked with me/us at the office a while back. His supervisors decided to let another unit borrow him (he’s a cook) so, he technically doesn’t belong at these barracks anymore. Ever since the beginning he has been a slob. I constantly have to tell him to clean after himself etc. I didn’t mind as much back then because the building we were in was newer but we were moved into the “ghetto” and there’s massive amounts of cockroaches. I’ve been trying to get rid of them but his nastiness just brings back more and more. No joke, I have seen 4 cockroaches running around in his bed. 

So, on a normal day he’ll eat, leave his trash at his desk, he’ll eat in bed and throw the trash into one of the drawers by a hole it has in the side, he sleeps in a bad full of trash, candy wrappers, soda cans, etc. 

So since were in the military, people can literally come in at any time they want and go through our shit. They’ve complained multiple times to MY supervisor because again, he doesn’t belong here hence why they have no one to complain to in my unit and since the building belongs to my unit well, they complain to my supervisors only. 

My gunny has already threatened us both with negative paperwork if he the room a mess. My area is clean asf. Literally the only thing I don’t do is my bed because what’s the point? Other than that, my desk is clean, my shoes are on my desk shelf, my trash is in a trash bag, etc. 

In the past I have tried a couple things. I tried being nice, telling him to clean tf up. I tried being a jackass, making him clean up, and I tried ignoring is mess which massively backfired (gunny came in and saw said mess) 

On the other hand, I’m being medically separated due to epilepsy. I’ve had a serious talk with him that went something along the lines of, “if we get negative paperwork you’ll still have an auto payment to your bank with money. If I get negative my medical sep will turn into an admin separation which means dishonorable discharge along with living with epilepsy and even less of a change of getting a job.” He listened and kept his part clean for a few days then went right back into being a slob. 

Marine corps logic is, “you live with him so it’s as much your fault as his” “sir, my part of the room is CLEARLY clean 24/7” “you live with him” 

His command isn’t even aware that this is happening because again, these barracks don’t belong to his unit hence why all the blame is being put on me even tho I keep my shit clean.",16May2020,1

My brother lives in the same room as me and he never really does anything quite or useful as long as he's home.

He's loud, speaks on the phone all day, speaks with me if I don't have my headphones on, always has the tv turned on and loud and I just can't ignore all these noises and distractions at some point.

920,"I would like to preface this post with this: If you are going to read anything below, just make sure you read the entire post.

Option 1: transferring universities
Option 2: staying at my current institution 

On paper, transferring is the most logical. By far, actually. But staying at my current college is very important for my emotional and mental wellbeing.

Transferring eliminates any financial debt (it’s practically free), resets my ~3.0 GPA, gives me a chance to graduate with a high GPA, and is a state school that is ranked #1 for my major. I would be graduating in 2023.

My current college is an elite US News top 25 university where my current program is also ranked #1, where I would pay ~100k and graduate in 2022. Here, I have everything I need outside of academics. I am more than
content with my social life, and I have a sense of comfort and confidence where I understand and know how I can grow and become a better person. With transferring, all the guarantees I have currently would be eliminated. I would, in a sense, have to start over. I’m not in the right headspace to do that. I have put in so much work to be content with my life outside of school at my current university. I have leadership positions in multiple clubs. But, I’m actually currently on a leave from my current university for mental health reasons and will be returning this summer. So mental health and emotional wellbeing is the top priority. I can’t say for certain that I won’t be happy with Option 2, but a significant void inside of me will be felt, without a doubt.

I fully understand how some people would kill for Option 1. I understand that five years from now it doesn’t matter what college I go to. I understand that student loans is a big deal and would impact my life for the next 10 years. But my gut is telling me to choose Option 2. It gives me a different type of happiness than the happiness I get from not being debt-free, it’s hard to explain. So right now i just don’t know what to do. I’ve gone to almost a dozen different people who are all very close to me and have offered a unique perspective. I still am undecided, however, and require all the external advice and words that I can get. Any advice is appreciated, whether or not it’s specific to my situation (you can generalize it as much as you want and i’m sure i’ll get something from it).

So if I am going to suffer no matter what, whats the point?

922,"I've always been a relatively simple minded person. I don't think I'm autistic but I have a hard time with abstract thinking and critical thinking especially. I also have a distinct lack of common sense. 

When I was younger especially I wasted a lot of time daydreaming (I still do). I just feel like it's better in my head than the outside world, which seems far too complicated. Things that are basic to other people feel really hard to me. I was able to go to college and graduate with a degree in Electrical Engineering with a decent GPA which also got me accepted to the MS program at my school (it's not very competitive). However I have a distinct lack of common sense when it comes to hands on things that I was never directly taught. For instance, I blew a device by mistakenly applying a high voltage without realizing it. I mostly got through school through ""rote learning"" or memorization. I mostly looked at old exams and homeworks and just studied them over and over. 

I've always felt like other people just ""get it"" and I don't. I'm horrible working with my hands and don't understand the subtleties of interacting with others. Because of this, I've mostly kept to myself for most of my life. I will be 23 in a month and I feel like I really haven't grown or matured much in the past decade, which is really sad to be honest. I lose almost everything and have a poor memory. When  I watch a video online I can't even recollect 90% and after about an hour I probably forget the whole thing.

923,"I’m going to keep it short and to the point- My husband and I have been married for a few years and haven’t had kids yet, mostly because of me, and the issues I’m trying to overcome. 

As a child i went through a lot of shit, I am not going to detail it out, but a few of the things that really stand out are - being molested by a close male family member at age 12 and a pretty bad relationship between me and my mom for the majority of my life. I also deal with pretty extreme anxiety and depression always have my whole life.

Because of these reasons I find it very difficult to want to have kids myself. I don’t want to have kids and not be an adequate enough mother for them, or have kids and not be able to protect them from harm from people - even family, because it happened to me as a child. i also am so afraid of not being able to teach them and give them the confidence and patience I never had.

925,"Seven months ago my girlfriend and I (girl) got into a fight with her ex, who manipulated us into talking to her (she said she wanted to apologize) but ended up shitting on my looks, my figure, and bringing up my gf's MH issues (which triggered my gf into spiraling). She even denied everything she said about me despite the evidences. After seeing the way she looked at my girlfriend, and pleaded her to take her back, I was crying out in the streets and wasn't able to talk properly to my gf. I dont't know how to react to the situation because I never came across a problematic ex before, and it was worse for my girlfriend who endured a lot during their entire relationship. Early morning she texted us apologies but can't even admit what she did, and because I was hurt and angry, I just told her to move on and stop gaslighting us.

Now, few months later I'm suffering sleepless nights, cant function well, low self-esteem on my body and looks, worsening MH disorders, wondering what's the root.

No wonder I asked myself lots of times what if I replied more kindly or did not reply at all to her auto-apology, and what if I didn't allow my gf to talk to her that night. I never expected that I would be affected this much by a hateful person that I wasn't even close to.

Her and I are very close now (wasn't always that way, we definitely got close these past two years even though we live in different cities for university). Our brother wants nothing to do with us. Our interactions at home don't go beyond him being really, really rude and patronizing whenever we say... anything. We constantly ask if he wants to hang out, wants to go on a bike ride, play a board game, go for a drive, etc... and he has 0 interest, just says ""no"". He is infamous for his one word responses. And whenever he does something to piss us off, all he says, in the most patronizing of ways, is ""don't worry you're not in trouble"" (?) or ""calm down"". He has this weird ass complex, like it seems he thinks he's this holier than thou person that is too good for us or something... I have no idea. I have never ever met anyone in my life like this, and have never been treated by anyone like this before. Of course, I have thought that maybe he has some kind of underlying issue in his life and so I approach him every now and then just to say ""look, I don't know why you seem to dislike us so much, but just so you know, I'm here if ever you want to talk or if there's a problem"" etc and he never even responds, just ignores. He's like this with my parents too -- never tells them where he's going, who he's hanging out with; we have absolutely 0 clue what is going on in his life.

928,"So I recently reached out to my long time best friend whom I had an argument with about 3 months ago. We haven’t spoke to each other since (Although they made 1 barebones attempt) 

So we started off the convo quite cold but it eventually got warmer, then he made a plan to meet with me and catch up, he rarely made plans for me so I was excited

The day we spent together was great, then when I got home he just didn’t really seem as warm as he was. The next day I asked to see him he said to come at a time that was 2 hours later that yesterday, I arrived 10 minutes early but I did walk for 30 minutes to see him. He seemed annoyed, not to mention his other friend was already there (Apparently was there 4 hours before me) 

Instead of usually bringing me to his room, him and his friend just left me in the kitchen and when on to do whatever they wanted. 

I spent the whole day quite annoyed because I was practically third wheeling and when I told my friend I wanted to talk about what happened, the other friend was very quick to intervene when possible. My friend explained that he assumed he was in the right and doesn’t feel a need to apologise, just wants to leave it in the past and move on. He also made it clear that he’s very close friends with the guy that he hangs with, more so than me. 

So I left happy that we discussed a little, I even made plans to come 2 days later, now that friend usually comes down every day.

930,"So, I'm in a pickle. I have to regularly interact with someone who I am usually uncomfortable with. I want to have a positive relationship with this person, but it is proving difficult. I am doing my best to be polite and rational, but im just not sure how I should be handling myself.

This is my problem. The only way she seems to try and interact with me is by gossiping or by trying to ""buy"" my affection. I do my best to be polite, but I get really disgusted with how she talks about people. She talks about EVERYONE like they are below her, even her friends and people she is nice in person to. It really bothers me. Im sure at some point, I've been on the other end of her conversations. When she brings up people to insult them, I do not agree with her and usually ignore/dismiss the topic. Im trying not to reward her with my approval when she does that. I dont want to be dismissive of her, but every time she tries to start a conversation, she just wants to get chummy. She tries hard to get me to agree she is better than whoever she's talking about. Topics can be about anything from their lifestyle to their looks.

She really does try to be friendly with me. When she isn't trying to force gossip, she is going above and beyond to coddle a friendship out of me, I guess. If I'm not going to gossip, she will offer to do some over the top nice thing for me that I dont need or want done for me. Sometimes this takes the form of extravagant gifts or treating me like I am royalty. It sounds like such a stupid thing to complain about, but it makes me really uncomfortable. Im a pretty independent person, and really struggle with letting people do little things for me, much less grand gestures. I usually decline her offers with a ""no thank you"", and it really seems to bother her. But she offers things I just don't want to say yes to. Like expensive gifts (hundreds of $$ worth), or offering to do personal errands with me (like going shopping for nice underwear with her.)

How do I foster a positive relationship without being uncomfortable all the time? I feel very overwhelmed dealing with this person, but I'd like to be able to have a relationship that does not rely on being bought or putting others down. Ive done nice little things for her, and try and talk about things she might like as I think of them, but it just seems strained. She is a family member I have to live with right now, so its not like I can just cut contact.

I decided to make a new post for it, to maybe receive multiple people's pov on my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

In short my stepdad has been seeing one of our neighbours daughter for who knows how long now, i've been very suspicious of them for a while now and i've found many ways to find evidence. As of now i've got chat logs confirming sexual intercourse, nudes, etc.

What makes this issue difficult is, my mom has a suicidal past and the breakup with my dad was a very messy time in our lives, especially since i was young, now that i'm older i'm here to fix things. I cannot have my mom know this as it would break her heart and probably her shatter her soul, not only for having to restart again at 40+y old, for the fact that it's cheating and for the fact that it's cheating with a partner not even suitable in the eyes of the law.

i'm at the middle level of piano, i was learning at school freely even i get a little time to practice.  learning an instrument needs practice but during this times i cannot practice cause i don't have a piano at my house. i really want a one but i'm a student (so i'm broke).  my family don't have money to spend on piano or a keyboard too. i want to keep learning; but now, i don't know how to do. do you have any ideas?",16May2020,1

940,"(14 yr female)So about a year ago I had a crush on this guy and he liked me back. So obviously we decided to get together. This doche bag turned out to a drug user I told my parents and he got mad at me. Even a year later I still think about him. I recently learned that this boy only liked me because the way I looked. So that ensues self worth problems with me in my mind. Then at the beginning of this school year I started liking this other guy who thought it was okay to sexually harass/assault me. I’ve had the worst luck with guys. I’ve been harassed by my nephews in my family one calling me fat. And trying to hit me. I don’t know what to do anymore I’m tired of the physical and mental problems, I want it to stop. I have told my parents about the harassment and assault. But not the mental side of this.

942,"I (33f) live in the ground floor flat of a two storey detached house with my boyfriend (43). Two women live in the flat above us, one of whom I’ve known since school and is a good friend - let’s call her Sindy (also 33), and the other is a random. The floorboards are quite thin so we can hear upstairs noises but don’t get annoyed by it too much as this is inevitable living in a shared house. We are quite lucky that the house is off the road and has a small car park. It is gated so this outdoor area is just for us and has been a blessing during the lockdown to use for exercise and just to get some fresh air. My bf and I have finally gotten into a lockdown routine and two weeks ago started using the car park to do exercise in the evenings as that’s really the only time I have as I have quite a demanding job during the day. I also did not see Sindy or the random use the area at all so was quite comfortable just using the space for about an hour every other evening, to jog (25 laps around it amounts to 1 mile) and skip. We don’t want to go to the park as my bf is considered high risk - everyone knows this. 
Sindy is currently on a weight loss journey and has been able to focus on this more since the lockdown. She told me she was going for long morning walks in the park in order to achieve her step count and I am happy that she has been seeing great results. But since last week she started taking evening walks in the car park for up to 2.5 hours and she speaks very loudly on the phone during her walk or sings along to music she’s listening to. Not only does this now mess with my exercise routine as I know neither of us would be comfortable doing exercise there at the same time, but as we’re on the ground floor we can hear her whole conversation and see her pacing up and down outside our flat, and it’s very disturbing. I’m really stuck on how to approach this. She is single and doesn’t get on with her flatmate so I know that talking on the phone must be important for her, and also I don’t want to come across as unsupportive of her weight loss journey. I don’t want to make the lockdown any worse than it is for her, but she’s impeding on my need to exercise. We’ve been friends for years but she’s very sensitive especially about weight loss. Really stuck on what to do so I turn to you Reddit.",16May2020,1
943,"I fucked up, really bad. Being young and stupid, I didn’t know what I wanted out of life. I was on a path to college and a career I didn’t really want, I just knew it would make my family proud. So in 2017, my first year of college, I did a whole lot of coke and cheated on my girl a few times. I was able to keep both a secret and never got caught. I thought I made my “trade” with the devil by messing up my school and a nice radio job I had so I could keep this girl close. Even reading this now does seem twisted, but I really loved her so much. After that initial girl, I never slept with anyone else. We would get married and be happy. But I lost all ambition in life and focused more on smoking way too much weed. I slowly started getting more irrationally angry about things as time went on. 

One day my mind broke and I couldn’t function as a human anymore. After some personal family trauma, finding out my dad cheated on my mom multiple times and he would cut up his arms that sent him to a psych hospital. I owned up to what I did, she was furious but willing to work it out. But my mental state was at a point where everything seemed like a threat and gave me crippling anxiety and paranoia. I had to be taken to a psych hospital. I’m much better now, have cut off smoking, taking meds to help my depression and anxiety, focusing on finding a job and getting back in school for someone that I feel gives myself purpose. But while I still wasn’t mentally well, I begged and pleaded she take me back and that I love her. She’s more than set on divorce and doesn’t want anything to do with me.

I just want to show her that I really learned my lesson. The psychological torture I gave myself is something I never want to go through again. I swear on my grandma’s grave that I’m never never never going to shove coke up my nose or be unfaithful. I swear I’m going to be honest with my thoughts and emotions. I have ambition to improve cause I feel so uncomfortable living back with my parents.

The spiral started in January and now, with the last text I sent, she won’t respond. I don’t want to blow up her phone or anything of the sort. It just makes me so angry seeing my dad happy with my mom and that I can’t win the woman I love back the way he did. I’m not really sure what advice I’m looking for here. I’m seeing my own therapist and getting my whole family to therapy. I’m job hunting, eating healthy, and just trying to stay positive. But I still miss her. I’m still hoping one day I come home and find her there so we can talk. I’m still hoping for the text that says she misses me and that she’s willing to give me one last chance that I can’t fuck up. I just feel so lost.",16May2020,1

947,"tdlr so that no one has to read my rant: I need advice on how to have confidence in myself, how to not hate myself, and how to be able to talk normally, so that I don’t sound like the most boring person on the planet when words are coming out of my mouth. 


Whenever I think I have confidence (which is a rare event in itself), it’s shattered only days later. By me realizing I don’t have a good body, and then me starving myself and working out intensely to try and fix myself, and the mental toll that comes along with not being able to enjoy anything that I eat and having to k ill myself to try and not become fat. Oh, and then someone will tell me my teeth look disgusting. 

I just absolutely hate myself. I hate everything about me. I just can’t be everything that everyone expects me to be, because the expectations of everyone in my life piles up so high that I’m just a failure regardless. And every day, I end up sacrificing my own happiness time and time and time again so that peoples expectations of me can be fulfilled, and so I won’t let anyone down. But I always let them down, because I just fucking suck, through and through. 

Oh, and I can’t talk. I don’t have any friends and I was homeschooled for half of my life. So in the rare event that someone I care about decides to finally talk to me, first of all I don’t know how to talk. I don’t know how to structure my sentences, I don’t know how to make the words come out. I guess it’s just that I have no social skills at all. I sound flat and I sound fucking stupid every time I talk, and frankly I just annoy myself and every time I speak I hate myself more and more. Secondly, I get excited when someone I care about talks to me, which makes it so much more impossible for me to talk like a normal person. 

I don’t expect anyone to enjoy being in my company. I don’t blame them. It’s an automatic thing for me to expect people to be bored, annoyed, and to not enjoy any of my presence. I should be used to it by now but every time, it’s still soul crushing when someone I love seems so bored when I try to spend time with them.",16May2020,2

Pros:

- I'm sick of my life and I don't have a future here. I could never make friends, I hate college, hated high school. Nothing excites me, nothing to look forward to. I need something different

- I love the idea of serving my country and making something out of my life, having a sense of purpose

- I'm indifferent to the idea of me dying. I'm going to die one day anyway

- I could meet new people, possibly like-minded

- This isn't a spur of a moment thing, and it's better than suicide I guess

- Opens the door for careers afterwards (body guard, security guard, etc.)

Cons:

- I don't like being told what to do and taking orders

- I'm kind of weak (my max bench is 250 lbs, which is low for the USMC)

- Possibility of paralysis, amputations, PTSD

- Don't want to do the dirty work for politicians or kill for a stupid reason (oil, politics).

Discipline ain't working, he always goes back to doing the same crap after getting discipline.

Only time when its peaceful is when my mom goes and drop him off. When he comes back, it's a living hell again. Problem been going on for at least 2-3 years.

959,"i started talking to my friend (let’s call him L) again a few weeks into this lockdown. he told me that before the lockdown, his best friend (N) broke up with him after like 2 weeks, and they’d stopped talking. well now they’re talking again, and i’m worried. here’s why:

L and N have know each other a lot longer than either of them know me. they’ve been through a lot of ups and downs from what i’ve heard, more so downs than ups. but they always end up talking again, no matter what happens between them.

me, and other people that know them, think that N has always been toxic to L, she’s rarely ever treated him right, has manipulated him, been dismissive of him and genuinely not treated him like she truly values him. but, it’s not really mine or anyone’s business so we stay out of it.

here’s why i’m worried: when i first met L, he and N were not talking for the longest time. he was the sweetest, most considerate and kind person i’d ever met, and he’s the one person i’ve gotten along with more than anyone i’ve ever met in my life. i thought i’d found the best person ever when i met him.

fast forward to a few months later, he starts talking to N again. this is when his attitude towards me takes a turn for the worse. he starts calling me hurtful shit, being dismissive of me, ignoring me, leaving me hanging etc. now i’ve got barely anything against N, she’s really sweet and kind, but just doesn’t treat L right from what i’ve seen.

i’m worried because anytime L has been talking to N, he’s always shown me this behaviour. i know it’s not N’s fault, but i’m so worried about him doing it again, but i only started talking to him again and i don’t want it to be ruined for another time. i’m so scared of it happening again, because then i’ll be on my own again. it upsets me so much typing this, i just don’t know what i can do. i don’t want this seemingly perfect relationship with him snatched away again. i appreciate any advice. thank you. i don’t have anyone irl that i can talk to about this.

961,"I am 22-years-old. I want to put my grandmother into an assisted living home. I am giving a shortened version of the backstory before explaining my grandmother’s condition because I want people to understand my feelings and concerns.

My grandmother “raised me” from age 1 to 11. She was however, abusive and neglectful and I was taken away at 11. I was placed into foster care for a while before my mother took custody of me. My mother also has a lot of problems and so after living in shelters and moving 16 times in my mother’s custody, I moved out at 17. I keep a distance between myself and my family because my family is severely twisted... and I mean that. I won’t explain everything but my family is a cesspool. 

I am doing ok for myself. I have my own apartment, I work, I attend college... I am able to save a decent amount of money for my age! 

I am the only one who really looks after my grandmother though I also keep my distance. I am the one who takes her to get groceries when her food stamps come in... I take her to doctor’s appointments... we don’t have a relationship because she is verbally vicious but also emotionally manipulative and clingy. Even though I do all those things with her, she verbally assaults me and says horrifying things to me. And she doesn’t respect my boundaries. She calls me 24/7 and messages me 24/7... but if ignore her, she throws a temper tantrum. 

She has 3 kids and 2 are messed up from her raising them. The other 1 who isn’t so messed up is my uncle whom I’ve never met but he sends her what I call “sympathy money” once in awhile. He only recently began checking on her over the phone but they don’t spend time together.

All of the responsibility falls on me and that’s just the way it is. I need advice on how to get her in an assisted living facility. I can’t take the stress of taking care of her anymore. She’s too toxic for me but if I don’t take care of her, I know it’ll cut her life short.

She pees herself 24/7 and just sits in it. She won’t wear adult diapers. She doesn’t clean herself and she doesn’t clean her house... she sits around when there are maggots and filth. She never bathes and always smells putrid. She doesn’t eat right and she barely cooks for herself. She is gaining even more weight as time progresses and he is angry 24/7. She sits on Facebook 24/7 and never does anything. She has no friend because she is truly evil and problematic and I say that in the kindest way ever. She is however, able-bodied. She’s heavy set but she can walk very well... and she is NOT senile. She’s always been a filthy, messy person... but it’s getting worse as she ages. She also makes very depressing comments like, “I’m gonna die soon, you’ll get there one day too.” If we’re together and I’m helping her with something and she is in a bad mood, she’ll make a terrible comment about me... or say that I’m going to be just like her one day. 

I love her because I am attached to her but dealing with her is eating away at my mental and physical health. Absolutely no one in my family will deal with her and she’s always expecting me to answer my phone and be of service to her. I need to figure out my options... How can I put her in a home?",16May2020,1

I have changed my password for him because he said it was too confusing, so I let him pick a password. I have never scared or hesitated if he looked in my phone because I never had anything to hide. In the beginning of our marriage we both have full transparency, but the past month or two he has been holding his phone to the side when he opens it or messages someone, he won't let me go anywhere near his phone even if I'm handing it to him, I have ask him what he's laughing at because I never hear him laugh that hard and he says it's nothing, don't worry about it. He acts very sketchy when I come up to him to cuddle and he's on his phone. He has been recently hanging out with people, only females though. He tells me he's going out to hangout, but won't tell me who or where. When I asked him who and where he says a friend first and says I don't know yet. I have to ask him two or three times before I really get an answer. I never cared who he went to go hang out with, it's just seems very sketchy that I have to ask him multiple times to get an answer.
Today, he was supposed to be out making extra money all day. Which is fine by me, but sometimes I want him home a little bit so I can spend time with him because I miss him and he is never home due to making extra money on the side and his main job. Whenever I would ask him if he could come home for an hour when it's not busy, he would say he needs to get the money first before he can be home relaxing. He told me he would send me a few dollars for a taxi so I could go walk around a trail in the city since we don't have an extra car. He told me to give him a few hours so he can make enough to send to me the money for the taxi. Not even 15 minutes later he tells me he's going to hang out with somebody. It just seems unfair to me that he won't come home and see his wife but he can find time to go hang out with a friend.

968,"Sorry cos this is a bit mental.

So I was adopted when I was 5, my adoptive sister when she was 8. We are about 2 and a half years apart, we both came from a pretty fucked up background, my mum was a heroin addict, multiple other drugs, she was always having different boyfriends and one particular one who stayed a while I can remember vividly moments of him punching her and giving her a bloody nose just for taking a cigarette. Theres more obviously but I dont wanna tell my life story.

My sister had it even worse, she had a mother who was an addict, she lived in a family who according to local authorities even though it was never gone as far as prosecution, the social services had said they thought her dad had abused her sexually and her brother. Her mother had set the house on fire multiple times and she has told many stories about blood around the house and waking up to her mum loony on deleriants.

 When she came, she used to be naked a lot. She was 8 when she came from adoption and I was 11 at the time. She would always be weird in that way with me, when we were just newly a family I remember her coming into my bedroom and shaking her hips naked and looking at me, and we started playing 'nervous'. 

This went on for some years, me honestly not knowing how much of a big deal this could mean or the severity of it, like I knew it was 'weird' and I didnt want people to know but I didnt think it could ever be something serious I hand on heart was unaware of what I was doing and just saw it as a just another thing almost. She would often walk about with no clothes almost on purpose when I would be near by, honestly probably one of my deepest regrets on the whole thing would be where she would come in and say if you let me play on this I'll play nervous with you. *I think I encouraged this sometimes.

This is what has made me feel like a disgusting human being, but its weird. As soon as I reached around 15 16 I started to realise how weird this was. It came down like a ton of bricks. I will never in all my life probably feel as lost and as hopeless as I did then, but still to this day I dont know what to make of any of it. To make it worse about 2 years after my sister was diagnosed with autism so I feel even worse.

It still affects me. I feel awful from it every day, I wish I could change things, I wish I could go back and know what I know now, but I cant. I'm stuck as me, and I guess I just wanna know if people think that I was a real monster or not. I need to know honestly really, im not sure if I can keep on like this, its killing me. I know I might sound like a freak and maybe I am. I just wanna know what you think i should do. I wanna fix things, no matter what it takes.",16May2020,1

973,"So, I've known this girl for almost about a year now. She's a good person at heart but I've noticed that she's needy and doesn't take into consideration my own personal space or my time. She guilt trips me when I tell her I'm out with other friends or if I make plans with other friends without inviting her. She has been through a lot and has some childhood trauma and has some issues at home. She has been through some unstable relationships in the paat and recently broke up with her bf and has used me as an emotional punching bag at times. 

I feel like It's my fault for putting up my boundaries earlier but I also like to help others. I've driven her around and listen to her problems in the past and offer her advice but she never seemes to take it. She'll call me to hang out every other day and when I tell her I have something planned she counters with: ""how come you didn't extend the invite"" or ""Ohh you're meeting your friends at 5, come chill with me for a bit then"", etc.. I have told her in the past that I need peesonal space but I see it hasn't really gone through to her. She's offered me support for my own problems before and she is fun to be around but she can be draining. Last week she had an ourburst at me saying that I never take initiative and that she is the one doing all the work in the friendship. I was kinda shocked because I wasn't expecting it. Grabted, I can be a bit too passive at times, but she usually plans things without telling me until the last minute and she is impulsive.  As an example, I even spent time driving her around at night when she and her bf had issues and I took my own personal time to help her and talk about her problems and support her, dozens of times in the past so it's not like I was never there for her.


I was just wondering what is a good way of telling my own thoughts to her without making it seem like I'm attacking her. I don't want her to get defensive but I also don't want to hurt her feelings either. (""How come you never told me this before?"", Etc..) 

Also, she lives like a block away from me too so it's not like I can just ignore her all the time. Any advice would be appreciated. Fyi, she's 28 F and I'm 26 M.

Thank you!",16May2020,1
974,"I just found out my boyfriend cheated on me with his best friends sister who I was also friends with. He had been living with them for a while. Last night the took ecstasy, smoked weed, and drank. They said all they did was make out and there are hickeys on both of there necks and she just got out of a relationship and the day before was asking if it was to early to hookup with someone. This morning he asked me if I wanted to have a three some with that girl, so I know that it wasn’t just the weed and alcohol, he still wants to sleep with her. When I found out I got mad and everyone ended up finding out what happened. He isn’t living with his friend anymore because his sister was upset and embarrassed. They were fine this morning before I said anything. Now he’s living at his house alone with no food for anything. I can’t let him stay at my house , I have no room and I don’t know what to do.

975,"So I knew about his wedding and didn't really think about an invitation. It is half the country away and, while my little family drove that distance a couple years ago, we don't want to do it again, so I would have to go alone and fly. My husband is understandably worried if I decide go.

Regardless, my sister posted about the invitations and how cute they were, so I asked for a Pic. The brother then messaged me for my address for a ""second round of invitations"" so he could send me one. I consider this to be the ""forgotten and oopsie list"". I do feel pretty slighted on being forgotten, but eh, not much I can do about it.

I will have to pay for flight, car, room, among other things just for me to go, which is normal, and I'd personally would rather just stay home and go to an event that is at the same time where I can spend time with my little family and celebrate my husband's birthday.

976,"My aunt is currently 50 and has trouble sleeping,

Despite taking pills for her sleep issues she usually needs to lay in bed for an upwards of 2 hours a night to get any sleep and she wakes really early. Overall, she only probably gets 3-4 hours a night which has had a huge impact on her life. She can't function properly and stays in bed until around 3 in the afternoon due to her fatigue. 

I'm wondering if it could be the mattress or bed that she has? She sleeps in a fairly small room and has a small bed with an overly soft mattress (imo). I have tried sleeping there once and it was quite uncomfortable. Maybe due to humidity or weather as well? Since she usually sleeps better in the winter and her condition worsens in the summer.

She has also been diagnosed with depression and takes medication for this.

979,"I’m a sophomore and I’m moving from New York to Salt Lake City and I have already been to two high schools because the first was giant and I felt useless and couldn’t make friends and the one I am at now is small and I have lots of friends and I was on the track team and the teachers are amazing but I’m not going back to New York so it’s no longer an option. I feel like if I go to another school it’s going to take me another year to adjust and that’s a long time to be miserable. Plus what if schools don’t even open in fall. I’m thinking of just doing online school and cramming to finish a year early. 

If I go to a normal public school I will have to be socially challenged and make new friends and I don’t know how different the teenagers are here vs. Coming from one of the most diverse schools in the country. Also for all I know schools will be closed. However, I would get to have teachers and have the normal high school memories and such. 

If I did online school I would get ahead and I think I’m motivated and smart enough to be independent. I would have time to do more extracurriculars (if they ever open) and overall it would be a better use of time because I wouldn’t have a commute or anything. This issues with doing this would be not having the social life I would get at a school. I might feel like I’m missing out. If I went to college early...I’m just not sure if I’m ready for that scene even though my birthday is late and I would be essentially the same age as the people there it just sounds like a lot. But if I did online school then that would be the plan because 2 years is a long time without near by friends. 

I just don’t know what to do because if I choose online I will keep doing school through the summer. If anyone could just tell me their opinion or if they have any experience going to college early. Nobody I have talked to seems to have anything to say.

I think the best way to get the best advice would be to explain what I mean specifically. I grew up in a small farm town in Connecticut and my father owned a construction company that I worked at my whole life. I've always loved the outdoors, including hunting, fishing, kayaking, canoeing, and hiking. I've also always enjoyed working on trucks and construction/farm equipment as well as working in the field or in the garage or anywhere I can do physical work and get my hands dirty. I've never liked the finer things in life but instead prefer the simpler things in life, like the outdoors, my family, my faith, my friends, my dogs, my truck, my guns, some good books, and charity/volunteer opportunities-- oh, and definitely my mom's meatloaf! Now, I can definitely compromise on some things, although I do suppose I struggle with being too stubborn sometimes with certain things, but I don't think I could ever fall in love with a ""stereotypical city slicker"". Obviously, I'm not saying that I hate all people from the city, one of the best people I ever met came from the city of New York, and being a Red Sox fan I initially had a little bias against her (not really, haha, but maybe a little), but then we became good friends and are to this day. Nevertheless, I think I'd struggle to every consider dating her or marrying her, and not because she's been so close to me for so long but because she and I are so very different, and while that's not a problem as far as us being friends it would be if we were to be married. I'm not trying to sound snobby or picky in saying that, and I'm struggling to explain it, but I hope you can understand what it is that I mean.

With that said, and hopefully you can understand what I mean, I have another thing I want to touch on, and that is that I'm unsure if I'll ever have any luck finding someone who has similar interests, lifestyle, values, etc. as me. In a joking manner, friends have suggested that I go onto farmersonly or that I move down south, both of which I'd rather not do, but I really don't know what to do. I know I shouldn't feel like I'm the only person who lives like I do, but for whatever reason I do, and I need some advice. I don't need someone exactly like me, and again I would hate that, but we need a common foundation upon which to build, in my opinion, and I'm struggling to find someone like that. Where do I look? How do I become worthy of their love? How do I know if they're right for me? Any and all dating advice, questions, etc. I really need help finding answers and advice, so please help me.

I'm FtM (female to male, trans) and 17 y/o. I started testosterone abt 8 months ago, it deepens your voice, makes you look like a man, and I'm pretty much fully passing as male bc of it.

995,"So, I have this boyfriend I met through discord in a youtuber's server. We've been together for quite a while now, and hope to meet soon when the situation is better. Now, in this server I used to talk only in voice chats, but now that there's a lot of free time to do stuff, I like to chat too. This way, I met a guy who had like a twisted mentality over being a good or bad person and was always extremely mean towards people, but not in a troll way, just as it that was his whole lifestyle. I talked to him about his way of thinking, since my BF also mentioned how he used to overthink about it. Turns out they once were friends, and my BF once helped him get through some rough stuff, but one day the guy stopped talking to him and now only insults him. My boyfriend tried really hard to change him back, but it never worked, so it is a really sensitive topic to my BF.The problem is that I somehow enjoyed talked to this guy, and before I knew all of this I got along with him because he liked that unlike most people, I didn't try to change him. My BF noticed and I could tell he got upset, so I told him I could stop if he wanted, because I knew that if he ever met any of my school bullies, he would stop talking to them if I asked him to. However, he is the kind of person that is afraid of asking for things, because he feels selfish. This applies to opening up when he's sad or asking for favors. He just feels bad doing it. So when I told him that, he said that he'd feel bad if I stopped, because that would be egoistic for him to ask me.Now, as a clarification, this isn't a jealousy problem since the other dude knows I'm in a relationship, and it isn't a flirt thing, and my BF knows that though we get along, I still think the guy is kind of an egotistical prick.

So, what should I do in this situation? Should I stop? Should I keep talking to him? What's most important for me here is my BF's happiness. I just feel really bad seeing him sad over past stuff, and if it takes me to stop talking to an internet dude then I really don't care. However, I just feel like whatever I do, he's gonna feel bad about it, either for ""making me stop talking to someone"" or ""me getting well with such a bad person"".

997,"Second time getting scammed.

     Hello, I’m not asking for money or anything, I just am asking for some positive advice and hide me because at this point idk if I am doing something wrong or if it’s just everyone hates me and I deserve this karma.
     Back in December I bought a $750 Visa prepaid card from one vanilla. Not for anything my important but just for random things like coins for games or maybe like a shirt, just random stuff. I wanted to buy AirPod pros and treat myself for Christmas and I had them personally engraved too. Of course they were in high demand near Christmas so it would take 1 month for them to ship.
      I waited my one month all excited thinking of all the things I was going to do with them and how I will use them 24/7 and I was so excited for it. Two days before they were going to ship I received a message from Apple store saying “you have an error with your payment method”. Naturally I was confused and I double checked to make sure everything was fine and it was. 
     Until I checked my balance. Six $100 payments to a random PayPal. My heart sank and I cried for so many hours. I’m 17 as well and was 16 at the time. To save this much money in cash is unreal when you don’t have a job. It took probably 3 years. So I freaked out and didn’t tell my mom because she would think I did something wrong and would disown me so I was scared. I called the company countless times and tried to figure out what to do and finally, I confirmed I could get a refund. What a relief. It took 5 months.
     Last week I got the replacement card in the mail, didn’t even take the sticker off of it yet, I buy a keyboard off of amazon and it delivered yesterday. I was so happy and relieved that I finally had it back. But then I went to order a headset and computer parts for the gaming pc I’ve been saving for and boom, “payment method was declined” instantly I cried.
      I knew what has happed and was scared to open the balance. $550 gone, not even a week after I patiently waited 5 months for a refund and it’s gone. People don’t understand the way you think having clinical depression, and anxiety and sometimes I wonder. 
     I hide my pain from all others, so I don’t drag them down, I text everyone every morning wishing them the best day ever. I try to compliment everyone to make them smile because everyone else’s happiness is my happiness. I’m to afraid to say no to people because I always want them to have it their way so they are the happiest, I never treat myself and always buy things for my friends, just to see a smile. What did I do to deserve this. I don’t even know if it’s worth the time I spent trying to get a refund on my card. It’s just gonna get stolen again. I’m broke, people are starting to abuse my kindness, I’ll never get my dream pc, I just want to give up.
     I’m trying to find the best version of me, I try to be religious and I pray almost every night asking for forgiveness when I don’t do really anything wrong. All I do is try to be perfect, try to make everyone else happy, I try to put other first, and I just want people to do the same for me. 
     Sorry for ranting and I’m sure nobody is even gonna read this fully, but if you do, thank you so very much and just know any support would be great because right now... I’m giving up, I feel more pain than ever and once I get stuck in my own head, forget about it. It’s over for me.

I have an actual plan now and I expect to come out victoriously, but it hurts my morale to have taken so long. It almost feels like I’m a 13-year-old held back two grades, still stuck in fifth grade while everyone else my age has reached seventh.

This IS NOT an issue of wanting to look good to other people. I don’t care what others think; plus no one else really cares about that either. The issue is that I lament that I’m not where I could have been because of my late diagnosis and treatment of ADD.

I realised that I'm really in trouble.

I'm 15y old and I just can't stop fapping. I started finding about fapping in kindergarten (I have no idea how I found out) and found out about porn very early (Way too early).

My problem is that I just can't have one day without fapping. It is really rare, that there is one day without fapping for me. It's like a daily thing or like a routine. I usually don't fap more than once a day, rarely maybe 2 times a day but that's it. It's just.. the thing is its everyday.

The addiction gets worse and worse. When I'm horny, I always find new ways to satisfy myself.

I have absolutely no control over me anymore in my horny state.

Not long ago I found out I can blow myself. From blowing it got worse to cumming into my mouth. After I came and I'm normal again I realise, what I made. I instantly washed my mouth very good, because I feel dirty.

Please help, I really have no control about me anymore. When my body goes horny, I'm like a different person.

Blocking porn won't do the job for me. I can always find a way around a censorship and I also get horny without porn.

What should I do? I don't want this. It just happends. It gets worse and worse. I have no one to speak about it. I don't wanna speak to anyone about it. Not a doctor, not my family, nobody. Only reddit may help me, because I can stay anonymous.

I have this addiction for pretty much my whole life.

And when I was brought home (back to my parents house) I was even more miserable. 

I didn’t have a job and I just sat around for a year. My parents make fairly good money so they supported me. Which I’m not proud of but I was a severely depressed 19 year old so...I mean it happened. While they did support me they were constantly on me about going back to school and getting a job. They wanted me to do both when i couldn’t even do one. I was going to therapy and trying to figure everything out and they were rushing me to get through it. At one point my mom was drunk and berating me in front of one of my very close friends who has known my family for years and she literally described it as “bullying” when we finally left. I ended up leaving therapy early and enrolling in school to make my parents happy. I didn’t want to be there and I didn’t know what I wanted to do still. 

My mom ended up getting a job in Chicago so I had to leave mid semester to go with her. When we got to Chicago i enrolled in school and I hated it there too. Again, had no idea what I wanted to do. I was working too and i has never done it both at the same time. It was a lot and my parents just kept encouraging me to put more on my plate. I cracked and quit going to class, hiding it from my parents. I failed both semesters this year. The problem I had all of those years was not knowing what I wanted to do. 

Recently a friend told me I should look into accounting because I’m really good with money and investing. I help my friends out with their budgets and whatnot and I really enjoy it so it makes sense. I get really excited about it and figure out a way to tell my parents I think I know what I wanna do and my dad literally went “I’m tired of playing your games, you need to own up to your actions”.  It didn’t make sense. Like none of it made sense at all. I told them my plan of going back to community college for a year, taking a few classes part time to get my GPA up and then applying to the online uni that my employer pays tuition for to finish my degree so i dont have to go into anymore debt. 

It’s probably the most sensible plan I’ve ever had. It hurt my feelings when my dad basically brushed me off his shoulder. I think a lot of my indecisiveness and lack of confidence comes from my parents not believing in me and disregarding my feelings when it comes to my life decisions (ie. sending me to college with no real plan on what I was doing there). I don’t know very many 20 year olds who have life figured out. Neither of them have degrees but are pretty successful so they want me to get a degree so I don’t have to struggle in my early years like they did which I get but they don’t want to work with me at all when it’s me doing the work. They push all their expectations onto me with no warning and then get mad at me when I fail. I’m just so tired of not being treated like an adult. I’m not stupid, I’ll get my degree. I’m just trying to do it in the smartest way possible. 

They don’t seem to understand that. I don’t know how to talk to them and at this point I don’t even know if I want to. I turn 21 in 3 months and while I do still live with them I don’t think I really am obligated to tell them intimate details of my life. I have so many goals that they just laugh at or brush off as me dreaming even though I am actively and aggressively saving and working towards those goals. It hurts my feelings, them not believing in me. How do I talk to them about this? Do I even bother? What do I do? I need help. This is my life I’m talking about and I feel like they’ve already just given up on me.",16May2020,1
1014,"Recently, I went through a breakup. It's been a month and I came across this photo of one of my ex's celebrity crushes on my Instagram explore page and I just started sobbing because I didn't look like her. She is this gorgeous, curvy girl. It's the general blueprint for what his other celebrity crushes look like. I realized I could never achieve that standard of beauty that most men seemed to desire. I'm a flat chested, small Asian girl.. That's never gonna happen for me unless surgery comes into the picture. I don't know why I still care so much and why I hold myself under his standards still. I thought I was doing better because I was having healthier eating habits and that I was happy, but then I just started sobbing at this picture of my ex's celebrity crush. 

I then just cried about everything going on. I realized that I've never once felt okay or accepted myself. I've always been so insecure and have always taken action about things because of things people have told me.. I've always put myself under other people's standards and I don't know how to get out of that mindset because all I want is just to be good enough. In fact, this was one of the issues that caused us to breakup with me constantly needing validation and reassurance. So, I ended up tiring him out with this bullshit too.

Before I met my ex, I was obsessed with getting skinny to the point I was anorexic. I remembered following all these thinspo pages and I lost a bunch of weight, just because family members called me fatty when I was a child. When I met my ex, he made me feel better about myself and told me that it wasn't healthy to treat myself like this and that I'm not beautiful as a skeleton. I remembered comparing myself to his exes and his standard of beauty and I strived so hard to achieve that by eating more and working out and gaining weight. I did all that because I wanted to please someone. I don't know what it means to be happy in my own skin or what it means to feel secure or self fulfilled. I'm so sick and tired of feeling this way. I just wanna be okay with myself and I imagine normal people don't cry at pictures of pretty people because they've realized they can't ever look like that. What can I do? How do I overcome the feeling of being so insecure?",16May2020,1
1015,"I (25m) just broke it off with a female (22)  I was close to because I was not ready for commitment. I’ve had pretty rough relationships in the past that have caused me trauma and commitment issues. She wants me to meet her parents and be her boyfriend but I’m terrified to go that far and it hurts her deeply. Basically I am scared to be hurt again which causes me to move slow and run from all my problems. I know it hurts her for me to leave but I feel as if she is better off without me. She is a great woman who does not deserve a man like me. She does not understand now but I hope she will one day. Today I took a stand and faced myself in the mirror. I don’t want to waste anymore of her time, She deserves better. I am going to therapy next week to get help because I don’t want to live the rest of my life being afraid and alone. And more importantly I don’t want to hurt anyone else. But I need help with coping with this process. Can anyone give me words of encouragement. I feel pathetic and terrible for what I have done.",16May2020,1
1016,"I (F16) have a big problem. This guy we will call Travis (M18) cheated on his gf Malory (F17) with me and some other girls at my school and beyond the county. The girlfriend is highly religious and very unconfident. As far as I know, the cheating never got to like sexual things, but I'm very concerned. She speaks about spending her life with him.

Before he was in this relationship he dated a close friend of mine Jenny (F14) and tried to get her pregnant so she wouldn't leave him. Because Mal is from a different town and Jenny never spoke up about the bad treatment, Mal doesnt know what kind of guy he is. I uh ""hung out with"" Travis off and on for a year and that year overlapped with his and Mal's relationship by about 6 months. Bad decision on my part, I'm just as much in the wrong. But now I want to  tell her what's been going on before she gets any deeper. It's her first relationship for reference and she doesn't know who I am. 

This is my first post and I'm scatterbrained. I'd be more than happy to clear anything up if you guys have some advice. Thanks :/",16May2020,1
1017,"Im trying to get into drawing, but no matter how much i try to learn, i end up hating what i draw or just scraping it entirely. Any progress towards getting better at it is so small it feels like im not progressing at all.",16May2020,1
1018,"TLDR at the end of post.

Ever since I was younger, I've been extremely sensitive to criticism and light things that I've heard. My mom tried her best to help me alleviate my nerves, since I always took everything to heart even if it was just ""your shirt looks bad."" I always took silly jokes and pokes at me seriously. Due to this constantly happening, I became a people pleaser aiming to make others happy.

This spiraled out of control in my middle school years. Some events happened with my family, which turned the sensitivity into anxiety and possibly psychosis(?). In stressful situations, I'd shut down, with shorter range of breathing and the like. I wouldn't be able to get in touch with whats happening and my mind would create absurd scenarios of what could happen, or what a person thinks of me. I've developed ways to cope with this. Sometimes I'd single myself off to look at the things around me, or I'd count my breaths to bring myself back.

But, I still suffer from these thoughts. With my eagerness to please, I always snowball from being fine to crying and breaking down. When I'm first ""criticized"" I become nervous, with the second I can't focus and I'm unable to really function and then with the third, I'm making things worse. An example of this was when I was helping my mom cook. I've been helping her since I was younger and I have a memory of everything in the kitchen. She was already angry from something that happened that day, so I wanted to help. I took out the wrong spice, and she got upset and said I was stupid for not knowing something since I was a kid. This upset me, so I freaked out trying to get all the right things out. I kept messing up since I couldn't think and she was angry. I cried in the bathroom after this happened.

Another example was when I was playing League of Legends with my boyfriend. I kept messing up and he was already mad at someone , so I wanted to make him feel better. But I was more of a hindrance to our team. He kept suggesting things, but he sounded really patronizing so I took him seriously. In the end, I cried because I shut down from the ""flame"" I was getting. But it was really silly to get upset over, in my opinion.

I'm 17 and going to college soon. I really want to at least learn to deal with this, or get rid of it. I really can't have these things getting in the way of my experiences. All advice is appreciated.

TLDR: I have anxiety and am extremely sensitive to the smallest things. It has developed to the point that when I'm breaking down, everything said to me snowballs and I end up crying over really silly and stupid things.",16May2020,1
