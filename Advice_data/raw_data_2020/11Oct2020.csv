I have a really good friend and I really love her but I just dont know what to do anymore I wrote a text to let my feelings out.




Everything i do is wrong 

Why are you even want to be friends with me 

It doesn't matter what I say it's wrong 

It doesn't matter what I do it's wrong 

How am i supposed to change to a good friend 

If i don't even know what is right 

I can't do nothing 

It really hurts 

And I dont know what to do 

Please just tell me what to do 

Tell me how to act 

Tell me what I'm supposed to say or do

Please I'm begging you 

I really like you

I really want to be friends with you

But I have the feeling I'm a bad influence 

I'm just hurting you 

So if you are unhappy with our friendship 

Please tell me 

If you don't want to be friends anymore I can totally understand that 

It would break my heart

But if it would make you happier I would do it becuase you deserve it 

I just want you to be happy.


Should I show her the text or should I keep it to myself because I have the feeling she would just get angry or sad if I showed her the text

7,"All of us are 13-14

Backstory: friend 1(we'll call him john) told me over the summer that he was raped in school. Friend 2(we'll  call him sam) have been friends longer than me and John.

John mentioned that he was raped and I had forgot. Later I was talking about the discussion with Sam (john was very open with telling people if they asked or he was reminded then he would say it and I thought Sam knew)and when I mentioned the text he said it was that he didn't know about john being raped and then said john was faking it because he hadn't told him and sam had been best friends and remained in very close contact with john and John never said that. His proof that john told him everything was that he had told him he was bi ( which john didn't hide BTW) and I didnt ask if he knew john was planning on going through transgender surgery sometime soon or that john was asexual which as far as I know he didn't tell everyone. I've been avoiding sam and haven't told john. 

What should I do?",11Oct2020,1

9,"Hi!

I work at a oil change shop. All co workers are males, I’m one of two females. My manager just told me (I’m pretty small/petite)  that I should start lifting weights so I can help out with the job more. I think it bugs him that I can’t carry a tire fast enough. I know I can do it, I just need more practice/time. He said that my female co-worker who is a LOT bigger than me can do. He said she’s strong for a girl so you can do it too.

I’m not really sure how to go about this, all I know is I feel really shitty for being small. I’ve been trying to gain weight genuinely for months and it’s difficult for me. I try and eat a lot but that’s also a lot of money sometimes. I’ve done my research to gain weight. I just feel shitty that was said by my manager.

I was thinking of telling the assistant manager about it but idk. I’m overwhelmed. I am literally thinking of quitting :( Thanks for reading.",11Oct2020,1
10,"I've been with my girlfriend (same sex couple) for about a year and a half. Our relationship has been incredible but at times I haven't understood what we officially are. We show affection and love eachother but we never really show that we are in a relationship. There are things that couples normally do, that we don't do. I don't think we are even 100% sure of our sexuality. We are very codependent when it comes to the relationship side of things. We now have an apartment, and we love it so much. But we have rushed so far into things and I don't even see a future. I don't see us getting married. I know I want kids, but I don't see her raising kids with me. I'm so confused because I love her with all my heart and I love having a romantic connection with her, but at times I feel like we just say we are in a relationship because we are romantic. 

I know this is a lot. I'm sorry.

The thing is, I love her as a friend. We are so deeply connected and we always have been. There is not one ounce of me that wants her out of my life. I actually finally brought this up to her, and she is on the same page. She feels that she has been confused about our status too, and we have mutually agreed that we don't see a future. Its just hard because we are very romantically connected in our private life, but in the outside world we tell people we are friends. We are so close but I have just always been confused about what we are.

I know that some people don't like to put a label on things. I used to be that way. But recently I've been thinking about my future. I don't see her as my lifelong partner, but I see her as a forever friend/connection. I don't want us to keep calling this a relationship if we both know it isn't going anywhere. The issue now is that we have been agreeing on all of this but we don't know how to act around eachother. We still say I love you and kiss but there's this weird feeling I have where I keep asking myself what I'm doing. I know we aren't soulmates in a romantic way. We've talked about how we are kind of friends with benefits, but also something about that is confusing. 

This is the most confusing situation ever, I know. I just need some sort of advice on how to possibly navigate this. I feel like I have to let go of the romantic side of things but I never want her out of my life.",11Oct2020,1
11,"I recently got roped in to an awfully overpriced car loan that I can't afford (you can read about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/j8nzy9/ive_been_crying_for_the_last_4_hours_after/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)). I'm panicking and have no idea how to get out of it.

Basically, I'm a naive first time buyer. A $4,000 warranty was tacked on without my knowledge. I (very stupidly) thought the warranty was a compliment of the lender that I wasn't paying anything for. The finance guy did his best to make sure I was as under-informed as possible. It was added in to the principle of the loan which means I'll be paying interest on that every year. The total amount paid at the end of the term will be $22,000 on a used vehicle valued at $14,500 that I already put $6,000 down on. That is a number I absolutely can not afford, even at $200 for 72 months (again, please read the other post I linked for full context. I sound very, very stupid. Because I am. It may also contain answers to questions you have after reading this post).

How do I get out of this? My understanding of refinancing a car loan is simply getting a loan from another lender at a better rate, using that payout to pay off the previous lender, and then repaying the 2nd lender with the new rates agreed upon. If that's the case, I'm fucked and can't get out of the final number of $22,000. 

The warranty agreement that I was given DOES say its cancelable in the fine print and ill be going down to the dealer this week to discuss that. But I'm afraid because it was included in the finance amount, I won't be able to cancel it. Its also worth noting that I am becoming increasingly suspicious of the possibility that my signature was forged on the warranty agreement but have no way of verifying that or really any recourse if they don't admit to it.

Please, I need help. My main question: how can I refinance/cancel that warranty so I am only financing the remaining $8,700 on the car plus interest? Please tell me its possible.",11Oct2020,1
12,"So I work for a company that requires you to pass several certifications. My training class is on the final one. And they said the goal was to certify us by the end of the week (4 days away at the time , 3 now) First the guy got certified but he had past experience so no surprise .

The girl in my training gets along great with everyone , everyone I work with is her age tho (30+) and I’m 18 , so I’m already always kinda fighting for my spot. She however still receives help on everything, and I very rarely get it and mostly have to ask for it , at which point other people tend to take over , and when we get busy they asked me to just go help the next customer instead of stay and learn , the other girl pretty much always gets to stay by someone’s side. 

Anyways , she got told day before yesterday she was getting certified , the other employees are the ones who officially report so that the manager can make a decision , obviously they like her , they all said she’s great and congratulated her that she was getting certified ... when she’s getting help on stuff I do on my own ... overall I felt like we aren’t getting ahead based on our work but rather who likes us which was a sad realization .

This is where I fucked up tho, I was really upset because I’ve been working really hard at this and trying to follow everything I’m told and actually feel like I’m doing well but Nobody had mentioned me getting certified , my schedule had 4 days missing while she had one , and the guy seemed unfazed by me asking if he did since he already officially had his job .., so I pretty much thought I was getting fired even tho I was doing the work the same selling just as much without help etc. 

There were customers in the store , loud ,ignorant , swearing customers , but still customers . I asked the girl if she was certified and she said yeah my manager (who she carpools with) told me They were going to certify me today .. I said oh I guess I have to talk to the manager with an attitude ... and then proceeded to ask the assistant manager and another employee what it is that I wasn’t doing and why I wasn’t being certified when I know I’m not doing worse than everyone ? With an attitude ... they obviously pretty much just shrugged me off 

I got in trouble for it the next morning for causing a scene with customers , but also certified ? He apologized for the lack of communication but also chewed me out and kinda told me I was lucky I wasn’t in more trouble .. but now Im completely pretty much alienated from everyone ? And I hate coming to the job I used to love ... I don’t know what to do at this point so .. advice ... 

(Also worth mentioning this isn’t my permit location but boy training partner will be at my permit location and my permanent location manger was contacted by current manager location to tell him about it ... I feel like they’re making it seem really bad like I was yelling or something but idk , I’m so stressed and it sucks so bad :/ )",11Oct2020,1

I sent my friends a picture of me in a giant inflatable costume and Emma's (let's call her that) response was all about how it's not safe to do Halloween this year. My mother is a doctor herself and even she approved it safe enough to wear outside as needed (it's a giant 6-ft inflatable costume - there's nothing more quarantine proof than that!) and was excited for me to wear it on Halloween just to walk around outside. Not to mention

I know this situation seems childish but it isn't the first time. I was really really excited to see my friend's response to the costume but I just felt down seeing's Emma response. I also felt as if she was looking down on me as too ""stupid"" to not realize the situation. Of course it's not safe to do Halloween this year - the cases are going up here in my area!

I’m probably overthinking this but I had an interview with a school club today for an executive committee position.

17,"Its hard to describe my predicament in the title but I (23F) love smoking weed. Eventually it started becoming a daily thing, before and after work, and if i have the day off im smoking easily 5-6+ times. I hate how its become more of a habit for me, and now my tolerance is through the roof. Sometimes i catch myself lighting a blunt for the sake of doing something. Ive been on a high’atus for about a week now and im not scratching my arms bloody or anything, im just confused on how i want to move forward. I love smoking and being high by myself, and its honestly not something I want to give up for good. But i do want to limit my consumption of it drastically, at least break the actual habit part of smoking. 

Ideally, i thought maybe save it for my days off, but theres the risk of over consuming in one day. My willpower is pretty shitty so i can see myself burning (literally) through an eighth in 2 days. 

Ive been told to limit it to only smoking socially, but i much much MUCH rather smoking alone than in a cyph.. 

I dont care for going cold turkey, either. I know im going to smoke one day or another, the question is when and how should I go about not making it habitual. I want weed to be something i do for fun and not put myself in a position where i feel as though i need it to relax or to enjoy life. I have to learn to enjoy life sober as i do inebriated. 

Ive the next 4 days off, and im pretty sure my overwhelming desire to get high is going to be on my mind every single day so..

18,"I sent an application for this job on the first of October. I was called back that day. I thought it was really nice to have things move along so quickly. We scheduled an interview for the following Saturday, the 3rd. 

I arrived on time. I was made to wait approximately half an hour before I was interviewed. This was fine, a bit inconvenient, but it happens. 

The interview went well. He decided to consider me for another position entirely. I had applied for something more “behind the scenes”, but he said I would do better as the “face of the operation”. I was very flattered by this. He said that I “wowed” him, and that we would contact me the following Monday (at the latest) whether or not I got the job.

No call on Monday. Waited a few days because he mentioned having other interviews and being busy in general since it was the beginning of the month.

Called him and asked if a hiring decision had been made. He said he was glad I called and that he would call me back at 6pm with a final decision.

No call. 

Left him a voicemail the following morning (today).

I’m confused because every time I talk with this person he seems to be really encouraging. I don’t know if he has problems being punctual, or if he’s swamped, or what. I’m just not sure how to go forward.

19,"House is 150-200ft from one of those giant electric towers. Looks a bit [like this.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Pylon_ds.jpg/440px-Pylon_ds.jpg) I don't care what it looks like; I'm concerned about the possibility of cancer. I don't want to let fear make me throw away a  great home at a great price that I otherwise like. Trying to approach this logically.   

I bought [https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-GQ-Multi-Field-Electromagnetic-Radiation/dp/B07JGJ897T](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-GQ-Multi-Field-Electromagnetic-Radiation/dp/B07JGJ897T) on Amazon to measure the EMF pollution.  

It measures 3.7mG at the front of the house. 6.3mG at the back of the house. 9.8mG at the very back of the 20x20ft yard. 5.7mG in the master bedroom I would be staying in.  

According to [this chart](https://emfinfo.org/guidelines-exposure.html) and [this chart too](https://emfcaution.com/emf-radiation-measuring-units/), that's above the ""normal"" zone and is linked to slightly increased levels of childhood leukemia, but with no conclusive effect on adults. [This website](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/extremely-low-frequency-radiation.html) confirms these conclusions as well: linked to elevated levels of childhood leukemia but no known effect on adults. However, [this website](https://www.healthline.com/health/emf#research) has a link to [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935118301403) saying there was a small increase in leukemia in adults too for ""ever-high"" EMF exposure. I believe the house is in the ""medium"" range, not the ""ever-high"" range but I can't actually access the pdf to read the paper myself. Finally, [this site](https://emfcaution.com/emf-safe-distance-power-lines/) recommends being at least 700ft away to bring EMF levels to below 0.5mG or at least under 1.0mG.  

So, based on that last article, it seems I'm exposing myself more than I should at this new home, but according to all the other articles, there's not a lot of evidence it'll actually do me any harm. Maybe cause a slightly increased rate of leukemia, but friggin everything causes cancer these days. Even cell phones give off much, much higher levels of EMF throughout the day and we keep them in our pockets. I don't want to lose out on $650 of house inspections and waste a couple weeks to get my EMD deposit back, but I also don't want cancer which seems like a very unlikely possibility... Should I just go forward with this and buy the house or should I wait for another?",11Oct2020,1

Now that we're together again, I'm afraid of losing him. I know that he's busy, and introverted, and stressed, but it still hurts a bit when he leaves me on read and doesn't reply to the serious things I ask him. My friend tells me I should try talking to him about it, but I'm horrified of being like my terrible ex, who was so demanding and obsessive. I just want things to be okay between us. I want to be everything he needs, and I'm willing to sacrifice everything to make him happy. But that seems so wrong, too. He's very much an independent person, unforgiving when it comes to being himself. It's something I love and admire about him, and it makes me feel so selfish when I want to say that something feels off or wrong. He says he loves me, and I believe him, but I'm afraid he'll have second thoughts, especially if I come across as demanding and controlling as I feel I am. 
And I'm scared that since we're in an open relationship, he'll be taken away from me by a well-placed kiss or two. Although, then again, that'd happen anyway, open relationship or not. 
Fuck, I'm just struggling with everything. And it doesn't help that these past few weeks have been nightmarish, and I haven't slept with him in a while.

This is not the first time he did this to me though, so I'm not crushed like the first time, it's actually the second time this happened. Just out of nowhere he gets a girlfriend, and after I text him he tells me of an existing relationship. The first time I broke it off and told him I couldn't text him like normal because of his girlfriend and I cut him off.

30,"My story.

Hey everyone I’m a 21 ftm and this is my story.. my ex girlfriend and I broke up 2 years ago and got back together just this month. After our breakup I was diagnosed with BPD which made a ton of sense, I was manipulative, held her on a pedestal but didn’t treat her like it etc. i was a depressed 12 year old when i met her who wanted attention so desperately. We dated for 5 years. I also was dealing a lot with my sexuality at the time.. We were an “online couple” and I actually went on a date with a guy while we were together I felt super trapped within myself and I wanted to breakup with her but was scared. I told her the truth and that I was actually a girl (I always showed my face I just passed well). 

Well I was completely disgusted with myself and didn’t do that again, she forgave me and we stayed together. When she left me I was devastated but realize it was for the best for both of us as I didn’t deserve her. I came out to my amazing supportive family,  I went to therapy , i transitioned and have now been on Testosterone for a year and a half.  Well fast forward to now my older brother lives in her state, after a year with NC but the occasional Instagram checking we stumbled across eachother, I was in shock and so was she. She said my name and I actually teared up. We spoke for hours like friends, and we became friends for 6 months, I explained to her my diagnosis and she was with me. She saw the change in me. I didn’t expect us to get back together I just wanted her to know how sorry I was.. I almost killed myself a year ago due to the mistakes I’ve made.  


I care so much about her and I’m finally in a position where can I show her the care and love she deserves. But I’m also so angry at myself and it’s really messing with me and I feel myself pulling away.. but I know how much I’ve changed and that I’m not that idiot that I used to be.",11Oct2020,1
31,"I haven’t posted on reddit very much, and I am on mobile, sorry about the formatting! 
So I have a cousin(22f), “Abby” we have never been extremely close, but have always been rather similar and had similar shortcomings and experiences, although she seems to be in an insane situation right now. We started talking pretty much every day around September 15th for reference, talked maybe once a year before and she lives across the country. 
We started because I noticed her sharing some depressing stuff on Facebook, sent the stereotypical “there for you,cuz” message and went from there. She divulged her partner of 2 years has been cheating on her for 6 months, and she also hadn’t eaten in over 2 weeks because she was “sick” and shortly after (sept 20th) she was admitted to the hospital for around 8 days. Multiple tests were ran, nothing was wrong with her except for severe dehydration and stress. 
I get it. I’ve been in shitty relationships and thought they were the only one for me, I talked to Abby every day in the hospital and called her frequently, her partner visited her 2 times in 8 days and was texting their “lover” the entire visit and acting generally distant. 
I truly thought she was going to leave her, she owns their house, she has the car and the license, she has her family’s support and she can financially take care of the house, but here’s the kicker. She doesn’t think she can. I have tried and tried to give her any advice under the sun, I know her prolonged starvation illness is stress related and I have even sent care packages in the mail and sent multiple articles and local resources for her to look into as her doctors are not really coming up with any answers. 
It has now been almost a month and a half since she hasn’t eaten, every day she “tries” and throws up. She only drinks ginger ale, no water, and she has started passing out and getting random shakes. I know her body is giving out because of starvation. Her partner is doing nothing and is just using her for rides to work and a free place to cheat on her. It hurts my heart. Is there anything I can do? Should I even keep trying? This is becoming mentally draining on me talking to her every day and hearing the exact same story, she refuses to go to the hospital again or a walk-in, I am worried I will have to end up calling a crisis intervention or something. 
Thanks for the incoming advice. I am not looking for medical advice. Just looking on how to deal with this situation maybe.",11Oct2020,1

34,"My parents are highly religious and are planning to leave the U.S in order to get away from a “war that’s about to happen against their religion.” They say they won’t be able to buy, eat , or do much very soon, so they’re planning to go back to their home country.

I, a 19 year old lady, who is not so religious, responded with: “no, I’m in college and I have a life here, so I won’t be going anywhere.” 

However, I don’t have enough money for such a sudden emergency in my savings account. As of now I have: $700 in there. I’m currently making a plan on how to sustain myself with them gone, but advice would be greatly appreciated. 

These are the things I’m most concerned with at the moment:

-Where will I live?
I could ask some other family members, but they have issues of their own. And I don’t want to intrude.
I could try to go for an apartment or pay the rent in a house, but I don’t have enough money as of now. 

-How will I pay for my car?
My parents bought me a car about 2 years ago and since they won’t be here anymore, I’d be responsible for paying it..

-How will I pay for health Insurance, and other insurance?

-Should I go to College next semester , or should I take the whole year next year to work and save up money?
 I receive money from College because of the scholarships and grants I have. But it’s not nearly enough to sustain myself. 

-How do I help my sister?
She’s still a minor but she doesn’t want to go with them, because she has school as well. the place my mom and dad want to go don’t nearly have as much opportunities for education. My parents say it’s worth dropping everything for God, but I disagree. Do I adopt her? I can’t just do nothing...

The problem is that while I think I am in love with my boyfriend, we tried living together and that didn’t work -I haven’t stopped thinking about this other guy.

I also regularly check this guys social media too which I understand is really bad behaviour. I just miss him. Can I be in love with two people? What do I do?

39,"Yf-young friend.   Fc-friends cousin

I have a friend (here on yf). I first found out about the abuse on an online game( you can make servers and only allow certain people on) when her cousin (fc) came on all panicked saying yf’s brother had pushed her off of a 2 meter bunk bed and she was unconscious fc starts saying her front teeth are missing and her arm is twisted. Some time passes and she’s been to the hospital, yf has a sprained nose,broken arm and her front teeth have been knocked out eventually yf comes online saying everything hurts and her brothers horrible. We think her brother is just an a-hole . The next day yf comes online and is crying her parents are out of the house and she’s alone with her older brother and baby brother. Older brother has been told to look after baby brother but being the ah he is he tries to make yf do it. Not wanting to ,older brother punches her in her sprained nose putting her in emence (can’t spell that word :/) pain. Soon after telling us this her parents have come home and punished her brother , now we think her brother is abusive and her parents are loving ,boy are we wrong. A few days pass and fc comes online telling us yf is in a bad way telling us she will be on soon when she does we are told her parents have beat her for yelling at her older brother who tried to hit her again. When she told us this she completely broke down and told us everything her parents do hitting and whipping her for the littlest thing she does and break her electronics in her face as well as allowing her brother to hit and verbally abuse her -the only reason they punished him for pushing her off a bunk bed was because they had to take her to the hospital. She’s been getting really suicidal and depressed which isn’t good to have at her age. I started to suggest ways she could get out of it like trying to video every little fight or argument they have and gather evidence to take to the police - won’t work parents go through her devices and if they find anything they break it. I suggested that fc videos what happens secretly since fc lives with yf - that won’t work since yf’s mum watches fc like a hawk during fights since she tries to help her. I need advice on how to help yf and get her away from her family since they are abusive but I can’t really make good suggestions since she lives in America and I in England and the law systems being different makes things difficult

Within the first hour of my shift I was crippled with lower back pain which I treated with ibuprofen and a hot bath, which relieved my pain entirely.

46,"So I have this friend who is suuuper nice. Let's call her Jane. We never really talked too much in high school but during the pandemic, we've gotten somewhat familiar and chat regularly since she's taking a gap semester due to stress from the whole situation, which is understandable. 

We and a group of friends (who I'm closer with honestly) hang out from time to time, and when we do, it comes down to me as the driver. My super nice friend Jane knows how to drive, and owns a car, and has insurance, but bless her fragile, delicate heart, will not drive on highways because she's too scared. On local roads, she's still pretty scared. So, she generally asks me for rides. 

I give her and the others (excluding one in the group who does drive, yet she lives far away) rides whenever we hang out. I do it really without complaints, and she offers to pay for gas most of the time (especially recently since it's been growing more and more consistent). 

However, sometimes I do have to go out of my way to pick her up, and that often adds to the time it takes to reach certain destinations, sometimes doubling it for me. We're planning another outing for a hiking location and it's at least 40 minutes away from my house. 

Up until today, no word about needing a ride has come up. But this evening, only when I prompted ""Are we all driving there separately"" did she even ask for a ride, almost like she was assuming it was the case. She offered split gas costs. I checked the location, and the hiking place is East where I live, while Jane lives 15 minutes West of my house. I'd have to leave my house 30 minutes earlier than everyone else just to drive to her place, pick her up, double back to my direction again, and finally be on the way to the hiking place.

I don't know if I even want to go anymore since if I say no, it'll seem rude because we're all going anyway. Plus she's offered to split for gas and she said she's ""willing to go earlier"" as if that makes my job easier. Should I say no and say I'm just to busy with work to even come? But I also want to go and hang out. Like I said, I'm closer with the people in the group apart from her, so I also feel guilty knowing that if it was anyone else asking, I'd probably wouldn't be as deterred from giving them a ride, since it isn't tHAt terrible. It's just Jane.",11Oct2020,1

His mom is lazy and lives in a tiny apartment with her husband, his adult daughter, their son, and my cousin and like 3 cats. It's a cramped disgusting mess.
My cousin suffers from depression and has contemplated suicide before. He doesn't have anything to do; no sports, no clubs, nothing. Anything he ever gets is used to control him and is eventually taken away.

52,"I'm kind of cringing at the thought of writing this, but oh well, it's whatever at this point despite the fact I'm probably going to continue to feel the same way. I've been having this problem for awhile now... Specifically since July 2020 or early early August 2020. No one really knows about this because it's something I don't really talk about publicly because I don't like to be too vulnerable but let me get straight to the point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hispanic, and I guess I've never really identified as that because I still live in Latin America, but I do wanna go live in the US when I'm like 18... And ever since I was young, I've sort of tried to distance myself from my identity. I remember any time I went to the US on vacation or a trip I would speak english and english only and try to tell my parents to do the same to try and pass as your regular every day American. Regardless, recently I don't know what happened but I guess I started looking into the culture more especially when teachers tell me I'm a little darker when my entire life I've been identifying as white but in reality most people tell me I look to be more mixed and that's created a whole racial identity issue conflict in me in itself. Usually it isn't much of an issue because where I live I'm pretty light, but apparently not white. Also, I can't help but feel that latino culture, while beautiful, is just a knock-off version of black culture which I love so much. Like there's just something so beautiful to me about black culture and something that makes it very unique and I just feel like hispanic culture in the US is turning into a knock off version of it and I guess it makes me feel guilty and I just wish I didn't have to deal with this in general. There are so many issues within the community like the erasure of black and indigenous people and I kinda just wish I was born as a regular American and just not be hispanic to not have to deal with these issues... Especially when you have so many people in the community chiming into it and having them tell us their thoughts and I just don't know. Everything I see reinforces my thoughts, especially after I saw someone on Twitter say the same thing. It's weird and I wish I could run away from it but I really don't know why I'm having identity issues, like I legit don't get it.",11Oct2020,1

She had trust issues because of past stuff and well I have never been the type to cheat or even really go after other women when I'm with someone. The beginning of the talking stage already started off rocky with her still talking to an ex and not really sure about me. We kept going on dates and after a good 3 months, we started dating. She always had trust issues about everything, where I was if I was talking to anyone and frankly, I was very patient in the beginning. I would always answer the questions calmly and always reassure her of my feelings towards her. I really did like her, dare I say I was in love.   
Fast forward to 5 months into it, she had kept blowing up on me, accusing me of cheating or talking to my ex (I had not spoken to her in about a year) and just hanging out with other girls. She was sad about family issues and told me she was depressed. I obviously always sided with her as she was in her right mind compared to the family (whole other story). The blow-ups consisted of name-calling and just overall some pretty nasty stuff said to me. I never really took it too personally and instead just wanted to stop talking so that in the morning she could be in her right mind set and apologize which usually did happen.   
So the mistake all started when my phone started to blow up while I was with a friend of mine, a man, and I could not answer. A barrage of messages accusing a photo I had posted last year, of being liked by my ex gf recently. I was sure it was not liked recently, I would have remembered something like this. I told her of course not and tried to reassure her, but it was too late. She told her mother and father, her roommates and it was over. She said some pretty nasty stuff again so I too thought it was best to end it. So we continued talking and I kept reassuring her no, again I felt and feel like I love this person, hard to cut off communication for myself and her. Either way in my head and hers it was over because she had told her family and friends, which I did as well.   
Now for the mistake. About 2 days from the accusation, I messaged my ex. I asked her if she really did do this because it caused an issue and I would like to know if I missed something. She stated no and that she was sorry about all that. Which was not her fault. We spoke for about 10 minutes, just asking how everything was and I made the mistake of asking her to meet and talk in person.  
The next day I and Dana decided to talk. She said she had cleared things with her family and that she had made a mistake. So yes we decided to try again. Yet I left out that detail of what had transpired the past two days. So I called my ex gf and told her that I was sorry for initially contacting her and that It was a mistake and disrespectful of me to invite her to talk and meet in person. We said our goodbyes and that was the end of it. I never disclosed this to Dana as either it would always be there and she would always be paranoid, and in those blow-ups, there were sometimes threats of suicidal thoughts. So in this instance, I left it out, no excuses though, I do see that it is selfish.   
Skip to the present day. Dana asked me about a situation in the past. She asked if when I got a haircut (i rarely cut my hair) if I went out with someone, insinuating that I got a haircut to hang out with a girl or something. Obviously, I said no but the questions continued to pour in about my past, about if I had been talking to other girls, about if I was having sex with others. I kept saying no. Note that this would happen every other night, from about 2 months into the relationship so I was fed up with having to answer the same questions. The questions would not stop until 12 am. The next morning she threatened to message my ex gf. And I told her to not do it. She kept threatening me that she was going to do it and I immediately just told her it was over as I was just tired of the drama. I called my ex gf and told her I was sorry for contacting her but that she would possibly be getting a message and that was it. Dana then sent me emails (I had blocked her on all platforms) that she was on her way to my house. I did not want that drama in my neighborhood so instead, we met halfway. We talked and I told her to trust me and to just try to make this work. We agreed.  
At night we spoke and she told me she had messaged my ex gf. So I came clean and told her everything about the messages, and how I invited her out and I canceled.. Understandably she was hurt and told me she was right all along and how I cheated. While I understand I screwed up part of me wants to think that the lack of trust just hurt me. The break up that time made me angry and sad and I just wanted to talk to someone (i don't talk to my friends about stuff like this because I don't want to make her look bad). I realize my mistake. It's hard to justify. My intention was not to get back with that ex. But that's my story. Any advice or words of wisdom would be nice. Thank you for reading.",11Oct2020,1
60,"To the people who will probably try to say ""move out"" -- my mom lives **with me**, not the other way around. I pay all of the bills and she doesn't have enough money to even pay one.

My mom has a variety of physical and mental disabilities that make it difficult for her to take care of herself fully. She doesn't need help going to the bathroom or anything like that, but can't really cook or clean, so it wouldn't be very feasible for her to take care of herself. I'm a software engineer who just graduated from college, so while I can afford to take care of her, I definitely can't afford to (&amp; probably wouldn't have time to) maintain separate houses for her and me.

The image I present to her is generally an innocent, loving son who is asexual, highly religious, and not interested in drugs, alcohol, relationships, or anything remotely ""adult."" We don't talk much and I spend 95% of my time in a different room than her, and the other 5% is usually doing something for her or occasionally just talking. My real self is not like this, as you might've guessed -- I'm gay, an atheist, and pretty open minded when it comes to things like weed or drinking (but I'll admit I wouldn't want to become a habitual user of any substance). The reasons I present a different identity to her include:

* I don't want her knowing I'm gay, and then having her talk about guys to me. ""Do you think that guy is hot?"" - not something I ever want to hear from my mom
* My sister has a ton of mental disorders and is just... a complete mess, and any time I begin to even remotely indicate I might be doing something of an adult nature, my mom starts worrying that I'll basically turn into her (I had this worry as a kid as well, I don't think it's completely unwarranted)
* I just don't really feel like it's appropriate for my mom to know these things about me. What's the point of her knowing my real self when it's just qualities she hates? I feel it will just make the end of her life more depressing. Plus, no one wants their parents to know when they've gone out drinking or whatever else, it's just awkward.

I don't even really want to date or be in a relationship or anything like that, but it makes any ""adult fun"" thing like hookups or drinking or staying overnight with someone else so hard to do because my mom is always nosy about where I've been. With COVID I don't do these things as much anymore, but eventually I'd like to have some actual fun on the weekends and sneaking out of the house like a teenager seems like a ridiculous solution. I could just lie constantly and say I'm on business trips or something but that also seems kind of annoying. What would you do if you were in my situation? Again, ""moving out"" isn't an option since my mom lives in **my** place that I pay all the bills for -- she would be the one that would ""move out"" but that isn't really possible. Also, I'm not putting her in a nursing home just so that I can have sex once in a while, that's ridiculous.

tl;dr: I support my mom financially, but I keep most of my identity hidden from her because I feel like it would cause problems, but this causes different problems because then I can't really do anything ""adult"" without her probably finding out eventually. Is coming out to my mom **really** necessary? Is there an alternative solution besides her living by herself (since she can't afford it &amp; then I'd also have to manage two households) that I'm not thinking of? What would you do in this situation? etc.",11Oct2020,1

62,"For the past year I’d say, my friend has asked me to borrow money nonstop. It’s usually around $15-$20 a time, but it seems like over half of our conversations revolve around her asking for money. I always say yes because she usually always pays me back, but I’m just getting annoyed by it by now. First of all, she’s married and her and her husband have full-time jobs. I got laid off from my job during the pandemic, and she knows that. I have money saved up but it won’t last forever. 

She has lots of other friends that she’s close with, family members too, so why am I the only person she asks for money? Is it because she knows I won’t say no? I’ve been fine with it for the longest time but now it just feels like I’m being taken advantage of. 

This last time she asked me for $300, which I have no idea how she’s going to pay me that back since it seems like she never has a penny to her name. I lend her the money because she’s short on rent, and then I see her smoking on snapchat. I get that weed is not that expensive but c’mon, I know my money was used to buy it. I’m just annoyed. 

Is she taking advantage of me and what do I do about it? She’s been my good friend for over ten years, and I don’t have very many friends. I’m just lonely and it hurts when all she does is talk to me when she wants money.",11Oct2020,1

66,"So I \[F21\] started a class online this semester and it has been going pretty well, except for the fact that my professor kept mispronouncing my name. My name is pretty long, but easy to pronounce if you sound it out with regular english pronunciation.  At first it was no big deal, but I corrected him by saying ""Oh actually it's \[OP\] by the way"", which he ignored. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I decided to put a picture on my zoom profile because the professor mentioned that he'd like if students put a picture up. I just picked a regular picture of me with a wall in my house as the background. The next class after I put mine up, he takes roll and when he gets to me, he laughs and says ""OP \*mispronouncing my name\* you have an interesting picture up here"" and when I say I'm here he moves on past my name. He does this a few weeks later AGAIN while laughing and asks ""OP you have such an interesting picture? I just want to ask you where was this picture taken?"" I awkwardly answered ""uh my house"" and left it at that. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable after that and my boyfriend told me that maybe I should take the picture down to see what he says. 

Then this previous Thursday, I attended his office hours to ask him a question and he brings up my picture again after I had already removed it. He asks me if I ""klingified myself"" (like made myself look like a klingon lmao??????) and I said ""uh no it's just a regular picture of me and he kinda smiles to himself. He also takes it upon myself to ask my race because of my last name. 

At this point I'm at a loss of what to do. I don't have recordings of these incidents because it caught me off guard each time. The first two were in front of my entire class but he conveniently wasn't recording himself at those times, even when he normally records himself taking roll. No matter what I look like, I feel extremely uncomfortable with how he's treating me and quite frankly I'm creeped out that a much older man is so concerned with how I look, even if his comments are negative. I'm also scared that this guy might try and find a way to lower my grade, even though I currently have an A from the class' self-graded online quizzes. Please help.",11Oct2020,1
67,"So, I'm a 24 year old guy who's been struggling to get through college. I changed my major several times, and I am on my 6th and final year of school, doing what is supposed to be a 4 year program. I settled on accounting for my degree, because I never figured out what I really wanted to do, so I figured I would go for something practical.

The problem is that the upper level accounting courses have never really clicked with me, and my GPA has suffered for it. I find it hard to work up the motivation to study something that I've realized I don't really have the brain for, alongside the subject matter being incredibly dull.

I am working hard to finish this year as strong as I can so I can get my degree, but I'm not sure what to do.

72,"I'm a senior in high school. I just took the ACT today, and I'm not feeling too good about it. This feeling has been in me for a good number of months now.

Looking back on my last 3 years of high school, I realize that there were a lot of really good opportuntiies I missed, and areas where I could've done better than I actually did. I currently have a 3.8 GPA and a 1340 SAT score, but I feel as though I could've done better had I worked harder. What makes me feel even more shitty is the fact that I'm privileged. My aren't millionaires, but I live in a decent house , access to education, full access to the internet (obviously from this post), parents paying for college, food on the table, etc. I'm not some homeless kid playing with stones and sleeping on dirt.

It's easy for someone living in poverty to not be able to achieve much in school, because they don't have the same advantages as everyone else. My family are not poor, and considering the fact that I was born and brought up in US, a first world country, and with all the other things mentioned in the first paragraph, I could might as well consider myself rich compared to the rest of the world. But all this advantage, I wasn't able to get a perfect 1600 SAT score, a 4.2 or 4.3 GPA, and probably a good ACT score. I didn't play sports, or win any special achievements in any competitions. I didn't start a national movement, or start a nonprofit organization, or a business of some sort, or win any medals. I just have mundane extracurriculars like being in marching band for 2 years, 2 clubs, some volunteering, and a job.

Feel free to laugh or make fun, but I hate the idea of being a ""rich kid"", derived from the fact that I'm privileged compared to the rest of the world. My parents bought me a phone, a laptop, and a car, and I always get this feeling that it is rare because every other teen in the US has to work part time jobs to get these things themselves. I feel like wasted privilege, because all these things are given to me and yet I end up being a complete disappointment and a low-life underachiever. If my family was dirt poor, I could use the excuse that ""ohhh, well I don't have that advantage, so it's fine where I am now"". But I'm not, and I don't have any excuse to be where I am now in terms of failing in academics and having no special accomplishments.

I always get this weird thought that middle class/wealthy teens shouldn't be having conflicts and fights with parents, because of the privilege. And those teens fighting with their parents must mean they're spoiled brats, hence me, and the only group of teens who should be having fights with parents are the teens living in poverty, because of the lack of privilege there and plus that is where all the abuse and neglect and shit like that is.

I've also fought with my parents before, mostly about my grades. I felt that I was trying my best, but I was getting all B's and my parents were yelling at me because they wanted all A's. They wouldn't believe me when I tell them I'm seriously trying my hardest. I hated them for that. But looking back, I feel as though that having those arguments makes me a spoiled brat, because of all the nice things that they do for me, and the way that they show concern. They do that because they wants whats best for me. Everyone else at my school probably doesn't have this type of shit with their parents, because when your support system consists of family and friends, every interaction you have with them is supposed to be positive. Some people on reddit have also said that, that your parents are your biggest support, and therefore you shouldn't fight with them or keep secrets from them. Therefore, I must be spoiled, and therefore not only have I underachieved in both my academics and extracurriculars, I'm also a spoiled brat because I fought with my parents when I was supposed to get along with them.

74,"Hello. Just want to start by saying that I love this sub

I'm a 23 year old male living in Canada. I've been recently going through a difficult time deciding what I want to do in life. I should also say that I struggle with mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. 

Before I begin, I want to mention that University and College are different here in Canada. In University, you earn a degree and in College, you typically earn a Diploma. Anyways, I went to  University for two years and ended up transfering to College. My grades were fine, but I wanted a more hands on experience that College offered. I got a Diploma in Advertising and I am now realizing that I do not want to work in this field. I'm having a tough time realizing that I have now wasted two years at University and two years at College and I am now just deciding on what I want to do. I feel ashamed that it's taken me this long and sometimes I really feel behind in life. 

Moving on, I've always wanted to work in Security.Whether it be Mall security, condominiums or private. However, listening to the opinions of others (especially my parents), pushed me away from it. But now, I am planning to start my online training soon to prepare me for my Security Guard License Exam. What scares me the most is starting over again. People my age are now working in the fields that they've studied for and I'm just now about to start studying for mine. Money isn't a big issue for me as I am incredibly grateful to be supported throughout these times. I know the money isn't that great for entry level security work, but I do plan on moving up. I've always been a big believer of doing what will make you happy, money or not. Is that true? I mean I have no desire to work in Advertising anymore and an entry level job in Advertising isn't that much more money than an entry level job in Security. What I guess I am trying to say is that, how do I push forward without knowing that I'll be able to make a living working in Security? I struggle with self doubt and fear. I'm always scared to take risks and try new things. Things that ""normal"" people do everyday. 

Also, do you believe that a Diploma will set me apart from others looking for work in Security? I know you don't need a post-secondary education to work in Security, but I don't know if a Diploma in Advertising helps either. This is why I feel I have wasted so much time already. 

I believe I will be happy working in Security. I know that sometimes they get a bad rep, but I've always thought it to be an impactful job. I'd like some advice on how to move forward? 

Thank you all.",11Oct2020,1
75,"So I just had my first date with this girl I really like. It went really well and we were both talking about what we would do next time. After I walked her back, we stopped to say goodbye. We were both carrying a lot of stuff in our arms, so we went for like a hand hold/high five (instead of a traditional hug) that morphed into one of those bro hugs (bros lock hands and put one arm around each other).

I can’t stop worrying about if she thinks I am the most awkward dude now, or if she thinks I friend zoned her or whatever.

She also said something like “sorry I would hug you for real if I wasn’t carrying all this.” Am I just putting too much thought into this, do these things happen regularly?

76,"My mom was recently diagnosed with MS. When I found out I started saving money to give to her so she could use it to maybe do some renovations to her house or get a better wheelchair. There would be no strings attached and she could decide how to spend it. So far I have $800 saved and I'd like to give it to her when I reach $1500.

Recently however she left her job because of the current world situation and the government has stopped their financial aid for those affected. Her disease has progressed to the point where she is no longer able to work. She's having trouble applying for ei or disability. She has no money right now. There's no worry about her living situation and access to basic food but she'll have trouble paying her phone bill and buying the extra food and drinks she likes as she'll be dependent on my dad who is financially abusive. 

I was thinking about giving her the $800 now so that she can have some spending money.

Some other factors that can affect this decision:

1. I recently reduced my hours at work and my mom is worried about my finances. I'm not worried and the reduction was voluntary and I can always increase again. However, me giving her such a large sum of money may cause her to worry and feel guilty about taking money from me. So she'll likely reject the gift. 

2. My mom may be getting a settlement from her work in the next few years that could pay for renovations. There are also grants she could apply for to help with renovations and supplies. So she may not need the money I'd give her. 

3. It may take me another 5-6 months to save the other $700.

81,"tw // self harm, suicide, depression

I (20F) constantly feel an overwhelming guilt about what I have put my parents (55 &amp; 59) through growing up. I know a lot of it is just part of growing up but I know I caused them more stress than both my sisters (18 &amp; 16) combined. I can't stop thinking about it, which puts me in a really bad mental state. 

I had depression and anxiety from a young age. My mom found out I was self-harming when I was 12. She put me in therapy which I refused to go to after two sessions. I attempted suicide multiple times between the ages of 13-15. I still remember her face when she saw a cop car outside the house and ran in to check on me. At 16, I crashed my dads car. At 17, I ran away from home for a few weeks to which my dad told me my mom had cried every night when I was gone. At 18, I started drinking heavily and doing drugs, which lead me to being in the hospital with a hefty bill. At 19, I attempted suicide again and my mom had to pick me up from the emergency room. This is not all that has happened, but a few of the events that I feel the worst about. 

We are an upper middle class family. My parents put us in sports, took us on vacations, packed our lunches until we graduated, drove us almost an hour to school, and everything else loving parents do for their children. They never hit us, put us in unsafe situations, or even really grounded us (I got grounded once for 2 days when I was 16 for smoking weed). They have been supportive throughout my life and still, for the most part, financially support me as well. 

Throughout the years, I have told my parents that they never cared about me, that I wish I had never been born, that they were terrible parents, that they favored my sisters over me, that they made me feel worthless, among many other things. I know none of these things are true but I know my parents still hold it with them.

My mom had a rough childhood growing up. Her mom wasn't around and her dad was an alcoholic so I know she didn't have anyone to learn parenting from, despite that, she is still a great mom. My dad has had most of his family pass away at this point. I have constant anxiety about how much longer they will be around. I know my parents love me and did everything they possibly could for me, which makes me feel that much worse about it. I don't know if they forgave me for everything I've put them through, but at least they pretend to.

How do I stop feeling so guilty? Or do I deserve to feel guilty for what I've done? It's destroying my mental health and I can't even think about my parents without breaking down into tears. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

My mother only has a power of attorney over him but that only becomes good if he is unable to speak for himself and in front of strangers he is able to compose himself well enough and act like he's fine. He recently became more aware of the poa and wants her to remove it and is threatening her and wanting her to get rid of it. She wants to obtain guardianship but that will be difficult to get and even then how can she be guardian of someone like him is so difficult? 

I am looking for places that can take him and care for him cause he needs monitoring. Now with corona everything is so much more complicated. I also worry he may end up somewhere terrible as I've heard a lot of stories about these group homes, but its better than him ending up in the street someday. Honestly I don't want to live with my mother because we don't get along well. The only reason why I am willing to it is for her safety. I just feel desperate and don't know what to do.

84,"Please help. I went on a trip over a year ago on a 2 hr plane trip. When I arrived my right foot was a bit swollen. I ignored it for a while. Some months after, I went on a road tip with my friends which was 6 hours there and back. Now my left and right foot were swollen. I’ve been to the doctor many times. According to the doctors, my heart is fine, blood in my foot is flowing well, I’ve had echocardiogram of my waist and down, a blood test, I’ve had an mri, and I’ve had my heart monitored. I have no idea how it is swollen. My right foot is extremely tight while my left is soft and tender. My right foots toes are also very swollen while my left foots toes look fine.

TW: child-on-child-sexual-abuse, incest, child abuse

So. Hi! I, M(15), had been having dreams for YEARS in which my younger sibling F(12) would initiate sexual actions, and I’d be unable to do anything other than let it happen. When I’d wake up from these dreams, I’d be disgusted and guilty, and for a while I literally couldn’t touch my sister without feeling sick.

I’ve been seeing therapists on-and-off since I was 9 because of an abusive environment in my household. Said abuse lasted from ages 7-11, but after a lot of family therapy we’re in a good place (comparative to where we were before). When I was 12 and became sexually active, I noticed that I behaved like someone with sexual trauma, and swung from hyper-sexuality to sex repulsion at what seemed like a drop of a hat. I’m really only self-aware because of how long I’ve been in therapy.

In 9th grade health class, my teacher taught us about repression. Considering how large parts of my childhood are blank, I figured I had some of it going on, but didn’t dwell on it, because if I dwelled on every traumatic thing that happened to me, I’d have killed myself and my major depressive disorder already peaked in 6th grade. So, fast forward to December 2019, during my first ever finals week. It was a Friday, and I had my yoga (it’s an option for students with handicaps, and i have nerve damage in my achilles tendons that limits me to a wheelchair occasionally) and Spanish final. 

The dreams had been getting more frequent. My mom blames the cymbalta I started that month. In this dream, (TW again for more explicit COCSA), my sister held me down in a bathtub and sat on my face (that feels so gross to type out, I’ve never gone into detail about this before). I woke up, and remembered a time when this actually happened IRL, where she (6 years old) chased down me (8 at the time) and sat on my face in our parents room. This fucking shook me to my core, and I texted a friend who I’ve been friends with since elementary school. He confirmed with me that sometimes I’d come to class and tell him my sister had done something to me.

For some backstory here: My sister doesn’t have any specific memories before nine years old. It is 100% a trauma thing. She was very violent to me during the abuse period, in her words, “because i was expecting you to hurt me, so i hurt you first”. She’s very well-adjusted now, and we’re close. My reasoning, when it comes to this non consensual touching stuff, is that she wasn’t doing it for sexual pleasure and didn’t actually know what she was doing. Instead, she did it because she knew I didn’t want her to do it, and violent actions were normalized for her.

I went to school, sat through the yoga final having an inner meltdown, and then went to the nurses because I knew I’d do something bad if I wasn’t monitored. I told her a bit of what I’d realized, and she called the school resource officer. We talked. I calmed down, but was sent home and had to take my Spanish final over winter break (got a perfect score, so definitely for the best).

The issue now: My parents know the bare-bones of what happened. I lied to my mom when she asked if it was any of our family members, but to be fair, she was thinking of our male cousins. I know they want to know the full story, but they haven’t pushed. My sister, on the other hand, has no idea. If SHE heard the bare-bones, I know she’d be protective and want to know who did it. I’ve been compartmentalizing it. After all, it wasn’t sexual assault. She’s three years younger than me, and didn’t even know what sex was. But I do have sexual trauma from it, and sometimes, like tonight, it eats me up inside not to talk about it with them.

I haven’t really processed the non consensual sexual stuff, and I don’t think I can until I talk to someone in my family about it. But I know how my parents would react, or at least I think I do, and I’d like to avoid that denialist gaslighting shitshow. I don’t know what to do.

TLDR: I M(15) have sexual trauma from one of my direct family members. Said family would like to know more than just ‘Something nonconsensual happened to your son’. I can’t begin recovery until I talk with one of them about it. I don’t know what to do.",11Oct2020,1
87,"My dad is really fat. He is 5'10 and weighs almost 300 pounds. When he gets in the car, the whole car shakes violently. When he walks on the stairs, they creak, and I can see the steps bend under his weight. He has to buy really big, baggy, husky clothes, and his belly bulges out all the time. He breathes and chews really loud, and he has a fat face that looks like a potato. He has a ton of wrinkles all over his body, and he burps and farts non-stop. He never exercises, and he has really thick thighs.

And my dad also makes very little money. He has a job that pays less than $30K a year, yet my mom makes about $120,000 a year. She seriously needs to divorce him and marry a man who makes more money. Now before you tell me that the extra $25K or so helps, he spends all the money on himself. He has to buy really fat clothes to accommodate his gross body, and he also eats a bunch of unhealthy snacks and drinks a ton of beer and soda every day. He constantly rips his clothes because he has an extremely bulgy potbelly, he punches his chest violently when he gets mad, and he farts really aggressively and forcefully. He watches TV all the time, and he spends a ton of money on gym membership, even though he never goes to the gym.

He is extremely uncultured as well. He has no sense of table manners. He often comes to the dinner table wearing nothing but a pair of dirty boxer shorts. He puts his feet up on the table, and he eats with his bare hands. He thinks it's cool to fart and burp when he eats, and he tells potty jokes at the dinner table.

90,"I (23f) have a friend (22f) who I’ve made pretty quickly since I moved states. Really nice 21 year old. We got close pretty quick. Even having her come over every Saturday for dinner with my fiancé (22m)  and I. It was really nice. We even helped her get out of a relationship with a coke dealer. 

Well she started dating this guy from work who’s 11 years older than her. I personally don’t have a problem with that. However, we found out that he will smoke weed as he’s driving with his daughter in his car. Sometimes she’s with them to. Keep in mind he has a high profile car. Sporty car that cops love to pull over. I saw her get out of his car with an open drink in her hand. 

This set both of us off. My fiancé got a bit upset since he had friends who are cops and has personally seen pictures of the after math of such endangerment. And sadly kids are in the cars as well and get caught up. 

She tried to say “well that’s unfortunate, but it’s not like robbing a bank” that is true. But same with peeing in public. And you can still get arrested for it!

96,"He  compares me to ""normal people,"" claiming that I have diabetes, all because I said I wanted to only play 9 holes of golf because I hadn't eaten lunch yet, and knew I would get hungry. He makes me play all 18 holes anyways. Nearly halfway through, I get hungry. 

He told me that I shouldn't be hungry when I just ate breakfast. It had been an hour or two after I ate breakfast, and it was completely normal for me to get hungry at that time. Because of school, I would always eat breakfast, a pretty early lunch, and a late dinner, so I naturally got used to that meal schedule. I now get hungry for lunch only a few hours after breakfast, and don't get too hungry until late at night. 

Even though it's normal for me to eat 3 meals, my dad thinks that people should only need 2 meals a day, since he only eats 2 meals a day. He eats more than the serving sizes say, and then has lots of snacks in between. He's never hungry because he eats so much, and I'm only hungry because I don't eat a lot. 

He thinks that since my mom has diabetes, and I get hungry after eating breakfast, that I have diabetes too. My mom needs to eat so she can keep her blood sugar at a safe level so she doesn't die, I eat simply because I get hungry. He has told me that my mom is fat because she eats too much, and constantly tells me that I should lose some weight. 

I'm at a healthy weight, my mom spends most of  her time either working or trying to sleep, so she doesn't have too much time to worry about weight, and my dad is overweight. 

Whenever I try to tune out his voice (He never stops talking), he just yells at me, and complains that I never listen to him. The reason I don't listen to him is because he tells me old info, complains about other people, rambles, or destroys my self-esteem. If I get upset at what he's saying, he'll talk about how he's not picking on me, and I'm the one bullying him. He says that nobody listens to him, everyone always tells him he's wrong (he thinks he's always right), and they all think he's a bad guy. He throws a tantrum over the smallest things, and often takes matters into his own hands instead of reporting it to the police or just ignoring it. He's also pretty stubborn, so once he has an opinion--even if it's doesn't make sense--nobody can change his mind.",11Oct2020,1

Throwaway account so people i know irl don't find this.

So, background information. I'm a 17 year old girl and this is literally my last resort to decide whether or not i'm overreacting with my parents or if I'm in the right to escape. Please be as brutally honest as you want, I really need help.

Basically, I believe that my parents are mentally/emotionally abusive, not physically, which is why I'm so confused on this matter. Some examples I can give are like so..

\-My mother yelled at me and grounded me when I told her I wanted to go back to therapy, and said it was 'just an excuse' when I said that I stopped going last time because I felt awful about making them take me

\-both my parents calling me names and taunting me while we argue, or while they yell at me and I stay quiet. they call me things like 'Little Shit', 'Entitled Brat', 'Bitch', etc etc.

\-My father has never said he was proud of me, nor has given me positive feedback in little over 2 years.

\-When I showed them my report card, proud that I was passing, they thought I had somehow messed with it (i have no history of this), and said I should do better, and didn't let me be proud of it

\-My father likes to make me walk the dogs late at night, in an unsafe town/park if I forget to do it earlier in the day. There has been reports of attacks/stabbings/murder in my town due to the homeless population.

\-Ground me for one reason, and then say it was for an entirely other reason. EI Grounds me to 'help me take a break from tech' when she really just let her emotions out of control and grounded me cause she was mad

\-Never let me cry in front of them, nor express any emotion

\-Tell me to control my emotions when I just want to vent to them

\-My mom isn't letting me getting my own bank account

\-I do the same amount of chores as two people. which is most of the housework and a lot of the yardwork. I'm still in school.

The reasons i'm hesitating are....

\-When my mom isn't angry, shes nice to talk too, and listens to me

\-Me and my dad go donate blood together every 3 months

\-They're my parents, and they care about me

\-I have an allowance, and my mom lets me buy mostly whatever I want/need

\-I'm afraid to do something this huge

\-I don't know what will happen afterwards if I do

\-I'm grateful for all my parents do and give me

I have a place to stay, and i've talked with the people who are willing to take me in. My brother is a little supportive and has offered his home as well (He dropped out of high school and left when he was 17. he's doing well now). I don't have any plans to drop out of high school.

I don't know how long I can take my father nagging at me for things I don't need to do, and my mother not standing up for me. There's a lot more to add, like my mother yelling at me when I said I wanted to commit not-alive, and grounding me for a month. Either way knowing if i'm overreacting or not will definitely help me make this decision.",11Oct2020,1

102,"Hi!

I'm currently a grade 12 student hoping to become a Registered Nurse after high school. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 I'm doing online school for my ENTIRE grade 12 year so it's a bit difficult to understand concepts but I'm managing it really well. 

TBH , I'm a straight A student, I sometimes get high B's. I'm very hardworking and motivated. I'm a formed IB student who got A's in the IB program.

Anyways, for my first semester I'm taking English Studies 12, Biology 12/Anatomy and Physiology 12, and Chemistry 12.  This runs from September until January mid. I have tests for each unit, mid-term, final exam, and lot's of assignments and a project for each unit of each course. NOTE: I need to learn everything on my own.

For my second semester I'm taking Psychology 12, French 12, Social Justice 12, and Pre-Calculus 12. 

So for university requirements I need a mnium of B in English Studies 12, minimum of B in Biology 12/Anatomy and Physiology 12, and a minimum of B in math 12.

This is no problem for me to reach and I'm aiming for a higher than a ""B"" mark since the program is competitive to get into the better the grades, I will stand out during university applications.  

Anyways, I need advice on how to do really well in Biology 12. I'm currently at a 92% in Biology 12 and I will be writing my unit 2 test next week which I have been studying hard for. 

I sometimes get unmotivated and procrastinate because during online school I don't have any other people studying with me and my eyes hurt from being on my laptop for too long. I do take breaks in between. 

For Biology my teacher doesn't give any practice test question or anything so does anyone have a website where I can go to practice some questions before my test?

Any tips or advice would be much appreciated!

104,"Recently I have felt excluded from my friend group and I’m not sure why it’s happening. I have been friends with these guys for 10 years, from high school through to our early twenties. We will always talk regularly and hang out, and if someone is doing something fun - going to a movie, going to the beach, etc. - we will always post the invite to everyone in the group. Lately it seems like they’re organising to hang out and do stuff together without mentioning it to me, and I only find out later due to a story on social media. Everything we used to do as a group, or as much as a group as possible, it feels like I’m the one getting excluded lately. 

I have brought this up a little in the past to a couple of them that I’d like an invite if they do something. I was told that I’m always welcome to join, but I never receive any details about it, so how can I join, and then they organise something else that I don’t know about. I don’t think I’ve done anything to make this exclusion happen, as we still all talk in a group chat, and do occasionally all hang out together. But it’s like for every 1 time we hang out, there’s 4-5 times that some of them meet up and I’m not invited.

So.. my whole life. Ive felt inferior. I always feel like life is a competition between me and every other person on the earth. 
I want to be the prettiest. But I know I never will be.
I want to be the smartest. But I never will be. 
I want to be the most successful. But I never will be.
Every single thing good thing in my life that happens, I can't be happy about it unless I feel I'm doing better than someone else. 
And I cant be 100% happy for others when they accomplish something I wish I could. I can fake it and I do (because I AM happy for them, but the envy and anger seems more), pretty well. But I always walk away with this anger towards them. 
I just never feel good enough. And when I do feel good enough, I see someone else who is doing better and it makes me angry and bitter. And then everything I've accomplished seems meaningless. 
No one in my life knows I feel this way. I've never once before this post expressed these emotions to anyone (hence the throwaway).
But it seems to consume me so much. And I just cant take it anymore. 
I truly want to be happy for others. And I am happy for others. But that happiness for them is so quickly overtaken by anger and jealousy and envy, the happiness evaporates. I know I have alot that others would be envious of. But its never enough. It just never seems enough. 
I just feel like if I'm not #1, im last and I suck. 
It causes me so much anger and bitterness. And I continuously feel inferior, which leads to me feeling depressed and anxious. Which only makes me feel even more anger for those who are happy, secure and positive in themselves and life. 
It's like a never ending cycle. 
I just want to RELEASE these negative ass emotions I'm consistently feeling everytime I see a positive post on social media, have someone tell me good news, etc. 
Its SOO fucking hard to mask these emotions and I absolutely HATE myself for it. I tell myself I'm being a selfish, self centered, egocentric bitch who needs to get off her damn high horse. I beat myself up over these emotions so much. 
But its like a knee-jerk reaction. I can't stop myself. And I hate myself for it.

106,"I live in a very small town in a (mostly) quiet neighborhood that I have no intention leaving any time soon. I share my back fence line with a family that has what seems like a platoon of small children that evidently only live for the purpose of playing on the trampoline in their back yard. These kids spend hours on end playing and screaming so loudly that I can hear them from down the block. Today I timed it. They spent \*six hours\* on that trampoline screaming and crying and that's not even an especially high number. This is a nearly daily occurrence meaning that I spend a couple hours a day on average listening to these kids.   


It makes me like a bad person but I hate kids. Like, a lot. Not only does this make it tortuous just to try to have a nice, quiet evening (normally they're outside till or past nightfall) but it makes me very unsure of how I'm reacting to this situation. I know that I could be totally over reacting and this might just be a part of living in a neighborhood, but it's very unpleasant for me and anyone else in my home to the point I'm finding excuses to leave my house just to get away from the noise. With the current pandemic on that's gotten quite difficult to do. I also don't want to tell these parents that their kids should be less active and spend all their time inside, especially during the dwindling nice weather. I've tried mentioning it to the father of the household before when he came over to retrieve one of the many, many toys thrown into my yard. He didn't really seem to register it as a problem, so I'm thinking I may have to just knock on their door and be more direct.  


Would it be unreasonable of me to confront the parents and ask for them to manage their kids noise level? Do I just have to live with the constant, grating background noise of young children until either they or I move out?

We went out for drinks tonight with some people they knew and returned to the apartment late. My cousin’s girlfriend went to sleep and my cousin put on some YouTube videos. Then he started rubbing my leg a little and talking about how it was soft/shaved, and then he pulled at my arm so I was pulled down to lay beside him on the couch, basically in a spooning position. I was very nervous at this point and he commented on it, asking if I was nervous. I kind of gave a noncommittal answer and then said I was going to go to the guest room and sleep, but when I tried to get up, he grabbed my arm and kind of prevented me from leaving. I tried again, a little more forcefully, and was able to extract myself and go to my room (which, incidentally, does not have a lock).

I planned to stay here another three nights, and my train ticket isn’t until Wednesday (not exchangeable) and I have other things planned in the city. I don’t particularly want to cut my trip short. Part of me feels like it would be in my best interest, but I also don’t want to be dramatic, and I doubt that he will try anything again - although this was unexpected in itself, so anything is possible. My gut feeling says that this was a one-time thing and he won’t try anything again, since he didn’t do anything like follow me to my room. Plus, on the weekdays he’ll be more busy with work, so I’m  going to spend more time exploring the city alone

111,"I have a dilema on which job I should take: a medical assistant (MA) position or a lab assistant position. I want to be go to medical school (taking a gap year at the moment) so the MA position is absolutely a great opportunity to learn more about the medical field! But at the same time, idk if I’ll even get in so at that point I’d have to consider grad school (which I would go into industry after that) and get a job. So from that POV, the lab assistant position would be a better way to go since I would get experience working in a company. I just can’t decide. They both have the same pros and cons but I feel like the MA position has a slightly increased ‘pro’ bc it’s something I very much enjoy. But my head is telling me to take the more practical of the two choices (the lab assistant position). Can someone help me decide based on your experiences? Not asking for the ‘right answer’ but more of like a guide. Thanks!!

115,"My older brother(19) asked about what he was going to do for college when I brought up the conversation with my father about what university they want me to go to. Right now, my brother is enrolled in an academy for special circumstance students. It’s online due to corona.  As far as I know, we’ve never really discussed the idea with him about what he wants to do for a job, so I asked him and he said sort of stayed silent so I’m going to say for now that he doesn’t know. 

Just a little bit of info about him, he is, as I mentioned in the title, low functioning. He mainly has trouble with communicating with people and gets very frustrated when trying to comprehend certain ideas. He also seems to have more intense reactions towards feelings of stress or excitement (watching an action movie, thunderstorms, people around him getting excited or angry, etc.).
He loves school, in fact, he looks forward to it everyday, and is pretty up to tune when there is a schedule set in front of him. He LOVES cars. Helping and comforting people is something he seems to constantly do when he gets the chance. Just in general, he’s a pretty caring person when it comes to intention, even if he messes up sometimes. 

If there are any questions, I’d be willing to answer them to the best of my extent. I understand he might have teachers and consulars at his school that are probably helping him, but I still want to help him in some way.",11Oct2020,1

119,"My ex boyfriend just broke up with me about two weeks ago. We were together for 9 months. He lied and said that he ""needed space and time"" 2 weeks ago and had me under the impression that he might change his mind. He didn't. After he gave me the silent treatment for a week and a half, he proceeded to officially break up with me through TEXT this Tuesday. Obviously no one in this relationship is perfect, I had really bad anxiety throughout the whole relationship, trust issues and insecurities. But he was never able to emotionally connect with me and he also was not the most honest partner.

Anyways, I sought out his ex girlfriend through fb messenger for answers as to why he may have broken up with me so suddenly, because the way he broke up with me gave me no closure. His ex-girlfriend had no idea who I was when I sought her out on Facebook and she eagerly replied when I said I had questions about my ex. Let's call her Sophie. Sophie is now happily engaged to someone else and hasn't spoken to my ex in years, therefore had no reason to lie to me when I asked her about my ex. 

She proceeded to tell me that she ""bet he hurt me really bad"" and that she was ""sorry"" before I could even tell her that he broke up with me and hurt me. It's like she just knew. She also mentioned that if I was looking for anything nice for her to say about him, she unfortunately had nothing nice to say. I raised my eyebrows when I read that. She also said that he gave her years of trust issues that she is still trying to work through.

But here's what I found out from Sophie.. here's what my ex lied to me about. I asked him repeatedly if he had sex with a girl that we both knew.. lets call her Dana. I had even met Dana and she added me on fb. She was at his house once for a family party. He said that they had never had sex... turned out he lost his virginity to her. He said that he lost her virginity to a random girl in a different state when he was 13 years old... but he actually lost to Dana at 13 years old. We are 22 years old now. I also found out that the girl from out of state he had sex with was actually who he cheated on Sophie with... and he completely lied to me about this. Sophie also told me that he had an extreme porn addiction and has a fake Snapchat that he used for porn and to sexually talk to young kids on. This was all from age 14 to 18 in his life and they also were off on when he was 19. 

Remember, he broke up with me out of the blue through text. He was also very emotionally unavailable and never really opened up to me about who we truly felt about anything in the relationship. He claimed that he wanted to marry me and have a future with me and move in with me, yet pulled the plug so fast. I'm still upset about the sudden break up but at the same time I'm glad I sought out Sophie because I learned that he is a pathological liar and she also thinks he has multiple personalities and a mental illness. Let me also add that him and I were in a long distance relationship since the pandemic started.

With everything being said I found out about all of these things that he did when he was young-- but he completely lied to me about his past and didn't mention any of these things to me while we were together, especially when I asked about who he had first had sex with and his sexual history in general. He's also lied to me a couple times during the relationship, like one night he lied about going out when he actually did go out and I found out days later. He lied to my face about that and he probably lied to me about a lot of other things. 

Should I see these lies as a complete dealbreaker and not regret losing someone like him at all? 
Or do people make mistakes and I fucked up the whole relationship because of my trust issues and anxiety?


TL;DR: I found out my ex boyfriend completely lied to me about his past. He lied to me about who he's slept with and hid a porn addiction from me that I found out he had from me talking to his ex girlfriend after we broke up. He broke up with me out of the blue 2 weeks ago.. we were fighting that day and he pulled the plug. I did have major insecurities and trust issues, but mainly because of my past. We were just planning the future and our entire lives together days before. We were long distance ever since the pandemic. He lied to me a couple times during the relationship, and he never was emotionally available to me and hid things from me occasionally. His ex revealed to me several things about his (teenage) past that he lied to me about. He is 22 now, and certain habits don't change.

125,"I'm a first-generation college grad in my family, and despite their best efforts, my parents haven't provided sound advice in the past. My dad has worked the same job for about 30 years. No upward mobility. He likes it, and he's not a rock-the-boat-type-of-person. My mom has worked odd jobs and currently owns her own cleaning business. 

For context, I worked at the same job for just over two years. For the most part, I enjoyed it, though I experienced periods of burnout from time to time. (All within normal levels, I think.) I made the decision to return to school over the summer and began studying right away. I genuinely enjoy it and it's probably the only thing - at least right now - I light up talking about. 

Earlier this week, my employer unexpectedly placed me on unpaid leave. I used what networking skills I have and began to ask around for letters of recommendation. My academic advisor encouraged me to use it as an opportunity to position myself for the next step. It was something I had been considering, but I wasn't sure if I was qualified. Lots of swallowing my pride and praying I didn't look like a doofus occurred for a couple of days. 

A couple of days passed with no response and I felt a little discouraged. A recruiter from a local health network reached out to me on Wednesday and spoke with me. She moved me forward practically right away. Then another recruiter from a competing health network sent me a video interview request. I was invited in to complete an in-person interview with hospital #1, then invited for a final (phone) interview with hospital #2. I received verbal offers from both. Another company (#3) that I interviewed with two weeks again invited me in for a final interview, but basically extended a verbal offer. (After researching the company, this one is my last choice.)

Prior to this, a colleague of mine told me she was building her own business and wanted me to help recruit for her (as this was my most recent experience). I initially agreed, but this was back in August. The project had a few kinks and kept getting put on hold. I sort of gave up due to slow progress. She informed me this week that it would pick up after the election. 

After weighing the pros and cons of all, I'm a little stuck. I have to make sure my next move is something that sticks for a while. So here's what I have so far:

\#1: 

* Close to my house. Literally a five-minute drive from me. Free parking
* Hours aren't exactly what I was originally wanting, but I could still make them work (More of a mid-shift, not my favorite)
* Two job openings here - admin or more clinical. I didn't necessarily feel excited about admin work, but the more clinical position didn't seem too bad. Won't give any extra points on nursing school application
* Employer was hesitant to discuss pay in interview - not a red flag per se (a lot of companies do this), but something to keep my eye on
* Still, clicked with both managers right away. I could tell we have very similar communication styles and it's a smaller team atmosphere, which I love 

\#2:

* Not a terrible drive. About fifteen minutes away. Parking is not free (*whomp whomp*)
* Hours were what I was wanting originally, but it will require me to adjust my sleep schedule (this doesn't bother me at all - just something to note)
* Job would give me 5 extra points on my nursing school application 
* Employer and I seemed to click right away. She was very upfront about pay and training

\#3

* A 30-minute drive, which doesn't sound bad, but in a vert busy area of town that can be a nightmare to commute to/from
* Hours were what I was wanting originally. Position would allow me to use my Bachelor's Degree, but that wasn't necessarily that important to me (there's a reason I went back to school) 
* Company has some pretty crappy reviews online and the pay is bottom-tier in the industry. Employer and I didn't really click and he didn't really try to ""sell"" the job to me. Didn't know about health benefits or any incentives when asked. No extra points on nursing school application 

\#4

* Job is working from home. No commute, no need to worry about parking 
* Job is working from home. I don't get to be around other humans, something I've missed since our office moved to this format in March 
* I would be working for someone I know and trust. She is an old manager of mine. I know how she thinks and communicates, and I know she trusts me, too 
* Pay is about what I made in my most recent job, plus the opportunity to earn bonuses for hires 
* Job is not relevant to my current area of study and is in something I think I might be ready to get away from, but the thought of continuing to do my previous job doesn't completely repulse me either 

I know the job market is tough right now and I'm sure there are plenty of people that would like to have options, but it's actually a bit overwhelming for me. Despite interviewing for a living, I don't really know which option would make the most sense (though I am leaning toward one specific...) Just needing a bit of input.

128,"My ex and I have been on and off for the past year. I love him so much and he tells me he loves me too. But there is just so many factors that's making our relationship complicated. HE has so many red flags but I dont know why I keep taking him back. He has a baby and a crazy baby mama who seems to have full control over his life and his emotions. He gets affected by every single thing that the baby mama says and does and I hate it because I feel like he is not over her even though he keeps saying he is. I am a very understanding person, I feel like throughout the relationship I have been nothing but patient and accepting of him and his situation. I accepted everything that he was giving me because I wanted our relationship to work and I loved him. For example, when he is over the baby mama's place to spend time with the baby, he would tell me we could not text and I tried to be okay with that. When he was homeless for awhile, I got him a hotel and airbnb for a month and during that time he even brought his baby there WITH the baby mama because the baby mama said she would not allow the baby to stay with him unless she is with him. I told him I didnt like that but in the end that was what happened. AND MANY MORE SCENARIOS where things were just not right. The last time we broke up was 2 months ago, and I was done after that. Met a really good guy and actually healed somehow. BUT just two weeks ago, my ex came back saying he wants to fix everything and cried to me saying sorry. I let him do him and now he is really trying and giving me what I want. He seems really genuine and sorry for everything and he is doing his best to be better and right for me. I dont know what to do and what to believe. I love him but look at our history. What should I do?",11Oct2020,1
129,"So In sixth form I went to a boarding school and made some really close friends who I adore and lived with for 2 years so we are really close, one of whom i’ve been best friends with for years prior. I also met my (now ex) boyfriend at this school and we had a very up and down kind of chaotic but intense first love with each other which ended for good¿ when we left school.

When we split my friends all had a problem with me because they love my ex too, everyone does, he’s extremely likeable, but he was always so manipulative and unkind to me, a side no one else sees, he cheated, lied, emotionally abused and was generally shit to me tbh. When I was with him it was confirmed by police that I was raped when I was 15, it was never confirmed prior because my drink was spiked and i only had injuries but no memories or proof but cctv was found and I also discovered I had an STI from the rape (as me and my ex were both virgins at the start of the relationship, or so i thought i was). He left me the week I found this out, and told everyone that only I had the STI, despite both of us both going for treatment at the same time and me being there when the doctor said that they wouldn’t even be testing him because there was no point as it was so impossible for him not to have got it from me after a year of sleeping together. He went around telling everyone that only I had it and broke up with me supposedly because of unrelated things in the same week but we got bsck together until our final split at the end of school. 

When we split I felt like I was going crazy because no one saw what he was doing and how calculated he was with his actions, from the way he was with me to always staying just a little too tight with my friends for me to be able to ever say a bad word about him. My friends had so much sympathy for him after our split and for a while I kind of lost them but we rekindled things after a few months of me being alone and then going on  a holiday that we’d prebooked. 

6 - 8 months after leaving school my ex suddenly reappeared and wormed his way back into my life i’m ashamed to say, and he sold me the dream this time and i fell for it thinking he’d changed and wouldn’t treat me the same but ofc the emotional manipulations started again and he’d even make jokes about my friends choosing him so i jus felt trapped . When he went to uni in september we mutually split, with the intent on being friends but i’d known for a long time how awful he was and was so glad to finally split because he also wanted this when he went to uni, but not before (i did try during covid for reasons explained below as if the above isn’t enough). I was only staying because I was so scared of losing my girls again. 

Since being friends he’s been entirely shit to me. I told him i would give him space to go to uni and we probably shouldn’t speak much, he agreed (though said he would probably find it to hard bc i’m the one for him and he can’t imagine not speaking to me). He insisted I update him after my doctors appointments that were booked before he left but fell a few days into his move to uni and was seemingly involved and supportive of my october exams, telling me he would want updates and be checking in. After my doctors appointments I messaged him to let him know the results and about my upcoming surgery that I had been informed id need and he ignored me, it hurt but i assumed he was busy. 

My exams started and i didn’t hear a word of good luck, when I know he knew the dates, we had spoken about them a lot... and depsite his accommodation being in lockdown and him being in his flat all day with more than enough time to wish me luck. 

After this shitty behaviour as a ‘friend’ to me since he went to uni i sent him a nice but long message a few days ago (responding to him finally messaging me to tell me about his uni) saying that I didn’t feel i could be friends with him because of our history and and how he’d treated me since being friends and also during the relationship, I said that we weren’t on bad terms and i’d always be kind to him but that the way he treated me was not ok and he should learn from it, I said at the end that I’d always be here to talk but I didn’t really want to stay friends, which extended to the “catch up” he requested when he’s home at xmas which means sleeping together to him. 

For context about our recent relationship, he cheated on me a week before he went to uni, also during lockdown he ignored me entirely for 4 weeks with no way to get to him bc of covid, before reappearing again and apologising... and me eventually agreeing to stay w him until he went to uni, that was always the agreement or rather the one i was manipulated into, i realise I should have left a long time ago rather than hanging around for him on his terms so he could go to uni single. 

And now i’m in the same sort of predicament, don’t get me wrong I have a lot of friends who recognise his awful behaviour and are by my side 100% , some of which are still friends with him but have the perfect balance of separating the two... but my school girl friends, my boarders who i love more than anything think i’ve been so harsh, and over sensitive and that he hasn’t done anything wrong and once again i fear they’re going to be really angry at me for not wanting to be friends with him, because they all adore him so much. I don’t mind them being friends with him at all and have no problem being in group situations with him if that should arise but it hurts me that they don’t respect my decision or recognise the mental stress and manipulations he’s put me through. sometimes i wonder if he’s a sociopath, his true colours rarely come out to strangers/ friends, but i’ve seen it for so long and been petrified of him and what he can do to turn people against me for a long time. 

I don’t know what to do about my friends, what to say or how to feel when they flippantly make comments about me being harsh on him etc. I refuse to lose them as friends, they’re like sisters... but it hurts me so much. They’ve already said I should see him at christmas because I’d be silly not to catch up with him and he “just wants to see you because he cares about you” and they also don’t think it’s a problem if i sleep with him as they’ve made comments like “an xmas shag would be nice” ... But i just don’t want to do any of it, especially the shag. 

What can I say or do? I don’t want to bad mouth my ex I know that won’t work and I know it will get back to him and I wouldn’t want him to know I was saying he was manipulative etc behind his back because I know that doesn’t end well and depsite everything I never like to speak badly of people especially people who he is friends with because how he treats me isn’t anything to do with how he treats my friends.

But how do i even work around this? sometimes i feel crazy because of this manipulative web hes created but i know i’m not crazy, a few people have seen it and are so shocked by his behaviour and more shocked by everything i’ve done for him to make him happy.",11Oct2020,1

I didn’t really read it and tried sliding up on it but Instead I accidentally clicked on it, I know I shouldn’t have read through it but a certain text caught my eye “Are we still up for meeting? And does *insert Tíos name* already think you’re going to a church meeting?”.
I’ve been around my Tía all my life and I’ve never believed she would lie to my Tío but when I scrolled up a bit I saw really flirty texts, I was shocked and didn’t notice she was behind me, as she got out she grabbed the phone and pulled me into the other room, our conversation went as follows.

Tía - Did you read through the texts?

Me - Yes, is everything okay?

Tía - look you can’t tell *Tío* because I was planning on breaking it off tomorrow anyway, so please don’t say anything. We have kids to think about and you would just be ruining their lives if I left the picture because you told.

Me - Okay...

141,"This is going to be long. I guess I should give some background. I was 17 years old in this relationship about 2 years ago and we were together for about 10 months. Basically i smoked some bowls with my girlfriend before homecoming(we had smoked together numerous times in the past well before this.) and she passed out and this made a whole ass scene of me catching her as she fell and just holding her desperately trying to wake her up. Well about 30 seconds later she woke up and Police got involved and called her parents telling them to come to the school. Her parents show up and ask what happened and I wasn’t going to say anything about weed but she tells her parents we smoked and they give me the most disappointed look. Well the next Monday at school somehow the school convinced my girlfriend to sign a witness statement. My father told me not to sign anything so I was just doing what I thought was best and listened. She went to Impact(the secondary school or whatever the proper term is you know what I mean.) I never signed anything because I was honestly just listening to my father’s advice. Now that I look back I feel like a coward. :/ well her parents literally never spoke to me again and wouldn’t let me in their home. So our relationship was confined to sitting on a bench outside because they would not let her leave the apartment complex with me. This went on for about 3 months and I was becoming very bitter towards the whole situation. Not her just the situation. Eventually I broke up with her because once again, I thought I was doing what was best for the both of us. Well you know the rest, I asked for a second chance and was told no. Well we were friends for a bit but stopped communicating after a while. Keep in mind I never stopped loving her. Well at graduation this past summer we unexpectedly ran into each-other. I wasn’t even planning on seeing her because I knew she had a boyfriend and I just thought since it had been 6 months since we had spoken like why now you know? And I was almost over completely over her so I did not want to stir up anything inside. Well she gave me the biggest hug you could give somebody. I was in total shock but I hugged her back and we started catching up. We walked to her parents car and ok I can’t tell if they were just being polite or if they were genuinely happy to see me to, but her mom hugged me as well and I shook her dad’s hand and we all stayed chatting for a few minutes. When I get home I get a text from my ex saying” You’ll always be special to me.” That messed me up so bad it put me in tears . I still feel heartbroken, It hurts everyday now and I just feel so dumb and guilty about how it all went down. I would love to reach out but she has a boyfriend that she seems really happy with. If anyone made it this far thanks for listening and remember love means no matter what so always find a way to make it work. I learned the hard way and I’m not sure if I should pray for a second chance or try to move on once more.",11Oct2020,1

I want to know how to have a better mindset, and how to make myself believe I am strong and successful. For about six months now I try to affirm to myself that I am strong, worthy, and that the day is going to be good , but strangely the days that I motivate myself the most end up being the days where I dig myself into deeper holes. For example, today I woke up and told myself I was going to be productive and try to start on a new hobby! I get up, have a healthy breakfast, do some studying and homework then try to start up a sewing machine. 3 hours later and that thing is so broken, I’m so frustrated! So I go and try to set something up (in order to stay productive) and not only am I unable to set up the new machine , the system set in place beforehand breaks!!

146,"I decided to write this gigantic ass rant on a throwaway account (hence my lovely username), because some of my friends started becoming aware of my real account...I want this to be a story they can see without knowing who actually wrote it in real life, ya know? Anyhow, I'm calling to the people of Reddit here, and some other places across the site as well, for some much-needed advice. Names in this story will be changed for the sake of privacy. 

For the longest time, I've always had shit luck when it came to attempting to date/help people. Either I've been cheated on, left for another man who she would then abandon days later, or even just have a severe mental breakdown and sabotage everything they had. I realized I was out of options, especially with the quarantine kicking things into maximum overdrive. I thought to myself long and hard, and I realized I needed to stop looking for people who I saw as absolute goddesses. People that were just so far above anything I had ever deserved. So, I started to ask for someone who would understand me, and someone relatable. I wanted someone who was like me. They didn't have to be someone to date, just someone with whom I could be close with for the rest of my life, because I was tired of people leaving me for greener pastures. They didn't need to be the most amazing creation on this green Earth. I just wanted them to be human.

The day after thinking that to my sleep, I went to a virtual club and met who now is basically one of the most amazing people I know, with whom I am extremely close to, despite having known her for a short period of time. I'm gonna call her...uuuhhh...Melody. 

In the small timeframe we've gotten to know each other, Melody and I are on that level where we basically trust each other with everything, from our darkest secrets, to the simple shit that happened in our day. She unfortunately suffers from social anxiety, but I have somehow gained her trust to be comfortable talking with me about it, despite literally no one else having that privilege. And this was in what...a week's time? 

She has made me more confident in myself than I have been my entire life. She makes me want to push myself to be the best that I can be, and step out of my comfort zone. She's so much like me, that it's eerie. I used to joke with people that she was basically me from another dimension, except way smaller and lacking a penis. 

There's one major problem...she lives like 4 hours away. Now, the simple solution I'm sure you've brewed up is ""just drive to her house 4head"". Well, I can't. You see, her mother is a grade-A germaphobe. Due to this being compacted with the COVID-19 pandemic, Melody hasn't been allowed to see anyone in over 4-5 months. 

Seeing as my last ex had a similar situation where she had parents that tracked her location at all times, and were almost always home, I felt like this was nothing alien to me. I had managed to see my ex in our relationship with all of these underlying circumstances, so how would this be any different? Turns out with her being so far away, her mom being a huge germaphobe, that was enough to be a major obstacle. But, I had an epiphany of how I could see her at her place, without her or anyone in her family having any chance of getting sick (basically she opens her window and I just yell through that shit). Then comes issue #3, she's too anxious to have me over, or tell me her address in the first place. She knows my address, cause we've discussed the idea of meeting up before, to inform her of how far away I lived from her. 

According to Melody, I'm ""too unpredictable"", and that's why she won't give me her location. She doesn't mind giving out her address, but it's just the fact that I am what I am I guess. Truth be told, I originally just wanted her address only to send her a Christmas gift in the event that I wouldn't be able to see her in person. Melody be smart though, and seemed to catch on to the idea that in theory I could take a road trip and see her in person with the gift instead as a surprise. 

See, at times I get really confused with Melody. I'm the person she trusts pretty much more than anyone else, and yet she gets really anxious for me to come say hi? To be fair, she doesn't like having people over if she's never met anyone in person, so that's fair. But there were other occurrences where I found out that me being in like a group call with people made her more anxious than when I wasn't in there, which upsets me because I'm doing my best to make her as comfortable as possible and want her to be happy with being herself. 

I made a promise to her a while ago that we would see each other before I graduate, since I am a senior in our college right now, she is currently a freshman (18F). She's been really lonely these past few months, and I wanted to go see her to remind her to be strong during this pandemic, and that it'll be over soon. We'll get to see each other whenever we want, and she can see all of her friends again, and she can meet my peeps and I can meet her peeps. 

The more time passes, the more horrible I feel since it seems more and more that it won't happen. My only chance of fulfilling my promise is for her to somehow be let onto campus next semester, so I can drive up there to see her on weekends. I'm also terrified of her forgetting about me before the quarantine ends, and I'll just be some distant memory, a pandemic story for a late-night campfire. 

I need advice, lots of it. How can I find a way to see her during these harsh conditions? How can I keep myself composed during all of this (I'm supposed to be strong for her and what not)? Why is Steve in Smash Brothers? Why does the most comfortable person also make her the most anxious, and how can I make it so she's less nervous/afraid?",11Oct2020,1

TLDR: Am I being weird by giving gifts compulsively to my friends (especially since they are items I already own) or am I overthinking? If so, how do I stop giving gifts compulsively?

For background: I (19F) was emotionally abused by my father growing up, and instead of apologizing to me he would give me money or buy me gifts. For example: I once tried to tell him that what he says to my little sister makes her very upset and he disowned me and called me a disgrace and a disappointment. A few days later he handed me a wad of cash and we went back to normal life. 

As a result of the abuse and other life events, I have multiple mental illnesses including social anxiety. I also have recently taken up giving gifts to my very small group of friends compulsively. I believe its because I feel like a burden and it's my way of apologizing for it.

I'm just worried it's weirding out my friends as I give very odd gifts. In the last two months, I have given/plan to give one of my friends the following:

1. A new mannequin hand for their art (birthday gift)
2. A watermelon (they invited me to dinner)
3. Two really nice beer glasses that my mother had collected and no longer wanted (they also collect)
4. A bottle of Jack that my dad never opened and didn't want (they love whiskey, and yes they can legally drink in my country)

In the last two months, I gave/plan to give my other friend the following:

1. Almost all of my Pokémon cards, including first editions (they collect)
2. A book on women's history (I didn't need it anymore and they expressed an interest)
3. A ton of balloons (to celebrate their arrival back from college)

I'm just worried it's weird I'm giving them stuff I find around my house. The one friend seems to not mind as they have known me for 12+ years and are used to my antics, but the other friend has told me that I shouldn't feel like I have to give them gifts and I'm worried I'm weirding them out. I just can't stop! I love seeing them excited and I like when they give me hugs and thank me and it makes me feel like less of a burden. Whenever I visit them I feel like I'm a nuisance and by giving them something I'm apologizing for being annoying. They know I have anxiety issues and are very supportive and I know they do not hate me, but I just worry too much. 

So am I being weird with my gifts (especially since they are items I already own) or am I overthinking? If so, how do I stop giving gifts compulsively?",11Oct2020,1
148,"So I met this girl on hinge almost 7 months ago. It took us a while to finally meet up because of corona and her working from home at her parents house a few hours away, otherwise we live in the same city.  The first time we ended up just hanging at her apartment watched tv and ate pizza. About a month ago we hung out for the second time which was a 8 hour drive each way, so in total 16 ish hours that time. Before we met we used to talk a shit ton and still talk a few times a week. (It seemed to fizzle off after we met). On the end of our ride home I basically told her I had feelings for her and she said she just wanted to be friends and take it slow. The next day she said “it’s not like I don’t have feelings for u idkkk in weird and take things slow” which was fine with me ( even tho she’s still active on dating apps) recently it really just seems like she’s stringing me along and really putting me on the back burner even as a friend. For example we’ve had like 5 different plans to hangout and she either doesn’t follow up when she comes into our city or straight up cancels. I almost want to drop her as a friend because the last time we had plans with reservations she cancelled and then I saw she actually got food and for high with one of her good guy friends.

I work at a fast food restaurant, and there’s a shift manager (not the main manager thankfully, that would make things more complicated I think) there that is more friendly to me than the others. 

She’ll joke with me more, talk to me more, and overall, just seems to like me more than the others in the work place. She’s even thrown a fry at me as a joke and seems happier to see me when I walk in for my shifts. 

Maybe I’m reading too much into it. Maybe she just relates with me more or it’s the fact that I can get along with almost anybody and she finds me better as a friend than others. 

But there’s a part of me that worries that she likes me more than that. One, workplace relationships are a no go whatsoever really anywhere, and two, I’m just not into her anyway.

151,"Let me explain. I just turned 27 two days ago. I just, tonight, realized I had a lot of dreams as a kid and I accomplished absolutely nothing. 

If anyone has ever watched 'The Good Place' you will know who Chidi is very well. As far as his ability to not make decisions on his own and his questioning of himself I will, woth confidence, say I am very similar too that but not for the same reasons or in every aspect. 

Ever since I was little I had confindence issues. I have never been very confindent. I have always second guessed myself. Unlike Chidi, who knew what he wanted to be when he grew up, I always struggled with it. I wanted to work with wildlife, I wanted to be a veterinarian, I wanted (still do even if I suck at it lol) to be a voice actor for cartoons, I wanted to be a 2nd grade teacher... But I did none of those things. I always told myself I wasn't smart enough, or that there's no way I'd be able to remember what I need to learn, or any other far fetched and lame excuse I could think of. As a result, I am 27 and aside from being a stay at home mom I have only ever worked in fast food, as a waitress, and once as a maid.

I feel so down thinking of the dreams I had that I told myself I could never accomplish. When I was younger I was the kid in the group who.had to study harder and still had trouble while my friends were the ones who could never open there books and pass the class easily. I was the one who had to get taken to another room with less people during test because I had a hard time in a room with 20 other kids. I was the one who was horrible at math no matter how many times it was explained to me. I was only good at drawing when what I am drawing is in front of me but I cannot free hand draw and I struggled in even art class. I was always comparing myself to others.... Etc. 

I honestly never realized how often I did that until a few years ago. I have gotten better and now I try not to compare myself to others but I still have hardly any confindence. I get nervous talking to strangers in person. I have social anxiety. I really just feel like I have nothing really to show for myself. I really don't onow how to overcome these problems I face with myself. I don't know how to tell myself ""it's okay, you still have time"" without 2 seconds later feeling like that is all wrong.

154,"Hello all,

Back in August, the 29th to be exact, a longtime friend of mine and former lover (we broke up on the 26 of that month, or at least I told him I felt the relationship was nil) sent me a message over Discord. Here's the link to the message since I don't wanna type it out, still hurts to look at tbh.

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fpCiBiB1MeR\_QuoJWEoz5fv3sr3J8yAI/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fpCiBiB1MeR_QuoJWEoz5fv3sr3J8yAI/view?usp=sharing)

Now, before I get into this, let me give you the background of it all, I'll try my best to be as nonbiased and factual:

Me and my friend met back in September of 2018, via Tumblr. I was an avid Yume Nikki fanartist and I had noticed he had made several arts related to it, and I commented that I liked his stuff and he took notice one night and messaged me. We started talking, a bit, he was very nice and seemed pretty humble regarding his own artwork. He had also stated he had known of my work when I was on DeviantArt (my old account is gone now lol, don't bother searching for it), mainly for my inflation stuff (yeah I like it, not gonna get into it here) and some of my YN work, so it seems like he was a fan of my work as well.

We really hit it off, I found a lot in common with the guy--both of us were autistic, pretty quiet socially, we liked being alone, we were night owls, liked Yume Nikki, inflation/cartoony TF stuff, Puyo Puyo etc. Granted, we *did* have some major differences as well, he tended to be more of a cynic and I leaned towards the optimistic end, he was more into dark and serious media (Evangelion, Another, Silent Hill) while I liked abstract or offbeat stuff (Clockwork Knight, Bonanza Bros., basically most 80/90's arcade games), and he didn't exactly have the best social life (many groups he was in had toxic people, family wasn't the most supportive. Not saying my social life is perfect, everyone at school said I was nice and goes for a lot of people online but at the same time I didn't relate at all to them and I didn't really try to get to know anyone as such. Family life is alright, everyone says I'm pretty kind but a lot of them have issues like bipolar or lying tendencies so idk, only family member I genuinely love is my grandma due to our similarities).

What we did together was mainly show off our drawings, share music or talk about out interests. Sometimes we would do art trades, or I'd do stuff for his birthday or Christmas or whenever he felt down (the latter I did for him a lot, which I didn't mind since I liked to make things for folks even if I'm not the greatest at it). He didn't do as much for me as I did for him but I assumed his stuff took more time to complete, he was a digital guy it seemed.

We never really quarreled as much as we did sorta crack under pressure and get all depressed and dyspeptic. Not gonna lie the weirdest things get to me and I often voiced my complaints, sometimes with passive-aggressiveness, which in turn sometimes made him a bit testy. Like if the music he liked was loud I'd often complain about it (over time I tried to become less and less picky about this stuff but inside I still get riled up, as much as I try to convince myself not to), or I'd kinda bemoan why all his favorite media had to be dark and dreary (he mentioned to me it was a sort of coping--he never had any abuse as far as he let me know so this could mean nothing or everything). Sometimes I'd look too deep into something he said and get all wishy-washy over it because I thought it meant bad news. He also often had his moments of dourness, and there were quite a bit of them, given his life outlook. We did have a bit of debate regarding his faith (he's agnostic as far as I could tell, he a said he often felt lost due to uncertainty if an afterlife existed, and said his family said they had ""signs"" of higher powers but he never had any) and I told him I felt religion was a waste of time. Also one other time we kinda got on each other's nerves was when I talked to him about a relative that was going through something, details are fuzzy and I can't remember such. We both apologized after both occurrences.

I cannot recall exactly when me and him first started to feel affection for one another, it was early 2019 probably. He mentioned he had a crush on me, and I honestly felt the same with him, even though we had never even seen each other's faces then. We just felt so comfortable around each other that a strong appreciation for one another grew into wanting to be with each other for the rest of our lives. I had never really felt anything like that in my life until then--I had always dismissed love as frivolous and the starter of too many arguments.

Things mainly progressed well--as said before we had our ups and downs (as most do) but unlike those two situations above they weren't radical and I don't think they have much place here as I didn't notice any relevant issues.

Starting around March of this year, though, I noticed he wasn't as affectionate or as talkative as usual (he wasn't the *most* talkative person but he usually at least had some stuff to say). It got more noticeable and I saw him say he was in a glum mood most of the time (which given the current situation would seem inevitable), and in early August things seemed to be getting worse, with his grandpa dying a few weeks before his leave. Over that time I had been talking to someone else (and had been feeling affections for until a few days after the breakup-, still friends though lol), and I had told him I had been feeling a certain way towards another person, to which he told me it was fine, as when we first got together he was currently also dating another person as well so he understood my situation. I didn't tell him that I didn't love him then, because I certainly still did--I just felt the feeling for two now instead of just one.

A few weeks after that, he said something to me that shocked me--he wanted to cut contact with everyone he knew, including me, stating that he was a ""loose cannon"" and that he thought he would harm everyone around him if he stayed. He even said that he bullied someone into therapy when he was younger and that he was irredeemable, something he never told me and caught me by surprise. I tried to diffuse the situation, not wanting to lose someone who I confided in and thought of as one of the greatest people in my life, and told him that he didn't need to leave everyone, and that despite his past he could change. After a bit he said he wouldn't do it and apologized.

Cut to Aug 26--me and the new friend were talking about relationships, they said they had been in several and all had ended badly. It made me think about my relationship with my boyfriend, and I started to notice things I hadn't before--it seemed one-sided a lot of the time, it was usually me picking him up rather than him trying to uplift me and I felt like an intimate relationship like that was no way to go. I admitted my love for them and simultaneously told my bf that I felt he wasn't trying to be more optimistic (bad timing I sorta felt) in the relationship and that he didn't have the will to improve his faults (sorta petty but we had agreed to a trade back in October of '19 and he never got me my half, even as I asked him all the way up until our breakup), and that I felt his parents were not the most friendly and wouldn't accept us being together. One thing I said that may have prompted his tirade is by telling him something along the lines of ""I know you miss your grandpa but instead of always moping about everything perhaps you could try to cherish those you have instead"". This part might be getting semi-biased, idk, I apologize, not the best at writing out my thoughts in the long. Either way, I told him while we were unfit to be in love, I still wanted to talk to him and have him as a friend, warts or no warts he still had his good side.

Three days later, his message hit and he blocked me. I was pretty shocked honestly, someone who I had tried to devote 2 years of my life to was gone, and no way to get in touch with him, no social media or anything (not surprising since a lot of the time he set his status to ""internet bad""). I wasn't sure if I truly deserved the backlash or if I had been insensitive enough to warrant it.

Idk if this is the way to end the post but I'll leave it here for now. I'll provide more details if needed. Marking as NSFW for fetish mention.",11Oct2020,1

Ok so, around June 2020 I stopped being friends with one guy in my main friend group , whcih led to the collapse of the group . I was friends with everyone else still, including one other guy and one girl . I don’t regret my friendship ending with the first guy in June, he became rude and was an asshole . I could’ve forgave him as he begged to be friends again a week later when he realized he had no one else , but I left him on open. I was friends with the second guy until todsy, when he texts me saying he didn’t want to be good friends anymore. I replied  saying ok and whatever , in all honestly I was tired of his bs that he put me through over the months about different things that I said which let get to him, some I regret saying but others were literally not offensive at all. The girl stopped being friends with me for personal reasons as we had a history (regretted that). So pretty much the friend group is together but without me , and I’m not upseet by any means . I’m typing here to let others know about my life recently , and still wonder if I could’ve handled it differently . Luckily I have other guy friends and other girl friends that I’ve made and strengthened my relationship with, and I feel way better then I Dod a while ago.

160,Hey all you fitness junkies! I’ve  always had leg day be one of my biggest issues. Ever since I was young I had a few misconceptions because generally I learn from watching people. I had always noticed people who run have pretty cut legs especially in the calf so I figured I’d combine leg day to be basically a big cardio day. My calf’s never get as big as I want them. Anyways a lot of times leg day for me was running or doing a stair master. Is this the wrong thing to do and should I start doing things like dead lifts and such? What do you think is best for leg day?,11Oct2020,1
161,"So I’ll keep this short. My friend (18f) I recently discovered has been having sex and all that with a guy (32m) for the past few months. She’s known him for a few years and all that, 2 to be exact, but she’s been having sex since the month she turned 18, or so she says. This is troubling to me not only because of the age gap, but because she has a VERY troubling and worrying history I can’t get into rn. Let’s just say it’s a history you would expect from someone who would need a lot of sexual attention like this, and would be easily convinced by someone almost double her age.

164,"Hey guys, 

I am a 21 year old male in Canada and I need some external help from outside my friends. My friends and I recently graduated from college in various professional courses. I graduated from engineering, and I have a friend who is in finance/law, another comsci friend and a friend in accounting. They all have massive career goals now, and we were discussing what our plans are for our future. They all want to be the next big shot Jeff bezos elon musk style, and I see no problem with having high goals. But I don't have such aspirations. Don't get me wrong, I love engineering, and I am very good in my course. I graduated in the deans list and find the courses fun. But I feel my heart is in my hobby of cooking, and feel a lot happier when I make a dish rather than when I finish an assignment. So I said that I have been saving up, and I am going back to school for culinary arts. If a career in culinary backfires, I can go back to my engineering amd work a regular desk job. I have no desire to be the next Steve Jobs or such, I just want to do what I love for 8 hours a day (or however long the job is), and come home to my family. This makes my friends laugh and say that I have a lack of motivation and dedication, and this might cause me to be miserable in the future.

169,"(16M) I never expected quarantine to fuck me up so badly. I haven't spoken to anyone or had a proper conversation with anyone for months. I am the only male in this house and I live with my 2 sisters and my mother. They don't do anything to me but I just hate the people I live with and my mom who mostly just asks about my studies and online class has recently tried talk to me about why I've been so quiet and unresponsive lately but I just couldn't open up.

I just want another man to talk to, personally. And my dad who hasn't spoken to me or visited for years. I miss him. I know he cheated and that was what fucked up my family but he was never truly a terrible person. He is short tempered and strict sometimes when I was a kid and I would get punished real bad. We would still bond sometimes and he'd get me things I wanted to the point where I got a bit spoiled. But now everything is different now that he is gone. He was gone when I needed him the most. I was never thought how to socialize and I still struggle to. I also never got to know him more and what he does and what he liked to do when he was my age. 

Now everything has gone to shit now that it's quarantine. I don't have any energy to go outside and with online classes stepping in I don't even have the time for it anymore. I got seperated from my friends and I don't speak to them as much as I used to.
I feel miserable most of the time and I just distract myself in the internet just to pass time and hope for all this to end.

I just want someone to talk to, and release all of this weight I'm carrying.

170,"Hey there I’m just writing this after a pretty long day so here we go. (In Mobile so sorry for formatting) 

So 7 years I moved to another country do to personal reasons and I met the most amazing girl, she was the first person to take me in as a friend (middle school) and she was just such a kind person and I just fell in love with her. And I mean true love. Fast forward to highschool she got a boyfriend and of course I was sad but like I said, I LOVE HER (I don’t know why and I hate the fact that I do) so we stayed friends. The guy broke up with her after he became abusive and just toxic in general, so I was there for her. Thing is through the years I’ve told her that I like her, that I care for her, that I love her. Since Uni started (we go to different ones) we stopped talking like we used to because of a lack of time. I tried to move on and find some new people but even when I was in other relationships, I still only thought about her, so I broke the relationships up because it wasn’t fair to the other person.

Now I’m in my bed just looking at some pictures of her, just crying of happiness and sadness because I now that I’ll never be with her, but I’m so happy to see how much better she’s doing and how happy she is in those pictures.

I guess we don’t chose who we love eh? 

Goodnight people may you do better at love ❤️

171,"What´s up, Reddit, I was wondering if you could give me some advice. I am a 21 years old man.

I actually planned to proposal to at least propose to be the boyfriend of one girl I really like during this year, (after I finished college) but only if I managed to accompany her as a friend more often (and in person). Therefore, during March, COVID-19 came around to my country, and stopped me on my tracks on visiting my friends, and especially this girl I like. I live with my parents, and my mom doesn´t allow me to exit home except when I go to the grocery shop. I then entered in a kind of social anxiety because the thought of depending EXCLUSIVELY on social media to mingle and connect with people outside of my house, was terrifying. I retreated from a volunteer social group, and had a tough time completing my first forced virtual semester (which wasn´t actually too bad, but my teammates often had trouble when I was afraid to speak or lead first). 

Today I discovered that one odd guy I met a long time ago got a girlfriend, probably during quarantine. However, I can´t compare to him because he lives alone and can get out more easily of his house than me xD but this awakened something on me. I want now to connect more with my girl during these trying times.

I managed to send her a love letter this week. It was super effective. However, I want to do more things more than send letters and watching stuff together like in Netflix party. What activities I can do to keep building a good relationship before I declare to her when I finish my college school? In addition, how and when I should propose to her to be his boyfriend if I can´t have freedom to visit her yet in person?",11Oct2020,1
172,"There is someone in my life (my brother) that is extremely two faced. I moved out and he is using that as an opportunity to trash talk me to my parents, I  heard this from my mother. He's always been a hateful child but I thought that he would outgrow this when. By hateful means that he will remember small things that others said about him to him like e.g. my dad ""you need to study harder"" and then smile and act nice to their face but then he will take my dad's toothbrush and rub it on the soles of his shoes and put it back. I never said anything against this when I was a kid and now I regret those kinds of things!! I feel like it's my fault that he is who he is because only I knew and I didn't condemn him even though I was 3 years older but in my defense, my parents did a lot of awful things to us like controlling us with mental and physical threats and the threats became executed sometimes too it was so unsafe and I believed that they don't know what love is and don't love us.  


I can only wonder what my brother has said and done behind my back like that. And anyway yesterday when we met he kept asking me to take pictures of him until I got annoyed and flexing ""wow how good do I look?"" and I asked him why he's doing this and he said in a condescending tone, ""remember a few years back when I asked you if I am good looking and you said I don't stand out in a crowd?"" and I don't even remember saying that and I probably said it because I don't want to think of my own brother as attractive to me?? Anw this was a really weird interaction but just an example to show that he takes little things of what people said and uses it as fuel for his actions. Even though the things that were said people don't mean it or said it seriously but he has 0 empathy for others too. When my mother cries for example, he does not comfort her and says it's not his fault and even said before that she deserves it like wtf??  


So anyway, my brother now tells me negative and degrading things about me in really passive aggressive ways whenever we meet. Everytime we meet, I've been crying for the next few days or numb for the next few days. It hurts. He gets some kind of high by getting me low. He also told others my secrets I found out after moving and it's ok if he did but he pretended not to know- extremely 2 faced. I want to cut him out of my life or at least set boundaries to never meet him until/ if he changes. I really can't do this anymore. My therapist taught me before to rate how I feel after each meeting and I never followed this but now that I think of it, every meeting has bought me low and left me low and I tried talking about it to fix it but he is extremely dismissive and he says it is my fault for taking his words and interaction this way- even though that is exactly what is it and I can't pretend like it is good when it is actually bad ok...  


So anyway, I typed out this, not sure if I should send it or post it on my story or just leave or how to deal with him in the future but here is the message that I typed and thanks if you read this far and also sorry Ik this is a silly problem that I am bad at handling:  


People be telling you shit to bring you down.  And then calling you childish for cutting them out. At least I'm not fake and I've surrounded myself with genuine people who truly care about me and not for superficial reasons and have achieved a state of inner happiness- something you never will. I am able to give out love and empathy because I have love and empathy for myself meanwhile you have 0 empathy for your own mother when she is crying and her health is deteriorating. You call me having ""no life"" while I am achieving that, meanwhile what is your life other than gossiping and telling secrets about others for attention and sitting in front of a camera talking to people you don't even like? You tell me you will maintain friendships and family bonds just to get things out of them in the future and you tell me at the same time that you hate them and don't like them. Not to mention, not respecting your own girlfriend who explicitly said that she does not want a sexual relationship and making her do it against her will- rape?? Not to mention I never said or thought anything about your shallow life before this but I am astonished by the judgement that comes from you and your ignorance about your own life.",11Oct2020,1

182,"I (30F) have been close friends with a particular group of women (5 of us in total) for over 10 years. For context, I have often felt like the 5th wheel in this group, for various reasons that don’t matter much for the purpose of this post. But suffice it to say, we’ve had issues with me feeling out of touch with the group/unsupported in the past, which they apologized for and stated they would be more cognizant and supportive. We have a group chat that is active pretty much daily and 9/10 times, everyone responds within a couple of hours (sometimes I’ll respond at lunch or after work, for example). I often don’t initiate conversation unless it’s something funny or some good news to share, but I’m active in responding to the others. 

Today, I had a health scare with my dad that really freaked me out, which they know is a very sensitive issue for me as my dad has been very ill in the past and we are close. I was alone and scared, so I went to the group chat for support this afternoon. Two of the 4 ladies responded, briefly and offered some (albeit minimal) support. The other 2 didn’t respond at all. Mind you, we had all been talking prior to my texts. It’s much later now, almost time to go to sleep, and still no word from the other 2.

183,"So, I'm currently in my Junior year of college(2 more semesters left after this one) majoring in Computer Information Systems. I'm very passionate about artificial intelligence, but one thing that I've realized is that the *type* of artificial intelligence I'm passionate about essentially has no jobs - it's basically research. 

Now, I currently haven't done a ton of stuff with AI, I've learned a few different types and took a few classes, but I've gotten too busy with my schoolwork and have to put that on the backburner for now. 

I'm at a bit of a crossroads right now. My ideal solution is honestly to work part time (My lesser passion is ethical hacking), but I genuinely don't believe that ethical hacking, or most other IT/IS jobs, are going to desire a part-time employee. In the time I wouldn't be at work, I could independently study artificial intelligence.

I've been with my adoptive parents my whole life, they're my REAl parents - i have always known i was put for adoption back in 99. I never cared to know who my real parents were, never have i brought them up - even my adoptive parents kept silent about my parents all these years.
Well this summer, my adoptive father probably got the courage to tell me finally that my mother indeed put me up for adoption when she was only 15 years old. It didn't surprise me one bit, i can understand someone in that age not being ready to have a child.
This is where i was taken off guard completely, he proceeds to tell me she's now a successful porn actress, something i didn't expect. 
I ask something that led to where i am now - i asked if she's ever tried to contact me and the answer was no. I've never cared about my birth parents but now that i know that my own mother has never tried to reach me - it hurts a bit and angered me. I know, i know - once your put for adoption you're no longer theirs but somehow i felt bummed out.
I ask for a name and there she was! On Twitter and instagram - really beautiful she is! I have her eye color, bright blue. I was joyed to see that i now know who my mother is! 

But I've been debating if i should contact her and i have no clue if i should even say something or let it go completely. She seems to be doing great and i don't want to enter her life and be unwelcomed. I have so many thoughts but i have no idea what to do right now.

Me, on the other hand, is not so much bright as her in political stuff. I am a democrat and have been trying to learn more about politics, because of all of the shitshow we are in (yup, from US). But I also don’t like being glued on politics 24/7 like her and have the newest info all the time. I know they are important, but it’s just too much for me since I’m not used to it. I was also raised in an environment where talking about politics were not that welcoming.


Because I’m like this, she now thinks I have conservative tendencies. Which is fair, conservatives are pretty ignorant in politics. But it does bother me a lot sometimes because as a gender fluid bisexual, I feel offended by this. 


And now we are in election time, and we now have politics come up in our conversations because, what is there to talk about? But again, many of the things are things that I don’t know. 


So today we were talking about a proposition we have to vote on in the coming election. I didn’t know about it that much, but of course she does. She gave me a quick run down about it and how bad it is, and I was like “okay, thank you. I should do more research about it”. Then she goes in a sense of “you don’t trust me?”. I explain that I want to do my own research so I can get a better understanding. We go a bit back and forth, and then I said “okay” as a response to what she said. No one talks for a second and then she goes “And?”. I didn’t know what to respond to that and explained in that way, but she seemed to be not happy with my response to it. Pretty much the same thing repeats in the next of our conversations, and then we just end it. 


I honestly hate talking about politics with her. I feel so dumb all the time, and her “And?” makes it worse. I feel like I’m a bad human being for not knowing these things. So I rarely bring up politics to her anymore because I just feel bad about myself at the end. Now she is the one who brings up about current politics. She thinks my “okay” are me trying to shut her up, and that is half true on my end because of what I have just wrote. I don’t want to be some rude person to say “shut up” to a friend who is passionate about something.

I am an 18 year old boy who lives with his parents and his girlfriend. She and I have been dating for 5 years and she is living with me, because we had to escape from our country, due to the inhumane conditions we suffered. I left first and she came to live with me 1 year and a half later, which she lived starving, her father died and was left in poverty, my family and I being her only emotional and economic support.

Since she arrived here, she lived through different episodes of post-traumatic stress, we had to take her to the psychologist, to overcome many internal conflicts and to stop the habit of self-lasing and she is even under medication, however, she has stopped taking full treatment for a long time. , because some medications need a prescription and live in a circle of negativity. She is not as strong as when she arrived and I thought she had been improving little by little. But lately, she showed trichotillomania again (pulling out her hair) and tried to commit suicide again. At this point, I no longer know what to do, at no point have I wanted to end her, we have been together for many years and have overcome many obstacles, we have not been able to take her to the psychiatrist, because the medical system is overloaded by the pandemic and in the town where we live, there are no private clinics. I'm really desperate, I know that technically, she is not my responsibility, but I love her and I promised her father before he died, that I would not let anything bad happen to her, although I am not sure to protect her from herself. I honestly have no idea what advice I may need, but I accept any and I wanted to get even for this too.

195,"This situation involves me and two friends. We will call one friend Annie and one friend Hannah. They are two of my best friends. We all go to the same college. 

Annie and I have been planning on moving into off campus housing with each other forever. We have known each other for 5 years. 

Hannah is under the guise that she is living with us too and is pretty excited about it. Hannah is rude to me quite a lot, but is still one of my best friends of 8 years. This leads to Annie not liking her, and refusing to live with her. On the other hand, Hannah likes Annie as a friend a lot and has no idea Annie feels this way. 

Annie told me if I don’t tell Hannah she can’t live with us, she won’t live with me. She’s pretty mad about it. But if I tell Hannah that she can’t live with us, it will pretty much destroy our friendship and cause her rudeness to excel. Personally, I want to live with Annie. Hannah is good as a distant friend but she causes a lot of emotional distress in our daily interactions (as me and Hannah currently dorm together.) she can be very unpleasant and rude to me, treating me like a doormat and forcing me to do things she wants me to do. 

Is there any way to rip the bandaid and tell Hannah I’m not living with her without destroying our friendship? She never takes no as an answer and will continue pushing until she gets her way. Whenever I reject her about literally anything (even something simple about playing a video game with her) she gets extremely mad and ignores me. I was thinking I should tell her “Annie wants to keep the original plan of me and her living together at a two bedroom.” but when Hannah questions me I won’t have any justification as to why it can only be us without her, unless I break her heart and say these reasons about her personality. Which I am not going to do.",11Oct2020,1
196,"My company is providing KN95 masks, and while I’m grateful, these things are itchy, uncomfortable, and almost unbearable after a 12 hour shift. These aren’t the 3M teal N95’s or Kimberly Clark’s duckbill, but made in China “meltblown cloth” that feels like bumpy plastic after a while. I’ve tried my Under Armour mask underneath and while it feel good the masks shift and then my nose isn’t properly covered. I’m seeking suggestions of hygienic ways to prevent irritation, whether a specific cloth face mask liner, a HBA skin protectant, or other creative solution. 

I also experience gapping at the upper margin of the mask around my cheeks/under the eyes (negating the point of a respirator).

I moved in Feburary. I moved from the UK back to the USA. So I dont know anyone and it was basically going into lock down almost as soon as I got here. 

I haven't had any opportunities to make friends. I wanted to date but honestly I put on MORE weight during this lockdown after I was trying to loose and it's just shite. 

You see before this I was depressed. I have struggled with my mental health for years because of sexual abuse I suffered as a kid. And I literally had like a 5 month window where I thought going into this year I'd finally turn it around. That I would go back to school and find someone to date. 

I am already someone who was isolated. I chose to be because of my panic attacks and issues. Then all of the sudden when I made the resolve to change and do better it's all ripped away from me and I *have* to isolate.

207,"I don’t know where to start.

So, I’ve been with my boyfriend for over a year. We both are gay and pretty much out, except to certain family members. However, he’s from Pakistan so being completely open about being gay - it’s hard for him. Baby steps.

On top of that, we both have different personalities and mental illnesses. I’m introverted, and he’s extroverted. I have depression/anxiety, and he has ADHD. I guess, opposites attract.

His friend group is used to hanging out frequently. They’re always in each other’s lives, and he’s the life of the party a lot of times. All of them except for us are straight. It’s hard for me because I don’t have a group like that. My friends are from all different pools so we don’t hang in a group all the time. My boyfriend’s friends also connect by partying a bunch (alcohol, cocaine, molly, etc). I’m not against that stuff as I also do similar but not as often (alcohol, weed, psychedelics). However, it’s like every weekend - they’re always down to party. I’m getting annoyed that it’s a constant thing.

They’re great people, but I do like “couple time” with my boyfriend. It can be draining when I get in social situations with larger groups. I was triggered this weekend a bit. One of his best friends already started planning New Year’s, and my boyfriend and I were talking about having plans with other friends. This one guy is his main best friend and single so he’s always ready to party. My boyfriend at times can be in the middle because he wants to please both me and his friends. I just feel bad that if he tells them, he will let them down.

We both have grown a lot over the last year. I really do feel we love each other. We’ve shared adventures, been each other’s support, discovered new hobbies, and push each other to achieve our goals. it just feels like his old life is so different from his new life with me. I feel like being with each other has been so healing for both of us. Although, I still get bothered by constant attention to the group. Maybe it’s because I’m introverted.

Now with online classes it's still pretty easy to not think about. 

Catch line is that her and my sister are also very good friends. And they talk over the phone almost constantly. My sister has some developmental issues related to her birth and has a very difficult time reading people's emotions, which often leads to her giving more information than she has to. This, along with the fact that my sister loves to talk about me, has put me under some stress.

Last year I checked out my uncle’s profile and saw that I have been unfriended by him (I thought maybe I did it on accident?). I couldn’t begin to guess what I did wrong. There were some minor miscommunications about meeting with him and his family before I flew back home and that’s pretty much all that went down.

Just to add on top of that this uncle of mine was one of my favorite people. I’ve known him pretty much all my life and he would take me and his son (my cousin) on all sorts of adventurous trips. Recently I saw my cousin unfriended me as well. I had wished him a happy birthday and we talked about a new game coming up, everything seemed ok.

231,"Two weeks ago, my sister (f18) checked herself into the hospital overnight since she was having suicidal thoughts. They released her the next morning since she didn’t actually attempt suicide. My family and I came out to where she lives to see her and make sure shes doing okay. 

I’m (f20) especially worried about her because I attempted suicide a few years ago and was put on 72 hour hold in the hospital and I see my younger self in her as of now. She’s almost had a personality change due to the severe depression. Somehow today it came up how she really wanted nicotine because she was super cranky. This threw me off because its not really like her and I didn’t know she had became addicted to juuling and cigarettes. Apparently its very recent which makes me worried because I don’t want it to be a crutch for her. Especially because she was saying how she likes it so much because it lets her feel as though shes in her body for a few minutes. She also casually mentioned that it would be fine because she heard that in inpatient facilities they give you smoke breaks. Which I found odd thats what she thought about when thinking about inpatient facilities. I told her that wasn’t necessarily true because the one I went to didn’t even let me go outside but she shrugged me off. 

Later in the day she asked our older brother whos over 21 to go buy her a juul and he was hesitant but still went to buy it which bothered me a lot. This isn’t all as my brother went to buy edibles during the day too. That night I heard her go to his room and ask him for one because she cant sleep. We’ve been staying in the same room so she came back afterwards. After a few minutes she sat up in bed and stared at the wall and I asked her if she was okay. She said that she can’t sleep even though she also took the maximum dosage of her sleep medication. I’m not sure what kind, but it makes me nervous to mix that stuff with edibles. 

If she was in a normal state of mind, this wouldn’t bother me as I have used these substances before myself. I’m just worried because these are becoming coping mechanisms and that can be very dangerous. Am I overreacting? I know its just weed and nicotine so it could definitely be worse. But I don’t want this to be a stepping stone into a worse addiction problem. I feel like while she’s in this depressive episode, it can be more hurtful to use substances than it is helpful.

after the first week of dating, a few or her friends/family reached out to me and basically told me to think about it first. i did, and figured everything was good so i went with it. we’ve dated for about 4 months or so and everything was going good, but then she just started getting immensely paranoid. i would delete a chat on snapchat and she would ask what it was all day. if i ever got a notification from a friend that’s a girl she would cry for hours over it, she even got to the point of calling me stupid and an idiot when i told her about my political views. she keeps asking me to come visit her, but i can’t because of my job and family and she won’t accept it and fussed at me about it.

tonight, she told me that i’m not trying hard enough, that she carries all this on her back, then proceeded to tell me how her only 2 other friends are barely talking to her. i told her maybe she should try being friendly to other people and she flipped her shit and told me no and that’s just how she is. she told me how depressed she is and how i’m the only person in her life (which i know is not true, she sometimes posts guys on her story and people tell me how they’re such good friends with her). she’s basically got me to the like where i don’t wanna be with her, but she’s essentially trying to place me in a situation where she’s threatening to take her life if i break up with her. her reasons are “family issues” and no friends. idk what to do. i don’t want to hurt her, but i feel like she needs professional help that i can’t provide. i don’t want to be an ass and sound like “i don’t like you cause you have issues” but it’s stuff that i just can’t help her with. 

my hands are tied with this. i care about her and idk what to do. what do you guys suggest?",11Oct2020,1
234,I recently met this attractive woman (single mother) and turns out she’s really into me and is willing to get intimate. Thing is I’ve found out she currently has 2 different fwb’s and is still speaking to her ex. She claims they use protection and she’s only friends with her ex (they have a child together). I haven’t gotten laid in a long time but I also have a fear of contracting something incurable that condoms can’t protect me from. I’m not sure how to approach this situation. Right now my little head seems to be getting the best of my bigger head and it doesn’t help that I haven’t been laid in so long.,11Oct2020,1
235,"I'm on my phone and I usually don't post anything, so I am sorry if it looks weird or this is all just a mess. 

So I (21F) am not too sure if this where I should post this, but I kinda just needed this out of my mind and just put out in the world somewhere. I think I have fallen in love. Maybe for real this time. I thought I was in love before, but I am not too sure if it was love. When I was 12, I met a boy and I guess I was in love with him for about 8 years. He and I were best friends at the time, but around year 6 of loving him we fell out of touch and no longer spoke to one another. The day he stopped talking to me I had gone over to his house because it was his birthday to give him his gift. He was into Star Wars and I gave him a box of chocolates that I knew he liked and a Kyle Ren figurine because he had been saying he wanted one for a while. He was happy with his gifts, his parents and I had a nice chat, and his brother and sister were pretty cool. But for some reason he just dropped me out of the blue for no reason from that moment on. Now while this happened, I was in a different high school from him, and here I met my current best friend and he was all supportive and tried to tell me that he wasn't worth it and to drop him. I was really hurt but I kept loving him, I never imagined myself as being his future gf or anything, I knew he didn't like me back, but I did imagine being there on his wedding day as a guest, happy for him whenever he finds the woman he will love in the future. Skip time a little to last year, I think that hurt from when he just stopped talking to me all kinda festered in my heart and I felt that the love I once had for him start to turn into hate. I didn't want to allow these feelings that I once had for someone that was beautiful to be clouded, so I decided I would reach out to him and just tell him how much it hurt that he dropped me like it was nothing so that I could get some closure. I did that and I felt so much better. I now feel like those last 8 years of my life was just something I had to live through, maybe for better things in the future. 

Now here's the thing I hate myself for. I think that I might have feelings for my current best friend. I have known him for about 6 or 7 years now, and we are the same age. Whenever I think about him I kinda start thinking about a future together. He likes kids and I don't, but I feel like if I were to be with him, I would want three children with him, and I'm scared of dogs, but I'd be okay with us getting one for our future family, and that we be there for each other when the going gets tough, and when we are old and gray, we are surrounded by our grandchildren and go traveling around the world. He is someone I am really comfortable with, he is my anchor, giving me reasons to live when I used to be suicidal, and whenever I breakdown, he has just always been there for me. Of course I want him to be happy, but when I think that he might get married to someone else I feel this pang in my heart and I don't know what to do. Some of my happiest times are when I spend it with him, walking in parks, getting food together, going for rides in his car and so on. He is also kinda my only friend, and he knows my feelings for him, so I can't really talk about this to him, I'm worried if it might make him uncomfortable. Is this what love is like? Am I doing something stupid thinking of these things?

Tldr: thought I was in love before, but I think this is real, but is what I am feeling love or something stupid and a passing fantasy?",11Oct2020,1

One of them is not available rn and the other is well...the sister of the friend I need advice on and so i don’t want anything to spread somehow. I’ve known Stacy for around 5 years now and she’s my absolute best friend, which is the problem. I’ve liked this guy for a really long time now (around 2 years) and she knows that I’ve liked him forever. But in the past few months they have started hanging out ALONE, almost everyday. It bothered me a lot but I didn’t say anything to her I just talked to the other friend about it. I finally got the guts to (with my friends help) to talk to Stacy about how I’m feeling about them. She took it well and she apologized and said “she had no idea I felt this way”....but how can you not know? I’ve liked him for so long and for your own best friend to hang out with him alone, everyday...for months...that hurts and how is that not obvious? I found out she does in fact like him, and he likes her..and that they are thinking about dating. Ouch. What the hell? Stacy has been having personal problems herself like depression, so I thought maybe I’m just being a bitch and I’m taking away her only source of happiness...but that’s not how I really feel. It feels they together would be sooo wrong. I would never do something like that to anyone because I know that’s just not cool or okay. We haven’t texted for a few days until she asked if we could hang out...but I don’t really want too because it’ll be awkward and I’ll just be sad. Is it okay to tell her I need time? Because wether they date or not I’m still hurt that my best friend would do that at all in the first place...so I want a break...but is that selfish? I love her and that’s why it hurts so bad.

Now it’s been four months and I haven’t had an interaction with a girl beyond being ghosted on Tinder after what seemed like a pretty cool connection.

241," 

I  am currently writing a literary work and I have recently received  feedback that the use of the word ""choogled"" was not appropriate as a  speech tag.

I frequently use it in situations such as ""he choogled softy"" or ""Kiss her hoof and choogle sweet nothings in her ear"".

I  understand that this word is not conventionally considered a normal   replacement for a phrase such as ""he said"" but nonetheless the   characters in my story *keep on chooglin""*

What does the word choogled conjure up in your mind, how would you imagine chooging would sound like in a verbal context.

Personally  I think It sounds something like 'to speak in a whimsical and   dismissive fashion' but other have said that it sounds like ""speaking  with your mouth full while spraying food everywhere'

if  the word had a widely Accepted meaning I would not have used it, my  work is very cerebral and I want my readers to question the meaning of  each line, and the motivations behind it.

I am writing a relatively serious narrative and do you think that that the choogling should continue, or do you think I should put a stop to it?",11Oct2020,1

Well this year she’s in my online class (because of quarantine our whole district is shut down) and my feelings stirred up again and for some reason I can’t get my mind off her.

246,"Dunno why, I'll be writing a stupid unorganised rant here.

I had a terrible childhood, saw my own parents turning from rich to poor because many a people ended up cheating them and left them as soon as they fell to the bottom.

I experienced bullying and ragging from both girls and boys. Ended up injuring one of their comrades in a bad manner, but never received support.

The same year, my father had a terrible accident. Miraculously survived, but with complications.

My very twin brother has stopped talking to me and doesn't want any brother-relationship between us.

My parents, after losing money, became bipolar and totally rude in their demeanor.

Because of ragging and bullying, I can't look towards girls, and feel afraid of the thought that I might actually rape them,or strangle them out of animosity. I'm afraid of even being friends with them.

I tried to lie to myself and put a fake persona of someone not suffering with anything in most social media platforms and Reddit as well..

To forget about stuff, I started watching anime and I'm watching recently as well, but to no avail. It's just temporary and makes me forget about my suffering for a few minutes to probably a day..

247,I am 13 turning 14 soon yes I know my posts are a bit mature for my age but im not here to talk about that yes I know i have had a account for nearly 3 years but anyways I constantly change ideas so like for example I will want to do this but never follow through then next week new idea yet never follow through and im lazy so for example ill say im gonna do my school work tonight then its tomorrow then its 2 hours before school starts then I dont get up and sleep in. I do this with nearly everything working out simple stuff or stuff like that I hate this quality of myself and I know for a fact I can make it somewhere in life if I can get over the laziness not trying to sound narcissistic or such but I get that im smart not because I just think it im just exceptionally smart in the economy for my age for example I get what stuff like recession is i get how the stock market effects the world and i have been investing in the market for a year with robinhood my dad lets me use it. Its under his name but im the one who does everything on it. I've been investing for a year so I understand how it works and am actually okay at it yes i lost a bit at first but who doesn't i mean you have to lose some to make some. But now im actually up 42% in the last 3 months which im quite proud of. I was up i think 66% but I fucked up on a stock and didn't take out soon enough so lost some. But at this time im up 5% as of Friday when the market closed. So I understand the economy and want to get a business degree but I won't get anywhere unless I work on not being as lazy. Im gonna try to start forcing myself to start doing stuff for example a big insecurity of mine is my teeth since they aren't white so I have some teeth whiting pens but didn't do it for 8 days last time from being so lazy. So im gonna make sure I keep that up try and workout every day make sure I get my work done before other stuff im planning on trying and force myself to get everything done with before anything else. Is there any other tactics work on it. I have adhd without hyper tendencys so add but im not trying to blame it on that. Im just frustrated I want to go to college and have a good life i get i don't need college for that but in the business world atleast it will give me a good chance at a job. But I cant ever focus in school on certain days not to bad on some days i can't take anything in. I don't want meds for the quite obvious. Yes it can help certain but 1 I don't want to be addicted to it and I dont want to become just a zombie off of them.

250,Recently I have been apart of a academic team for 3 years now. The first year I was given two different roles I did well at and even got a 1st place award for. The next year I was stuck in one of the same roles all years. I have done this role 6 different Times and I am burnt out from it. I have put hours into this team and now have some good experience under my belt. I emailed my coach the role I wanted to do at their request. I didn’t get it. Instead they gave it to a girl who wasn’t really that interested in it even though my coaches know I’m interested in this role. I got put in another role I was sort of interested in. Basically anything besides my old role. I then said I was interested in doing one of the two speaking roles for this role. (There are three of us on this side of the team) I didn’t get it... but one of the girls that did get the role my coach told me to train her and prepare her for it... so I wasn’t given one of the speaking roles. Now I am tasked with in addition to helping this girl prepare her speech but also training the new person doing my old role!!! And I am stuck just being involved with that subject and not something new. I have put a lot of time into this team and my coaches know it and I’m just caught up in the constant disappointment of not being able to have a part I have been interested in. For three years I have always been team first and still am I just want to know can I be a little selfish here wanting those roles. What is hard is I’m not given the role I want but I am tasked with helping the people have the role I want.

He’s deaf and so I usually just shoot him a text that I’m on my way since knocking or ringing a doorbell won’t register. While walking away I happened to see the very edge of his shoulder in one of the windows off to the side of his front porch so I went to go give him a wave, and I was pretty excited since I never see him anymore with social distancing and all. I waved really big circles in front of the window for probably 5 seconds but he was turned too far from the window to notice me. Finally I took another two steps closer to try and knock because he can sometimes hear faint noises or feel vibrations when his hearing aids are on and that’s when I saw his computer screen. He was very clearly watching porn on full screen. I know he’s human and all but it totally sucked, to see and I don’t think I can wipe that from my brain anytime soon. 

But the actual advice I’m looking for is not how to wipe that image from my head, but it’s if I’m obligated to say something about it? I was able to see his computer screen when on his front porch, but only by walking maybe 5 feet away from the front door/mailbox. Even then I had to stand about a foot away from the window to see in. I ran off pretty quickly feeling freaked out but I took a second to look from the sidewalk and with all of the bushes he has planted I couldn’t see anything from there either.

Its not like idc really but it was 8 years ago stop brining it to make people feel pity for you!!!!! What do i reply??? Another thing is that she goes to stalk her ex that domestically abused her so basically she is the one now goes to want to see him. If he really almost killed you... you shouldn’t be looking for him and going to his house just saying. Anyway, what do i reply back?????

Another thing is that i want to cut her off but want to do it gradually. I just can’t stand her anymore. She even got a tattoo yesterday that she’s is a survivor.

272,"I’m a junior in high school at the moment and I’ve landed my first job, I work in food service. My “plan” I guess is to ditch the US and move to wales, start college there and become a vet tech. The thing is ever since this whole covid outbreak I can’t seem to be motivated to do school work. I did summer school online and it was stupid because you would start a course with a series of questions and if you guessed them all right or 90% right you pass and didn’t have to learn that certain course, at that time my first ever boyfriend and me were going through tough times and I found out he had cheated on me, so I spent the last two weeks of summer school depressed beyond all belief. Now I don’t blame failing summer school on my depression, for a lot of it, it was just hard to focus in my room where there is a lot of distractions. It’s the same with this new semester. I can’t and I mean CANT focus when I’m in my room, my local library is closed so I can’t go there, I’ve tried leaving my house and going to a friends to try there and it worked for a week and then I started working. 5-9 shifts every week day and 2-9 shifts every weekend. Usually I’m so tired from work I just pass out after work. Sometimes even at my friends house. With how exhausted I am from work I tend to wake up at 10 am which is practically lunch and then three more classes and schools out. I know hybrid learning is a thing but my friends sister just came down with something and she was in hybrid learning at my school. I tried to shorten it down to where I wouldn’t go on any zoom calls, go to work, then finish my school work, then hopefully pass out and do it all again. But now it’s been two weeks and i just switched teachers from hybrid and online classes becoming a thing and I don’t even want to open my laptop for anything, no video games even. It just hides under my pillow while I sleep then wake up and go to work. I honestly don’t know if this is all from my depression which is definitely coming back because at work I’ll slow down and just blank out or get lost in thought doing something or even just become very slow and my arms feel heavy to the point where I ask my boss if I can take a coffee break to wake up. Should I call my doctor and ask for Adderall? Or just a prescription that would just make me focus? There’s also some bad stuff happening at home I guess? My mom has this boyfriend that just screams trump supporter. You know the typical “women are only good for their bodies” “people of different race are lower than me”. And as an almost 17 yr old I have to lock my door at night because I’m scared he’ll come in my room and do something because of the comments he’s made about my body. My mom refuses to believe me and says I’m being dramatic about him. He’s yelled at my mom and called her a whole bunch of names and there’s been fights where they’ll throw things at each other and he’ll get kicked out piss drunk. My dad is coming back in a few days and it’s just stressing me out because after being told by my mother if I tell my dad anything about her boyfriend I’ll get my ass whooped I finally broke and just told him everything. He said that her boyfriend better not be in the house while he’s here or they’ll be a fight and I just really don’t want to deal with my mom yelling at me because I caved and her waste of space boyfriend got hurt or charged or whatever might happen. Fuck this was a lot to dump on strangers but I need to get advice or medication because if not I don’t know what I’ll do. Call me stupid, ignorant, or ungrateful but at least I’m asking for help. I’m lost.",11Oct2020,1
273,"So yesterday I got invited to a girl from my class' sleepover with her other friends, who I do not know. How do I come off as a gentle guy? I am a bit shy, because all the other ones have known each other for over ten years, while I've only known that one girl for around 2 months.

274,"So I (14m from Canada) was in a game party with a close friend of mine (13m from cali) whom we shall refer to as h, and three other friends, one of these friends, has a girlfriend. So we all start joking about her, yknow the usual, when out of nowhere h leaves. Not long after that I get a message from h, telling me all about how in love he is with friend and how much he hates the fact he has a girlfriend. This is kinda out of character for h, hes a bit of a pessimist sure, but overall he's a goofy laughy kid. I try to reassure him and tell him it's ok, I use myself as an example as I was in a similar situation not long ago, but then h drops an absolute emotional bombshell. H goes,

""Ever since friend got a girlfriend I started cutting."" 

And that broke me, my vibes were already off when he first messaged me, but that one hurt. So I started panicking, i didnt know what to do, I tried more reassurement but the messages got darker and darker. Finally he said he had been thinking about suicide. At this point my body was numb, I was shaking a crying and couldn't think straight, I googled a suicide hotline and sent it to him, and begged him to call it. But he said he didnt need to call it, he needed a knife. Then he went silent I was sobbing at this point, mind you while this was all happening everyone else in the party was obvious. So I started calling out for help. I told them the situation and noone knew what to do, so I started spamming his phone and messages with the suicide hotline number, begging him to call it. I happen to know one of his friends from cali, so I texted him seeing if this was anything he could do, eventually we had about 5 people in his messages, we were legitimately contemplating calling the police, but luckily he responded and rejoined the party. It was at this point I broke down,i was sobbing telling him how much he mattered, how much we love and care for him. I was practically on my hands and knees begging him to seek help. But he refused, he wasn't budging. 

After what felt like hours of sobbing and pleading, things started to calm down. We started playing together again, but throughout the day I kept getting messages from h telling me how sad he is after his mom got paralyzed and how he cant be In the same party as another one of our friends because them and friend are jokingly husbands. This is all taking a load off on me, as just two days ago my boyfriend broke up with me, I'm so tired, so stressed, and so worried. I genuinely hate seeing him like this, I need to know of theres anything I can do to help him. It's my job as his friend to make sure hes happy and loved.

As a result, supervisors drop off hard-copy checks to employees contracted out at different work sites.

Well today, I check the status of my deposit. *DECLINED*. okay wtf, so I call up my bank. They tell me that the check, which was unhampered with and unopened, was somehow ""deposited electronically at another banking institution"".

279,"So theres this girl I really like at work. Whenever I come in and shes there she gives me a hug, we talk and all that. I'm usually a pretty quite introverted and awkward guy but lately I've been trying to come out of my shell for her.

Today as I was wiping down the windows where I work, I threw a paper towel into the trash from far away. Me, the girl I like, and another coworker had our headsets on and my coworker goes ""Baller"" and the girl I like says she proud of me. Then my coworker jokingly said ""I was about to say I caught feelings"" or something like that. Then, the girl I like said something, I can't remember what, but then she goes ""(My Name) is cute as fuck."" Earlier she also rested her head on my shoulder and I rested my head back.

While this was great, the problem is I don't know whether to take it seriously or just brush it off as her being her. She usually acts that way with people at work and I don't want to get the wrong idea. I think she got out of a relationship with another coworker so I figured my chances may be better but I don't know, I just don't see how or why she'd feel the same way towards me as I do about her

- My ""friends"" never hit me up. when I say im fine they dont give a fuck but when i say i have no friends they be getting all tight af.

- I just want one person in ma life to have fun with I can't even remember the last time i hangout prob like 4-5 years ago back in elementary.

- I tried holding contact but when I'm always the person who needs to ask how they are doing it feels like im just wasting time/energy in ppl who don't show interest back.

- at Home i feel all alone, can't remember the last time we even ate together. Phones ruined our whole family connection and it hurts me so much that we don't have that family connection. Everyday im just wishing we could go back too that. Few days ago i saw my mom eating on the dinner table so i just went to sit next too her to have like a talk without phones she just responded with ""yes"" ""no"" i guess her K-drama movie on her phone matters more so i just went back to my room And talked to sum people online cuz they are the only people in ma life that seems to care.

- I say too myself that i dont need friends to be happy but in reality im just lying too myself cuz ik im so unhappy in my life rn.

281,"I will give a little bit of back story first. I am M(26) and have been working at a company now for a year last August. Before that i only worked at a small convenience since I got out of high school. After starting this new job with this company I fell in love with what I did every day and the people I worked with. Also I was making substantially more money say around $15 an hour plus commission. I live in a small town that doesn't have a very big population so to be honest I never really made commission they basically just paid me to watch tv. I mean really I would only have a customer every other day at most. Unfortunately do to covid many stores shut down permanently around the country and mine was one of them. They gave us another job offer to work from home and a raise on top of that. Around $20 an hour now and commission should put me around $54,000 a year. The only thing is I absolutely hate this new job without getting into much detail about the reasons it's just not something I am willing to do. I will not be with the company much longer if I can't find a different position in the company. I have been looking for different job opportunities in the same field but most companies pay substantially less money than what I was even getting paid before to do the same thing. I have been trying to find better jobs but there just really isn't anything around where I live. I am afraid that I am going to have to go back to working at a minimum wage job and feel like I'm starting from scratch all over again. I'm not sure what to do and I feel like every day I'm running out of time.I am just looking for some advise if anyone has been in this position before or if anyone has felt the same way.

283,"My (21F) and my friend (also 21F) are having some political differences. The sides don't really matter, but I'm sure my US friends will be able to deduce. Purely for context, I am an immigrant as well as a person of minority ethnicity, while my friend is white. We got into an argument, and have gotten in arguments before about our presidential candidates. I vehemently oppose many of the social stances one of the candidates supports, and a big issue for me is the systemic racism that America is currently suffering from (as a recipient of many racist remarks and aggressions). She continually talks about how she doesn't see any racism because she has never experienced it, and I continually try to have a conversation about her white privilege but she defends aggressively with comments calling me a ""reverse-racist"", etc.

I get so disheartened, angry, and sad because for me, the election of \*that\* candidate in November would severely hurt the rights of so many women, people of color, immigrants, and people belonging to the LGBTQIA+ community (and so many others!), and as much as she claims that ""friendship shouldn't be politically based"", I really actually don't think I can be friends with someone who supports a leader that promotes misogyny, racism, and discrimination in general.

This is really hard for me because I really love her, and she's gotten me through some tough times, and outside of politics, we completely agree. And if we don't agree, we can talk it out and agree to disagree, or have a mature conversation. She is functionally a sister to me, and has gotten me through a lot of trauma, including emotional/physical abuse in my past. But having her so closed-minded about something that is so important to me, and her actively supporting someone who will ultimately hurt me and others like me is really difficult for me to handle.

How do I go about this? I want to retain our friendship but every political conversation I have with her ends up with us both arguing because I feel like I need to stand up for these basic human rights, and the fact that she doesn't understand them, again, really conflicts me. I would avoid politics in general, but in this climate, that is difficult.",11Oct2020,1

I don’t think we have covid i think it’s the cold as we don’t have a cough or fever. However, my mom went to the grocery store to buy cleaning wipes. This already made me uncomfortable as she shouldn’t be out in public but after that she made me go in and buy more wipes as she couldn’t buy more than 3 boxes. I felt pressured to go in because she was angry and upset already. I went in and bought the wipes i was in and out in less than 5 minutes and i wore my mask properly. I still can’t live with the fact that i went somewhere in public knowing i should have quarentined. What if i infected someone and possibly killed them.

It didn't feel right so I ignored him after a few messages. Then today I sent him a loooong message about how that made me uncomfortable. 

Years ago he also sent me a video of him taking off his pants. It was really weird. I asked him why did that and he didn't say anything.

About half a month ago I've had an extremely stressful week to prepare for my first ever business pitch.  Ever since that passed I've been feeling little to no motivation to work on my study (or do anything really) and am seeing this huge load of work that I need to do.

As im in my third year, I am also writing my bachelor thesis right now. We don't really get help and after having not worked on it the first two weeks, I barely worked on it at all tbh... I'm feeling way behind, I don't know how to approach it, I feel like I am not working correctly, and ultimately: I don't know what I should do.
 I can't concentrate, time flies past extremely slow and I feel like I'm just waiting for the days to pass... I never have time to meet with someone, but if I recap my day I barely get stuff done (or everything just takes extremely long) Is my life getting out of hand? Am I experiencing burnout? I don't know what to do im suffocating in work at the moment.

Me (f16) and this guy (m18)  have been really close since August 2019, since then we've both admitted feelings for each other and are kind-of together. Our relationship is hard to explain- we technically aren't dating as we've decided to stay single due to his mental health (bipolar, depression) however mutually agreed not to see/talk to anyone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this time last year he ghosted me for 2ish months. honestly, it broke me. Those 2 months were the most painful of my life. Anyway he reached out after 2 months to apologise and we quickly became inseparable again. We have our bad days, but ever since then its mostly been good, only occasional arguing, nothing extreme. 

&amp;#x200B;

This time last week we went out together, something we try to do often and we both had a great night. Everything went well and there were no issues- or so I thought. Since then we've barely spoken and every time I text him he leaves me on read. In the past week, Ive probably spoken to him 30mins total, a complete change to our usual texting 24/7. Ive reached out to see if he was ok and try to make conversation, but all of his replies are extremely brief, if he replies at all. When I asked him if I had done something wrong, he said I hadn't, but refused to give reasoning for his behaviour.

It has only been 2 weeks and I have spent every single day crying. The move hit me hard as I am very close with my family. Even though we call every day and I go home on the weekends it's sti difficult for me to adjust. I also struggle with terrible panic attacks and crowded places ( I used to live in a tiny town and my university is in the biggest city in my country where every olace is a crowded one). 

Another issue that I stumbled upon is that i'm not sure if I genuinely want to work in my field anymore. It would take 8 years for me to complete my degree if I did everything right and i'm not sure I want it. I wonder if I should have chosen some other field or if I should just give up. 
I worry about money a lot and I don't want my parents to waste all their money on my education and for me to end up giving up after 3 years over something I know now, or I think I know? ( me getting a part timr job is impossible as i'm in university all day long and barely have time for anything but studying).
My parents are trying really hard to help me adjust but it's extremly difficult. All my friends moved to different places and i'm not very good at making friends.

All of this has brought me a lot of stress and anxiety, I feel like i'm going crazy at this point. Every day is a famn struggle and I have no idea what I want from life. I tried contacting people because I found out that as a student I can go to therapy for free but nobody responded to my emails. Therapy is pretty expensive where I live so going on my own is not an option. I have no idea what to do...so if you hqve any advice please share. i'm sorry for any mistakes in typing and thanks for reading.",11Oct2020,1
301,"I’m 13, and I had 723 followers on a platform called wit. I posted nsfw things that I’m not going to talk about, but it wasn’t child porn. 

I said that we should be kind to each other and said no matter what race you are, be kind to each other. People in the comments started saying white isn’t a race and you can’t be racist to people who aren’t oppressed. I said that you can be racist to white people, and got attacked for it and called a colonist. 

I’m not white, I’m Native American and was told I should be against white people as they took my land from me. I’m not getting hated on and lost 21 followers in less than 20 minutes.

302,"I'm starting a new job tomorrow that is two levels/steps higher than my previous role in another team/division.  

Whilst I know I was previously performing at the level directly below it, my official title/role was still 2 levels below. Additionally, I've only worked full time for 9 months (worked 8 months part-time at the same level previously during my last year of university) whereas most people at this new level have worked 2 years plus.

305,"Lately I've noticed how tense I am in my private life. I have several hobbies that I pursue regularly. However, I mostly plan when to do something and I think things like: ""You have to read more. You have to take more photos"". And of course I can't always do everything at the same time. But I often think that I have to read at least 50 pages a day, for example, otherwise it is not enough. Or when I haven't written short stories for a long time, I think I have to write one every day. It usually goes on until I'm hopelessly overwhelmed. 

I have already tried to just rely on my intuition and just feel what I feel like doing. But if I follow this intuition, I usually stay on the sofa and stay on Reddit or Youtube. And I don't want that either. I blame this on the chronic light depression that I have. 

To sum it up: either I do things with compulsion and a sense of duty (although I can see that they are good for me when I am doing them) or I do not do them at all. And so far I haven't found a way to deal with it better, because the whole thing always puts me under pressure and, above all, takes away the fun of the actual thing. E.g. sometimes I feel so much pressure just from looking at my book shelf iwth all the unread books that I have. 

Sometimes I wish I only had like two hobbies/interests; I think I wouldn't be so overwhelmed then. But actually I'm not willing to give any of my current hobbies up because I like them all :(  It's a bit like seeing my hobbies as work and that often makes it exhausting for me. 

Has anyone of you ever experienced something like this? And maybe have some advice for me? :)",11Oct2020,1
306,"So exactly a month ago I took a break from playing ps4 with my friends who are always on there. Mind you we are in our 20’s so we don’t really have that much freetime anyway. I started noticing them posting on there stories hanging out and stuff and it became a constant thing I would see and it bothred me cause I would normally go to those hangouts and we would have a good time. So I mentioned this to the group chat that we’re in and basically one of my friends said for me to stop acting like a female and shit. And my best friend also said that they don’t invite me cause then I’ll say im busy. It really suprised me since they told me some really personal stuff and we were actually good friends. Then like two other of my friends were kinda going along with what they were saying and it surprised me even more. It felt like I was being attacked.  Im not busy all the time and it doesn’t hurt to text or call anyway since it litterally takes less then a minute to do so. It seems that they make they’re plans in the ps4 party which is stupid cause I can’t be in there all the time. Now they are officially ignoring me and Im having a really hard time with that especially since out of that group, two of them Im really close and personal with and they too don’t say anything and I’ve known them for 10 years!

308,"TW: suicidal thoughts, I guess


Long story short I did something stupid and irresponsible and someone else understandably gave me shit for it. My problem is that I somehow can't deal with people criticizing me so instead of coping with it in a healthy way I feel extremely ashamed or humiliated to the point where I get suicidal. Right when that someone called me out for my behavior I thought about wanting to die, that I always ruin things and that I should kill myself. In addition I also can't stop thinking about how the people that call me out now hate/make fun of me and spread lies about me.

I feel like my reaction is extremely childish. There are probably a lot of better ways to own up to my mistakes but I just don't know what causes this behavior in me or how I can handle these situations better.",11Oct2020,1
309,"Sorry for the repost. My thoughts are racing so much right now. 

Good morning, afternoon or evening dear community. I (22,m) am a third year student of business (writing my thesis) and am currently in the process of founding a startup on top. About half a month ago I've had an extremely stressful week to prepare for my first ever business pitch.  Ever since that passed I've been feeling little to no motivation to work on my study (or do anything really) and am seeing this huge load of work that I need to do.

As im in my third year, I am also writing my bachelor thesis right now. We don't really get help and after having not worked on it the first two weeks, I barely worked on it at all tbh... I'm feeling way behind, I don't know how to approach it, I feel like I am not working correctly, and ultimately: I don't know what I should do.
 I can't concentrate, time flies past extremely slow and I feel like I'm just waiting for the days to pass... I never have time to meet with someone, but if I recap my day I barely get stuff done (or everything just takes extremely long) Is my life getting out of hand? Am I experiencing burnout? I don't know what to do im suffocating in work at the moment.

Also, I have been a daily weed user for more than a year. Usually always had my shit done on time, but i am wondering if this is part of the problem.",11Oct2020,1

312,"Basically, I'm horrendous at communicating (in person, but text is fine because I can think about what to say) and also have severe emotion regulation issues, so when I feel an intense emotion I need to isolate myself to understand and process it, and if someone speaks to me during this time I get extremely pissed off. 

I told my housemate (who is/was one of my closest friends) this and that sometimes I'll walk around the house with earphones in and ignore everything or I'll just stay in my room. I know it's not a good coping mechanism, but I can't afford any kind of therapy. My housemate told me he understood and would give me space if I need it, but he has done absolutely nothing to show me this. If I'm quiet, he'd confront me and ask what he did wrong, and ask why I'm being such a shit friend. 

It aggravates me that much that I completely ignore him because I know if I know I'll end up saying something I don't mean out of anger. He's moving out in a few days so I'm considering just completely ignoring him until he's gone, because I don't want anything to do with him after he leaves. 

I know all this might make me seem like a shit friend, but he's well aware of my emotional instability and I think he's trying to gaslight me into doubting my own reality. He tells me my perception of every situation is a paranoid delusion and blames me for his mental health issues. 

What is the right thing to do in this situation?

314,"I‘m a teenager and for as long as I can remember being one, my mother is randomly irate for no  discernible reason. Today has one example:

Mum: I need a tissue

Me: Here you go

Mum: Are there any left in the box

Me: I don’t know, (so then I go check) yeah there’s some left

Mum: (checks for herself) There’s only one left. Why didn’t you tell me there was one left? 

Me: You just asked if there were tissues left in the box and I said yeah

Mum: Why don’t you do things properly? You should‘ve told me there was one left. You need to make a habit of checking things properly, and it starts from here, and if you don’t you’ll... (and goes into a general lecture about being responsible. she then kept on muttering as I aimlessly went around ‘oh there \[me\] goes with \[my\] hair on \[my\] shirt, flip it over,’ that kind of stuff)

So right now I’m giggling like mad since in my opinion she’s worked herself into a bad humour about a tissue. It doesn’t quite annoy me in the way it should since I have a principle of sorts that I won’t get irritated by something that’s either not worth it or untrue so I find the whole thing funny instead. But I’ve been dealing with this for years now and it’s kind of tiring to have to do mundane tasks and stuff for my mum only to be greeted with a drawn out lecture instead of just a ’thank you‘ or anything that‘ll allow me to dismiss myself in 2 seconds instead of 10 minutes. I‘m inclined to say it’s almost a habit of hers. If I try to say anything or become sarcastic (something along the lines of ‘I’m sorry, I now understand that a tissue matters very much in the grand scheme of things’) she’ll become even more angry and there’re excellent prospects of me getting grounded. If she catches me giggling or laughing she gives me another lecture of how I need to respect what she says and she has not, to my memory, ever let me explain that it’s just the tissue issue and the fact that she decided to drop her lecture over a tissue that I find funny, I do at least attempt to pay attention to the meaning of the lecture itself. She’s not even stressed out or anything I just feel she‘s pissed off whenever she talks to me. How can I get her to calm down?",11Oct2020,1
315,"Hello,


I have been obsessing about this for a few days now. I haven't done drugs, had my first kiss, had a fake id, etc. I recently moved to uni and am finding out about all sorts of stuff from my old high school. In high school I was kinda anti social, but I worked on myself and became confident and social in uni. However, upon chatting with people who go to my uni and went to my high school I am finding out about a lot of stuff I didn't know happened and about sides of people I never saw. I have begun to feel like a loser and that I missed out on being a teen. Idk, I feel different from other people and pathetic for not having ""lived"" unlike everyone else. Am I being irrational?

316,"I have an unhealthy view on relationships and strongly believe at some point that my partner will cheat on me once they find a hotter dude.

This isn't coming from a place of self-pity/insecurity. Practically speaking it would make sense for a partner to sleep with someone who has desirable genetic traits

We text each other very frequently too. After a while, there is no flirty text and she didn't text me back that frequently too (takes like 20-30mins to reply).

318,"So from a very young age like 5 I have always been deeply afraid of getting sexually assaulted. I was very protective of my sister who was younger than me like obsessive over keeping us safe from a very young age but no one ever knew why. I never wanted to tell adults I’m afraid of something happening because I don’t even know how to explain that me a young child knows what that is or why I’m obsessed with keeping us safe. From that age I would have little “flashbacks” and it bothers me that I don’t know if it was a dream or if this is a memory? It’s of a little girl who looks like me sleeping on a bed that looks like the one from my house when I was young. She looks about 4 and a man is putting his hands on her privates. But it almost seems like it’s in 3rd person view, but I feel this huge wave of discomfort and fear when I remember this. It feels like I can feel that feeling. Whenever encounters later on as a teen/adult came up with a boy like kissing etc I would sometimes remember this and feel that feeling of discomfort. I could feel that feeling of a hand on me that I don’t want on me. I don’t know if this is a memory or a dream and it bothers me. I don’t see how anyone in my life would do that to me, but I don’t understand why I was like that as a child also. I’ve had terrible anxiety issues since being a child. When I talk to people now people always say they were completely not like that as a child, people that saw me as a child behave so obsessive with trying to keep me and my sister safe at all times from men.

323,"So recently it feels like I’m pushing everyone away. 

I made a friend of mine cry. We went out for dinner and the topic of marriage came up. So I asked her if she’s actively looking. She said she’s not ready for a boyfriend because she doesn’t love herself fully just yet. And that only when she loves herself 100% and when there’s excessive love, then it’ll be the right time. Somehow the topic was heated, because I was quite stubborn on saying we don’t need to close off ourselves to anyone. She doesn’t need to be actively looking. But if someone does come along the way, don’t push them away. And meeting and letting someone in can teach you how to love yourself and love others. I think we were both quite stubborn on our own opinions, she ended up getting quite emotional, and grabbed my chin so I’d stop talking. The dinner didn’t end very well. Today I texted and rang her, no reply yet. 

At work, I forgot to record something, which can be easily fixed. A colleague of mine exclaimed ‘ah young people’ while I was only 1 year younger. I said ‘you’re not that much more experienced that me’. And she replied ‘but during that year, I learnt a lot.’ I was quite offended by the comment, and at the time I sarcastically replied ‘I’m sure you did’, because I didn’t want to cause any conflicts. I guess now when I think about it, i shouldn’t have let her walk over me.

Sorry if this and the title is all over the place I’m so upset and furious but please try read through. A little bit of backstory I went through horrific verbal abuse for 5 years when I was living with my father and his girlfriend, then I went to live with my mother 6 years ago. When I met my partner we realised  he knew  my dad girlfriends brother *Tom  through his longtime family friend *Sarah (who are boyfriend and girlfriend. I have told my partner i wasnt really uncomfortable with Toms presence in the past as he wasn’t very nice to me when I was being abused, but I did not in any way limit my partner from seeing or talking to him. Today we got invited to a party by Sarah and he nervously told  me that Toms going to be there; I said that was fine I just need to face things and my anxiety. When we got to the party Sarah came up to me and said why are you worried about Tom? He’s not going to hurt you and laughed almost condescendingly (in-front of a few people) . My heart sank and I wanted to cry on the spot, I was so embarrassed and hurt. When we left the party I told my partner who told Sarah I was u comfortable, I feel really hurt and I feel that should come from me and not anyone else (his family are aware of my situation so I thought maybe they went behind my back) and he admitted to writing Sarah a message saying I was uncomfortable and wouldn’t go if Tom was there and asked who’s going to be there. I felt almost betrayed and asked why would he do that to me and make me so uncomfortable, it almost makes me feel how I used to be when I was being abused. He immediately gets defensive and and makes me feel stupid for being angry and upset. He always seems to do this to me. I tried to tell him that put me in such a horrible position and severely hurt me, he said he was trying to help me and saying Sarah didn’t mean anything by what she said. Sarah could’ve pulled me aside quietly and had a talk to me about things but no she decides to say it in front of people and out loud in such a weird way. Am I in the wrong? We had such a massive argument and I have blocked him I feel so hurt.

Looking for advice to successfully transition to an sustainable diet

I (27m) feel the need to move to a more environmentally friendly diet but don’t really know where to start.

I’m fairly large and active. I eat a lot of fruit and added things like peanut butter almond milk shakes as meal substitutes but still have beef steaks, fish, bacon etc. Also have little snacks with wrappers that just get binned

I definitely know I need to make a change but don’t know where to start.

What kind of high energy/ nutritional options are out there? How much meat (if any) could I include in my diet? Can fish still be a regular part of my diet? What kind of snacks could I introduce?

Please know that I live in the country and don’t always have ready access to city supermarkets. I’m also working full time as well as studying so don’t have hours of prep time available.

I’ve gone from £11-£9 an hour and I feel like I have been lied to and I have 0 motivation and I just don’t want to be there. I’m on even less money than when I first started with the old company. 

They are giving me all the horse work to do all the shit jobs. They look at me like I should be happy and motivated and expect so much work out of me. Ive so close to quitting, but with the virus I am just thankful to have a job for now. But if I’m down as trainee shouldn’t I be getting trained up? Then the problem is I can already do 5/6 jobs on my own (One I’ve learnt with the new company) I’m the second most skilled person here so what have I got to be trained up in? So I don’t want to go down the route of a training plan as they will grind me down on that. They will say I’m not trained up so they don’t have to pay me more, it will go on and on. I admit I need experience in most of them but If I’m doing them on my own surely I am trained up? They said they would review my wage in 6 months. I’m only expecting to get 50p or potentially even nothing but I want the £11. They expect me to cover my old promoted job on the wage I am on now when the other guy is off. I feel like a ticking time bomb ready to snap at them. My line manager (Who is good) was afraid I would leave and I told her I will if something came up I would be daft not to, they pay £12 elsewhere. But that If they treated me right I wouldn’t leave, which was 100% true. But with the way things are going I am really fed up. I’m doing a good job so I’m scared they will leave me doing the shit jobs. I keep feeling like doing the job wrong so they will take me off it, or taking the piss hardly doing anything. The works that easy for me though even if I take the piss I still end up doing it better than other people. What am I supposed to do? I feel like walking out everyday I’m that pissed off.",11Oct2020,1
335,"Hello all, I’m urgently looking for advice.. in my place of work in an education centre, there was a rats nest by my desk. It was cleared and blocked off but 3 weeks later there was a dead mouse in a trap right by where the nest was. 
 I emailed  report to my boss (the health and safety officer) and sent a picture as evidence. The picture was not graphic or close up. The mouse actually looked alive and kinda cute, no blood etc.  
 My boss really dislikes me (for no reason I might add) and she pulled me into her office under false pretences and said she was shocked to receive such an image and how horrible I was and I must have a nefarious reason to traumatise her. I apologised for sending the photo however evidence is always sent and because it wasn’t graphic I didn’t see an issue. I maybe should have put a trigger warning in the email.. This went on for half an hour and I ended up crying and calmly walking away saying I need representation or support with me if she was going to talk at me like that. She then sent an email saying I abused and manipulated her, that my tone was dismissive and making me out to be this horrible human being. 

 What I need advice on is A) was I right to send the photo of the mouse as evidence? Every other place I’ve worked at we would always send photo evidence. 
B) how do I respond to her email in which she seriously slanders me and has completely fabricated how I acted? Her email was to preempt any actions I might take to further this up the line and her way of making the first move and making me out to be hostile. 

 Thank you in advance, any advice is appreciated.",11Oct2020,1
336,"In a long distance relationship currently and its now over a week of absolutely no communication from her. I at first was worried that something happened to her, but after seeing her active on social media (tiktok), following new people, I now know I'm being ignored.

As stated, I have absolutely no idea as to why. We did not have an argument, or anything even remotely close to one. Our last conversation was very typical and even included her telling me she loves me. 

Even though she is ignoring me. She has not blocked me on anything. I've tried texting, calling, messaging through social media and email. I was genuinely concerned for a while, but all that concern has now turned into anger and confusion.

Our relationship has been wonderful from the start, and I went to her last month and spent more than 2 weeks with her, which was the best days of my life. Absolutely no red flags at any point. After deciding to be official, it took another 3 months to plan to get together in person.

I'd lay awake for hours trying to sleep. 
Issues waking up due to alarms not waking me up?!

On meds now and I can fall asleep on the drop of a hat, alarms are better at waking me up now but I can still sleep through them so I set multiple.

Here's the part that has me curious, whenever I sleep over at anyone elses house. I wake up minutes before my alarm EVERY. FUCKING.TIME. 
Which is like kinda great, I don't wake up anyone and I can slip out without disturbing anyone and I'm not late!

344,"So my friend used to be with this girl that everyone liked. She was super caring, worked hard, educated, friendly, and overall just great to be around. Well they broke up around a year ago, which is fine sometimes things don’t work out, not my life not my choice there. My friend felt strongly about it and didn’t ask my advice so I didn’t give it.

Almost right after he starts dating this new lady. She’s 8 years older than us and has a daughter (we are still in our 20s with no children of our own). She doesn’t look at the positives in nearly anything, has very strong opinions she could not back up with any facts/data, is slightly racist (which is weird because she’s an immigrant), and overall does not bring much to the group dynamic. BUT this guy has been a friend of mine and my girlfriend for years, so we are trying our best with the situation, trying to be the nicest people possible.. although it’s tough to forget how much better it used to be. 

Few months ago we take a trip and all ride together with the boat hooked up (her car). They end up fighting on the trip. She’s being extremely mean to him and is making it very public. After a day of this, she decides to leave. Mind you we are 5 hours from home and have towed a boat with us. Luckily his brother is there and can tow us back, although it’s 3 hours longer of a trip for him... The other guys there and I finally tell my friend just how much we do not like his new girlfriend. He completely understood why, especially given the situation we were in..

It’s been two months since all of this.. Since she has moved into his house, where we used to hang out most. The atmosphere isn’t great and my girlfriend and I have to hype ourselves up to be as nice as possible for my friends sake every time we go over. 

Of course I don’t want to overstep in a situation that’s not mine. The issue I’m having is I no longer want to hang out with my closest friend, because his girlfriend is awful to be around.

346,"Basically we work for a small casual production company that was badly hit during covid. Because of this, all the full timers have been converted to freelancers at much lesser pay, but we still do the projects that they assign us to at least get some income while we job hunt/work other jobs.

Before this, we started a non profit project to offer our free services to a few struggling companies. However due to a mixture of not regularly seeing everyone (all of us work remotely after being downgraded?retrenched?), different projects and commitments for all of us, we forgot to tell a client that we moved down a shoot date and now they want to forgo the free service. We feel terrible but we understand why and told our boss the news.

He told us off and said since we don't seem to be interested in the project anymore, we can just forget about the whole project and scrap it. Though it is our fault, it was genuinely an honest mistake on our part as we were dealing with the retrenchment effects and were all working other jobs to try to have an income. We've apologised and explained to him but he's still extremely pissed off and thinks we have no passion.

I'm not sure what to do here, as we (the freelancers involved) feel that this project is beneficial to the companies we're helping, but we can't continue if he decides to scrap it.

I also feel slightly indignant for us since he was so disinterested during the planning of the project himself when we were working on it as full timers. We had to constantly remind him about his portion of the work, and most of the time he doesn't end up doing his part, so we usually have to step in.

TL;DR : we pissed off our boss in an honest mistake and not sure what to do now to persuade him to continue a special project",11Oct2020,1

348,"Me and my mom have a pretty good relationship these days, I'd say she's one of the few people I'm very close with. However, when I was younger we went through a lot of rough patches that included verbal and physical abuse. I thought I was kind of over it, I guess? I'd get little flashes every now and then but I'd shove them out of my head. It seems to be more and more prevalent though, I don't know if it's because I'm otherwise stressed, or if it's just been slowly simmering under the surface. 

My mom has generally apologized (a lot of the issues we had were because I was autistic and she didn't know, she basically gave an all encompassing apology for things related), and we've talked about it to some extent. But it still bothers me. I don't even want anything in particular from her, I don't think there's anything she can do at this point, but I also know I need to deal with it personally. However, when I start thinking about it, I don't want to be around my mom and I can be a bit short with her, I don't want to ruin the relationship we currently have.

350,"Kind of a weird topic but this has recently been really bothering me. It seems that nowadays it is imperative that in order to even be able to function and thrive in society that you need to have a solid social media presence. Potential employers and colleagues will want to look up your LinkedIn profile as it acts as a medium for networking via the internet. Instagram seems the most important for people in my generation especially because you can use the app to meet new friends and potential partners as well as keep up with other people you know. People will also often try to look you up on instagram after meeting you for the first time irl.

I used to have an instagram with decent followers made up mostly of people that went to my high school that I honestly barely knew. After graduation, I remember one night I got super high and thought about how much of a loser I was and decided it’d be better to erase my social media presence entirely. I know completely regret the decision almost a year later and am not sure how to dig myself out of this hole. It would seem so weird and embarrassing to try to start over again and try to make social media accounts from scratch.

I am currently a university student, but I am taking time off this year. Last summer, I studied abroad in Italy for 3 months and loved the country.

As you know HR right off the bat asks me about salary expectations and I say I'm open but I would like 75 or 80. She says ok we usually start at 60 and then after 3 mo 65.

I feel like if they offer me that I would be disappointed BUT here's my situ:
1. We moved to a city 4 hrs drive away from this potential job to live with family for free. We'd have to move again and probably rent a place in the new city.
2. Left my unproductive 4 yr postdoc to move and be closer to family, so I'm currently unemployed.

I'm currently in high school and have been looking for careers i should major in. I have been doing research here and there for the past few months. My first thought was animator, but i quickly shut that idea out. 
After that i thought about something forensics related, but i heard that they get paid pretty bad. (correct me if i'm wrong) 
Then i thought about going into anything biology related. I searched around and the most common thing that came up was anything medical. I thought i could become a surgeon. Besides art, biology is my best subject. Thinking about going to med school sounded genuinely fun in my eyes. The more i thought about it the more i thought it would be a good idea.
I looked at the requirements and i almost started crying right then and there. It sounds pathetic i know. I saw you need a 3.5 gpa to even get in. I live in a 3rd world country and if i want to study internationally (which i do) i have to get even better marks than that.
We don't use gpa here but i don't even come close. My marks in bio alone are not good enough to even think of applying.
I thought I'd at least have a chance, but now i don't know what i should do.
Should i give up? We can't afford tutoring so i dont know how i could get my marks up otherwise. I know it's stupid to reach for the stars when you're at rock bottom, but i want to know what you guys think.

Tl;dr: I want to be a surgeon but I'm too stupid. Should i just give up?",11Oct2020,1
373,"Throwaway for rather obvious reasons

i (14M) absolutely suck at personal hygiene. I goes from simple brushing teeth to showering - I just suck at it.

I forgot it so fucking often, that I might end up not doing either for weeks. A year ago, I didn't shower and brush my teeth for 2 months, didnt even clean my clothes. 

I know how disgusting it is, I know that it's not healthy, but I don't know why I can't do it. If I am lucky, I get to brush my teeth and shower once a week. If I get lucky that is.

My room also smells absolutely disgusting, since I don't clean it that often, not even having my window open helps. I myself know, that I smell, and it makes me really self-concious.

Evertime I am in school or near any form of live (even cats or smth) i make myself as small as i can, to not get as close to them.

If you answere that it is just puberty, yeah no shit, that won't help though. I don't wanna be like this, I want to be able to be near other persons without being ashamed of just standing there.

I don't even clean my glasses reguarly, and deodorant doesn'T seem to help that much. 

This also goes to wearing braces; I have to wear braces because i have over 1cm overbite (correct word?), but I forget it often. Like I don't wear it, more often then I do.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I talk to my parents about this, they just say ""just do XYZ!"", but I simply can't. But I want to. So yeah, my parents aren't a good help either. All they do is tell 

me that I smell, and that I should shower, but te problem is that I can't ""just"" do it.

Please help me, it has gotten to the point of me not even being able to bare my own smell :(",11Oct2020,1

My cousin (16F) just started dating boyfriend (20M) recently, I know this is not okay but my aunt and sister keep encouraging their relationship. How do I show them or my cousin that a 20M being so invested in 16F is a massive red flag?

The reason I think this is a red flag at minimum is because my cousin does not know anything about herself. She only just stopped going to tafe on top of school (Was doing bridging nurse courses) because she realised that she only went to please her mum and grandma. She heavily relies on what her mum or my sister are doing for hobbies, so to start dating a 20 year old as her first boyfriend screams grooming to me. This is also amped by the fact that neither my aunt or sister are mentally stable and cannot hold a healthy relationship themselves.

385,"So yesterday I had a belated birthday party at my house. After the party, he had to go pick up his sister from work and he wanted to get some boba too. He invited me to come along and I said sure. It was getting dark and we stopped by the pet store first, and as he was driving out of the parking lot to get on the main road, he made a left turn and almost hit a car on its right side. We barely missed it because my friend didn't see the other car. My friend didn't slow down either, he was going full-speed-left-turn, and when he saw the car he was about to hit he swerved a little to the left. 

When he realized his mistake he immediately apologized to me and said he's never been so close to a collision before. He must have apologized like 10 times and he promised to be much more careful. I wasn't really shaken up at the time. I'm very calm and don't really panic about a lot of things. I just told him it's okay and that all that matters is we didn't hit the car and he just needs to be more aware. After a few minutes, that was that and there were no more incidents like that the rest of the night. 

I've been in the car with him a few times before and he never has gotten that close to an accident. I think maybe it was just because it's night time and he must have been tired.

When I was trying to get to sleep last night, I kept replaying the memory in my head when I was about to fall asleep. I knew that I was a little scared but I didn't realize it was bothering me so much. I haven't been so close to death before so I guess it makes sense for me to be so shaken up.

392,"  I apologize if this is a bit raw. I wrote this on a whim and decided to post it without editing so that I can get my issue across because its quite abstract. I'm happy, but I am not happy. I am happy, as in I don't really feel as sad as I was before, but the happiness I feel now doesn't really feel that satisfying. Each day seem repetitive, and I feel like all the years I have lived through has amounted to nothing. I'm not good at anything was good in anymore be it singing or studying. I feel like I am just a hollow shell of my past self and that I am in my prime; like this is the best I can ever be.

   It's like everybody else around me is so motivated to follow their passions and study so hard, and yet here I am, stuck in the same place like an abandoned truck on some highway. I lost the only thing I was passionate about, and try to convince myself and everyone else that I want to be a doctor or a computer engineer, when deep down I just want truck-kun from the mangas and manhwas to knock me over so that I can be isekaiied to another world with brilliant skills and fame. When I was really down a few years back, my world was just flashes of black and white. And now, life is yellow tinted, like I am there physically, but mentally I am just a bystander in my own life, and I just feel...numb. I'm happy, but I'm numb. 

  And I often feel envious. I feel like I have only one life and somehow I picked one of the shorter sticks. I often look at other people, famous idols, even my past self and feel jealous. I used to be beautiful, so up and motivated, defying the adults and doing the impossible, then puberty hit me like a darn truck. Now I am here, and people who knew me in the past just look shocked when they see me now. Stunned how someone can fall so far. Whenever I think about all this, something hits me.

I'm only 16.

  So to all the adults out there, am I the only one feeling this way? Is this how the rest of my life is going to be? I'm happy, but I'm tired. Life seems so bland. I mean, I don't hate it, but it seems pointless to live this way.

407,"So I've got major fear standing up for myself and this has spilled over into my relationship with my landlords particularly the male one. It started with oversharing information, I had just got away from abusive family I mean literally put on welfare and not allowed to leave or have my own money, and I was brainwashed with turn the other cheek thing so I've never stood up for myself. 
So it started with oversharing information by me. And then they know that I'm a struggling Christian so they come over for a social visit to invite me to their church. I decline. Then its mockery of my hobby. 
Then one day I ask them if they'd been inside while I was sleeping and the wife landlord says no and the husband WILL be coming over to which I dont know why I didnt say no and felt like a child. Hours later he walks in and asks ""oh thought you were sleeping!"" I could barely muster words or tell him to get out. I dont know why my brain just completely misses I'm being abused. Next time its appearing on the lawn to mow it with no notice at all. Then it was trying to trick me into paying them rent twice through cashapp. I'm getting the vibe of I know where this is going again. I've dealt with this before from landlords who would search houses while people were out and my aunt told me to turn the other cheek so I'm kinda f*cked up from all that.
There was a viewing for my room yesterday(I'm moving out this month) and they stroll in saying ""Hi Morgaine"" and i ask if they could've knocked to which he said ""oh I did but the door just opened"". It was locked. We talk damages, cleaning, whatever and then the male landlord stands there legs spread and arms crossed asking me where I'm going and doing and I pathetically could hardly look him in the eye or answer the questions. 
Before I leave I really wanted to bring up the just entering thing again but left so they could show the room. 
At that point after getting in my car I start to think and start shaking with rage and pull my car back round to my block and they're already gone. They left lights on again. I text them and ask them to come back and they give me that usual of they're on their way to the hospital to blow me off again. I blow up and call them out on literally everything. How this punking game stops, the lies, making me a b*tch. I tell them we're going to talk in person and I'll be here all day if they try to walk in again and if not I told them they'll meet me in the house tomorrow and they knock this time or there'll be a situation. 

I felt so exhilarated I felt like I actually got some of my balls back but intense fear that I wanted pack my bags and run in case they file a mental health report or call the police but thought nah that probably wont happen I'm justified and stayed. They didnt respond to my texts at all.

Now my priority is how I'm going to tell them off confidently and dominate the space(its literally my apartment..) as I should and keep this from happening again. They should be here in 3 hours. I read some of an assertiveness book last night but this is going to be all balls.

It was about my mother's fertility issues ( I was born after 7-8 years of my parents' marriage because of that issue) I told her to stop talking about family problems and talk about regular stuffs instead. I told her not to talk about me and my parents and not to spill personal stuffs. She literally screamed at me for saying this and now she's not talking to me and giving me attitude. She told me that I don't need to teach her how to speak and she can speak they way she wants to. And I said , at least you could consider not to tell them all about my family because I need my privacy.  I said this calmly. But still she was screaming and acting rude. I feel helpless. I got no one to talk to. I have no friends. My colleagues are just toxic.

She's been diagnosed with dementia and anger management issues since 2008. And she doesn't want to go to therapy. She is kind of dysfunctional. She bursts out of anger if anyone utters the word 'therapy' in front of her. Once I told her that I need therapy for my anxiety and depression ( not severe though but still I want to get better) and she told me that i was mental because I talked about therapy. I tried to make her understand what therapy actually is but she didn't listen and mocked at me instead.  Also she has crappy hygiene sense. Because she doesn't wear mask properly and goes out frequently. If I tell her to wash her hands she yells at me. 

I still don't have enough money to move out and haven't got my license yet. I took the test last month. But I failed and she cussed at me.  She was pushing me to work harder before graduating from high school just because she wanted to brag about it. I was recovering from an attempted harassment by an uber driver and i was at a loss.  I had no money. I was absent from school for days. I gained weight and going through phases. She was body shaming me all along and told me that I will never find love. Whenever I needed a little refreshment on the weekends and asked her if I could hang out with my friends, she didn't let me. I've lost weight recently and she started body shaming me all over again.  She's been controlling me ever since I moved in with her (for 2 years). She doesn't even know what she wants in life.

I might have to stay with her for a year or two. Because I can't afford to move out again. Living with her is somewhat affordable for me.

413,"So I’m in my 40s. I’ve had people telling me that I’m going bald since I was in my 20s. Yesterday I was giving myself a quarantine hair cut (it’s easy to give yourself a pompadour). But when I was working on the back I noticed the giant bald spot. Truth is I have been rocking a pompadour and / or a pho-awake for to the last 5-10 years to cover the thinking hair.

414,"So a little rundown of what is going on in my life at the moment. I was working for Lowes and it turned out that the people I worked with were super lazy and I ended up picking up their slack every single day, on top of the manager being a narcissistic jerk off. About a month after receiving that job and working 5 days a week, I decided I did not want to stay any longer. I had applied to two different jobs, the first being Panera and about a week later to a company that fulfills prescriptions over the phone. Luckily I received an interview offer from Panera and made an appointment to interview. It went really well, I expressed that having fulfilled every role in a restaurant before I felt I had enough experience to take on a lead role in the company. Interviewer agreed and offered me a position nearer to my home. I’ve started training and they offered me another $1/hr up front on my first day saying that they wanted to groom me for leadership and possibly manager at some point. I am enjoying it and I feel comfortable being back in the food industry. However I also interviewed with another company that takes phone calls from people ordering prescription medication and this job offers full benefits, and a pay I’ve been dreaming of since I started working. I accepted this job and plan on pursuing and following through with it as it will surely change my life as a result. My question is do I bother training at Panera for only 4 hours a day for the next week, maybe get a few more hours the week after, and then quit because training for the new BETTER job starts in 2 weeks. I do DoorDash on the regular and make decent money $150-$200 a week, so I could do that in the meantime, I already paid my bills and I have savings to last a while so I’m not stressed about money. I am also a bit behind in school and I need to get caught up, I can do so but these Panera shifts are in the middle of my day and it’s a bit disruptive to getting schoolwork done. Panera says you have 90 days and you can terminate employment. Do I bother even showing up anymore? Am I just wasting my, and the company’s time and money? I feel like I could be more productive in the next few weeks without having to show up for a few hours five days a week.",11Oct2020,1

416,"Bf got the cat while he was living with me (till before the pandemic). We raised him for an year before I moved out, so I've been pretty attached to him too. He was still a baby, our baby. 

This morning, he fell off the 24th floor chasing a bird and died. Bf woke me up with the news, I couldn't believe it for so long. That cat was my solace in one of the hardest years I've had. He was incredibly goofy, incredibly beautiful. 

I'm doing okay, I've been very upset yes but I can't grieve in front of my family as they can't know I have a boyfriend. I also don't have a good relationship with them and they've been giving me a really hard time today for some reason. So I'm just sort of numb now. 

So the problem with that is that is I'm having trouble supporting my boyfriend with this. He's absolutely devastated, blaming himself for being careless, and thinking that this is some form of karma to teach him a lesson. It's hard for him because he has no family he's close with, no close friends around, just his roommates who are really nice but whom he can't open up in front of much. The cat was his life. 

Initially, I was able to support him because I was feeling equally awful and I could empathize. By the evening, due to the situation with the family, I'm numb to all emotions.

418,"so my friends and I have created a secret santa, much like we do every year. This year I got lucky and picked someone i'd really like to buy a gift for. So here's the dilemma: 

I want to buy my friend a gift that is related to his mental health issues (among other joke gifts). Both he and I have struggled with serious mental health issues in the past, and this is actually one of the things we bonded over when I came into this group. Everyone in the group is aware that both of us have a history of mental health issues, and others have had lesser experiences themselves, so they are supportive. However, the group is mostly made up of men. They were all close friends from school and over time I and other girlfriends have joined the group. 

the gift i'd like to give is a book that provides coping skills specifically for men with mental health issues. Alternatively, i'd like to give one of those little ""mindfulness card"" boxes, that contain little words of encouragement and motivation. I think he would be appreciative of these gifts and might get some benefit out of them. However, i'm concerned as to how he might feel if he received this gift in front of all of his friends. So i guess i'm asking how others would feel about it if this happened to them? Whether you think it would be a good idea? Other ideas that might be more suitable?

421,"My brother has really poor hygiene practices. My mom thinks it's laziness but personally I think my brother is in the spectrum. I don't mean to be insulting to people with autism, but I once read an article about how in a certain type of autism, some have trouble comprehending the need for hygiene, which I think is the case for my brother since his failure to take care of his body is just not normal for a person his age, and sometimes even beyond comprehension.

My brother's teeth is just awful. His teeth are practically rotting and he loves eating sweets. We remind him from time to time to brush his teeth but he'd just nod or ignore us. I got angry this evening because I've been living with my mom (along with my sister and brother) for the past few days and I realized that I almost never notice my brother go downstairs to the bathroom to brush his teeth at night. This was later confirmed when I noticed that there are only two toothbrushes in the sink (my mom's and sister's). 

The other day I also found out that my brother pees on our party wall (wall separating our lot from the neighbor's). My mom doesn't know about this. I got furious with my brother when I found out because there is literally an outdoor/2nd bathroom right next to the party wall and there was nobody using it! And even if both of our bathrooms were occupied, it's not an excuse to pee on the wall.

My brother is a good guy and he almost always listens. He's a smart kid too which makes me suspect that this isn't just laziness. I think I hit a limit when I found out that he doesn't even keep a toothbrush, which means it's been weeks probably since the last time he brushed his teeth.

426,"Caution: it's a little long read after this point. It's just details for the question tho, so you can understand the question even without those details.

He says he suffers from mental health problems, which I understand, and i try to support him however I can. I'm not an expert in that area so I do the best I can and admittedly, I get tired of talking about negative things and the problems he faces all the time. I can't even joke about them bcz I know that's very inappropriate and that means conversations aren't really that light whenever we text. We meet sometimes (different schools so we meet about once in a few weeks) and those conversations are better but even then, he doesn't really continue any topics I'm interested about.
For example, I was telling him about a whole story plot I've made up with lots of details in my mind and he kept changing the subject. I had to force it back into our convo.
On texts, he'd ask me how a test went, for example, and then when I do tell him all about it, he doesn't even respond properly, just starts a new topic about his new glasses. That makes me feel like, in an underinformed way, that maybe he just asked the question as a formality rather than bcz he wanted to hear about it.

I'm sorry for the long read. Please let me know how to solve this problem. I don't want to tell him he's doing anything wrong in case he isn't, in case it's just that he needs time with his mental health. On the other hand, I don't want drama to be there about how I want to talk about myself when he has more problems.

As a last note, we do talk about light subjects and school and our days, it's just that mostly he's the one who picks the topic. I don't get to pick what we'll talk about.

I appreciate all responses. Please tell me if I'm being wrong, I'll appreciate that too. Thank you",11Oct2020,1

428,"So my living situation is as follows - I (22F) live with my dad (51M), sister (19F), and brother (21M). We live in a 6 bedroom house in south east England because we used to live with my dad’s girlfriend and children but it didn’t work out. 

We’re now selling our house and it’s looking like we’ll get an offer on it soon but the problem is, once we’ve split the final cost of this house and paid off the mortgage that will not leave us with enough money to buy a 4 bedroom house. Honestly it’ll be tricky to get a 3 bedroom house with the money we’re left with.

My thought is that I’m the only one of my siblings who could almost afford to move out as my sister is on apprenticeship wages and my brothers been out of work since before covid so has no money or savings. I don’t have a lot of savings either and I don’t earn much each month. But I don’t know what we could do once this house is sold. 

I’m concerned that if I do have to move out so they wouldn’t need a 4 bedroom house that I wouldn’t comfortably be able to afford my own place... I earn around 1200 a month but a one bedroom or even a studio flat around here is at least 800 and that’s just the rent not including the bills. My boyfriend has good living circumstances so does not want to get a place with me (but I don’t get on with his housemate so wouldn’t want to move in with them).

I’m looking to save money so I can get a new place (because I don’t really like living with my roomates) and I want to move to Colorado and then figure out what I really want as far as a career goes.


One of the jobs is for fedex as a driver . It’s starts at 7:30 and I’m paid 130$ a day for completing a route. Most days probably go till 5. There is preobably no benefits. The job is probably 30 minutes sway from my house and I think it would enjoy driving . They said they would often need me to work on weekends and it would be 5-6 days a week 


The other is an industrial eletric job. They offered me 14 an hour. I have the ability to move up and learn about electrical work, and I could continue this somewhere else if I wanted to. It will be challenging work, on lifts but I would meet some cool people. With this job I would probably get steady weekly hours. This job would have benefits, and sometimes I’d have to work overtime



So after doing some math 
I’d probably make 550$ on a 40 hour work week doing the electrical work and 650 on a 5 day work week delivering for fed ex.

436,"Before I begin I should preface I few things. I work for my father in a professional office setting. About a 2 years ago now, I got some one a job here. We will call him Tim. At first, Tim was doing great! We’re in sales so it’s a lot of cold calling and customer service. We are also pretty friendly with one another and I would consider him a friend of mine. 

Well, fast forward to now, and Tim has been slacking. Coming in late, going on very long lunches, not calling like he should be. 

Now, this upsets me for a couple of reasons. I got him this job &amp; I feel that it is a poor reflection on me. I also have to pick up his slack and fix a lot of his mistakes considering it is just myself, my father, and Tim in the office. My dad has mentioned that he is on thin ice and needs to pick up his slack soon or it could be an issue. 

Yesterday, I went into the office to finish something up when I heard Tim’s fan was still on (another thing that has been an issue for some time, he never turns his fan off lol) so I walked over to his area to shut it off. That’s when my gaze caught something that looked weird. A large can in an open drawer covered in a paper towel. Obviously, curiosity got the best of me and I took the paper towel off. It was a half drank “jamaican me crazy” alcoholic beverage. I just couldn’t believe my eyes. So, now it’s clear to me that Tim has been drinking on the job. 

I’m just kinda at a loss on exactly how to go about this. Tim is someone that I have considered a friend, but obviously I have my Father &amp; his business’s back more. 

I was thinking (and hoping) that my Dad would see it himself tomorrow morning so I don’t have to get in the middle of it. The chances of that happening are pretty slim, so I know I am probably going to have to do something.

I (18F) am currently too young to really have kids, but the prospect of having them one day is something I really look forward to. My own parents were not exactly the best at being parents, and I look forward to giving my (hypothetical) child everything I didn’t get (mostly emotionally) while growing up. I’ve been with my boyfriend (19M) for roughly 2 years now, and would like to imagine an eventual family with him. 

I struggle with a couple mental health issues that do very much affect me in my life. I am not medicated for them, although I have dipped my toes in that pool in the past. I am typically a very driven, determined, and open minded person. My bad days do happen, but I try my best to recognize the difference between what I’ve labeled my “actual feelings” and my “unchecked emotions.” My entire (pretty much no exaggeration) maternal side of my family struggles with various mental health issues. They are incredibly loving people who I would never wish out of my life and have gotten me through some of my hardest times, but there’s no doubt that poor mental health kind of runs in the family. 

Is it irresponsible, or selfish, for me to want kids when I have reason to believe they will inherit the good ol family tradition? Or that they may be subject to my own poor mental health? Or both? I have zero fear of myself being abusive. In my other relationships (friends, family, SO) I feel as if I am very loving, but some days I just know I’m hard to deal with.

It looks unhealthy and skinny in my opinion (you can see it’s hip bones and many ribs). (And I have little to no knowledge of horses). Their yard is nothing but dirt and some weeds. I have fed the horse treats that we had but I feel like something needs to be done (some type of animal rescue/protection). I brought it up to my family and they all unanimously said/yelled at me “DONT GET INTO OTHER PEOPLES BUSINESS” 
They live in a not so great area, surrounded by not so great people and I believe they are afraid of retaliation. My family has animals of their own (cows, chickens etc) and living in Florida, people be crazy. They’re afraid of the neighbors possibly poisoning their animals. Which I understand, but it seriously breaks my heart looking at this poor horse suffer! 
Is there anyone who can guide me or give me advice on what I should/shouldn’t do? 
I’ve never met the people that own the horse, but haven’t heard great things from my family about them (insert Jerry Springer hell matches and crazy family dynamics) and apparently they had a different colored horse in worse shape, and one day they saw them digging a big hole and never saw the horse again.

444,"Don’t know if this is the best subreddit to post this on but thought it was worth a shot.

I’m 20F, haven’t had significant skin problems past acne as a teen and some dry skin issues when I visited northern Europe.

I’ve always had kinda wrinkly skin around my eyes but recently under my left eye the wrinkles got deeper and additionally the skin was very sensitive and dry and flaky. I left it alone for months not thinking much of it but then I went to a much more humid country for a few months and I was a little surprised nothing changed. In fact it got worse as it would get itchy. I continued to use the same skin products I had been using for years but my mother gave me an eye cream to try and treat the dry skin. Got a stye on my upper eyelid from that and stopped using the cream. Skin under the eye remained dry. Now about a month later I’m back in the country where the problem first developed and it still hasn’t gotten better. Haven’t really tried to do anything about it but continue using the same stuff I had used for years because they never caused my any problems.

Well yesterday my eye started hurting and I’m pretty sure I’ve developed another stye, this time on my lower eyelid.

Just don’t really know what to do, the dry skin was a little annoying at first then really annoying when it started itching more, but bow the whole stye and eye hurting situation really just makes me wanna figure it out. Haven’t been to a dermatologist because of the COVID situation or else I would’ve already. Anyone have any advice other than that?",11Oct2020,1

452,"I could use some advice on moving on from a situation and terrible feelings. About two years ago, I became bffs with someone from work. He (25M) and I spent every day together for over a year, I would drive him to &amp; from work and we would hangout at night. Eventually I met his girlfriend (28F) of six years that he had been on and off with. Didn’t know he was in a relationship but I became friends with her too, she was friendly. 
In the meantime, my work friend and I had started a heavy adderall addiction. (Sometimes hard drugs when we couldn’t find any.) I am not making excuses, I just wasn’t ready for the spiral that he took me down. We would be taking over 80mg on average just so I could get through school and work &amp; so he could get through work in general, it turned into thousands of dollars gone and a friendship that relied on drugs. 

Fast forward a little, because I really need help. I’m in this situation where I stay every night at my 25 year old friend’s place, which is really his girlfriends parents basement, doing drugs and hanging out as his girlfriend occasionally was there. She relentlessly asked me if he ever cheated on her or was abusing drugs, I said no. I’ve always prided myself in being an honest and good person, so she never questioned me, but I lied constantly to this girl. 
On his end, he told me she was crazy and stupid on a daily basis, but it got so much worse. He would say “I would never have stupid fcking kids with someone like her” or “I enjoy spending time with you more than my girlfriend, I just need to respect my situation.” 
They were my only two friends, and I did a lot of bad things that have been driving me insane. 

One day in April, I told my friends girlfriend that we had taken adderall together before. She wasn’t mad at me but heartbroken by this boy. If she knew everything else, she would be shattered. But she always told me “she needs to know the truth, and he never gives it.” He lost his goddamn mind screaming at us both, saying he was going to kill himself and throwing things. He called us names and worse, but I have been no contact since. (Except for keeping an eye on him for two weeks after we were friends. I sadly regret this now, he wasn’t suicidal but did save his relationship with her.) I need advice on putting this past me. 

Tldr: (20f) my (25m) only friend I had introduced me to adderall &amp; I became heavily addicted. We spent every waking moment together at work or hanging out until he lost his shit and screamed about how (his gf and) I ruined his life and he should just kill himself. His girlfriend (28f) should know the truth and it haunts me. 
How do I get them out of my mind? Should she know all of this? Most importantly, how do I get out of this “I really want adderall” mentality?

The thing that really fucks me up is that everything I have been doing and I am planning to do is because I am afraid.

457,"Hi reddit, this is my first post and I just wanted to get some perspective and insight on this. 

Today my friend hit me up because they were feeling really sad about life, and talked to me about how no one really cared for them, the struggle to connect with people and not have a real group of friends to get together with, and how they felt incredibly lonely. This struck a chord with me as I have had these feelings for the past few years—always wondering what was wrong with me and feeling so empty because I struggled to connect to people and form meaningful relationships. I barely see people I know, generally don’t have anyone to go to when I have things on my mind and mostly keep to myself. Though I’ve always wished to have those relationships with people and have pushed myself to, it just never became something deeper and this has really affected me mentally. 

When my friend mentioned these issues I empathised with them and we talked about it, however I couldn’t shake off just feeling this sense of frustration, or sadness hearing about it because this friend has so many things I’m envious of. They talk about having no one who cares for them, but I know for a fact that he has some solid people who really care for him, are always there for him when he has a problem, and he has mentioned these people to me and how they’ve helped him through hard times and give him advice. During our conversation, he showed me screenshots of what other friends said to him today that made him feel better, and another friend even headed to his place to deliver food because he was feeling this way. 

Hearing this, I couldn’t help but feel frustrated at him because he has exactly what I’ve always wanted yet still felt lonely, but also frustrated at myself because people are allowed to be sad about things and it’s not my place to dictate that. 

These days I’m starting to feel a bit better about being on my own and not having a lot of people around, but listening to him and how sad he was despite having these friendships—I just couldn’t help but feel like crap and wonder if I should be feeling worse because I lack those relationships. Sorry if this post is a bit all over the place, just looking for some insight because I feel really conflicted and lost.",11Oct2020,1
458,"I posted this in another subreddit a while back but it didn't get too many responses unfortunately.

Me (24m) and my bestfriend (30m), we will call him E, use to work together at a grocery store for a few years. We use to have so much fun working with each other and we had so many inside jokes that we would use and we would hang out after work as well quite often. Our common interest is work so we would talk about that a lot and all the best/worst things that come along with it as well. My bestfriend has also been through so much with me the past 5 years and is always there for me whenever i need anything from him. About a year and a half ago I got promoted to an assistant manager and got transferred to a new store while he recently quit for a better job opportunity somewhere else.
  
I also need to mention that E has a wife, 4 kids and a new born puppy while i am single with no kids. We don't have anything in common outside of work and we don't   have the same job anymore so everything that he ever talks about is either about his kids or his new puppy. We never have any constructive conversations that have anything to do with our interests because they are just not the same. Its always about what he did that day with the kids and something new his puppy is doing and all the drama going on in his life that has nothing to do with me and i am not going to lie, I just can't relate to any of it and I am just not interested at all. All we ever do is smoke weed at his place and just sit and talk about his kids and puppy. I get so bored at his place really quick and end up leaving about an hour later. He always texts and when I don't respond to him because I have nothing more to add to the conversation, he usually either double or triple texts me asking to hang out. I feel like he is just using me for my weed but i am not sure because he always wants to hang out with me and it is kind of implied that he wants to smoke.

What should I do? I asked her "" What if I don't want you to go?"" she replied ""Well on Tuesday, we aren't anything so does it matter? And it's my life so this is me. Even if we are dating I'm gonna go out with guys"" We call each other every day and on average we talk on the phone for about 4 hours a day, we joke around and we have a fun time.

463,"I have worked for and with the same supervisor for 7 years in financial planning. He took a huge risk on hiring me because I had no idea about anything relating to finances, economics, stock markets, or even much common sense (I was about one year clean/sober at that point).

Since then, I have grown as a person and professional. I have been asked to speak at conferences, give presentations to my peers, and have obtained the Series 7 and Series 66 licenses. My supervisor depends on me, and he will be devastated when I tell him and likely take it as a personal insult.

464,"This is going to be long, but I have been thinking about it for a while. I originally posted a situation in AITA, which kind of got me thinking on the matter. 

I have a friend who I have known for ten years. Now she has been an amazing friend. She has always been there for me. She has helped me in all of my situations, cared for me, fought for me and so on. I really cannot deny anything that she has ever done for me. Sometimes I can never pay off, and I will forever stay grateful for those.

The issue is that she became friends with my fiance through me. And they always refers to him as her brother. She is very reserved when it comes to her matter, so the only two people extremely close to her are me and my fiance. When I had started dating my fiance I was a bit uncomfortable of her constantly hugging him, or running her hands through his hair, or holding his arm and so on. My fiance uncomfortable as well. I talked to him and he understood what I felt and he made her stop. She was upset but she didn't say anything. However, once I was not there and she kept trying to hug my fiance saying that I wasn't around. 

I have a habit of sending my fiance cooked meals, or deliveries when I know he's least expecting it. It's like our thing. She started doing the same. Saying she's her sister and she likes when she sends him somthing. I was not comfortable with this at all. I told my fiance that this is our thing and Im not comfortable with her sending him all this stuff. My fiance agreed and told her repeatedly in a subtle manner to stop. However, she never got the hint. Or even if she did, she didnt stop sending anything. To the point, she stopped telling me altogether that she was sending something. My fiance stopped eating anything she would send and it would just stay there. Or he would make her send it to be, so he can ""pick"" it up from me, which never happened.

During the pandemic, things were already hard enough. I couldn't see my fiance. And there were no chances of meeting at all. My fiance said that he will meet me before anyone when we're able to. And I guess that helped me a little. Now my friend whenever she wants something to be done with rushes to my fiance. Whether it is buying a phone, need guidance of home decor, needs to reboot her laptop, etc. As if she's finding ways to meet him. My fiance sticking to his words avoided her as much as he could. Knowing how he promised to meet me before anyone else. There was this one time sje got visibly upset and fought with my fiance that I was wrong in not letting her meet him. I was very angry, but I didn't say anything and just stayed quiet because they are friends and maybe I was overreacting. 

Now my fiance and I have been going through certain issues. We're better, progressing and there is no doubt that it is a long way to go. Whenever me and my friend would talk, she always asked about how was my fiance, where he was. How he was doing and all. Now I will not deny that she did help us during this time. She did help with the fights. Fought from my end, fought from his end and so on. My fiance being tired of everything told her that her constantly refering to him as her brother was annoying him and politely asked her to stop. She was upset but agreed. Next time they talked, she called him her brother again. This got my fiance upset and he stopped talking to her. After a while he talked to her again, she again referred to him as her brother, he got angry and stopped talking to her. The next time they communicated was through me. I was delivering their messages to each other. She was very upset at him not talking to her or letting her call him her brother. 

Now the issue that has been going on, she had not diclosed a few things to my fiance previously that he found out laterwards, and it had caused some misunderstandings. To clear out her name, she pushed me under the bus. Made it look like that I was the culprit, she had nothing to do with anything and that she was not wrong at all. She knew all the details from my end, and I was so hurt and angry that she would say such a thing. I fought with her and we haven't talked since. I really don't know what to do. I think my fiance was better at this entire issue, and he kind of cut all contact with her but I dont know, I feel burdened by all she has done for me, but when I think about all of these things (Im probably forgetting some) they just make me so mad. She does something like this, knowing I get mad, and then cries that she didnt mean to. Her intentions were pure and that makes me feel bad about the entire issue. So what do I do?

(We’re all in our twenties.) When we first became friends she was very possessive over me, and an ex said he felt like she liked me. I didn’t think anything of it but five years on she’s still a bit possessive and always makes negative comments about my partners. Three years ago Lucy met Felix, who’s now become one of my best friends too. They got engaged last year. 
Lucy, Felix, me and a few others had a little get together this pst weekend and got quite drunk. Lucy was incredibly drunk and whilst everyone else was chatting, she pulled me to sit on the floor with her and told me she was in love with me. I tried to laugh it off and said “I love you too!” but in a friend way. She said “no, I’m IN love with you”, all of this a few feet away from Felix. Again I just laughed out of awkwardness but then she tried to kiss me, and kept saying we should fuck. I felt uncomfortable at this point so removed myself and Felix took her to bed, he didn’t hear any of it though. 
It was obvious in the morning she didn’t remember any of it, but now I don’t know what I should do. It makes sense, all the signs are there. She gets upset when I mention hookups and past behaviour of her around me and men has always been weird.

467,"I work in healthcare as an optho tech with on-the-job training. Ive been there about 1.5 months. I’ve been picking things up pretty quickly, but any mistake is (usually) treated with very harsh criticism, often in front of patients (example - I had patient with Parkinson’s, he couldn’t stay still long enough for a scan. I got yelled in front of that patient). Obviously I don’t have any formal training, so I often miss things that were never taught to me in the first place or I didn’t know I had the authority to do (send in prescriptions). 

Most of the time I go to and leave work miserable, and the rest of my day is ruined because I’m so upset and feeling stupid and worthless. Sometimes work is fine or even good, but 3/5 days of the week it’s awful, especially Fridays - which then ruin my weekend dreading going back Monday. I got an Apple Watch recently to track my health and my heart rate has been elevated from the start of work -&gt; right when I go to sleep. 

It’s not really like I can just transfer to a different doctor because it’s only her, and I’m the only tech - so quitting would mean she’s without a tech &amp; I’m without a job.

Another lady at work said she’s seen techs quit after 2 weeks because she’s so harsh.

468,"I moved very far away from my dysfunctional family 4 years ago. During that time I managed to pick myself up, find a decent job (after 3 years of hell), and get myself back into therapy to BEGIN healing. During that time my grandma got sick again, and 12 years after her first diagnosis she died back in April. We were all shocked as she went downhill within days. I mourned and grieved alone as we were all cautious because of COVID. We made the choice to have her cremated and put her memorial on hold indefinitely.

My mom retired to take care of her years ago. So I did not have to worry too much about her being out and exposed to covid. Now my mom has cancer just 6 months after my grandma died. I am shocked, angry, and scared like hell! I left my home and rushed here to care for her. I plan on working from home and caring for her. She lives with my uncle who plans on going back to church once it opens. Its a small church (10 people) and they wear masks and distance. But I DO NOT want that shit around my mother it is not worth the risk! 

One major point of conflict with my family was they are religious fanatics. I am considered the black sheep heathen. My mom usually listens when I threaten to disown her. But how can I control my stupid uncle?! Adult services? The police? What can I do? I would take her back home with me if it was not for COVID? My mental health is suffering, I hate being back here with so many horrible memories. Being here is dangerous for me, which I plan on discussing with my therapist.

469,"Basically, after university my friends all moved to London. I didn’t because I didn’t get a job right away, and I wanted to go back and spend time with my family since I’d been gone for four years. I was pretty sad at first, felt like I was left out and I was desperately looking for jobs in London to join my friends again. Now I have a good job and I’ve moved there... and I absolutely hate being away from my family.

My mum was recently diagnosed with early stage cancer and was luckily booked quickly into radiotherapy and has finished her course. I came back from London a month after moving there to help her whilst she was going through treatment. I was miserable that first month in London and was glad to go back, I stuck around for a while to wait covid out.

Well now I’m back in London and miserable again, but even worse now is that I had a real realisation when I was looking after my mum and the whole fear with COVID that I want to be close to my family. To be able to pop in for lunch or dinner, to give my mum a hug when she’s down. 

The thing is being close to them means I will be away from my friends and will need to search for a new job. The area isn’t the best career wise, the next big city is 40 ish minutes away which is where I could be transferred to if wanted to stay with the same company. I’d need to buy a car and somewhere to rent, likely on my own because most of my home friends have moved on. 

I’m honestly not sure what to do. I can’t leave for a while anyway because my lease doesn’t end until late January. I also don’t want to leave my friends and my social life, I’m happy around them but that’s okay for a day or so a week. 

I’d really appreciate advice!",11Oct2020,1
470,"This is so dumb, but it is seriously starting to affect our friendship and she is one of my closest friends. I have literally never felt this jealous of a friend before and I don’t know how to get over it. And it’s also such a stupid reason: we play this competitive video game together every evening and recently she has gotten so much better than me. To be fair, she is at least 50 level above me, but she plays more difficult champions than I do. 

Whenever I get a success in the game, she genuinely cheers me on and seems so happy for me, but when she is obviously better than me I just get this sting in my heart of not being good enough, and her being more “deserving” of playing that game than I do. Gaming was always my passion and as a girl it was hard to find another girl just as passionate about it as me. But now, seeing her surpass me and get praise from our mutual male gamer friends just makes me feel so small. I really don’t want this stupid thing to stand in between our friendship but being confronted with it on a daily basis raises feelings I never experienced before.",11Oct2020,1

472,"Hi guys,

I'm really freaked out and don't know where to put this. So me and my husband were in the process of getting our dream home. Its every thing I could've dreamed of, all our pieces were falling together.  He got a great paying job that gives him great respect and benefits and we were gonna close on a 500k+ home. I was pregnant with our second baby girl and things were going perfect. We were set to close next week on the 16th. Then I get a call from my loan officer.  This is where things get shady.

     She told me that something happened to the loan and we weren't able to get funded!!!! Apparently I made some purchases that messed up my loan but it is NOT my fault because they did NOT tell me I couldn't do that. I had wanted to surprise my husband and furnish the house and have it ready for him at closing. So I bought furniture, new appliances, and security system etc. All together I had put about 19 thousand on our credit cards. Apparently the mortgage company did NOT like this. And it messed up some debt ratio thing. 

Needless to say my husband is FURIOUS at me. Even though I did it for it he says I did it without his ""permission"". He's the only one that works and sometimes I think he gets touchy about our money but it wasn't like I did this for ME. Anyway, I'm freaking out , because now we're gonna be homeless, we lost the earnest money deposit , my husband is furious and I am totally freaking out !! Just to be clear I did NOT know I couldn't purchase anything before closing. My loan officer or real estate agent didn't tell me. Can I sue either of them or somehow save this loan??? Please, any help is appreciated!!!",11Oct2020,1

475,"For several years, I’ve been wondering if I have schizophrenia and I’ve even researched if the things I’ve been experiencing were related to or not. I felt like I could’ve had Bipolar disorder or something else similar, but schizophrenia seems to be the only thing that sounds like what’s happening for me.

Even people who researched pretty heavily over schizophrenia said the things I talked about experiencing sound very, very similar too. And being so much lately has made me so paranoid and I’ve been forced to sit in silence than I ever have. Because of that, I hear voices that aren’t mine. All of this makes me scared and paranoid to the point where I injure myself in result.

I really need to tell my mom, but mental disorders aren’t discussed in my house, that includes talking about disorders that my parents know I have. I feel embarrassed for asking for help.

I had to return to my parents’ home after being able to find a job or home. It’s been two years now and my mental health has totally declined. My mom is a hoarder, I’ve gotten some tendencies from her but I try to keep control of it. Last month I purged 80% of my bedroom. The living conditions aren’t great. There are often dog excrement on the floor, my 29 year old brother is a heavy drinker and is abusive (he’s gotten physically violent with everyone in the household several times resulting in injury and distress) my parents won’t do anything about it even though he’s legit tried to choke my father whom has COPD with low oxygen if not supplemented. Just yesterday he slammed my arm in a door and pushed me into a nail resulting in a nasty puncture in my other arm. He’s been threatening to set the house on fire, he’s even tried terrorizing me by telling me he’s going to kill me and I’m going to die periodically throughout the day.

I really can’t take this anymore. I just lost my job because the pandemic has effected business at my job.

I feel like I have no where to go and am not able to do anything at all. I don’t have a car, all my friends are in different states hundred to thousands of miles away, I don’t have much money and huge student loan bills.

479,"Hi guys, I'm a 21 y/o guy that have never been in love with any girl, ofc I have been attracted phisycally to girls but then when I meet then they have never met my expectantions in terms of feeling some chemistry beteween us, and some of these girls aren't attracted to me. So time has passed and I'm getting worried about the fact I have never had a gf, when I started the uni I thought I would meet someone, you know, special. But not, so my friends are getting into relations and I'm just here wondering if I have made wrong choices having high expectantions on meeting someone.

On those days where I'm feeling down I ask myself ""why?"", I'm a normal med-student, who love hanging out with friends or going to the gym, except for the fact that I have never been in a relation as most of my friends, I wonder if something is wrong with me.

If I think rationally I know I'm just overthinking, I'm young and have a lot of things to live. I'm happy with my life but sometimes I have the stupid ability to compare myself with others on terms of love. So I have a lot of things I want to be happy but just for this ""problem"" I feel sad and empty.

So after that long description (thanks for reading), what should I do? Force myself to start relationships/hook ups with girls just bc it is what a guy of 21 y/o would do (which I think is stupid) or wait and continue meeting people (which I have been doing all this time and I have the sensation of have lost time).",11Oct2020,1

481,"For years everyone’s known my friends family is middle class. They’re a rich family, have 5 bathrooms in their house rich. But until recently I never really noticed jsut how rich. 

For people my age in the UK we were able to set up a trust fund that was government funded. My friends parents and my parents did this. Your parents could also contribute to it over the years if they wanted. 

I found out how much I had a while ago, it was £900 over the course of 18 years (my family couldn’t afford to contribute.) My friend told me hers today, £12k. On top of that her family set up a Uni savings account for her which amount to (today at least) £25k. She’s got more than £30k aswell as her family’s money. 

We’re not even 18 yet and she’s got enough money for a house and to pay for uni with no debt worries. Of course this is great news for her but I hate myself so much rn because I do feel happy for her but more than anything it makes me feel sad. To know that I’ll never have that. That I never got to have the privilege of my family being rich. That my family weren’t able to set up a savings account for uni, that they weren’t able to contribute to my trust fund. 

She’s so fucking lucky and yet all she does is talk about how she hates rich people, “eat the rich” lmao. It jsut makes me a bit angry that she hasn’t and will probably never experience serious money problems. She won’t have to worry about debt, won’t have to worry about bills. I know I shoudlnt feel angry that my friend won’t have to suffer but I just can’t stop thinking it. 

I want to stop thinking it. I want to be happy for her but it’s made me sad that I’m more than likely going to be struggling for a while with money and debt and uni fees and at the same time my friend will be fine. She’ll have no worries. I won’t feel comfortable telling her about my problems if they happen. Idk how to feel rn, I want some advice just idk what for really.

483,"I have this colleague that started 10 months ago in January 2020. Initially he seems like a really good fit in interviews and he has great energy and banter. We also really needed someone to fill the position as it's vital to our growth as a company.

Fast forward to June? July? I'm beginning to notice that he is always popping into my DMs and asking to zoom. The trend that starts to appear is that the call always ends with me agreeing to do some part of his work for him.

He's also not hit any of his targets, conveniently it's corona and he works that quite heavily as a reason.

So I catch up with other coworkers and this is happening to them to. He's also delegating any new task that comes his way to his team, who are very junior.

Anyways, I'm very busy as it is and I'm starting to really grow resentful that I'm doing so much extra work for him that really falls within his responsibilities, including training his team. (And I'm almost positive I get paid way less than him)

I do tend to call it as I see it so I have made comments to him that he needs to improve.

I set a boundary that im not available all day every day, I'm happy to help or bounce ideas off of but it would be appreciated if he books in time with me to do so. 

He starts treating me differently. Being very rude and demeaning towards me in private and around others. Even called me a bitch in a group setting. But not so that it's noticed by the executive team.

I find out through other colleagues that he's still doing the above to them but also on top of that, on team nights out he's been

1. Asking if his junior female team member would ""suck off the VP"" (his boss) in a group setting
2. Said he would and could get this female team member fired if he wanted to.
3. Provided cocaine and did it with his team in the office after hours.
4. Allowed everyone out on the roof which is not up to code and very dangerous. 
5. Making fun of other members of the team, myself included.


 There's a bunch of other evidence to the fact he's not doing his job to the standard required but I think these are the biggest issues.

The advice I'm asking for is, do I report this? How do I say it... (I have a direct reporting line to the CEO and co founder)

I don't want to work somewhere where this type of culture is accepted. It makes me sad because I have been there a long time and helped build the company to what it is now.

I'm still a teen and in school, so this is mostly for stopping procrastination, but also for actually doing household chores instead of putting them off.

I was staring at him and then he did something EXTREMELY disturbing, he unzipped his penis and took his dick out and was staring at me. I had no idea what I was looking at, I was scared and disgusted but couldn't move. He started playing with it and I just stood there very frightened. I then just walked away and I never told anyone about what happened. I hated my neighbors and I never wanted to interact with them after that. Luckily they moved couple months later.

486,"My parents have a lot of problems in their marriage, and they seriously need to divorce. I see no reason why she would stay with him. First of all, my dad is really inconsiderate. He often just walks past a bunch of people and butt them. He burps and farts around others. For example, he constantly squats down and squeezes out a really loud fart. Or maybe he is talking with someone and suddenly he turns his back on them and rips a nasty fart. Or at a party he would just let one rip and everyone stares at him. He is really fat, so when he butts people, it hurts a lot. He weighs upwards of 290 pounds, and he has a really fat body. My mom and I hate being around him, and he looks so scary and ugly.

He has terrible breath as well. He has several rotten teeth, and a really gross burp. When he talks, I can barely stand to be around him. He also gets like 2 inches in front of someone's face when he talks. He has no etiquette at all. He just suddenly hangs up on people when he's talking on the phone, and he yells at people in public. He puts his feet on the table all the time, and he punches his chest when he gets angry.

He also breaks things all the time, and he always finds a way to screw things up. For example,  he constantly clogs the toilet when he uses it, and it's impossible to flush it. He uses a ton of toilet paper, and he never bothers to flush. So we have to plumb it bit by bit, and takes about an hour to fix. And then we use a lot of air fresheners and other chemicals as well. Several times in the shower, he ripped the shower curtains off, and he made my mom fix it, even though it's completely his fault. When he finishes eating, he just puts the dirty dishes back in the cupboard without even bothering to wash it. Another time, he was washing the microwave. He just poured water on it, and broke it. He constantly rips his clothes because he has a gigantic potbelly, really big butt cheeks, lots of fat on his legs, and he puts a lot of snacks and beer in his pockets.

He snores super loud. Sometimes, he would just be sitting in the food court at the mall or something and he just starts snoring. I don't know what the heck is wrong with him. He's not even falling asleep, so I don't know how he produces those noises. I bet he's doing it only to annoy the hell out of other people. When he actually sleeps, he snores so loud that I can't sleep at all. I often just go sleep in the car because my dad snores so aggressively.

He drinks a lot of beer. He drinks like 50 bottles a day, and he always yells and pounds his chest when he gets drunk. He also tries to flush beer bottles down the toilet, and he has nasty farts as well.",11Oct2020,1

489,"This is something that is tearing on me lately. 

How it started: i grew up with dogs. I always wanted my own dog. I just love them, im the type of guy that points out every dog he sees on the streets and sometimes i even politely ask if i can pet that good boy if hes in dire need of one.

I live with my wife and previously we rented a place that did not allow any pets. But now we own a place with lots of space and a garden, although the garden is only accesible through one set of stairs.

So in early summer this year we decided what breed we want to have (its a very family friendly breed) and started making some calls. The Pandemic messed up the schedule for a lot of breeders, so the market was scarce. We knew we would have to wait like 6 to 10 months for a puppy.

I read a lot about dogs and i listen to podcasts about dogs all day at work. Im going literally crazy about giving that pup the best time he can possibly have. Its very important to me to be very prepared for him.

So we finally got a call, and we have a breeder that would happily give us a puppy in early 2021, after we went through a lot of hoops to even get to that place because they are picky on who they provide one to. They check basically your whole life if you can give that lil one a good home. 

Thing is: we also now expect a baby in early may. We tried for it, no accident. But on my hunt for a dog i never took a breath and thought about it. It was a pure habit to keep chugging and working forward to my dog.

We live in germany so i would take like 3-4 weeks of holiday just for the moving in of the puppy, and my wife would also stay home for an additional 2 weeks. After that my parents and brother would watch him when we are at work until we stay at home for the baby. In germany the wife can also stay at home for 6 weeks before birth, fully paid, and up to 3 years with like 60% pay. The father can also stay at home for 2 months, and gets less money for additonal time after. 

We do know that it would be stressful. My wife said that i can just stay home for 2-3 months and focus mainly on the dog, because im not that much of a help for a baby anyway in that timeframe. But everyone tells us that we would be idiots to get a dog. But i feel like there is always a reason NOT to get a dog, i dont know. I talked to my wife and she said the thought about it, but did not want to hurt me in denying of delaying that dog because she knows how important it is for me. We both think we could handle it, but have some doubts because like i said, everyone tells us not to.

Getting a dog is this very deep urge of mine and it just really pains me that im that close, and that i would have to tell the breeder that after all that we dont want one. 

So, was anyone in a similar situation or knows someone that was, and is it really that stupid of an idea? Please consider that through our savings and everything, i can stay home for quite some time with my wife. I assume we have a better system in germany than the US, which is guess will be most readers.",11Oct2020,1

Hi,  I don't really know the reason for it but I always have felt very  small(?) and helpless towards life. I can't really find my own voice, I  feel like everything is and should be happening to me, not for me or  because of me. In relationships, I can get super codependent, I can take  all the blame and be very easy manipulated, I don't really trust people  cause I've been used and abused by many but then again I always wait  for people's approvals and permissions so it kind of creates a  dissonance right then and there. I would love to start something new,  change my life, go out and get involved into things but I'm terrified  and I also feel like I have no choice in what I should be doing, or if I  really like or don't like something, I mostly wait for some kind of a  ""sign"" or a recomendation from other people when it comes to adressing  my life. Right now it's a struggle cause a friend of mine I've depended  on for years has kind of unsubscribed from the relationship so I'm  freaking out a little bit, but then again there is no point in whining  about people wanting to live their lives anymore, I really wish I could  become independent instead of looking for another foster parent like  that. but how do I even start?

506,"(I posted this on another subreddit, would really appreciate all advice and tips given) 

I (19F) and my boyfriend (20M) have been together for about 3 months and love each other very much. We have a strong and healthy relationship going on but there’s a problem, we both are from different religions. He’s “Catholic” and I’m “Evangelical” 

Why the parentheses? Because we both just play our parts for our families but we really don’t identify with either labeled religion.  Our problem is the added family pressure that will be added on once we both reveal to our families that we’re together. On my side, my parents probably won’t take it well as they’re conservative evangelical (again, I’m just playing my part till I’m able to leave) although they’re for the most part understanding. 

On his side his mom probably won’t take it well either as she’s more into the Catholic faith than any of his other family members.  I personally don’t really care about what my family will think but he’s wary that my parents are gonna blame him for “changing” me. 

We both would really appreciate some advice and tips on how to face this challenge once we both reveal to our families that we’re together.  One thing I’d like to add is that we’re both in college going full-time and not financially ready to move out, so that is not an option. Thank you in advance!",11Oct2020,1

513,"I apologize in advance if this is too long. There is a TL;DR at the end. I realize Reddit is a large place but if you could stick with me I would really appreciate advice.

So I have been in a relationship with a woman for about 8 weeks. The first week was spent talking on the phone for hours as we live in separate towns, good conversations. By the second week when we met I had agreed to drive her out of town on business. I took her up on Monday and we came back the same day. I had ordered an Airbnb to stay in town and much to my surprise she didn't let me kiss her, but would let me hold her hand. I also bought the food.

The following week she wanted me to take her there again, I told her that I would because I cared for her but that I didn't think it would work as a relationship because I'm really affectionate. We ended the conversation and she texted me the next day saying it was okay but she hoped we could be friends. I had second thoughts and we restarted the relationship. I took her and we stayed at a hotel, she was much more affectionate.

Things get a little off when I made a joke not directed at her, and she somehow thought I was making fun of her and called me, ""fucker."" I am very sensitive and told her she did not have to be harsh with me like that. She was quite argumentative but she apologized after I took a shower because she could tell my feelings were really hurt (that was the first time she kissed me).

Fast forward to the next week she says she wants to treat me to dinner for helping her. I got to my Airbnb and we have sushi. After that we got into a strange argument about a TV show, I disagreed with her analysis and she really took it personally and said I should always agree with her. I told her that was bizarre and she said, ""Shut up, I don't want to talk to you"" and turned over. Eventually we made up, agreeing to disagree, she had interpreted my disagreeing as not trusting her (IDK why). She talks about not wanting to live because she didn't have a purpose, though she says she's not suicidal.

We talked about everything over the phone that first week, including the timing of marriage if things went well and kids. We agreed we didn't want kids. I found out later over a couple conversations that she actually did, but thought she couldn't so reformed her desires. Come to find that night after sushi she feels like a kid would give her purpose but that she can't find someone in time. I tell her to think about it and let me try for her because I love her she could have a kid no strings attached. We started making out and having sex but I couldn't finish because the argument had unnerved me. In the process I left hickies on her neck. She didn't like that, but we agree to try again the next night.

She blocked my number for two days. I visited her house with a gift, I come to find from a friend (she wouldn't talk to me) because she was upset about the marks on her neck. I broke up with her because ghosting really turns me off. We started up again when she texted me the following week. Fast forward to last week. I took her to her business town again, we had sex and even after sex I made her feel really good. The next morning she told me she hoped I would die because I hurt her backside by fingering it a bit and that I made her want to die more. I got really pissed and threw the rental car keys and told her she couldn't say things like that. She apologized and I apologized for throwing the keys.

She hasn't done the things that hurt me before because I told I will leave if she treats me like that. She talks about wanting to invest in stocks together and make an LLC (no idea what that is). I do love her and the sex is good but clearly the age difference makes her think she can be hard on me at times. She's been divorced twice (first husband got her citizenship), had two abortions, and one miscarriage 6 months ago so she's been through a lot and I don't want to hurt her. She has trust issues and trusts me.

I lost an uncle to a heart attack and a dear friend to a brain bleed this year and the quarantine has really gotten to me. My judgment, which is usually horrible, is worse than usual. I have more but I'll wait for questions. I can tell she cares for me and I want to make her happy but I think about blocking her number (I've never done that). What should I do? Is she abusive even though she stopped?

516,"I’m 15 years old, my mom is a pretty normal, sweet person, but when she gets tired she’s like a completely different person.

I remember when my grandpa bought me a toy gun she had a panic attack over it telling my dad that when se sees it it makes her want to kill herself and asked why kids today are so fucked up. She said that she had a grandpa who was racist and threatened to shoot black people on his lawn. I threw away the toy gun, I didn’t want to hear anymore of that. I was I think in 6th grade when this happened.

I remember when I was 5, one of my cousins donated to me a shirt with a Christian Cross on it (we are an atheist family) and when she saw it she threw it behind the bed saying that it would be a “treasure you could cherish forever” if I found it. Honestly the weirdest memory I’ve ever had.

Those are just the major examples, she’s been doing this my entire life, usually she starts to speak in a different tone of voice, and gets a little more paranoid. I don’t think my dad notices this at all but I do.

My mom usually stays in her room all day, my friends have never seen her. My dad is a completely normal person and I stay with him more because he doesn’t have those changes like my mom does. I’ve never been told that my mom has a personality disorder so that’s out the window.

I've done a pretty good job at putting it out of my mind, though, and just living life. Work is good, home life is good, life in general is good. I'm not an unhappy person. I've not even thought much about dating for a long tjme up until recently.

I developed feelings for someone, and they've become pretty strong by now. But, I'm fairly certain she'd reject me. I may or may not eventually take the plunge and ask her out. I still haven't decided on that yet. But that choice is irrelevant, because she's going to say no, so whether I ask or not, my situation doesn't actually change.

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 1 year and 6 months now. We started off in the same city, but then things panned out and my Girlfriend decided it would be the best to do long distance relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

We decided long distance relationship would be good, because we felt like we have a really good connection, but we are really young, so we give each other breathing space and yet save the relationship too with the tension. Also, my girlfriend really wanted to study here, because she dislikes the country we live in.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we meet every 3 months, sometimes 2, but never longer than 3. We mostly meet at vacations, which makes it even more special, and we miss each other very dearly, but we have discussed how longer than 3 months would affect our relationship badly, because we get a bit sad without each other.

&amp;#x200B;

I've applied for college and I quite dislike my choice, but I'm really interested in a project. This project would mean that I would go abroad for studies (like my girlfriend did). For about 3-12 months (depends how long would I want it to take).  Mind you, I've already gone to this project, before I've met my GF. And I've really really enjoyed my choice. I promised myself to go on one of these again. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is that my girlfriend doesn't really support that idea. She thinks that it will affect our meeting time (like me not coming back one month etc...) . Although, I've told her numerous times that there is like a 1 percent chance I wont comeback for longer than 3 months she still isn't convinced... So I can't really make up my mind, because I obviously care how my GF feels about it, but yet again I really want to go on this project. It's one in the life time experience.

When did using people for sex and abandoning them when they want something deeper become normalized?? That’s psycho abuse in my book. Since when was it acceptable to treat people like items. You don’t matter if you’re not 6foot. You don’t matter if you don’t have a huge porn star cock.

I don’t trust my dad. I know he was lying about the affair to make the blow less than what it really was. I told my mom that. I told her he’d do it again. I checked his phone a week ago and saw that he is still talking to the woman. I am not surprised, but I am really crushed.

535,"I mean this when I say it, her and I are perfect for each other. It's insane how well the last 2.5 years have gone with her and I couldn't ask for anything more.

But, I have a problem. First let me preface this with the fact that I would *never* cheat on her or act on these urges. But, like the title said, I am almost on a daily basis thinking about having sex with other women. Let me give you some examples of where my mind goes. Sometimes I think how easy it would be to get on some bullshit app like Tinder and kindle a no-strings-attached casual sex relationship. Or I'll be walking through the store, see an attractive woman and think about how if I wasn't in a relationship, I'd strike up a conversation.

With that said, when these thoughts enter my head, I never actually regret being in a relationship. I love this girl relentlessly and I would never put myself in a situation where I could hurt her or harm our relationship, at least not intentionally of course. These thoughts I have are purely sexually driven and that's it. I'll also say this, this has nothing to do with me being unattracted to my girlfriend by any means. She's absolutely beautiful, cute, adorable, all of those things. She's so sweet, kind, loving, thoughtful, everything I could ask for and more. She's the kind of girl any guy would be highly attracted to personality wise and physically.

So why am I having these extreme urges? Do I have some kind of disorder? Is this normal? Does anyone else experience this? Maybe it has something to do with the fact I've been cheated on in two major relationships in the past? I don't know, but the polarity of my thoughts is so confusing and contradictory.

I know I probably sound like a giant asshole when I'm explaining my thoughts that I'm having. But, I'm trying to be transparent with you strangers so that I can hopefully get the advice that I need. Again, I would never do anything to hurt her. These thoughts just feel consuming at times and I figured it was time to ask for outside help. Thanks for reading, I hope this came out well.

tl;dr I'm in an amazing 2.5 year relationship with the girl of my dreams. But, I keep having strong urges to cheat. Any advice is much appreciated.

EDIT: After reading through this, I realize how spotty my thought process seems. I apologize, I'm typing this out on mobile at work and had to somewhat rush through it.",11Oct2020,1
536,"2 of my friends are in a relationship together. Its been really rocky for them in the past with one party that isn't the most monogamous. With the other forgiving them and taking them back. They've broken up and gotten back together. 

The first time they ""broke up"" she was very distraught. Since they've got back together she has been very attached to him and when they aren't together. She needs to maintain a reliable way of contacting him. 

The other day we were hanging out with him and she called and texted him 30+ times and when he answered she proceeded to start tearing up. This has been going on for a while with him having plans of leaving her for someone else. 

As a good friend of both of them and as someone who would like to be helped if they were in the same situation. I feel like I should do something but I'm not too certain about what to do and still maintain my relationship with both of them.",11Oct2020,1

538,"Hi everyone, fyi before I begin this is a throwaway account for privacy. 

One of my best friends has dealt with a lot of issues in her past which have led to her being extremely anxious and depressed at times, and she seems to have a lot of bad days compared to good ones recently. I haven’t known her for too long, but she mentioned once how she used to cut herself when she was younger. I have noticed a few cuts on her that have scabbed over and are healing that she disregards as cuts from her boots or scratches from chairs. But they are in neat lines close to each other and look a lot like cut lines to me. She has a background in mental health as she is studying this in school and has gone to therapy before, so I don’t know how to go about asking her about this and how to help. I know she knows there are other methods to cope, so I don’t want to come off as patronizing. I just want to help my friend as she means the world to me. I know she is struggling but she won’t open up to me, and I respect that. I just want her to know I am there to help if she needs it. Any advice is greatly appreciated, I just want to help her.

541,"Essentially, upon arriving to college I was told I couldn't have the extended time testing that I usually had. It is not a major accommodation (only time and a half) and since I had it before I decided to request it. The disability coordinator immediately said I wasn't qualified. When I asked why they said I should know why. When I asked what documentation I could provide to get my accommodation they refused to answer and just said to submit paperwork filled out by my doctors. I tried asking what exactly they needed to know and was refused any answer or direction. When I said on a phone call with the coordinator that I was getting the paperwork filled out now and would send it to them, they said they would take away my flexible absence accommodations if I got any other accommodations. 

To explain my health issues, I have both crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. I also have severe anxiety and depression which causes hallucinations. Finally I have overactive bladder issues and migraines. I am currently being tested for seizures as well. I obviously need flexible absences. With the Crohn's and UC alone I am heavily immunosuppressed with Remicade, which is a mild chemotherapy. I am prone to illness and get sick regularly. I would fail without flexible absences. I also need extended time largely bc of my psychological issues and migraines + potential seizures. I am on a lot of medication that inhibits my ability to focus and remember things. I have sent in documentation of this and still been told I can't have the exam accommodations. 

I have contacted the head of disability services to complain about my coordinator and requested a meeting so I could get more information on what I need to pursue this accommodation. I don't accept the answer from my coordinator simply because of how blatantly they were trying to work against me in this process, even threatening to take my other accommodations away. I need advice on what exactly I should be doing here and if anyone has dealt with university on accommodation issues what can I do to get the help that I need?",11Oct2020,1

Then i found out that he had called both of them separately on more than one occasion. I continued to not mind, I trust them.

My bf was the one to tell me, only when he noticed something was off he asked if I was okay with it.

I had a load of issues in high school (UK, so these started at 13/14) when I developed a disability, due to this I ended up redoing my GCSEs four times, I failed every time. My studies had never been A grade but up until these years I was a C/B student pretty consistenly.
After this it's just been impossible, I can't even concentrate, I can't comprehend even the smallest things to the point of losing my temper because I get so confused.

A one hour exam will be two for me. They're also done alone.)

I read pages and nothing goes in, revising doesn't work, even the simplist tasks are just too hard. No matter how hard I try I just don't understand. At all.

I tried taking a vocational course. I decided to train as a personal trainer and even the simplist of tasks in the work book had me stumped- some of the people in those classes thought london was near scotland kind of dim, lovely people but not the brightest. These were simple find the information write it down kind of questions and I just couldn't do it.

I can't just read a book anymore but used to read 4-8 books a week.

I never understand anything- to the point I just throw my books at the walla and scream when I'm alone because nothing makes sense.

At home we get into a rut of him needing time alone, and then using that time to work on things because he doesn't know what else to do.

He also has been trying to read up on every awful thing in the world so that he can be a better person/ally.  I love that he wants to be aware of social issues, but it also leaves him feeling hopeless - there must be a way to balance it?  He gives a lot of his pay check to charity/organizations.   
When he does have fun for example playing video games he feels unproductive.   


Any suggestions? He did some therapy sessions early in the year and the therapist told him to make  friends. He is an introvert, and it is COVID so he feels he can't easily meet people.

One of the girls mentioned a friend that had been in close contact the night before didn’t attend because of a low grade fever and a migraine, but later said the girl was fine and she has chronic migraines. 

These girls also go to a high school that’s fully in-person and apparently the sophomore class is having to be suspended as of next week because so few of them are following guidelines outside of class and so many have come down. I know a lot of these party guests at this point have probably been in contact with carriers. I decided to email a couple of my professors (we’re teaching hybrid irl/online for the whole year) and let them know that I would be attending class online for a week or so because of this. 

My university is having free covid tests but will only give them out to students with symptoms. The other test I took in my city (that didn’t require a referral or present symptoms) at the very beginning of my semester cost $200 and I only got results back when I went to them in person (3 1/2 *weeks* later) and demanded my results. I can’t afford to get another test if it’s that expensive so I’m either going to lie to my school and say I have a sore throat and fatigue because it’s my only other option, or I’m going to quarantine for a week with no test and hope for the best.

Well tonight I’ve gotten as close as I ever have at making her the victim. 

I tried reasoning with her about food and she said my dad and I told her not to eat and that she was fat. Neither of us said anything like that.

She ramped up the drama by saying she could fight me. And that she should have beaten when I was younger so I wouldn’t be such an asshole now. I brought up that her fighting has always disturbed me. She used to fight with my dad like this often when I was young. Sometimes she would get mad and drive off and leave me feeling abandoned. I told her about this and she gaslit me. Obviously she’s never done anything like that and I’m full of shit. She’s trying to bow up still and I threatened her. She is 5’2 150lbsish. I am 5’10” 260lbs. I explain I could deck her out cold. She comes over to me and grabs my face to goad me. As she walks around the table I’m sitting at, I rise. She’s taunting me with gaslighting and saying I’m a [female dog] who’s full of shit. She talks about how she can beat me up some more.

My face is hot, my hands are shaking. All I can do is shout for her to “shut the fuck up.” Luckily my dad heard it and came and got me to leave the room (which I told him to do for me if I get mad). If he hadn’t come, I don’t know what I would have done. Probably throw something for starters.

She always talks about how miserable her life is when she’s drunk. She then decides to pick fights like the one above and will not accept any responsibility for anything. Everyone is out to get her and she is the mighty hero of her own fabricated story.

This kinda shit right here is why my ex wife and I keep our daughters away from this house as much as possible

556,"My cousin is getting married in January. Earlier this year, I was given the role of being a bridesmaid in her bridal party after a month or two after her bridal shower (My cousin had announced the bridesmaids and gave each one of them a special bag filled with personalized macarons and a shirt). 

For context, I am a 17-year-old girl and she's in her late-ish twenties.   


My sister was given a spot in my cousin's bridal party; she was told the day of the bridal shower and she got her own specialized bag.   
I wasn't supposed to be in it but my cousin's brother's wife just found out she was pregnant. Therefore, she couldn't be a bridesmaid. So the role was handed over to me. I was shocked but I was excited and honored to have this position on her special day. I \*told\* her that.   


She then said to me one morning that she was inviting her entire bridal party to this getaway place and asked me if I was coming; I said yes, of course.   


It was supposed to happen Colombus Day weekend. It IS Colombus Day weekend. Guess who's home while my sister, cousin, and the rest of her bridal shower is drinking wine, dancing, and having fun???   


Now I wouldn't mind if I was told I couldn't come because of the alcohol but I should have been told beforehand; if she didn't want me to go she could have sent me a text instead of me realizing too late.

so i’m at my friends house, we smoke and talk like y’know friends do. We’re both 18

But once he gets stoned he just doesn’t say anything. He only speaks when I ask him a question, like really short and concrete

At first I was thinking he doesn’t like me or something, but he always invites me back, and acts like nothing happend the day previous

Sometimes i’d ask him what to do after we’ve smoked. Like watch a movie or some shit, and he’d say «sure» but when asked what to watch he’d either say «don’t know» or «it doesn’t matter to me». So i’m forced to put on something idk if he likes in HIS home. When I put something on he puts in his earpods and goes on his phone. Like almost all the time during the movie. Idk it feels unantural. 

After all this super awkward shit I’d just tell him i’ll head home (no excuses or lying to leave) or «get going» and he’ll be like talk normally and stand up, he doesn’t walk me to the door however.

I think he just gets very anti social when smoking, which is fine I guess just wish he’d tell me. Or he straight up doesn’t like me but is afraid to say. Idk it’s confusing

He’s also an experienced smoker, so like he doesn’t get scared or some shit shen smoking

I broke my ankle in August falling down a skatepark ramp (Trimalleloar +1 break and dislocation) and am going through the rehab process (in a walking boot now) and since I broke the ankle, I’ve been pretty tired from healing so energy has been under control for a while. Recently in the past couple weeks I’ve been feeling that insane energy again like I have to run as fast and hard as I can and just move but I can’t really do much at the moment because I’m in a boot. Kinda feel like I’m going to transform into a wolf or something it just feels so uncomfortable that all this energy is balled up without being expelled. Anyone experienced similar or know anything of use or of the subject?",11Oct2020,1
572,"Hii!
I would love to get into the music industry, I've always been in love with music and I've always thought about it but the thing is I'm not good at singing and I can't take singing classes because of the virus.
I don't know how to play any instrument, I have an old guitar but again can't take classes because of the virus.
I don't know how to compose and I don't know how to write lyrics.
I'm trying to learn how to rap and sing better but of course is difficult and school makes it harder, also can't really find youtube videos that help me.

573,"My (22F) boyfriend (23M) is always body shaming me and I want to break up, but before that I want to get a nice body. Please help!

So my boyfriend is always body shaming me. I was really affected by his comments but I decided that not only am I going to get that body, I am also going to dump my boyfriend, but not before I ‘glow up’. :) 

I know this may be a little toxic, like why don’t I just dump him right? I’ve tried a couple of times, he’s always told me that he loves me bla bla. No, you wouldn’t body shame me if you loved me. He’s always going on and on about my thick waist, small breasts, belly fat, love handles. Ugh, he’s not even slim or fit himself, but it never mattered to me. Now, I just detest the double standards! 

I want to glow up, but my self-esteem is really low so I don’t dare to go to the gym. Are there any home-workouts that I can do, to help me get a smaller waist, bigger hips, perky ass and overall slim and toned body? Any good Youtube videos to recommend? I am also cutting down on junk food, sticking to healthy meals at the moment :) 

Ps, I am in no way trying to perpetuate or promote unrealistic body images, nor am I trying to fat shame. I respect people who can feel comfortable in their own skin, good for you people! But personally think I can look better if I worked out too, and I think I’d be more confident and less of a loser in front of my boyfriend when we break up.",11Oct2020,1
574,I live in a dorm with 6 other students. I also have insomnia and can’t fall asleep easily so I’m usually very tired and have a hard time waking up. This means that I have to set up multiple alarms in the morning to make sure that i won’t oversleep and miss class. My roommate can apparently hear my alarm clock going off from her room across the hall and told me that if I set up an alarm I should actually wake up and turn it off so that she won’t have to listen to it. I don’t want to come off as rude and I understand that this must be frustrating for her but I also don’t want to miss classes. What should I do?,11Oct2020,1
575,"This is kind of a long story, but I’ll sum it up quickly. I’m from NY and my junior year of high school I feel in live with a college in Los Angeles. I got into the school and almost went, but some logistical stuff got in the way, so I wound up going to a different school in NYC. I’m now a sophomore and could not be more miserable. Despite the pandemic, we are back on campus, but I have no friends and no social life. My mental health is down the shitter and this school literally drove me to develop an eating disorder.
Needless to say I really don’t want to be here anymore.

The only other school I would want to go to is the school in LA. It always has been the perfect school for me and I should have gone there since the beginning. The problem is that they haven’t opened their campus back up since the pandemic started. They weren’t on campus this semester and they won’t be back next semester either. That puts me in the awkward position of transferring schools having no idea when or if I’ll ever step foot on that school’s campus. 

The earliest I would be moving to Cali would be fall of 2021, the beginning of my junior year. And, theoretically, it could be even later than that given that COVID doesn’t really seem to be going anywhere. And by that point, transferring almost doesn’t seem worth the effort.

Hypothetically, even though I’m miserable at my current school, I might be able to graduate a year early if I load up on summer classes. Maybe I should just suck it up where I am and get through through the next year and a half to graduate early. As miserable as I am, I’m surviving. And honestly I don’t think it can get any worse than it already is so if this is as bad as it gets, I might as well just stick with it and see it through.

But at the same time I don’t know what I want to do after graduation. I know I need to go to grad school but I don’t know for what. It seems stupid to rush to graduate especially given the job market right now. I should be wasting as much time as possible in school so I can graduate into a better economy. 

What it comes down to is this: I’m absolutely miserable where I am, but it makes no sense to transfer, especially to a school that I may never be able to attend in person. I feel like this is a loose/loose situation. 

I know this is kind of a unique situation so most people probably can’t relate, but any opinions or advice would be really appreciated. Maybe someone with a more objective view-point can offer come clarity.",11Oct2020,1
576,"So basically this guy admitted to liking me a few weeks ago at work. I'm not sure how the conversation came about but he said it to the guys he works with downstairs. The problem was I didn't see him as anything more than a work colleague so I just kept acting like he didn't and when people asked if j liked him back I wouldn't give an answer. 

There were two reasons for this. 

1) With how everyone reacted when he admitted to liking me I didn't want to admit that there may be a chance if me liking me back. (my cheeks were already hurting from blushing)

2) I didn't know how I felt. I've only had one crush in my 20 years alive and that was back in school.  And I've never been in a relationship before. 


I've wanted to pull him to pull him to once side and ask if he was being sincere but there's always people about. I have his number from the group chat but don't want to say thing over text. 

If he does say he likes me how would I ask if he wants to go on a date somewhere then. Especially with the city gov looking to close restaurants again.

578,"Hi all, sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. If so let me know. I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting blah blah.

Some backstory:

I (22F) lived in a house growing up with a biological sibling and two step siblings, all older than me. One of my step siblings had a drug problem and other mental health issues that made growing up pretty hell, from constant destructive outbursts (destroying things in the house, throwing things, having the cops called, etc) to tension between my dad and step mom, leaving the whole house on edge and bad vibes a around. This sibling had two kids while I was in high school that my parents are now left to raise. Problem sibling is out of the house doing who knows what, leaving my parents fully raising those two children. My other siblings didn't do much to help, so I helped my parents with everything from lending my car to my step mom (who smoked cigarettes in it, despite me asking multiple times not to because I hated the smell, and even left a beer in the car while I was underage at the time), waking up very early to watch the kids while they ran errands, and really being the only kid of theirs to help with the household chores and yardwork. I lent my dad money when needed (because of circumstances I won't get into, money was tight and they had lots of car issues). When I made enough money, I moved into an apartment all by myself that was close to work. 

My dad promised me that he would buy a bed for my old room so that id always have a place, which caused me to not bring all of my things to my new and very small apartment. He never bought the bed

Less than 3 months after I moved out, my nephew's bday came around and my stepmom tore my room apart to make it into a playroom for the bday party. My stuff was thrown into closets and the shower in the bathroom next to my room (shower was broken and no one used that bathroom after I moved out). I was very hurt by this, because my biological sister moved out before I did and her room was still intact (but in a different part of the house than where the little kids' rooms were).

Less than a year later, I had to break my lease and move back in. I had to move into a different bedroom because mine was no longer mine. My stepmom tried to postpone moving me in because she was ""too stressed"" with a fundraiser and got mad at me for not waiting another month to move back even though I had to break lease because of money issues. 

I was back for about 2-3 months before I found my current living situation. I moved all the shit that I had originally brought to my apartment into this new house, and anything left was tossed into a closet by my parents. 

Every time I go down to see them my stepmom tried to ""jokingly"" get on my case about taking all my shit out of the house and it makes me really sad. My parents invited me down a few weeks ago to just hang and my stepmom got on my case again so I loaded up my car (and still haven't unpacked it because I don't have space in my current living space). My dad told me he was upset with my stepmom for making me pack shit up, because that ""wasn't the point of the visit"". 

Today I texted my dad to see if they were free today - they weren't. He then said that there are a couple of weekdays that work for them to come get more of my stuff from their house, but I work weekdays so id have to take days off to do it. 

That's basically the story, let me know if more detail is needed. 

I don't know what to do because it really hurts that after all I've done to make their lives easier and help them, they're tossing me out like yesterday's trash. I don't expect them to turn their lives around for me or anything, but I've done so much to help them throughout the past 7 years between errands, favors, and a lot of money, and the second I become slightly inconvenient that they no longer have space for me. 

It also really hurts because I barely have a daughter-parent relationship with them because they're too busy with the kids. When I visit, the kids act up like kids do and prevent me from having conversations with them. Even when the kids aren't around, they're too strung out and stressed to really have a conversation. 

I felt insanely guilty for moving out and leaving them to deal with two kids to raise as well as two of my other siblings living in the house and eating up resources (my siblings argue with them a lot and don't really do anything to make life easier for my parents). Their marriage sucks because of that problem sibling and the kids and it breaks my heart. I cried every time I thought about it. And it hurts further how they're trying to get every one of my belongings out of their house because my stuff is just ""in the way"" now and I don't know what to do. 

I miss having a relationship with them beyond family cookouts or whatever and I'm hurt by their actions the past 3 years. Every time I brought it up my dad would be too busy or stressed to deal with it or just said ""stop"" when I brought it up and I don't know what to do. Please give me whatever advice you have.",11Oct2020,1

584,"I've been asking myself this question for the past few weeks, and would like to see third party inputs.

For context, I am 22 years old and have been in college since 2017 - only recently declaring this major. My Gen-Eds are all done.  

So, I am currently enrolled in college with a declared Bachelor's in ""Integrative Studies"". For those of you that do not know what that is; it is basically a culmination of three to four minors or ""focus areas"". The degree itself is labeled as an art degree as well. The reason I chose this major is because no specific major really 'spoke out' to me. 

My minors within the major are: 1. Electronic Media Broadcasting (cameras and audio, etc.) 2. English 3. Marketing

I just recently found out it has an Associate's program. To be honest, I do not know how much the Bachelor's even weighs in the grand scheme of things, and college is expensive so this could keep me out of more debt than I am already in, as well as finally working a job that I can enjoy and sit comfortably financially. 

For what I want out of life, I really do not care to make a lot of money (I know this is relative to location), somewhere around 40k to 50k is satisfying enough. The issue is, though, is whether or not future me will be kicking myself for not sticking with a Bachelor's. I don't ever see myself buying a fancy house or all the new cars and what not. 

To be honest, I just want to be out of college already. 

I'm sure this isn't the best information given, but I want to keep this post somewhat short. If you need anymore information I can try my best to in the comments to give more context. Thank you very much.

593,"I [19F] was taken advantage of almost a month ago by a guy a year above me in my college. It was a school event, we had been drinking much and somehow part of our group (me, a (girl) friend, the guy and his roommate) ended up in their dorm and I was basically black out drunk. When I realised that someone was having sex with me I told him to stop and he did and I left. (By that point my friend and the other guy had left)

When he found out I had said he took advantage of me he started accusing me of starting it: putting my head on his shoulder, my hand under his shirt, kissing him etc. As I was so drunk (and sleepy by that point as it was around 4am) and I don't remember much of it, I can't swear I didn't do those things, but I've been in a very happy relationship for pretty much a year now and I could never do something like that to my boyfriend, he says he agrees and some friends I've told also say it doesn't sound like me.

I've been doing okay and just trying to focus on school as I'm a first year, but I get these bouts, especially in the evenings, when I feel really bad about it. Obviously it's always there but some evenings and nights are quite bad. It feels like it's just eating my insides. I'm feeling guilty because I could have just gone home at any point during the night but I kept going along with my friends. The part that makes me feel the worst is like I betrayed my boyfriend. I know I wouldn't ever do those things that the guy described but it still feels very wrong to me to remember being in a sexual situation with someone who isn't my boyfriend. My boyfriend keeps assuring me he doesn't blame me and it's not my fault and has been very supportive overall. But since he's serving time in the army (compulsory in our country) he can only be with me during weekends and is away for the most part and it gets hard alone. 

I was just wondering if there is maybe anyone out here with a similar experience or just advice on how to deal with this and how to make myself feel better during these harder nights?

596,"I’m 16 and my brother is 26. He’s a drug addict and he’s been in and out of rehab the last 4 years or so. About three months ago he relapsed after 7 months and he’s a completely different person.

I can’t take it anymore. I’ve told my parents I think we should kick him out because our approach of “unconditional love and support” isn’t working; and every time we use it it inevitably blows up in our faces.

I'm gonna have to jump to conclusions and stereotypes for the sake of explanations. He is a rich white dude, and married my asian sister. it took them like 10 years to have kids because of she was either infertile or / but they finally have kids thanks to Invitro.  


though, he is not a bad looking dude (i'm not gay, just making observations), and my sis is definitely below average, even for an asian girl that is average is like a little more than average but my sis is definitely, sub-par, I Love Her, but just making observations. its not that my brother in law could do better, but he could. I guess he just reallly loves my sister for who she is, but I still have my doubts.  


his dad is loaded and does contracts for the military. likes on the sea coast million dollar house, and a few years ago now he and my sister have like a 1/2 million, practically a million dollar house. I'm not sure how but he only works his job and my sister used to work one but ever since they had kids not any more  


i just think he is too nice and its just too good of a deal. there must be some leaks somewhere, am I wrong for thinking that and not having full faith in my brother in law? I assume no one is perfect, I just think he is too good.

599,"TW/CW: Rape, suicide

When I (37F) was 20, I was abducted and raped. I spent 6 years in court and the 2 men who raped me were locked up for 16 years. 

In 2011, I had a nervous breakdown followed by extreme social anxiety, and as a result I lost my entire social circle. I am here because I don't know where else to turn.

I realised this year, on the 16th anniversary of the incident (under quarantine), that I had managed to get to a point where I was hoping that they were out of jail and with their families during the pandemic. I thought I was getting better.

Recently, in my country there have been a number of very serious Covid outbreaks in prisons. After reading the news last Wednesday, I don't know why, but I Googled them to see if they were out. They were due to be released in 2026. One of them showed up on LinkedIn, he's out and working as a store manager. Part of me felt relieved that he wasn't in prison during a pandemic, the other part of me went into a full panic attack.

Ever since then, I've been having nightmares of the incident which end in my death, near constant flashbacks during waking hours, and my suicidal ideation has gone into overdrive. I have been unable to function, and am constantly on the verge of tears. I also have Bipolar Type-2, which is making it all much, much worse.

Does anyone have any advice on dealing with traumatic flashbacks and intrusive thoughts?

My point is that I hate monthly subscriptions and every book summary or audiobook app like **audible**, **blinkist**, **Scribd**,.. don't offer one-time payment.

I like the content but it seems some of it is just pulled from youtube without any contribution. And I also didn't know if the full audiobooks are narrated by a real human or AI. 

I would be pretty glad for any opinion or suggestion for a different app, 

thanks and have a nice day!",11Oct2020,1

608,"Hey guys, so this is going to be a long post but I feel all the background information is necessary. I’ve been working at my job for three years, and ironically I work in a radiology office that has been known to have a mold problem. In the back room that I started in (they’ve since moved me around a bunch of times only to return back to the same back room) the air in there has always been really musty and mildewy, and at first my coworkers would make jokes about the mold until I realized it was a true statement. I never really felt bothered by it in the beginning, and since they moved me into other rooms I was always kind of away from it. It turns out our building has a bad foundation, and because of that the back room and also one of the scan rooms has issues with flooding, leaking, and mold growth and it’s so expensive to get the foundation problem fixed, the owner refuses to fix it. On top of that, I live in Florida (lol) and of course it’s extremely rainy and floody here, so every time it rains we have to put buckets out and have people come and pump out the water.

With that being said, two ish years ago, a lot of us were in that back room when several girls started developing health issues. Most felt mild allergy-related symptoms but my one coworker in particular went through hell. Tons of doctors appointments, tests, her asthma grew so bad she was put on an inhaler and her doctor was dumbfounded as to what was causing this for her. She mentioned there’s potential mold at our job and boom. That was it, he told her that she needs to get out of that room and so she did. At the same time she was experiencing all of that, I happened to have a plastic drawer thing under my desk and one day I dropped something behind it so I had to move it away from the wall to get the thing I dropped. The carpet was soaked where my drawers were, and the bottom of my drawers were soaked as well. I was very confused and we immediately brought it up to management. They moved everyone out of the room and closed the room off for a long time until it was “clear” of whatever was going on. When my coworkers moved to another location, they instantly felt better, and the coworker who was put on an inhaler no longer needed it.

After accepting a couple new positions at the same job over the next year (but staying in the same building), I was again moved around a bunch and felt fine despite the awful cold temperature of the office. They moved me to the back room again in February 2020, and from there on I started getting really sick. The best way to explain how I feel is sick in my chest- extreme congestion ONLY in my chest, not nasal or sinus related, I clear my throat constantly so sometimes my throat feels sore from that, and this really weird chest tightness that won’t quit. Sometimes at night, I have to sleep a certain way to be able to breathe properly. I’ve been to countless doctor appointments (hundreds of dollars spent on medical bills), I’ve been covid tested and had CT scans of my lungs and chest - my doctor can only conclude that I have really terrible allergies that just started acting up. I’ve tried- I shit you not- every allergy pill and congestion pill and nasal spray out there, and I still feel terrible and like I’m getting worse. He also put me on a nebulizer which is something I never would have thought I’d need, and told me if there’s a mold issue at my job, my unexplainable issues could very well be from mold and he’d write a letter to get me out of there. Over the course of several months because I finally spoke up about it in September, have been doing experimentations in my condo to attempt to isolate where the problem is. I have cats but have never experienced cat allergies, but I still experimented with moving the litter boxes to other locations and even installed a cat door in the laundry room where the litter box is kept since it is connected to my bedroom and I didn’t want to be breathing that in at night. I also bought an air purifier for my space, which I believe helps a lot, and I keep up with cleaning everything here as much as I can. I even went in on cleaning my car. The point is- I’ve tried everything, and I singled the issue out to me feeling like shit the entire work week, Monday-Friday, then on the weekend when I’m home I actually feel recuperated and symptom free. Then by Monday night I’m suffering again, and by Friday I’m legitimately considering going to the hospital.

The final straw came in July, when I was minding my own business working when my manager needed a staple remover. I had one in this cloth box I kept under my desk which I kept my office supplies in, so I reached in and rummaged around until I found the staple remover. I realized, though, that everything in there felt tangibly wet to the touch, which is odd because I don’t have water spilling around there and I don’t have any liquids around that area. I looked in there and found black mold all throughout the bottom of the box, and I had to throw out 95% of the things I kept in there because it was all COATED in black mold. I honestly made a big scene because ??? What the fuck? And dumped everything out on the floor in front of my managers to see and showed them what I found. One of my managers goes, “Ooh, so that’s where the smell is coming from!” And laughs. I was pretty upset by what I found as well as her reaction, but I for some reason let it slide for a bit. I kept having the same symptoms throughout working, and finally I mustered up the courage to speak to HR about it. She was really understanding but I think had her doubts until I showed her the mold pictures of the box. She said she’d have someone come out and test the mold, which they did two days later. The guy who came out to test it had some weird machine on a cart that he pushed in, ran for five mins in the middle of the room, then left. He took no samples of anything which I thought was weird because I feel like an accurate reading would be moreso swabbing or looking around but he didn’t do that at all. The results of course came back negative and my managers are super happy about that, yet I’m still feeling the same and about to spend hundreds more on testing and allergist appointments because I don’t know what else to do. The best part is!!! They don’t want to move me from the room because it’s “too much”. Especially now with the test coming back negative, they won’t.

My question to you lovely people of Reddit is, am I wrong to feel how I feel for one, and two, if there was mold growing in that box, how is there not mold all around the whole room or at least in the floor/carpet? I don’t know if I’m blowing this thing out of proportion or if my feelings are valid but I just think this is insane and for me to go to such lengths for the sake of my health at my job, I’m just beyond frustrated and lost. If any of you have the knowledge or experience with this sort of thing, please help me lol. And if you made it this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart 💛 I can also provide pictures hopefully in the comments of the mold.",11Oct2020,1

It's been two days since the guy i like from work and I have come for a work trip. I told him about the break up and we were hanging out with drinks in my hotel room. Although he said he's sleepy he stayed post dinner and we were watching something. He stayed after that also and we chatted about random office stuff till he said I look sleepy so he should go.

I have been chickening out about making a move. It seemed he might have been interested but expected me to make a move since I had a recent break up.

612,"Me and this guy are seniors in high school, we’ve been friends since our freshman year. Recently he has been acting super selfish and like he’s better than everyone else. He’s applying to a lot of Ivy League schools, while I’m just planning to stay in state in order to be close to my parents. He kind of shames me for this, saying that the school I really want to get into is his very last option, and is only a safety school to him. The way he says it after I say I want to go there EVERYTIME the topic of college pops up gets exhausting. This is followed by him making fun of every major I show interest in that isn’t engineering lol. 

Not only that, but he’s just been super selfish lately. Since it’s our senior year, more leadership positions are available. He applied for many and got in, but he’s not very passionate about any of them. I asked him to not apply for math club positions, because I really wanted to lead since I had 0 leadership positions and he already had 5. I love math, it’s what I plan on basing my major on next year, so leading math club would really help my transcript. He applied and got way more votes than me, taking the spot I wanted. I really wouldn’t have a problem with this, but I specifically asked him not to and he only did it because I told him he had too many positions. This sparked him being super mad at me and just ignoring me or walking past me whenever I tried talking to him. In turn I just let him ignore me. 

This sudden “break” in the friendship made me ponder on all the things he’s said to me, and I realized he really does treat me unequally. One time when I was trying to tell him he treats me like I’m stupid he said, “you’re smart, just not everyone is good at school” like I think that’s out of pocket. My biggest pride is that I work really hard in school to get the grades I want, unlike him who doesn’t need to do any work and still gets the same grades. He’s told me that my best friend won’t talk to me after high school, and that the only person that would want me is him. Things aligning to that. 

It’s been 2 weeks since we’ve talked, and in all honesty I don’t know what I’m going to do. This isn’t the first time I’ve had these types of problems with him, it’s actually the second. The first time I told him I wanted him to better himself and become a better friend and I don’t think he has. He’s just so clueless and all I want is for him to say “I’m sorry I understand I’ve made these mistakes and I will try to be better” but he can’t. He’s said behind my back that I’m missing points and basically overreacting. But I don’t know, many people I asked about him agree with me and tell me my feelings are valid.

I just want to know what I should do, should I talk to him or continue to wait for him to say something to me first? He’s being so passive aggressive towards me, and I really don’t like the awkward tension we have around each other.",11Oct2020,1

She would send me pictures of herself, we’d talk about our personal lives and exchange music and memes and whatnot, we would also text good morning and goodnight texts. I even decided to message her best friend and she essentially confirmed that i’m the only one who she is talking to. 

The reason why I started to second guess myself was because I received a text from one of my friends saying the girl is just being friendly. We talked more and more about it and he was ignoring my questions and statements. Anyways that whole situation made me really question what was going on and to add on to it the girl who I like texted me “hey im probably gonna be off my phone for the next few days” “theres some stuff that came up” “goodnight”

619,"we’re both 16 f and we’ve known each other since we were 10.  i’m the “introvert” friend and she’s the “extrovert” friend, but other than that we were pretty similiar. we had both strict parents so we’d talk about how annoying our parents were ecc. 

since she turned 15 her parents started going easy on her and letting her out more ecc and she made a lot more friends in the process.
i feel happy for her but everytime we go out she has to invite another friend that i’ve never met or if i want to meet her i have to go with a group of at least 5/6 people that i don’t know, sometimes even 7.  i’m really asocial and i don’t care to meet other people because i’m already happy with the friends i have but she doesn’t seem to really understand that and keeps trying to make me talk to her friends. basically if we go out i want to only be with her

we never liked alcohol, smoking, drugs, discos, boys ecc but she’s changing her mind. she goes out a lot and most of the times she drinks beer or if she goes to the disco she tries to make out with someone. sometimes she posts insta stories for her friends with low-key drug stuff like a selfie with a drawn joint with marijuana leaves and stuff

for example she’s organising a halloween night out but she plans to invite like 10-15 people and most of them are suggesting drinks and getting wasted. i really want to go for her but the thought of spending it with strangers that i don’t even care about isn’t that fun to me. i also don’t know if i want to go as there was another occasion where i went to a pool party and they started drinking while i was the only one who didn’t and felt pretty left out

 don’t get me wrong i care a lot for her and she does too as she calls me her only best friend and stuff but sometimes i don’t know if we are fit for each other. i feel like she puts too much effort in me trying to make me open up and i feel sad when i don’t do it, like she’s trying to care for me but i don’t know how to react

620,"Hello! So right off the bat, I am a notorious procrastinator.  My whole life I grew up top of my class, and able to ace all my tests without any studying.  Now that I’m in high school however, I am starting to take college level classes and it is really starting to impact me.  Growing up the way I did, I never developed the proper study habits needed to succeed, and while I do have amazing grades right now, there is a project I have been putting off that is going to change that

This project was supposed to be started two months ago, during the second day of school, and it is due at 2:00 PM Mountain Time on Monday.  I am working until 9:00 PM tonight, leaving (if I pull an all nighter) 17 hours to complete this assignment.  Out of that 17 hours however, one hour is dedicated to working out, and four are for my other classes in online school, so really I will only have 12 hours to get it done.

For this project, I was supposed to have to read an American novel, and as I read the novel, create journals to document my thoughts, analysis, character development, etc.  these can’t be just written journals either, they have to use some other form of media or creativity on top of a written journal

What I have decided to do is commission a friend of mine to draw most of the main characters (as my extra form of media) and I have skimmed all the (30) pages of cliffnotes on the book.  I have a general understanding of the plot and character development.

For anyone curious the book is A Confederacy of Dunces

I am struggling right now because I do not know what I should do to incorporate the drawings with my written journals, or how I can shorten those 30 pages of cliffnotes down to a measly 7 journals without setting off my teachers plagiarism checker.

I am overwhelmed and have shut down, and I do not know where to start, or how it is possible to complete a project of this magnitude in this amount of time.  If anyone has ideas or suggestions, I could use all the help I can get.  This assignment is 60% of my grade this semester, so anything you are able to provide will be amazing.

I start work in 30 minutes but I will check back as often as I can if more info is needed.",11Oct2020,1
621,"Hi,

I'm a 23 year old male who has never been in a romantic relationship. I've attempted a few times but it never really worked out for me. I haven't dated anyone either because well, I got turned down every time.

I haven't been asked out by anyone yet so I never had the chance to be on the receiving end. I have been trying to figure out whats wrong with me but I haven't found an answer yet.

&amp;#x200B;

**Physical Reasons?**

Could it be lack of height? Could it be lack bad body physique. I am neither too fat nor too thin. I have normal BMI but my height is too low, 155cm(5'1) to be precise. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Reasons?**

 I don't really know how to describe my personality but I'll do my best by explaining in points whatever comes to mind about me. 

1. I like Anime, sometimes I watch sci-fi tv shows as well.
2. I like trying out different cuisines. Food that I like makes me happy.
3. I work as a software engineer
4. I have a few goals that I really wish to achieve and am working on them. Not as fast or as hard as I should be, but ever since this lockdown started I've lost interest in a lot of things.
5. While I do like some things I'm not particularly obsessed with anything. If someone dislikes the things that I like it doesn't really bother me. (or at least I try to not let it bother me)
6. I don't drink or smoke. Don't know if that makes me boring. I'm just looking out for my own body, the city I live in has enough pollution anyway.
7. I like memes and so I make too many meme/joke/movie references when I'm talking to a friend.
8. I like wordplay.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I blame my personality, other times I blame on how dense I am because I generally don't pick up on signs (if there are any).

Every day I can only think along the lines of ""Whats wrong with me?"", ""Why am I not good enough"", ""How can I improve myself?"" and ""What am I doing wrong?""

At this point I have started thinking that maybe love doesn't really exist. Maybe its not meant for me. I can't think of any possible scenario where a girl would be interested in me. It all feels too difficult to even imagine. I can't help but think that if there are better people around me(which is true, this thought is not so hypothetical) then why would anyone chose me over them?

I wish I was good enough. I went through college for bachelors and master's degrees and couldn't date anyone once before pandemic. What hope do I have now?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

I've more or less given up on finding love since I've never been successful in finding dates or relationships before. I don't think things are going to change since I don't generally meet new people and I'm not in college anymore. How do I cope up with being single?

623,"I feel like I need to explain. I live in a lower middle class blue collar neighborhood. We call them “GI” towns, because these houses were all built around the end of WWII, built in a hurry, and VERY close together. This is our first house. We take some pride in it, but we’re not perfect by any means. 

I live a few doors down from this one guy. He’s around mid 30s. It used to be him and his father, but I think his dad passed away, or moved out because it’s just the younger man living there now. I take daily walks, so I have to walk past this house a lot. I’ve noticed a lot of concerning things happening, so I’ll just list them off in order of when they started happening. If you want more details, ask. 

- He cuts his grass once a month. And when he does cut it, it’s almost down to the dirt. 

-He scatters junk in his yard, like geodes, crystals, fake flowers, stuffed animals, tea kettles... random stuff. 

-He’ll dig up the yard and bury the junk he scattered in the early hours.

-He’ll hang random stuff from trees, trash, old blenders, toasters, stuffed animals. 

-Build 10-15 ft fires in his front yard that he’ll throw whatever into. (Again, tires, newspapers, plastics,) You’ll feel the heat 3 houses down. 

-He keeps a bulldog in a cage that’s too small in his front yard. It’s not starved, but it’s vicious. It stays there all day. Even though he has a fenced in yard.

Lastly, are the signs. It started with a presidential 2020 sign. But it evolved into pizzagate like conspiracy theories concerning local governments. Like, Every Halloween local government locks kids in cages, sprays them with cancer chemicals and torture them. All in graphic detail. Some of them with hand drawn pictures. I’d go into more detail as to what they say, but just know, it’s nightmare fuel. 

I told my boyfriend about the signs, but he didn’t believe me and told me to sneak a picture the next time I walk by. I told him I’d try, because sometimes, he’ll sit in his lawn chair and wait for you to make a comment on the signs, so he can talk to you about them. So yesterday, he wasn’t outside, and the house was dark, so I casually got 2 photos of 2 signs as I walked past on the sidewalk (not the house, just the signs). To my horror, he runs outside and stands on his stoop. Yelling something about “don’t take photos of my signs!” And that I was from “the deep state.” I just look at him as I walk past. He watches me walk all the way down the street. 

He’s technically not breaking any laws. Everyone here seems to be aware of how he is, but seems nothing can be done. We just moved here, I feel like we’re stuck. Am I an asshole for being concerned? No one seems to be checking on this man. I should probably just mind my own effing business, but the fires, and the dog, and the signs... everything at once seems like a lot.",11Oct2020,1

I have been around smokers my entire life, basically, I have been a second hand smoker for aslong as I can remember. This led me into hating cigarettes and I had a very biased and strong opinion against it since it is rare to find someone who finds the smell of burning paper appealing. That was untill i tried my first couple of cigarettes and that opinion started shifting. I still don't concider my self a smoker because I don't have any attachment to it, I am what you would call a social smoker, although, I still like the effects and the relief that it gives me and i just feel much better, I usually suffer from mild social anxiety, awkwardness and such but all that kind of disappears when I am on a nicotin high, one of the biggest effects that it has on me is that during arguments my speaking would be interrupted by many things, sometimes I would stutter, I would forget words, my throat would kind of seize up and i am not able to talk, but when I smoke and try to argue all that worry and anxiety vanishes. And I just feel a lot better all around.

629,"So I'm a male in my late 20's, and two years ago I began working at Whole Foods in the bodycare/supplements etc department.

it was great, until about one year later myself and another coworker were moved into the Grocery (main food aisles) department because that's where hours were needed.

The manager there was definitely the complete opposite of the woman that managed Whole Body... this guy was my age (late 20's), and was insensitive, never showed appreciation or encouragement, literally always serious with me, never said hello to anyone... clearly an emotionally unhealthy person. I'm the opposite of all that, so you can imagine we clashed a lot.

So my time in Whole Body, one full year, I was never written up and never had any conflict with management...

I was in Grocery for 8 months and written up 4 times, and fired...

This Grocery manager, let's call him Shawn, would micromanage and constantly get on me for the most minor of things...

I would politely tell him via email how much this stresses me out since I'm a sensitive person...

His response to that would be to be calm and sensitive for one day, and then revert back to his harsh intense demeanor...

he actually amped up his intensity and would be even more overbearing on me, and before I knew it I was called in for a writeup...

didn't organize the aisles perfectly...

I didn't clean the shelf strips how he wanted... I thought he meant sanitize them, when apparently he meant to clean off the sticker residue and to him it's a ""black and white issue""

He also loosely manages health/beauty and wrote me up for not fully working backstock, like excess product we keep in the warehouse. The assistant manager never said it was wrong to work backstock this way.

After two months of adapting once again, being completely focused and working with all my heart, he wrote me up for missing literally two items in backstock... this was a week where I was tasked with working like five literal times more backstock than usual because we were short-handed... i remember it being like 100 degrees back there and climbing up in these bays and i just missed two items in the back.

And then about two weeks later, I decided to take one extra 15 minute break because somebody called off and I had twice the work to do, and didn't see me getting out on my scheduled time... that was apparently the straw that broke the camels back, because the next day i was fired... this was an issue one year ago, but not this year.

*** The crazy part about me taking a second 15 minute break is that my department manager was closing shift manager this night, and when he found out I took an extra break, he rushed me out of there before my work was even complete!

I 99% of the time only do closing shifts and no other closing managers have rushed me out before my work is done... it's always the opposite, you stay until you're done, within reason. There's many times I've had to stay an hour later to work. 

If you work an 8 hour shift you get two 15 minute breaks, otherwise it's just one break.

This particular night where I had twice the amount of work to do, I was under 8 hours and just needed 30 more minutes and it would've been ""legal"" for me to take that second break.

I pleaded in tears at the end of that night to my manager, and how I didn't want to get fired... he went through with it anyways.

The greatest injustice is that ALL of these writeups were during times where I was very distraught, stressed out due to Shawn being so intense with me...

he made me feel like I was always walking on eggshells. He doesn't see that he could be an efficient manager and still be gentle hearted and uplifting and encouraging.

I told Shawn numerous times all year long how it's a very tough time outside of work. I cried at work numerous times due to Shawn's intense behavior... even aside from that, his write ups were not fair.

Around my second writeup I had a strong feeling that Shawn was already planning to fire me through these unjust writeups...

I told HR and emailed regional HR a very thorough detailed statement to undo these writeups, and she told me she was unbiased yet did not remove any of them.

I built such a strong case for myself and store management and local HR, even Shawn told me that they are not wanting to fire me, but they did...

They gave me such a stronger level of scrutinization, and anybody would be fired if they received my level of scrutiny... yet nobody did.

I corrected myself every time after each writeup, and they found something else to write me up for that was so minor.

It felt like no matter how hard I worked, it was never good enough and they were going to fire me eventually no matter how hard I work. I believe they all conspired to fire me.

I believe Shawn wanted me out. I was the odd guy out who was a gentle-hearted person. They want the opposite, like a military mindset. I was outstanding with customer service and progressed by leaps and bounds after each writeup and it was always overlooked how much stress Shawn put me through, how much unfair intense scrutiny he gave me.

It was always so obvious to me that Shawn was looking for excuses to write me up. Nobody else received the level of scrutiny that I did. He was much not laid back with my other coworkers.

Why does it seem I was fired? Does this seem unfair? 

All the store managers and HR think my writeups and termination are justified, while everyone I talk to outside of that sees it as totally unfair.

I was not only fired, but also banned from working at any Whole Foods ever again.",11Oct2020,1
630,"2020 has been a mistake galore for me starting day one. January, hour after midnight at new years eve. My female friend was partying somewhere nearby and was texting me if she could come over (I was just minding my own business in my apartment alone), I told her not to, because I've been dating someone else for a 2-3 months now she was supposed to come to me from another town in a few days, she didn't know about the dating part though. In an hour or so I heard the bell ringing, it was her. We were both a bit drunk and we ended up sleeping with each other. I felt absolutely terrible about that in the morning, and the feeling continued until the girl I was dating arrived a few days later. She stayed for a few days, it was a good time, one of that rare times I felt like I mean something to someone. It quickly changed when one day after the meeting we had an argument over messanger. We only talked for one more day, and stopped talking. It wasn't until half a year later that I realized the situation ended like this because I was being arrogant. 

This was about the time I started developing the feeling of extreme loneliness on the course of next few weeks. About 40-50 days later I invited yet another girl I've been occasionally texting for a long time (both lived around my home town). For some reason she also accepted the invitation. So we were drinking alcohol and talking, it was going kind of nicely. For some reason after a few hours I did some fucked up things and things become awkward (nothing illegal, but I wanted to get too close). We went to sleep, other day was also awkward. She went back to her town and never talked to me again. I felt absolutely terrible for next few weeks (I still feel bad about this to this day). 

Some time later corona virus lock down happened and I went back to my home town to my family (working remotely). I didn't want to be alone for next two months or so. It was around second/third week of March. I wasn't really talking to anyone besides my family and my best friend for another month. Around 2nd/3rd week of April I started texting this girl, we've known each other for a long time but never really talked much. for another month we texted each other 1-3 times a week or so, in the mid/late May we started talking pretty much every day and the covid lock down was starting to go down. last week of May and the first of June we met a few times. I really liked her and felt like she liked me back too. But I had to go back to the other city, to the office. We continued talking, she visited me in a few weeks in my place in the other city. I still remembered what I did a few months back so I tried holding my distance. And, well, everything went exceptional, no fuck-ups this time. this was probably the time I fell for her. For next two months I've been driving to my home city to visit my friends, family and her (especially her). Around first week of July I told Her how I felt about her, but she told me that she isn't ready for anything after her last abusive relationship, that she has to get things straight in her life, and that she believes that she'd hurt me. Without going into much of the details, it sounded pretty rational, not the bullshit kind of excuse. I told her that I can wait until she gets her things straight.

This was the time I started losing my sanity. Every next time we met something always must have happened between us. I started feeling extremely jealous about her. We were in a club, drunk. I wanted to go dance with her but she said she needed to rest for a while. I was like ok. Her friend took her somewhere to talk to her, I thought that they had gone dancing. I felt furious and just left and gone home. On the way out I told her other friend to pass her a message ""go fuck yourself"". Next two days we talked about that incident and about my feeling toward her. She was stalwart with her decision, so I decided that we should stop talking. Neither of us wanted to stop but we just had different expectations. 

Had I kept to this decision everything would probably be all right present day. But I didn't, I just couldn't stop thinking about her. I've become obsessed with her. After a week or so we started talking again. Also this was about the time I negotiated permanent remote work and went back to my hometown. It was her who motivated me to negotiate this, I wanted to work remotely to meet with my friends more often (she was the deciding factor tough). 

Then it was on/off I get mad about something, get furious, stop talking to each other, start talking again. Every time this happened my sanity got damaged.

One time it was so extreme she got mad at me and the talks went really rough. It was about the time she helped me realize I had anger problems (no, I didn't realize that earlier). It was the first time I made her mad at me. we didn't talk for about two weeks. I have never felt so bad before, I felt I was going insane. I don't remember apologizing this much to anyone before. We kind of talked to each other after that but it no longer was the same. Since this moment I am trying to get this feeling (towards her) to disappear, but I feel like that's impossible. I want to stop this feeling but deep inside I don't want to. 

I am writing all this because I made her mad at me again, and I realized I didn't make any progress on not doing stupid mistakes (nothing stupid for almost two months though). My sanity is on a brink and I am currently in a mood of dropping everything, cutting all contacts and going on a month long journey somewhere far (but hey, covid won't let me). At least I realized how much of an unlikable cunt I am.

633,"I’ve had awful experiences with girls in the past and I feel like it’s happening all over again 


We were childhood friends but lost contact for years and years but recently since August we’ve been reconnecting and it’s been great. It felt like she really liked me and it felt special since we used to be childhood friends. 

She sends me “good morningggg” texts, memes, and we talk all day 24/7. She is so caring and showers me with love and care. She tells me how secure I make her feel and how happy she is to have me in her life. 

It really felt special and I assumed she felt that way too cause why else would she be texting me all that stuff?


But when we hungout for the first time and everything was going great. We were laughing and talking nonstop. It was all good until she randomly blurts out she’s still in this long distance thing with her ex. She went on to complain about how awful he is and isn’t sure how to break things off with him

This seems like a red flag to me and my anxiety is being triggered really bad. I was starting to feel safe and content with her but when she brought up how she still has a thing with her ex it caught me off guard. 

Everyday since then I’ve been an anxious mess. My thoughts consist of “why was I not good enough? Why would she text me all that nice stuff if she didn’t mean it?”

635,"About 25 years ago, when I was 11 or 12, two of my younger relatives began to act as if we were pretending to have sex. We were on top of each other (clothed) and imitating by moving up and down. 

I know that kids play and explore. There are a couple of things that bother me. I was the oldest at 11 or 12. The others were younger than me by 3 and 5.5 years. This pains me so much because they were too young to be exposed to this.

When the youngest and I were imitating, I told him that licking was a part of it, meaning that adults licked each other. I believe my intent was to just tell him to mimic, but I believe he licked my shoulder. I’m not sure if I told him to stop or he just stopped. I don’t believe it was my intention to have him lick my shoulder.

The other thing is that when the other two were imitating together, I told them to do it in their underwear. They immediately said no and I said ok. I don’t know why I said to do this. I don’t think it was for  anything vicarious, but it might have been to be mean or funny, or just to see if they would do it. It was probably some combination. I’m so glad they said no though.

I had also picked up prone masturbation (where you rub yourself against the surface) though I didn’t know what it was or what masturbation was. At one point I demonstrated briefly (clothed) that if you move back and forth it feels like you are having sex. I had worked out at some point that the feelings were related to sex, but I just thought it was something I discovered that no one else knew about.

I don’t recall there being anything stimulatory and there weren’t any overt sex acts. As far as I can remember it was all pretend play.

As I said, this was 25 years ago. It’s never been brought up. I don’t recall thinking about it again until I was 15 after I watched a video on sexual abuse and this memory popped up. I have ocd too, so I tend to obsess on thoughts and mistakes.

I can’t stop thinking of this. Even if I grant that kids play, I can’t forgive myself for the difference of ages, the licking part (although I don’t think it was intended) and telling the others to do it in their underwear.

Do you think I harmed the others? Should I say something to the others (some say I should, and some say I shouldn’t). I’m not sure if they remember it or if they were harmed. Bringing it up could cause shame? How can I work on healing this?",11Oct2020,1

638,"This post is going to sound pretty fucked up because it is.

First of I'll put out some reasons why it's not plausible, organ removal can only be done by a skilled group of medical professionals, an organ needs to be the right match for it to be worth anything and also organ theft is extremely rare and often originates from urban legends.

Yet, what my friend went through sounds like he may of had his kidney stolen. I'm not sure if hes in denial or genuinely dosent think he was the victim of organ traffickers but why not go to hospital and check ?

Because he flat out refuses as he says that its not plausible. So I low key suspect he willingly sold kidney to some organ traffickers.

This is what happend according to him, he was walking back to his house when someone asked if he new the time, next thing he new he was knocked out after someone hit him from behind.

He wakes up 48 hours later in an abandoned warehouse, feeling drugged and confused. Hes in his boxers with a huge cut down his abdomen which had been bandaged and stitched. He was in a lot of pain and couldn't really walk at first.

He had no phone and had to walk to the nearest house, where he phoned a friend to pick him up. The friend said he looked half dead and very out of it.

He says this was just a retaliation from when he jumped someone but wtf, I've never heard of someone getting kidnapped stabbed and then professionally stitched and bandaged up by some teenagers before.

That shit dosent happen, somethings not adding up. I've seen the scar and its huge. I'm so confused. 

It's like he wants to open up but dosent know what to say but I'm meeting him this Friday to smoke, so he might tell me what happend then but I doubt it.

I'm not sure how to proceed but I find this whole situation to be super strange and kinda fucked.

TL;DR My friend sold his kidney to some organ traffickers but wont admit it ?

I'll add, he is a very dodgy person and I wouldn't be surprised if he'd some how become involved with organ traffickers",11Oct2020,1

I miss someone wiping my tears away and telling me it's going to be ok. I miss the friend group we had. I have a new one and I really like it as well, but it still stings to know I'll never be held like that again by him. Not that I'd let him anymore. It's a bunch of complicated emotions. I thought I had moved on but I guess I haven't not fully at least. Any advice on how to just, well, forget? To become indifferent? I just want to be ok and love again. Now I've just convinced myself that I'm too ugly and fat and obnoxious to be loved since ''he wouldn't have cheated if there had not been something wrong with me''.

* I'm a University freshman taking 3 classes per semester this year. 
* I plan to be a nurse, which will take me around 6 years total. 
* I don't mind my job, but scheduling has been a bit of a pain in the ass. 

______________________________________________________________________



**The situation**

I can't work on Thursday/Friday/Sunday because my dad's and brother's cars aren't available for me to use.

I have classes on Tuesdays/Thursdays, but I can work on Tuesdays since lectures get uploaded and I have access to notes, to do at my own time.

The biggest issue is that my incompetent manager refuses to change my availability (I requested MTWS), despite me mentioning on my resume that I would need to change my schedule once the school year started *(I got hired in April, when school was out)*.

This forces me to have to scramble to find someone to take my shifts (Which is rare to find since most of my co workers are also students), or I have to call in sick, which I hate to do because it makes everyone's job harder.

**The Finances:**

Financially speaking, I'll be alright? My student loan debt at the moment is $3,050, but I have around $4,500 saved up, which leaves me at around $1,500 net worth at the moment. I'll be taking out around 3,000 for each semester of school, so I'm become a nurse with around $35,000 in debt. This loan is interest free for the time, I'm at school. My parents are great and they don't force me to pay any bills, so I'll be okay in terms of housing.

* Liabilities: Student debt. Approx. $3,000 per semester x 2 semesters a year = **$6,000 a year** 
Gas money for brothers car, approx. $50 per month x 12 months = **$600 a year**
* Spending: I can be reckless at times, but it's manageable.

**Cons for quitting:**


* No more money coming in

* Finding a job in this economic climate is very hard. This is my first job ever and it took me months of searching to even get interviewed. Not to mention my availability is limited which hurts my chances even more.

* Quitting may kill my chances of being rehired with Walmart

* I won't be able to buy a car (I was planning to buy my dad's off of him for $1,500)

* I feel soft for quitting cause of some adversity.


**Pros for quitting:**

* More time to focus on my studies, and health. I haven't been fully able to focus on my classes because whenever I work, I ended up feeling wayy too drained to dedicate time to studying, and I end up just breezing past it, without really putting in effort. Also work can be mentally draining.

* More time to work on myself. I'd like to lose weight and I enjoy working out, but work drains all my energy and I get too lazy to workout/eat healthy.

* The student debt isn't terrible. $36,000 is a lot of money, but nurses in Canada can start off making $70,000 a year, and since the loan is interest free for the first 6 months after I graduate, I can probably pay it off fairly quick.

* Bit of a stupid point, but I think starting from the bottom will be good for me, it'll put me in an uncomfortable situation and I truly believe that I can make it out fine.",11Oct2020,1

657,"Alright so basically I've been raised in a sort of a country side. I live far away from a small city in which theres basically only one friend-circle thats my age. These are my childhood friends, people I grew up with and as of late I feel that they're treating me very badly.. Now, I'll admit I'm a guy who takes the most easiest things to heart and dwell on it for a couple days. So I'm unsure if what they're doing is actually bad for me or them just fucking around.

Basically, they really like to annoy me and tease me, when I go to say things they often come out wrong because I talk rather fast than I should, which they use to mock me which can go on for weeks to months.. They continue to use this technique with everything I happen to do wrong, or anything else I happen to do they find funny. As of late they've been embaressing me on the street etc, calling out names loudly and shit etc.. I've told them countless times to stop, like actually dead on serious telling them to stop, and in the moment they usually agree and say they stop in which I get relief. But after the talk they just carry on with their bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you know all this, what the fuck should I do? I really feel like I'm starting to hit a boiling point and I really dont wanna be with them anymore, is that just me over-reacting or are they actually just assholes? 

Now if yes, I really don't know where to go, sure I could stay inside and talk online and stuff but I feel like I'm missing out in that case, which is a motiviation to why I'm still hanging out with them. 

Sure I could just find new people to hang with, thats the big problem here, I basically have nowhere to go as I live far away, and the nearest ""city"" is pretty small with nothing special around. Basically they're the only friend group of my age thats around. And I really dont wanna spend my time inside all day.

662,ok i’m 19 and really thought I found my passion in music I love singing learning guitar and just music in general. I am doing trade school for music production and this is my first semester. It has been so hard. I’m behind most students my age. I have been so stressed trying to learn everything on top of life stressors and mental health issues. Any ways now I can’t ever get myself to do my homework or practice music at all. I’m so overwhelmed. I thought maybe it’s my depression and today I was having a really bad day then I told myself you know what i’m just accepting that i’m not doing homework or anything today (that way i would stop being so hard on myself all day about doing nothing because it was making it worse) so after i said this to myself a weight lifted and i could get out of bed  make a meal smile even. My point is what if this isn’t even my passion? I mean when I sing it lights me up I feel so amazing or when I learn a new song on guitar. But i feel like i’m losing myself i’m almost 20 and not nearly as experienced as other people i feel like people think i’m in denial or something. I just don’t know what to do at this point to make a living because if i drop out of this program i am screwed and i don’t know how to keep up and I absolutely hate school (i do well in school but it literally drains the life out of me and makes me absolutely lifeless) I just feel so sad that I’m so confused and don’t know who i am or what i’m doing. if anyone has any advice about what they think i’m not seeing or life advice in general even personal stories help me I feel very alone.

663,"I have a German Shepherd crossbreed which was a rescue from a really bad situation around two years ago.

The dog was caged up all day, with another dog yapping at him and a young kid with adhd banging on the cage. Poor guy had never even seen grass before and didn't even look back when I took him out of the house.

He wasn't toilet trained or anything despite the owner telling us he was. He still is extremely skittish and pees occasionally when petted. He's been to professional training and I've been working with him for two years but today has been a nightmare.

He's attacked my girlfriend for the fourth time. The first couple of times was fairly minor and we figured out was food guarding so I made a set routine for feeding and it seemed to solve the issue...

Then my girlfriend was playing with him and he flipped out, completely out of the blue and drew blood pretty heavily on her arm. I told her that was it at that point and I'm going to have to have him put down. My girlfriend really loves animals though and managed to convince me to keep him and she would be careful and stupidly I agreed.

Fast forward to today, we got back from a small trip and picked him up from the kennel today. He seemed really tired and not like his usual self, we were just about to go to bed and my girlfriend went to pet him and say goodnight and he bit her arm again but wouldn't let go. I dragged him off and locked him in his room but when I went in to tell him off he raised his lip at me like he was thinking of biting me too.

I've told my girlfriend that's the final straw and he's likely going to have to be put down tomorrow. Now she's saying she's breaking up with me over it.

I know I'm doing the right thing, especially after four times of aggression but am I missing any other alternative? I have no doubt this will keep happening if something isn't done and next time I may not be home to stop it.",11Oct2020,1
664,"So, my apologies in advance, this is a very in-depth post lol. I am (21f), and I’ve been studying in university for 2 and a half years now. I recently got married and moved to a new city, which gave me the opportunity to start fresh. I decided I would switch majors from biology to materials science because I thought it would be more employable. 

I think the classes I’m taking now are pretty interesting, but everything is online so it’s hard to focus, and I’m mostly faking my way through at this point. My classes have been difficult for me, mostly because i have no routine and I have such a lack of motivation. Being stuck at home because of the virus has really impacted me, along with being in a new place with no friends.

In addition to this, if I continue next semester, I will have to start taking out loans to attend school. I never had to previously. This will amount to many thousands of dollars in debt. With my husband (23m) working full time, and me working part time from home, we are basically making ends meet from month to month. We have enough, but nothing is  leftover to go into savings. My husband is stressed about this because he wants to settle down into a house and start a family, and I do too. To do that, we need to save a lot more. 

To sum things up, I am asking for advice. Should I continue attending university for a materials science and engineering degree that will put us in a lot of debt and take away from our savings? Or, an alternative I’ve been thinking of, should I find a technical program that is affordable, that maybe I would enjoy just as well, so I can start making a significant amount of money asap? I could always go back to university later on. Thanks for reading, if you made it this far.",11Oct2020,1

I really like her as a person and I've always felt we had a great relatioship, which is flattering because she's picky with who she chooses to associate with. 

At one point during our drinking, while the birthday boy was in another room, she came over to me and it seemed like she was trying to just put her arm around my waist. I assumed the best and asked ""are you okay, what's up?"" She was silent and continued to put her arm around me so I repeated my question. Then she slowly slid her hand off and touched my ass but I couldn't tell if that was intentional or not which makes this more difficult. Then she kinda slunk away and leaned against a wall a few feet away and I asked again if she was okay but she was silent.

But this time, when I saw her, she was by definition: smoking hot. I kid you not, she was drop dead gorgeous and she knew I was staring at her too.

About an hour in, she asked me to walk her to the bathroom since it was far away and she didn't know the area too well. I obliged and guided her to the nearest bathroom but she asked me to come in with her because she thought it would look weird if I stood outside. I thought that was really weird but I went along with it anyway.

She went in the bathroom, washed her hands (COVID and stuff) and then locked the door. She looked me right in the eyes and just said ""You want me, dont you?"" I was obviously flustered, since I clearly did and she knew it. She did a little kissy face thing, winked, and then left the bathroom with me just dumbfounded.

So part of me thinks that this is a golden opportunity, right? Like this is any horny teen's fantasy. But the other part of me is telling me this is a horrible idea, not only because she is distant family, but also since in a year from now, I'll be 18 and this shit will go downhill REAL fast.

Around this September, I deleted my TikTok basically leaving me with no social media besides YouTube (I don't really count Reddit cause I don't use this much at all). I kept Youtube cause it's not something that's toxic like spending 3 hours just to get a picture you look good in for some likes (I'm looking at you Instagram) and it's also a really dope app. **Basically, I deleted all my social media.**

I’ve been taking care of my mother and youngest brother since I was 15 years old. I was struggling in high school. I have a learning disability and struggling with my mental health. At the same time I’m trying to remain strong for my mother and youngest brother. I have a big family but we not close. There was a time when we had no food. We was behind on our rent and no one in my family helped us. I learned how to be independent because of that. There was days when we had no food. The little food that was left I gave to my mother and brother. I stood without eating. I was struggling through depression suicidal thoughts. For so many years it was hard. I was trying to repress those suicidal thoughts. I was fighting my own battle that no one knew and no one will ever know. I sank into depression and couldn’t eat. Everyone thought my weight loss was due to a diet but it was because my depression and when I’m depressed I can’t eat and have no appetite. My mental health is getting worse and I don’t know how to seek help. I’ve been committed to a mental hospital before but that didn’t help me. They kept me in a room all by myself for two weeks and I felt even more alone. Loneliness is the worst feeling. I suffer from major PTSD as well as other mental health problems and that was caused by something bad that happened to me a few years ago. I don’t trust anyone. I don’t believe in trust anymore. When someone who claims they love you and care about you hurts you and caused you so much pain that you try and take your own life, that changes you. It changes your views on the world.

I don’t believe in love anymore. I don’t believe in friendship. I don’t believe in family. I feel alone. I’ve been having these depression episodes and it’s hard to deal with.

I can help it , it's like a fidget for me, same with biting my lips , pulling out hair, and I also sometimes like to burn my self (with an iron) so I can pull of the scab and a new one I've started is sucking on the skin of my arms until it bruises. 
I don't know why but it's very satisfying for me to do these things. I have gone to a doctor about my acne and my dad thinks it's not acne and that it's just me being self destructive.

695,"I don't know what happened, I swear just the other day I was having the time of my life and within the space of a few weeks it all turned to shit.

Last year I took a gap year before my final year of uni. I didn't use that time to travel or anything, I got a simple bar job. It was a risk, but it turned out to be the best year of my life. I made the best friends I have ever had, and I finally learnt how to socialise. I was almost never at home - for someone who as a teen spent most of my free time on my computer, it was the greatest feeling in the world.

I've never laughed so hard or so much as I did that year. I even loved working as I loved my colleagues.

Then the year came to a close and I had to go back and finish uni. At the same time as this, I got hit with severe acne (which I'm still experiencing to this day - and this was over a year ago now). I spent all my time in my room. I was alone, and miserable. I had to quite my job. I suddenly had zero social life, and my skin just got worse and worse.

The light at the end of the tunnel was getting my final year out the way. The plan was to get right back to where I was the year previous. Then of course, COVID hit.

Well I graduated in May, and I here I still am at home. Hardly a friend, hours away from those friends I made last time.

I feel it's not much to ask. I don't wish for lots of money, nor travels to exotic places. Quite simple things really: A job in a bar, and some good friends and social life.

As hard as I'm trying to get back to a life like that, I can't find a job in the service industry due to COVID. I know it's selfish to think this way, but I feel like the lockdown couldn't have come at a worse at than 22 after just graduating university. I hated uni and studying, and I'd been so excited to get on with my life in a way that I wanted to.

I feel like even if I went back to that area things would never be the same. That year was magical, the best year of my life and if I try to recreate it, it will just disappoint me.

696,"I’m new to reddit so and I am a bit stressed so sorry for spelling and punctuation errors. I’m 16, I fell in love with a girl that I met back in June and she loves me back. Unfortunately it is a long distance relationship and we have run into a few problems. Up until this point I have never been in a relationship before and I feel very dependent on her. She makes me happy especially in these current times where I can’t go out and do anything. I very often feel frustrated because even though we both love each other she is not allowed to date because her parents decided she could not until she was 16 (she is 15 right now). I find myself stressed out because I sometimes I’ll spend a great majority of my day with her on FaceTime and my parents will get angry at me for not doing all the chores I’ll need to do or letting one or two school assignments get turned in late, I feel awful about letting my parents down but nothing else is even motivating me to try anymore except her. Even so I can’t hug her, hold her, kiss her or do anything physical because she lives a day away. I feel so cold and empty when I’m not talking to her but I want more when I am talking to her and it’s going to be at least another year before we meet up irl. Not only that but I have a host of mental issues such as ADHD,OCD and a generalized anxiety disorder that affect me quite a lot and very frequently. She is very accepting and cares because whenever I get upset I dont take it out her but I still feel bad I have to deal with it every day. Recently I had a friend of mine go to a mental hospital, I had previously told his mother about the dangerous stuff he had been posting on social media and I felt powerless because I couldn’t help more. When he finally got out of the hospital my phone broke and I couldn’t text or call to check up on him like I told his mom I would and now he doesn’t want to talk to me. This is all while the girl I love was giving me a hard time for not being able to give her attention and whenever I want attention it’s like her priorities trump mine. I sometimes feel like I want to split up with her but I know that will break her heart and mine. I feel like I am putting her through so much with my anxiety and I also feel like I’m not getting enough out of this relationship but right now it’s all I have to motivate me. My best friend won’t talk to me, my parents are mad at me and I feel bad for the only way I find comfort and motivation to wake up in the morning anymore is the girl I love who I can’t see.

so there’s another thing that will tie in with this, so I bought a car in april of this year because my older one was having problems and long story short I got fucked over again and sold a bad car now I’m in debt with that. if I make as much as I think I’m gonna make by December of this year then I’ll be able to pay it off but I won’t be left with much in my savings if I do pay it off and once and quitting my job would be a risk but I’m also unhappy. or I can keep the money and just keep making payments on my car so I can have some money to back me up rather than making one big payment that I can’t really make at once.  (btw I don’t have much savings because I was young and dumb blowing my money since I didn’t have no responsibilities nut now life hit me and I’m taking it more serious lol) anyway I really just wanna pay it off and get rid of it because that car is problems and I wanna be done with the payments and eventually get a better one. if anybody has on advice on what I should do please comment, I just wanna be happy and not make a bad mistake, if you have experienced this yourself I’d really love your input thank you",11Oct2020,1

699,"Im not a native english speaker, so im sorry for the mistakes.
So:
Last night my boyfriend visited me. I am 19 f, he is 20. Our parents are very strict, his parents dont know that i exist, mine do know my boyfriend but dont allow him to visit me in my own home. (But they do allow staying somewhere else together) since we rarely have the opportunity of spending the night together at some other place, i occasionally sneak him in and out of our apartment, usually during the day and when i know that my parents are gone for definitely at least a few hours. 

Yesterday night he told me that he will be out until the morning with friends and i jokingly asked him if he wanted to spend the night at my place (my parents are very heavy sleepers) He liked the idea. 

Fast forward at around 3 in the morning he is outside my apartment complex. I told him that he can ring our doorbell, since i muted the sound (he has to ring, otherwise the button for the entrance door of the apartment complex wont open) i also thought about just going downstairs but our doors are heavy and wont close quietly, so opening it once for him to come in was already risky. 
So i told him to ring the door bell. He did, but accidetally pressed on the door bell of our neighbour, who instantly opened the door for him. I must say that the door bells might seem confusing for people who dont live here- its a really big apartment complex and in front and at the end of every name is a button for the doorbell. Like this: doorbell-name-doorbell and not how it is with most apartments/houses in a horizontal way. (Like: doorbell-name
                                     doorbell-name
                                     etc.) 
(I hope you understand how i mean it 😖)
My boyfriend usually does hit the right doorbell but i guess he was a bit tired or so.
I was so focused on sneaking him in quietly, and not so much on my Neighbour. I thought that since its sunday the next day he might still be awake, watching tv or so ( thats also how i explained to myself why he opened the door that fast.) 

in the morning we left pretty early. I had some things to do and he had to leave before my parents woke up. I was back home at 10 am. Shortly after my arrival, my Neighbour knocked on the door. My parents were awake, but in other rooms so luckily they didnt catch much of the conversation. 

To keep it short, my neighbour explained to me that my boyfriend accidentally ringing on his door ended in a catastrophe. His whole family was wide awake in an instant and they were all in panic. They didnt sleep anymore the rest of the night, and his kids were so tired and stressed. Apparently it had a really deep impact on them and i was honestly a bit baffled ( I barely hear our doorbell, since we have massive doors and walls in the whole apartment, and the other apartments do too, and our ringtone is already set to the highest volume. )  
But i apologized a few times, explained to him that it was my boyfriend who used the wrong doorbell and that it was not my intention to scar them all that deeply. I dont know if he understood it, he seemed to be really pissed off, which i understand because i am aware that even if i wouldnt have reacted that way, that people experience things in different ways and something so insignificant to me could be a much bigger deal for other people.
As i said, i did apologize while talking to him and i feel that he also said everything that he wanted to say, but after sleeping a bit and having clearer thoughts i felt so bad the rest of today. I still feel like crying, because i hate to make other people feel bad and im thinking about apologizing again by pinning a note onto their door and leaving a basket with chocolate  on the doormat, i think this would be a less aggressive way opposed to knocking on their door and talking to them again. But im also scared that it would be too much and im just exaggerating the whole situation because of my anxiety. What do you guys think? Maybe if you agree, you have some other suggestions?",11Oct2020,1

701,"My cousin and I are super close (we are both women in our early 20s) and we are similar ages. I notice guys fetishize us. It always made me feel uncomfortable, but it seems to be getting worse.

I dated a guy in high school who secretly fetishized us. I found out when I saw a snapchat conversation from his friend that basically said, ""are you with the hot cousins"" and he replied,   
""no only one of them."" I saw because we were hanging out, I saw it over his shoulder. This was really degrading considering we were dating? I was young when it happened (around 16), so I didn't even think much into it. I just knew I felt uncomfortable and maybe even objectified? I also felt upset that my boyfriend was open about being attracted to my family member. 

Years later my cousin and I are at a party where we see this specific ex. Basically, the ex was ALL over my cousin and wouldn't stop flirting with her in front of me. This brought back the old memory of him fetishizing us. I felt upset, I kinda felt like our relationship was him secretly being in love with my cousin. And despite the fact that I was over him, it is still not the best feeling to think your ex only dated you because of your cousin.

I also had another boyfriend who did not keep it secret. He said to me he wanted to have a threesome with my cousin and I. I remember feeling extremely uncomfortable, way more than when I was 16. I think this is when I put it together that guys fetishized us. He would say it often too, I ended up breaking up with him thankfully. 

I have a boyfriend now and he has never once fetishized us. Thinking back to boyfriends who did is really uncomfortable for me, though. My first ex who I dated at age 16 was also known to be a really nice guy. Everyone looked up to him as being really kind, moral, and respectful. I just feel upset and angry that there are guys who can be viewed as having those characteristics yet they will still fetishize women? The way guys fetishize my cousin and I just make me feel like they view me as a sex object. Also, these guys are encouraging incest between my cousin and I? It's kinda gross and it makes me view my cousin differently. It isn't my cousin's fault, but whenever I meet a new guy I worry about them having eyes for her and wanting a threesome with us.

703,"This is quite a story so buckle up or gtfo.


I'm hoping that the Reddit community can help me with an issue I am having.  My parents have told me I am being selfish and impolite about this issue.  I (obviously) disagree, and believe that they are ignoring the elephant in the room and giving someone a free pass, who does not deserve one.


In order for this all to make sense, I'll need to include some backstory on my Dad's side of the family.  My Dad and my Uncle stopped taking to their brother (I'll call him SC) after a falling out when their parents died.  After that we never spent holidays with them or really even talked to them.


SC is (still) married to a woman who I'll refer to as Libby.  Libby had a sister with severe mental health issues, who was unable to care for her child.  So Libby and SC did an amazing thing and agreed to take the child at about the age of 3, so that she could have a stable home until her sister could sort her life out.  That didn't end up happening and they adopted her.


This child was raised with our family as our cousin. My siblings, my cousins and me grew up with her at every birthday and holiday, and to this day, I still consider her to be my cousin.


Unfortunately, as she grew into her teenage years, she began to show signs of mental illness. Soo Libby and SC decided that best course of action was to kick her out and completely disown her.  (I am well aware that teenagers can be terrible and even dangerous (I was one such teenager), and that parents can kick them out as a last resort, but without going into details, that's not how it happened. They gave up on her within a year of her issues arising.)  Neither of them have talked to her since.  


Within the last three years, SC has decided to leave his bitch of a wife and reconnect with his two brothers (my Dad and my Uncle).  We were elated upon hearing his eagerness to be a part of our lives again, and we all enjoyed our first holiday together in 15 years.


Both of SC's brothers agreed to loan him (large) amounts of money to help him get through his divorce, with the promise that he will pay them back after his divorce has been finalized.


Everything seemed to be looking up until last year, when my Dad gets a phone call from SC.  SC is calling to tell my Dad that he has a son.


""Is this a child from an affair?""  No.
""Did he accidentally get his (much younger) girlfriend pregnant?"" No.  
""Did he adopt a child who was in need of a home.""  No.
What he did do, is fly across the continent to another country (the states) and hired a fucking fertility clinic who got an egg donor and surrogate to produce him a custom child.  


(Fun fact: SC tried to get a surrogate in Canada, but the regulating body for surrogates said he was too old and did not have his affairs in order.  What a surprise)


We were all initially shocked by this and I honestly didn't know what to think at first.  My family has come to more or less accept SC and his new baby.  Initially, I wasn't sure how to feel, but the more I've thought about it, the angrier I've become.


So on top of all that, he has decided that in the event he ""gets into a car accident"" (like he isn't far more likely to die from heart disease or a stroke because he's fucking 70?!), one of the cousins (there are 5 of us) should take him.  My oldest cousin and his wife have three children and are done having babies, my other cousin and my older brother both aren't sure if they or their wives even want children, and my younger brother and his wife do want children, but my brother told me he has no interest in taking the child of his recently un-estranged uncle, and as for me, I have never had any interest in having any children ever (but because I'm the only cousin with fucking fallopian tubes he thought I'd be a sure bet).


(Fun fact: he has no plan (financial or otherwise) for the child's future or any back up plan since all the cousins said they wouldn't take him.  SC likely won't even be alive by the time the child is 15.)


My one cousin and my older brother have said that if there were any chance of them adopting the child in the event something happened to SC, they would have to have an established relationship with the child.  As it stands, SC lives in a city almost 4 hours away from the rural community where both his brothers and all 5 of us cousins live.  In order for my cousin and brother to have a consistent relationship with the child, they would have to move to our community so we could see them more than a handful of times a year.  


SC won't move.  Is it because he's concerned about the quality of education in our rural area?  No.
Is it because he has friends in the city who are close to him and his child?  No.
Is it because our area's lack of timely access to healthcare?  No.
It's because SC thinks that being in a city makes it easier to find a woman (not over 50, by the way) who will want to marry him and raise his child (he's still not even divorced from Libby).  He won't do what is undoubtedly best for his own child, because he wants some fucking tail.  


(Fun fact: he thinks that the child is a ""chick magnet"" [his words].  He doesn't realize women are thinking, ""What a cute baby!  It's nice to see a grandpa spending time with his grandson"", instead of ""What a cute baby!  I really want to fuck his 70-year-old father."")  


I do have to say that he appears to be an adequate parent in that he is able to meet the basic every-day needs of his child, (he was already a parent to a child at one time) but outside of that, I do not trust him.


My opinion is that he is a selfish cunt (SC), and that we need to talk to him about his life choices and how they are damaging his child and his family.  I don't trust him with the child as he already abandoned his own adopted daughter when things got tough, and won't make basic decisions so that this child can get the best chance in life.  


My parents' opinion is that what's done is done and there's no point talking to him about it because it will cause stress and that's not best for the child.


If we really want to go with what is best for the child, I think that the child should be adopted out ASAP to a stable, loving home where his best interests are at heart, and that SC should get a stuffed dog in a purse because that's all he fucking deserves.


I'd like to hear people's opinions on what I should do.  He's currently at my parents' house.  I've hidden myself away I my room with my critters to avoid him because I am unable to pretend everything is fine.  I honestly can't fucking stand him.",11Oct2020,1

705,"As a teen, I have major regrets about how I treated a few people I came across or were friends with. To name them simply:

* I stated personal things about a friend to look better in front of peers, once. I've regretted this since it happened, and I find myself almost wanting to cry knowing I did this to a person. After this happened, I immediately cleaned up my attitude around this. However, I can't help but feel as if this person should be apologized to personally. But I do not know this person anymore, and we are not friends. 
* I yelled at a girl from my class, who had been talking behind my back for quite a while. However, as bad as that was, I ended up yelling at her in front of our entire class, because I became very angry at her, when I was in earshot of this. No matter how bad it was, I feel as if she at least deserved to be confronted personally, and not by me mocking her in front of others.

With this information, I wonder whether I should reach out to these people and apologize, and tell them that what I did at the time was not okay. The reason I am only contemplating this, is because I only did this to these people once. Never again. I have a very small temper/attitude usually, so it felt like I burst at these times, and I did something I could never imagine doing. I also know that this sense of dread maybe is my own fault, since maybe seeking them out seems selfish. Like i want to feel better with myself, despite doing these things. Also, these things happened around 5-6 years ago. But they still come to mind whenever says I am nice, as I deeply feel sad about them. I am coming onto Reddit because I don't want anyone to know how I have acted. I am ashamed of it. But I have written it out as clear as I can, and as objective as I can s:

710,"So my ~5 year old cat, Buddy (I know, clever name, but we named him after Will Ferrell’s “Elf” so don’t judge me) has always been an outdoor cat. We live in a pretty secluded area in front of a giant forest/farm, it’s very animal friendly so we allow our cats to wander freely out there. There are no roads or any wild animals around, so it’s very safe, we don’t even have raccoons. Anyway, Buddy, along with our other cats, would spend most of the day outside unless it was raining or snowing.

Buddy is a very fluffy, kinda chubby, black cat. He seems like the ideal cat to snuggle with, but he very much dislikes cuddling and being picked up. He’s never bit or scratched me, but he meows and whines whenever I pick him up, and always struggles to get out of my grasp. All he wants to do is go outside and unless he’s eating, he just paws and meows at the door until he’s let out.

Since we’re getting into fall/winter soon, it’s started to rain a lot. And I might just be overprotective here, but I really don’t like it when he’s outside all night in the rain. I know he’s safe and can take care of himself, but I just feel sad thinking about him sleeping alone in the cold. I’ve tried and tried to get him to warm up to me and sleep in my room like my other two cats, but he just won’t have it. If I ignore his whining long enough, eventually he’ll settle down, but I can still tell he’s unhappy.

Maybe I’m just selfish and should accept the fact that he just would rather be outside, but I really wish that he’d spend more time with me. Is there anything I can do to make him like the indoors and being cuddled? I’ve tried giving him treats, and I do have a bowl of food and water in my room whenever I have a cat in there with me.

Thank you to anyone who gives me advice. And I’m trying to subtly make it clear that there’s no reason that Buddy should dislike me, it’s not like I abuse him or anything. My other two cats adore me and literally will never leave me alone, I hate how Buddy is the “loner” of the group.",11Oct2020,1
711,"I’ve been working this job for about a year now, and except for my manager, it’s been decent. It’s also my first real job, minimum wage and horrible hours, all that fun stuff. Recently my elderly grandmother has had to move in with us due to medical issues and no one at my work is willing to wear a mask, even when it was mandatory. This combined with having to struggle with online school with a learning disability is  weighing on me and I need to quit my job, but I have no idea how to go about doing it. They say I have to give two weeks notice but I don’t know if I can risk that with my grandma, and advice is appreciated.",11Oct2020,1
712,"I have an overall decent relationship with my roommate but this makes it hard for me trust them.

&amp;#x200B;

Lived with my roommate for 5 years, never really had an issue. I ended up getting a new car a year ago and I've been extremely careful in taking care of it. I park far wherever I go and never park close to anyone aside from our apartment parking. I always do weekly scans between car washes to look for imperfections and it's been great until recently when my roommate had our parking spots moved to be next to each other. I went to do a car wash and noticed 2 relatively big chips on the driver side that face the driver door of roommate's car. I instantly felt it was them and I looked carefully. Their car door lines up where the chips will be, and both chips fall on the same horizontal line and have the same color chip as my roommate's car. I asked them if they hit the car and they said no that they haven't even driven due to covid. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to trust my roommate, but it's really hard to with all the evidence pointing to them. Also in the past when my roommate had borrowed something and broken it, they would just put it back and not say anything then have me fix it. I didn't care because they were minor items and quick fixes but it shows how they are and not willing to admit when they broke something.

&amp;#x200B;

Question is how do I proceed? This makes me not want to renew living with them, and actually just move out right now. I want to just ask them if I can borrow their key or come down with me so we can see if the door does line up with the two chips. My gut says its my roommate and that they just don't want to pay the 600+ repair (yes door panel repairs cost that much because even a small chip usually needs the full panel to be painted). Any good advice?",11Oct2020,1
713,"My dad is extremely mean to everyone. He criticizes people's behavior all the time, and he nags people to hurry up and get things done, even though he's pretty lazy himself. He shows no consideration for other people, and he is very greedy. For example, he would come in the kitchen and take a jug of milk, drink straight from it, and then rip out a huge fart. It's so gross when he does that, and he never apologizes for doing that. He also sticks his hands down his pants, and he farts and burps around others. Often, he is around people, and he just lifts his butt up ad farts in people's face. Or he would go burp in someone's ear. It's embarrassing when he does that. To make matters worse, he props his feet up on the table everywhere we go, even in public. He has very stinky feet, and often at a restaurant, he would just kick down someone's water glass and spill water all over them.

He snores super loud. At night, he snores like a violent chainsaw, and he farts and burps when he sleeps. Even when he's not sleeping, he just suddenly produces weird snoring noises that scare the daylights out of everyone. He drinks a lot of beverages, especially milk, soda, and beer. He drinks milk and soda straight out of the shared container, and he often doesn't put the lid back on the bottles. When he finishes drinking a bottle of beer, he tries to flush the beer bottle down the toilet. I don't even know what the hell is going on in his brain.

He has no manners in the bathroom either. He spends about 3 hours showering each day, and he uses a lot of shampoo. He leaves his dirty underwear on the shower floor, and he throws dirty clothes and towels on the bathroom floor. He uses up all the hot water, and he farts really squeaky farts in the shower. When he uses the bathroom, he never bothers to flush the toilet after using it, and it's a shared bathroom. He goes to the bathroom about 90 times a day, and he uses roughly 50 rolls of toilet paper each day.

The worst part is when my dad eats. He puts his feet up on the table, and he shoves food down his throat with his bare hands. He drinks a lot of milk and soda and beer when he eats, and he always eats a lot of food and then releases nasty farts and burps, and has massive diarrhea and he has to use the bathroom like 100 times an hour. He is really fat and ugly; he weighs almost 400 pounds, and he is bald and wrinkled and has fat everywhere on him.",11Oct2020,1

716,"A bit of background:

I am 40 years old, working in a live-in position at a university.  I recently had a cancer situation that, thankfully, looks to be resolved.

I'm not close to my family, and they have no idea I've been dealing with these health issues.  I have never married and have no children.

I gave my two-week notice at work this past Thursday.  I am moving home to New Orleans.

I have no job or prospects there.  All of my friends have moved away.  My family does not live in New Orleans.  I will be completely alone.  I have found a nice apartment in my old neighborhood.

I know i should have stayed here, but I'm absolutely miserable.  I had no prospects of moving up in my job here, and I can't stand the pitying looks and the empty thanks that have become normal in Higher Education due to COVID, especially compounded by the recent medical issues.

In short, I just want to go home.

I'm just scared.  I'm scared that I won't find a job, even with a fairly impressive, gapless resume.  I'm scared I won't make friends.  I'm scared that this is a mistake.  All I've ever wanted is to work for a specific university in New Orleans, ever since I was a little kid.  I've applied for 100 jobs there with no luck.

I have enough savings to survive for several months without a job but I'm worried I'll just sit in my apartment and get lost if I don't have a purpose.

I just want to go home.",11Oct2020,1
717,"Today my (22F) big cousin (26M) called me to tell me his sister aka my little cousin is cutting herself.
He asked me to meet at their house so me and him can try and speak to her.

The thing is, I used to cut myself too from 13yo to 16yo, that's why he wants my help.
The problem is that I don't really have a relationship with my little cousin and also I don't feel comfortable talking about this stuff with her, I don't know why but I really don't want to.
I'd like to help her but at the same time, since I've been in the same situation as her many years ago, I know it won't make a difference, she would probably feel overwhelmed by the situation (me and her brother talking with her about this stuff) and also I don't know what to say to make her stop.
When people tried talking sense into me about cutting myself I wouldn't listen or care about anyone else opinion: I wanted to do it and I needed my time (alone) to understand it didn't help me at all.

I suggested him so let my little sister (17F) talking to her because they have a better relationship because of a lesser age gap and my sister also have the experience with me cutting so she would know how to engage that type of conversation.

So I want to tell my big cousin that I don't want to do it, for me it doesn't make sense and already feel uncomfortable thinking about it.
 
Need to point out: she'll be going to therapy regardless me speaking to her or not.

Any advice on how to engage in this situation/help her?
I honestly feel like an asshole.",11Oct2020,1
718,"He’s always been very shy and introverted and I never minded that. We talked for months before starting to date and even though he was shy with everyone else, he would call me every day and every night and talk to me, or at least text me a few times a day, or send me cute pictures, etc.

We’re long distance. We started dating while I was visiting him 2 months ago.

Now he doesn’t talk to me. Like, I’m pretty sure if I didn’t text him every now and then he could probably forget I exist for a solid week or more. It’s like a switch flipped. When I got home from the visit where we started dating, he FaceTimed me ONE time in a period of almost a month. He would leave my messages on read or wouldn’t even open them, but he would open messages in our group chat- for hours on end. Every time I asked to call, he’d forget, or brush me off.

I went to visit him again. And I brought this up with him, and he told me he’s really bad with people and just doesn’t know what to say sometimes, and he needs a lot of alone time. Ok, fine, but why can he spend 12+ hours a day in an Xbox party with our friends playing video games talking his head off but he can’t call me once a week or text me now and then to have a conversation about how life is going or literally *anything*? He almost started crying he was so upset and said he’s sorry and he’ll try and work on it but he’s never been in a serious relationship before so he’s still learning. I agreed to give him some time to work on it.

I’ve been home for a month now. Same issue. Weeks now, no calls unless I call him first and he’s only answered twice out of the dozen or so times I’ve tried to call him. He still barely responds to or opens my messages and if he does it’s one word or disinterested answers. It seems like he doesn’t care about me, my life, anything really, and he just goes on playing video games and laughing and joking with our friends while forgetting that I exist. I don’t even text him more than once, maybe twice a day because I’m so terrified I’m annoying him.

I don’t want to give up on him. I know he struggles a lot with social interaction. But I’m hurt and frustrated. If I bring it up with him it gets pretty much nowhere and I’m so hurt that I love him and spend hours making him cute gifts or cookies to send to him or try and ask how he is every few days and he can’t be bothered to send an “I love you” text once a week, at least.

726,"I recently left a Discord server that I really enjoyed being in. It was a pretty tiny one dedicated to a more niche side of a game I play. I didn't know anyone there irl, but the anonymity sorta helped me express myself if that makes sense. I was on good terms with most of the people there (I think). There were only a few that I didn't really like. 

I left because those few people were posting certain things that made me uncomfortable and upset. It was happening somewhat frequently. On a few occasions I was able to establish that the posts bothered me (I'm not sure how well I communicated it, I pretty much just said ""I don't like this"" when asked about it), but they ultimately either forgot or didn't give a shit. I completely understand how absurd it is to try to influence what strangers post on the internet (I'm not even sure if that was even my goal). I guess it was a bit surprising that no one really cared and kept posting the stuff anyway.

So I left without saying a word.

At first it felt really good, like I was able to cut something out of my life that sometimes felt really toxic. Mentally I've been feeling better now that I'm not as exposed to the stuff that was upsetting me. I'm starting to have seconds thoughts about leaving though. I've had random moments of loneliness, like I feel left out or I wonder what they're all up to. I've been trying to remind myself how upset the certain posts were making me whenever I consider rejoining the server.

TLDR I left a discord of (what I thought of as) friends because of a few bad apples. Having second thoughts; considering swallowing my pride to rejoin the server at the risk of exposing myself to content I hate again.

I guess I'm just looking for any advice on coping, or if anyone has experienced a situation like this before. Anything would be much appreciated.",11Oct2020,1

728,"I’m mainly referring to when it comes to maintaining their house. My dad is very handy and does most of the work himself. He can do a lot of things, but sometimes he doesn’t have the knowledge to know what works. We never hire professionals.

For example, we just put up a fence in our yard after years of the former one dilapidating and blocking holes made by our dogs with literally any random thing they can find ranging from cinder blocks to bicycles... we built a [“custom”](https://imgur.com/gallery/BZGhiXQ) fence Bc mom didn’t want a picket fence and that vinyl fences were too much. (Really they were just too lazy to look into hiring someone to do it.) and then we just dug up all the weeds and put mulch down.. as you can see, it’s bowed and they didn’t even do it all the way around.

New project is the living room rug they need to replace for probably 10 years now. We tore it out and it’s been just a bare cement floor for over a month now. I keep pressuring them but they get mad at me and say they’re looking and “taking their time.”

I don’t live there anymore. But they’re aging and will likely sell the house within a few years. They also have a vacation home in even worse condition that needs serious work they can’t afford.

Long story semi short; a month or so ago I was  sexually assaulted by seven men.  
Four raped me fully and three watched/came on me or took videos.  
I am from America but I currently live in a foreign country (South Korea, where this all happened). The police here have been amazing and they were able to find the men and prosecute them for what they have done; unfortunately only the four that raped me will be punished.  I live in a super small countryside town where I see the men often while walking down the street. For now I am protected by police but I know that won't always be the case. Mentally I have had a tough time getting past everything that happened and I find myself in constant fear and pain.  


My question is, should I go home to America and come back to this country when I am mentally better? My contract ends in Jan/Feb 2021 and I have been thinking about my options. I could extend but i'll need to stay at my same job and same city without the chance of relocation or I can go home, find a new job (if possible given covid), and try to rebuild the pieces of me that I feel I may have lost.   
Going home does take a toll on me mentally as well. I would need to move back home for a bit until I could get myself back on my feet and well....home can be a bit toxic for my mental health; not to the same degree.

Regardless, i've always told myself i'd go home for a couple years and then move back to this country for a longer term but I am wondering if given covid that is a good idea or if I should stick it out and try and work on my mental health where I am.

734,"Okay so due to some legal reasons, I have to be cautious on what I say and answer.... I will try to keep this short.

To start, I have BPD. So when trauma happens to me... I don't handle or heal from it well or easily. And when I am emotionally spiraling, I make bad life decisions. Yes I know... I am working on it. And I know that my choices and actions are the reason where I am.

I moved to CA last year. I never changed my residency from OH as I wasn't planning on staying in CA long. Eight months then my good ex before this guy and I fell apart after I was raped by a coworker. During the breakup, I met the one currently destroying my life.

Every insecurity I had, he fed in a healthy way. I was struggling with anorexia, and was 82lbs when we had met. I had and still have a lot of body image issues stemming from abuse.

I was falling apart in CA. Within a month of this ex and I starting to date, I knew I needed to return to OH. My best friends were here. It was the only place in the world that felt like home.

He had nothing going for him in CA as covid had ruined what he did for a career. Terrible family issues... So when I told him I was leaving for OH no matter what and I am sorry... He chose to join me. Looking back... I see that red flag. At that moment... I didn't.

The morning we left we got into a major car accident we were not at fault on. My car was destroyed. I was injured lightly not enough to go to a er in covid though. I got xrays the next day and knew i could wait for doctors until I got to OH in a few days.

Also... Fun fact I am an ex cokehead. Drugs are a major vice of mine. Ex was trying to get me to do coke, and because i fought it with everything i had in me, he got me to slip and fed an addiction for molly, e, and acid. Can't give someone clinically depressed something that makes them happy at their core. It was better than any medication I had ever taken. And it made an addiction grow RAPIDLY.

Once we moved he refused to find a job. He didn't try at all. I started seeing doctors. I was told to not work. Yet I was the one bartending because he wouldn't lift a finger. Once we got to OH he got insanely jealous and possessive. I wasn't able to have even a phone or text conversation without him going through my phone or listening in. I wasn't even able to work a full shift without him popping in and checking on me at least three times.

I struggled to get medically seen because I didn't have insurance. My attorney worked on it nonstop. Ex... Never once let me rest, relax, or put up a leg. Everything was coming out of my pocket, and my accounts were left at 0.

In July I finally snapped. He had tried to step between and ruin my relationship with my best friend. My cat had just had a major life saving surgery, and he sat there and got jealous she was snuggling me and I was spending time with her. He outright yelled at me at how I snuggled the cat more than him. Like... Dude she just got gutted.... I left my job because mentally and physically I was incapable of working any longer. And I finally had enough. The night before I left him... He got some acid and we got high together. And that's ironically when my moment of clarity hit me. 

I still loved my military ex deeply. I missed him. (Still do but it is so over it isnt funny. He really hurt me) I was not happy and I saw I was rebounding with my new ex. 

The next morning I packed my things and broke up with him. We had a lease together at this point. And boy oh boy... He refused to let me out of the apartment until my best friend messaged me when she was awake because I was going to retreat to her house.

I finally got away when she texted me and i left on foot as right now due to my injuries I cannot drive. Thats when he followed me in my car and begged me to get in. We would have a cigarette and talk calmly....

My dumb trusting naive self got in the car. Where for the next hour he verbally berated and abused me. He got me written off the lease by the landlord, he tried to steal my car and purse. This is when i started to record. As he drove down the street screaming at me. Threatened to destroy my car and everything i own if I didnt get in the car right then, almost hit me with my car....

I didnt know what to do so still recording i got in. He was finally taking me to besties house. The entire five minute car ride over to her street he was screaming at me. Switching between emotions in the blink of an eye. Using key triggers to rip me apart. Told me ""I don't have the right the choose to end the relationship. That's not my choice."" And ""I hope you die a horrible slow painful death you bitch."" He floored the gas at one point and I asked him if he was gonna kill us. He responds with silence. If the large truck in front of us didn't turn, we would have plowed into him at 60+.

My friend who is a psych major and has his doctorate watched this video and said after everything he has been privy to seen and known... He would straight up diagnose him as a sociopath.

When we get to my best friends street he says ""No... You're not going to ----'s"" and turns the wrong way. For the next two and a half minutes in the video you hear me screaming to let me out, i don't feel safe in this car, i dont consent, youre kidnapping me, and im gonna jump. You hear my door open and every time that happens you can hear my engine rev as he floors it so I cannot safely escape without critically injuring or killing myself.

He only released me from the car because I called 911. I also have the 911 call.... The entire call I was screaming and begging him to step back and not approach me and just leave me alone and was running from him. Screaming how I didn't feel safe. It was so bad the dispatcher could barely get me to breathe or even tell her where I was at. I was in such a deep panic... There was also a call from someone who lived on that street.

Cops saw the video. Didn't arrest him. I was brought, hysterical, to my best friends house by an officer. At this point it has been nearly two hours since I was supposed to be there. And on her cameras she saw the cop cruiser pull up and me get out. And when she saw me... I was in the worst mental state she had ever seen me. And that's saying something. I wasn't even able to form a coherent sentence.

She took me in as I have nowhere else to go. I can't leave the state because of my medical stuff going on. My injuries because of the time I fought to see a doctor... They have exacerbated and grown far worse. I am officially medically disabled and am now going to be fighting for disability.

I signed up for food stamps covid care and unemployment. Denied for all because of my lawsuit for the accident. Im fighting to get on section 8 housing but that takes forever. Homeless shelters have a 10+ month waiting list. 

Then... Ex starts harassing my mom and best friend and my lawyer for the lawsuit. He kept and held everything of mine as a hostage, because he wanted ownership to my car. He tried to blackmail and extort me saying if I didn't give him what he wanted he would report me to the company I was suing and claim I intentionally injured myself after the fact and I was faking it. 

He would call and text me constantly. Guilt trip me. Rip me apart. Beg for me back... It was getting insane. He did it to my mom so much she had a nervous breakdown and a stroke from the stress he was putting on her. Oh and none of us know how he even got her number to begin with.


My attorney finally demanded I go and get a CPO. And I did mid july. Six days later.... He broke it by messaging me on a social media app. He was arrested and was out on bail. Now... The social media site in question is anonymous based so he had to outright admit to the officers he messaged me to be arrested. Now... Keep in mind this please, as it does directly affect what has been happening. Because it is anonymous, unless he admits it, or they get a subpoena for the site or his phone... I can't prove it outright. 

But this moron posts and leaves a trail. He stalks me on here and wants me to know it is him. He gives away and slanders me publicly with details about my sex life. Or rants about our situation in a detail so it is obviously him. 

We are now at.... Over 100 breaches of the CPO since mid july now. Driving past my house, showing up where I frequent. It is a small town.... And he has made me feel so deeply unsafe here I now only leave my best friend's home to go to my PT or doctor's appointments.  I cannot function daily between my mental health and physical health which has degraded deeply. I am looking at at least one surgery. My surgeon is scared the pain disorder I have formed is at the stages of being permenant. My spine and ankle are fusing so I have to medically break them myself to avoid two more surgeries....

He kept a majority of my stuff including my bed. So I have been sleeping on a concrete floor because my bestie doesn't have room for me. I'm living with her, her husband, and their two kids. Covid wrecked his job. She is disabled. They are on foodstamps and struggling and have taken me in 100%. Her husband gave me until Nov 13th as of last week before I am out.

I am now negative in my bank account. My phone is going to be shut off on Friday. I have... Absolutely nowhere to go. I can't leave OH or at this point according to my lawyer I will forfeight my medical care. Same goes if I put myself in inpatient in psych for my rapidly shattered mental health. I have... Absolutely nowhere to go. I am losing utterly everything in my life. It is in ruins.

I will be living in my car soon, unable to drive. Unable to reach lawyers or doctors. I am going to live as a cripple and in constant daily agony at unbearable levels forever if that happens. Unable to make it to appointments or my court dates and hearings against the ex. And plenty will be coming. He has my SSN and threatened me with it. He used my laptop he stole and broke into my google drive and deleted emails to my lawyer and my entire drive full of evidence against him. He also stole pornographic photos of me and military ex and now is using them not only against me... But he tried to reach out to mil ex too. 

I am watching my life burn away. I know once I am in that car it is a matter of time before I starve or freeze to death. I'm... Falling apart mentally and so unraveled...

I have lost everything and the only place in the world I have to go to is my moms and I can't. Not even for the medical shit... But also because my stepfather has made some highly disturbing sexual advances on me. And I just.... I can't handle it.

I have no help. I have nobody. I am so scared and IDK what to do. Bestie is trying to work with her husband on letting me stay longer but it isn't looking good at all. I am... Fuck i am so scared and idk what to do anymore. Im 27 and... I lost everything.

My detective and lawyer and I agree at this point it feels like my ex is trying to drive me to suicide or drive me so far I go crawling back to him. He is... Not sane in any capacity and has proven such.

I have tried every resource local and available to me. I have no more friends. He burned those bridges. I have nowhere to go. I have to wait 6+ months for EVERYTHING still resource wise... And I don't have that time! 😭

I wanna note multiple times he was offered to be sent back to CA, he made deal after deal with me and renegged on every single one... He is just at this point doing this to hurt me and torture me mentally and emotionally.

I don't know what to do anymore. I really don't.",11Oct2020,1

We are both in the military and live together already. we’ve talked about getting married a lot and we were planning on doing it by the end of this year but I ended up deploying with less than a days notice and he wasn’t able to propose like he had planned. I got back a couple of days ago, and then he ended up having to go somewhere else for awhile. Since home alone and bored I decided to clean and reorganize. I ended up finding the ring on accident, and I couldn’t help but look. 
We had gone ring shopping before I had left and he took a picture and got the information for it so I thought he knew which ring I wanted. But he got a different one? The one I found is not even remotely close to the one I picked. Don’t get me wrong it’s beautiful and I love him and anything he gets for me, but I don’t really know if I should bring it up or not or what to do? Either way when he asks the answer will be yes, but I LOVED the ring I had actually picked. What should I do?

Title says it all, this is my only friend and she doesn't ever bother to text me or talk to me apart from when I see her IRL, at school. Even during the entire 7 months of lockdown, she barely spoke to me, leaving most of my messages on read.

 I haven't been to school for around 4 months due to personal reasons, and she hasn't even asked me when I will next be at school, if I'm okay or whatever. It's eating away at me, I feel like I did something wrong, lonely, and guilty.

I have no one to talk to, and I don't understand why she doesn't talk to me.
At school it's like she doesn't even want to talk to me, and that she's just tolerating me. She stopped viewing my stories and liking my posts a while ago too, am I not even that important to her? I don't understand.

743,"So I’ve been driving since I turned 16, but got my license back in August. I have driven both automatic and manual, and can do so very easily. I’ve never been in an accident, never got pulled over, and always followed the rules of the road. 

I have always driven with a parent in the car, never by myself. I understand this is necessary in the beginning, but I have driven so many times with my parents that I feel I have a lot of experience and sensory acuity to be alone. 
 
Anyway, today I wanted to drive one of our cars to the park to hangout with my friends. I asked my father if I could do this, and he told me that there something mentally wrong with me. I just responded with “Thank you” and he told me “Anytime”. He said that if he were to put my name under the insurance it would be thousands of dollars more. He told me that I wouldn’t know how to handle a crazy driver like he could. After that he told me when I’m 18 I’ll have to pay for my own separate insurance. 

My mother is less strict, but can’t really do anything about it since she’s not in charge of that. My friend drives alone under his parents’ insurance and likes to brag about it which only further angers me.

745,"We originally met on tinder, we went to the same school and we both agreed to meet for sex, just casual. It got a little intimate at times but I attempted to distant myself as she told me she has slept with a few men before and that she was planning on moving away once she finished her job here (2021 April).

A few days ago I went to her house (she lives in a bedroom that's a bit of a mess) as her cousin owns the house and she just rents the room essentially.

She lost her mother a few years ago and when she moved to the big city (the place she wants to move back to when she finishes the job contract) she decided she didn't care anymore and started sleeping with guys when she felt like it. 

However a few days ago she seemed off? Didn't want to meet up and kept conversations very brief, she sent me a photo and I'm about  70% confident I saw tears in her eyes. So me being the simp (?) That I am I decided to show up at her door with some flowers just to cheer her up, I didn't expect anything else or wanted it. (I now know she has a pollen allergy so I feel like a grade A bastard).

Today I messaged her and it soon came to my attention that there has been something bothering her and she told me she was willing to talk about it tomorrow with me at my house. I'm worried it might be something mental health related. I've already told her I'm struggling to see us more than just friends due to her general attitude so I doubt it's a visit to say that she doesn't want to see me - that and I asked her to just tell me straight if I'm bothering her.

I enjoy her company, how do I make it feel like I'm there for her without coming off as pretentious or annoying?

My dad comes home once on Saturday and Sunday just to walk the dog and leaves for work my mom is just never home on the weekends. So having that said, I’ve been bringing my girlfriend to my house after my dad walks the dog so I don’t have to worry about anyone coming home. He rides a motorcycle and it’s pretty loud so whenever he does come home I get around 2 minutes to hide my girlfriend so he doesn’t see since sometimes she comes before my dad walks the dog. So today, my dad walked the dog and left. That’s when my girl came after. We were getting pretty intimate and we were both were undressed so you could see where that was going. 2 hours later my dad suddenly walks in the door while she was on top of me undressed. I never thought in my life that any of my parents would ever see me doing anything of the sort. I don’t drink and I would have rather him saw me drinking with friends. I do not know what to do. My dad just asked about a package that was supposed to be delivered and he left again. I’ve never let my parents meet any of my girlfriends in the past and I don’t tell them about it as well.

755,"First, I have to start off by letting you all know that I know that compared to others I have a really great family, they haven’t been abusive or cruel.I’m the only child of a single mom but she’s close to her siblings and their children. My only issue is that I’m an incredibly private person but my mom loves to tell them my business and then they love to give me advice.

I usually like receiving advice but the problem is that this advice is almost always consistently terrible, like advice that no one who has any knowledge of the subject would agree with. An example is before I went to college, they all told me that  my major was unrealistic and would result in me being unemployed for years after graduation. But I put a lot of thought into choosing my major and graduated this summer and found a job within two months.

My mother told them as soon as I got it and now they’re calling/stopping by with plenty of advice for things I should do in my new job and new city to ensure I’d successful. Unfortunately, many of my relatives haven’t left our city (which to be fair is a big city) but they don’t have much experience trying new things. So the advice will be often be rooted in fear or in things I shouldn’t do. 

For the most part I usually just nod and move on but as it goes more frequent I’ve been getting more and more upset and reluctant to even talk to them about my plans for the future. 

The worst part is I know my relatives really do mean well, they support me to the best of their abilities and were really proud when I got into college. Nothing they say is designed to upset me but it somehow always does. Even my mom says that I’m normally patient with my friends and other people but that when it comes to my family I’m so quick to get annoyed. Any tips for helping me remain calm/not catch an attitude.

TL,DR: My well-intentioned family always gives me terrible advice about things they don’t really know much about and it upsets me.",11Oct2020,1
756,"(Please note - I am a minor. Thank you!)

I am currently dating my first girlfriend. We’ve been together for a little over 7 months and have only recently kissed for the first time (our first kiss of the relationship, but not her first kiss. It is my first kiss tho). Tbh I didn’t like it, it could be due to lack of experience on both of our parts but I didn’t feel anything... it just felt kinda wet and awkward?

Anyways, obviously considering I’m a minor I can’t know for sure but at my current life state I want to end up spending my life with her. She is the one person in my life I can be around for hours and hours and not get tired of - we share tons of hobbies and interests, I enjoy being around her (obv), we have a lot of fun together. Whatever. The thing is, considering I felt nothing from kissing her, I have no interest in kissing other people, I’m beginning to wonder, am I aromantic? 

I don’t have the experience to know what love feels like, so obv I wouldn’t know. I only know from like, movies and some vague descriptions from other people around the internet. I’ve always seen/heard it like you look at your partner and it’s like everything else melts away, where you’d climb 20 mountains just to be near them. You get butterflies or your heart skips a beat. I understand it’s exaggerated, but I feel nothing like that. I felt nervous right before we kissed but it didn’t have to do with her specifically, it had to do with the expectations of what a kiss should feel like. I don’t feel that kind of stuff with her. I long to be around her, and I would rescue her from a fire, but I feel that way about friends too. I don’t get butterflies, I honestly calm down more when I’m around her. She makes me feel comfortable. I’d describe her as one of my best friends, but is it love?

It’s ok if it isn’t, and it’s ok if I don’t know yet. If anyone has any apt descriptions of how they feel about their lifelong romantic partners I would appreciate it. Sorry if this is weird or super subjective or if I’m just overthinking it.

My boss is a manipulative, condescending, pathological liar who plays games with me, takes credit for my work, and has even went as far as speaking negatively about me to other coworkers. I reported her to HR at that point (as many others have), but it gets nowhere. She found out about the report and things got worse. I was written up for my work performance right after she found out that I was applying for other jobs (suspicious). It's just a living hell. My position was combined with two others and due to budget cuts, there is no help on the way. I'm doing what 3 people used to do and the increased work is more than I can take. I take work home with me all the time, literally and figuratively. I've come home depressed having just spent half an hour in the car in tears. My husband knows it's bad, but not quite how truly awful it is. All this being said, I love what I do and I like a lot of my coworkers, the drive isn't bad but there are quite a bit of ""fake"" brown-nosers and ample office politics I can't keep up with. Just a toxic shit hole most of the time.

I got a job offer this past Friday, and I have the weekend to think about it. Need to let them know by tomorrow. I've turned down one job offer a week ago for a really shitty pay offer, and then this came along. It's a 15k/year increase (would be my first time as a salaried employee and not hourly, not really sure if this makes a difference), good retirement benefits, and a step up on my career ladder. Downfall is it an hour long commute one way. And I live in Wisconsin so winter can be brutal on the roads. 

My anxiety eats this up of course. What if this job sucks? What if I hate the drive? Is losing 10 hours a week driving too much? After all I have a daughter who is growing up so fast and I don't want to miss anything. What if this boss is worse? Or it's an even more toxic workplace? What if the job is too hard or I don't know what I'm doing? My current job is less than ideal due to the environment and people, but it feels ""safe"" and I know it, and I do it well. 

That was a long text-based vomit of a post. I could use any help. My hubby is not quite for it I think and maybe this decision would be easier if he was for it, I just don't know if it's the right move. Am I being anxious or is 2 hours a day commuting crazy to anyone else?",11Oct2020,1
766,"Hi. I have a relative who is young, in middle school. She has two younger siblings as well, but I worry the most about her. Her mother has been the victim of recurrent and ugly domestic abuse, from what I’ve heard, her father has physically abused her on multiple occasions, and most recently has broken one of her limbs. My relative witnessed this recent event, and I worry so much for her. Her life has been twisted upside down, and I don’t think she’s known stability since her younger sister was born, likely even before then. I’ve always felt like she was my younger sister, and she feels the same, we’ve known each other since she was born when I was four, and at one point in time we were incredibly close. At the moment custody and whatnot is very up in the air, and if she is removed from her mother’s care, she would likely live with me, but until then (and I am hoping that it does happen at some point as it’s just plain unfair and traumatizing to keep her with her mother who must work out her own traumas before being a parent) I don’t know what to do to help. Is there anything you’d suggest I do? She is not very open at all about her feelings, and I worry that she is thinking of hurting herself or worse. I don’t have a say in much of the legal processions, and I don’t want and advice about that at the moment as there is very little I can do. I would do anything to help my niece suffer any less, or feel that someone cares about her and is there no matter what, but I just don’t know what I should do. Thanks in advance",11Oct2020,1

768,"I am at the point in my life where I need to be focused on me and nobody else because these next few years will determine my future, but my mother thinks I'm a narcissistic ass hole because I wont spend time with her or ""worship god""

About the god thing:

I am not about her religion. I never have been. I can't tell her this because I am being practically blackmailed into believing in something that I don't think exists. I can't tell her that I don't believe in god because she will take my future away from me.

This is what I mean:

Today i was at my computer after I had finished shampooing our carpet and I was practicing programming and I was watching videos on how computers work (going into Computer Science or Media Arts and Science for college). I am also part of a highschool Esports team who placed 3rd in state last year. I spend a lot of my time trying to grow my twitch and get noticed by colleges so I can olay Esports for them

The problem is, my mother limits me to 2 hours a day. And you and I both know that is NOT ENOUGH TIME AT ALL if I ever want to become a professional Esports athlete.

Because I would rather focus on getting myself a future in the world of Media Arts and Computer Science and becoming a professional Esports athlete, I don't have time to spend 6 hours a day with my family. On top of this I am juggling a job in between. I have a couple of people who are willing to let me stay at their houses until I can get on my feet and get an apartment.

I am wondering if there is anyway to legally be released from my house underage, because this religion forcing, future destroying parent that I have now is making me want to kill myself. And that is not a joke. If you can help that would be greatly appreciated.",11Oct2020,1

772,"My predator mother

So here goes nothing, and I’d love to hear any input on whether any of this is my fault.

My mother and I were inseparable until I was roughly aged 14. She had cheated on my dad at this point with a teenaged boy. She broke up our family and it was extremely wrong morally what she did. It was then, I started to emotionally distance myself from my mother. She would constantly ask me why I’m not the same little girl and as much as I wanted to say she isn’t the person I thought she was, I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. 

Years go by, I am now married with a daughter, and my mother and my relationship is distant but there, because she wanted to see my daughter (I think that was the only reason she would keep me in her life). I cheated on my husband, yes I am aware that makes me a piece of shit. My mother had opened my mail, and caught me cheating because of a visa statement, she exposed me to my then husband. We tried to work it out, but both him and I were emotionally cheating at this point. We divorced...

This is where our relationship got even worse because even though she wanted to expose me, the trust I had for her was gone completely. To make matters worse, she had used this to turn my older sister against me.

I started to slowly distance them from seeing my daughter because I’d heard them speaking negatively about me in front of my 5 year old daughter.

Then came the information from my daughter that my mom had been sexually abusing her. She was instructing my child how to masturbate, and touch herself when I’d allow her to have sleep overs with my mom. My daughter told me her and my mom had a secret and finally I got out of her what the secret was. It DEVASTATED me, and she denied the entire thing and called myself and my daughter a liar. She said I coached her to say these things because I wanted to cut her off from my life. 

By this time, I had started dating someone new... and she went ahead and made an internet blog with my older sister, about every mistake I’ve ever made in my life and sent it to everyone I knew. It included me cheating, on my ex husband, and any mistake I’d made as a young adult ... she sent it to my new boyfriend (who thank god didn’t listen, didn’t care)... everyone has a past... she was virtually trying to destroy my life and her and my older sister said “if you don’t let mom have your daughters unsupervised we will tell everyone all the things you’ve done”.

I was being blackmailed, so she could have access to my daughter she had sexually abused. I said no, and I didn’t care what they told anyone. My daughters safety was # 1. 

They even tried to contact cps and say I was an unfit mother, and threatened me with lawyers that she will gain visitation of my daughter... 

I started therapy and so did my daughter for the abuse she had been apart of. During this now therapy I’ve had suppressed memories of my mother sucking on my ear lobes and my older sister sticking her fingers in her vagina and making me smell it... now I don’t know if this is exactly wrong, but it doesn’t feel right... 

My question is, do you think I’m in the right for cutting myself and my daughters from this woman?

What would you do?

(We tried to pursue legal charges but with a 5 year olds account of these incidents it wasn’t enough to press charges).

Thank you",11Oct2020,1

778,"My dad is a HUGE control freak and very spastic. He wants everything done his way and if it’s not done his way, it’s the highway. He is extremely judgemental and is always making negative comments. 


Whenever I get into an argument with him, no matter how small he gets all defensive whenever I disagree with him or stand my ground with him. He takes these situations to heart. He takes it as I’m disobeying him and basically saying “fuck you dad” whenever I don’t follow his orders. There a lot of examples of small instances where my Dad gets all defensive and makes me feel guilty



He doesn’t understand the concept of free will. I’m 21 and I still don’t have a license because he doesn’t want me driving. He basically won’t let me get a license until HE feels IM ready. It makes me feel like shit because I know I’m completely capable of driving but he projects his fears on to me and makes me feel like I’m not capable. He says stuff to try to make me afraid of driving

“It’s no joke out there. You’re driving a death machine!  You can’t trust other people won’t kill you out here”

I can’t ever drive with him cause he’s such a intense back seat driver 


Another  example today my Dad told me not to take a shower because there’s an issue with the water. He started beating a dead horse about it and said it like 20 times.  But I felt so gross I just had to shower I couldn’t take it anymore. So I took like a 3 minute shower. I was in and out without him even knowing. Later on he once again reminded me not to take a shower because I don’t know how to take a quick shower and I always take forever. So I got annoyed and snapped back “I already did take a shower!” I feel awful for  how I responded and I’m overwhelmed with guilt 


Another example is this weekend I was going to visit a friend for his birthday. My friend used to take a lot of LSD and my dad knows this. So before I left he got all suspicious and kept beating a dead horse saying “you’re not doing acid right?? don’t let him talk you into anything. Don’t do acid. Don’t do it. I know how these things go, it’s his birthday and he’s gonna wanna trip.” He just kept going on and on and on it’s very intense and exhausting to listen to him beat a dead horse like this. I don’t know why he thinks im gonna do acid. 


It bothers me he doesn’t trust I won’t do acid. I’ve promised him countless times I won’t do any hard drugs and I barely even drink. I don’t know why he thinks I’m gonna do acid. It’s like he’s projecting his fears on to me. I wish he’d see me as a responsible adult who can make his own decisions.",11Oct2020,1

783,"Hi, to make a long story short my gf of 7 years and I got a golden retriever puppy in March. Our lives were very stable at the time and it seemed like a good decision. Fast forward to now, my life has completely changed. I broke up with her because she didn’t want to move to let me pursue my career and other life goals and I felt held back. There were other things but that’s the long story short and I’m not asking for relationship advice so who cares.

I took our dog, which we had agreed on before we got him. I love him to death, he and I have a really strong bond. However, since leaving the gf, I have landed my dream job. The work is exactly what I want to do, the salary is amazing, and it’s remote so I can live wherever I want. 

What I’m now realizing is that I really want to live in a city. I see big high rises with beautiful city views and am feeling very strongly that that’s where I want to be. I grew up in a suburb outside of a major city and the thought of moving back to a suburb-y place makes me want to puke. After I left for college I stayed in my small college town (~80k people) until now and I’m not really interested in that anymore either.

I’m really attracted to the big city amenities that would come with living in one. I started looking today and I can totally afford some really nice upper floor condos/apartments right in the middle of many big cities, but alas, having a golden retriever on the 30th floor of a building seems like a bad idea.

788,"So this is an update to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/in68tq/neighbors_gf_making_me_uncomfortable_long_read/

Both my neighbor and his girlfriend have kind of escalated things. Whereas before I thought she were maybe just watching me from inside their house, they both have now begun to blatantly watch me from outside. The backyards of our houses overlook each other, with an empty lot between. It seems like a large distance between the two, but in the right conditions, we can actually see into each others' houses. My house has an upstairs landing with large windows looking out into our backyards. I noticed a while back they're not hard to see into, even at a distance, so I had begun pulling the shades down on them at night. But most of the time, they are open.

This is how I noticed my neighbors watching me. I'll be cleaning or decorating (for Halloween) and casually look out the window, and there will be one of them, just sitting on their deck or randomly walking across their yard, close to the property boundary. This is not suspicious behavior normally, but this is not normal for them. Before, it was rare they would come outside recreationally, let alone even go on their deck. But all of a sudden, they like to hang out there, and take strolls across their lawn. 

Then one day, I noticed, while doing some window cleaning, him standing underneath their carport, just looking at my house. Not doing anything, just standing. Can I say for sure he was watching me? No, but it was odd and out of the ordinary. Now, they both will often times just go out to their carport and do nothing but stand there, seemingly watching my house.

The kicker is now how both will often times show up at the store (my workplace) not long after I do. Usually it's her, but he's started to do the same as well. It happens if I don't take my usual precautions when going to my car, and end up going out onto the deck where they can see me easily leaving. Today for instance, I needed to get milk, and since I wasn't working, I just took the deck and the steps face their house. It just so happened he was sitting on their deck at the time I left.

I had just gotten into my car and left the store parking, when all of a sudden he passes me in his car, and goes to the store. If I had been in the store a minute or two longer, we would've ran into each other. This did not seem to be a coincidence to me.

I am getting frustrated with this continuation, and honestly, it feels like harassment, even if it's legally not. I want my normal life back, to be able to do things at my house again, without worrying if I am being watched. I'd like to not be nervously waiting at my job wondering how many times they'll both be coming in. What would you do if this was was happening to you? What options do I have?

tl;dr: My neighbor and his gf are constantly watching me and it's starting to piss me off. Need advice on what I should or can do.",11Oct2020,1

793,"Hi reddit,

I am a 27 year old male. Most of the last 27 years of my life have been amazing. I ended up graduating college, getting a high paying job in a low cost of living area, and made amazing friends. I am coming to you asking for financial as well as relationship advice.

I met this 25 year old girl online a year ago in my area, and she has a 7 year old son who is pretty great. She was doing well for herself at the time in life when we met, renting a decent condo with a roommate and her son. We really clicked and started dating.

I had been renting in a very cheap one bedroom apartment for around 5 years to save money. I really enjoyed the peace of mind of never having to worry about money and saving a ton. Rent was about 7.5% my gross monthly pay and I had no other debts. I started looking for a house because the neighbors started being less than pleasant, and I was going to be in the area a while.

I was taking my time because I had a month to month lease, but my girlfriend was thrown a curveball and was no longer going to be able to rent her condo. I wanted us to each get our own places until we were ready to move in together. I regret not sticking to this plan until I was more committed to the relationship. I ended up getting pushed into buying a single family home at the top end of my budget at $230k. Luckily I was pretty Frugal and had $100k saved. 20% went to the down-payment and I still have $55k liquid. This is not including retirement accounts that I fund at 15% of my salary each year. I'm paying more than double here than what I was paying at my apartment.

Here's the thing -- I was rushed into picking this house and don't like it. I fantasize going back to a condo or apartment with no yard work. I feel stuck since I just bought it, and the market is very hot I bought it at top dollar, it will likely be 3 to 5 years until I can break even. Also the previous owners sold it within 2 years of living here for a $30k profit with only minor upgrades. I fear it may be a harder house to sell with unique features, and I missed some not so great things about it when looking. I also hate the location, it is stupid to say but with covid I really didn't realize how far away it is from things I normally do because I wasn't doing them. Financially I feel like I must hold onto the house for a few years and hope it appreciates even though I hate it, due to the high costs of selling.

This brings me to my relationship again. I had realized after getting my offer accepted that I could not let my girlfriend and her son move in. I simply wasn't ready for that. I talked to my girlfriend early and she felt awful for pushing me and understood. I tried to get out of the contract but couldn't without getting sued as I was out of contingencies, so went through with closing.

After this, we agreed she could live with me on nights she doesn't have her son, and she and her son will live with her parents on the nights she does. It's not that I don't care about her son and don't want him around. It's that I am very worried about hurting him at this fragile age. He visited with her for the first time today at the new house. He was running around with glee, saying how much he loved it, how it was like a mansion, and how he really wished him and his mom could live somewhere like this some day. It's also in a better school district...",11Oct2020,1
794,"For context, I'm 16, in my junior year of high school, and I love to program. I first got into it around the age of 10/11 or so and it's without a doubt my favorite hobby. I definitely consider myself to be more on the smarter side of the spectrum, as I've always gotten A's, am in the highest band, etc. etc.

I think doing online school has made me realize how much time I'm wasting. When you're in school, you turn in your papers and get a grade. Though at home, I'm spending hours upon hours on these assignments, only to just throw them away afterwards. How am I supposed to stay motivated when I'm spending so much time on work that just gets thrown away after I put that much effort into it? I now realize that this is exactly what's been going on the past 11 years of my life, it just wasn't as clear as it is now.

I cannot stand wasting time, and I honestly feel like school is the biggest waste of my time right now. Don't get me wrong, I do know there are benefits to school: social skills and whatnot. But I want to create things. I have so many ideas for apps, programs, ""next-big-things,"" etc. that I want to make. but I can't because 99% of my time is taken doing this work that I literally *see* going to waste.

I think the problem might be that I feel like if I'm going to be successful or make those ""next-big-things"" I referred to, then I have to start now. I feel like every year, or week even, that goes by without me being productive (considering I don't consider schoolwork productive) is just lost opportunity that I can't make up. Maybe I just need to realize that high school is a part of life and I need to simply push through, deal with it, and do what I'm passionate about afterwards.

Though I would still like some input on how I can motivate myself. I spend hours on homework that should really only take an hour or two, simply because I just can't bring myself to do it. Just knowing that I'll never see it again, and that it's going nowhere but the trash is just devastating to me. I'm motivated by progress and productivity, not by an alphabetical letter that determines whether or not I'm smart.",11Oct2020,1
795,"I don’t know where or how to start this. I apologize for my lack in making sentences. I’ve never talked about my issues to anyone because I fear for what they will look at me as.

I guess I’ll start with not feeling accepted. I’m not sure if this is what’s affecting me. I’ve sat down a lot and it makes sense. I’ve never really felt accepted in my community. I’ve always felt like a secondary person because of my thoughts and how my mind works. I know my mind is different. And I’ve accepted that.

I’ve been single since my first heart break 4 years ago. And it’s not that i haven’t tried. Countless girls come and I push them away. And I’m so so tired of it. Because of this I’m progressively growing lonley. Like spending 3 hours scrolling though suggest friends just to have someone to talk to. I think that has to do with feeling accepted. I’m not sure.

Because I’ve been single so long. I’ve developed premature ejaculating. And it’s embarrassing. I’m only 20. I also feel like I’ve lost the aspect of relationships. I think I’ve wired getting help with relationships. I’ve never been motivated to try anything to help myself. So for so long I’ve dreamt of a relationship where we work and build together. That way I have something to work for other than myself. I feel like I’m too pushy with girls. I get too excited that a girl is texting me and I slowly but surely push them away. Some even come back for a reminder.

I’m the type of guy who’s always here for everyone in their time of need. But it really sucks when nobody’s there for you in your time of need. I’d go to the moon and back for a stranger that wants to take their life. But I can’t get a text.

I have anxiety ontop of all this. It doesn’t help with relationships. I’ve talked to this girl for 3 days. New girl and everything. Every night I wake up each hour on the spot and I get uncontrollablably excited thinking about her. How do I stop this. She didn’t text back and it put me in a whirlpool of emotions. And it eventually caused a breakdown.

I feel like I use people to feel accepted. But idk. I don’t know if I know what using really is. I feel like asking for help is using people. I don’t want to put that stress on anyone.

In the past I’ve struggled with severe anger issues. I’ve gotten much better and I rarely get mad anymore within the past year. And I’m proud of that. It took me 18 years to finally have control over myself. But nobody is really happy for me and it sucks. It feels like I have nobody

I have jolts of anger and excitement. That’s the best I can describe it. During anger, I see myself in my head harming animals. And I hate when that thought comes up. I never want to harm animals. So why am I getting those visions of causing pain. What can I do about it

When I get these angry bursts of energy I shake because of how angry I am. It could be over something stupid. Something that doesn’t make sense. You shouldn’t be mad about. I wish I could provide an example but they are so weird I can’t think of any of the top of my head. These jolts of energy only last a couple seconds. I hold my breathe and my face turns red. I’ve passed out and had a 3rd person experience because I got so mad for no reason. 

When I get excited jolts. I feel like a kid. But in a bad way. I’ll pull my arms up to my chest. But not touching. And shake them left and right because I’m excited. That isn’t normal is it.

My personal hygiene sucks and I don’t know if it’s because of this or a separate issue. I’ve never really scrubbed myself in the shower. I do now. But it’s a new thing for me. I still don’t brush my teeth at all. But they are cavity free due to a lifetime without brushing. My teeth grew resistant. I don’t have very much clothes nor clothes that fit my skinny waist.

I cannot keep a house clean let alone my room for the life of me. And it really upsets me. I’m so dissapointed in myself because I like basic human functions. It’s not like I don’t want these things. I’ve tried different things and I still find myself disappointed in myself.

Both anger and excitement jolts last only a couple seconds at a time. It’s like a glitch in my head. I got these weird glimpses of life. But I’m in 3rd person. And i hear like a horror movie screesching scratching noise. An actual scarry nosie. That’s all I hear. And I see myself doing things that I could imagine acually doing. Aka harming animals. Crashing my car by swerving. Things along those lines. I took acid one time and one of the driving one happened but it wasn’t just in my head. I lived the short couple of seconds while driving. 

I’ve always had thoughts of cutting and suicide. But I don’t think I’m strong enough to do it. I cut myself once by punching the blade of a knife in anger. I just didn’t think before I did it. 


I don’t know what’s wrong with me.
It’s extremely hard for me talking about my issues. I feel like if I talk about some I’m going to get myself in a hospital. I want to be successful and live a normal happy life. Am I even capable of that? Can anyone please shed some light on me. I could really use it.

Again I’ve never talked about this. This is an act of desperation even if I don’t understand it either.",11Oct2020,1
796,"Ok I was talking to a woman I like. I already ended the conversation. Then she tried to continue it by asking me a question. I responded back then asked her a similar question. Because I thought she still wanted to continue talking.

Then she did not reply..its been more than a day already. I really hate the feeling because she could not have continue the conversation if she does not have plans to reply anyway. Any advice?",11Oct2020,1
797,"So I (M) have been friends with, lets call her, Miranda for a coupe of years now. She would tell me anything interesting going on in her life or that she thought was cool. She would also tell me what is going on with her boyfriend. 

But since we both came back to college this semester, though we hang out a good bit here and there, I just feel like it can be awkward. I am not sure if I did something. Like I feel like we don't text the same anymore. Like we are ""BFFS"" on Snapchat but sometimes I feel like we are not as close as we used to be. 

Like are we still close? Has anyone experienced this?",11Oct2020,1
798,"So I asked her to be out for 4 hours while Im taking very important test. She was okay at first but on that day she was really tired and I understand her that she gotta get good rest. And because of some technical problems my test finished at 1am and I called her to come in, but she was so mad when she came. I really feel sorry for her what should I do?",11Oct2020,1
799,"How do you talk to a friend who recently got a boyfriend (actually a few months ago) but now she literally spends all her free time with him, almost every day of the week now, making no time for her other friends outside of work or her boyfriend? I don’t think said friend realizes she’s doing it I don’t think it’s on purpose, but I also don’t want to be rude bringing it up to her.",11Oct2020,1
800,"I’m recently single for the first time since I was 16 and I’ve been trying to get hookups on tinder but have had no success. Idk why but I just can’t be flirty and sexy, I only know how to get to know a girl as if I’m going to date her. With all of the girls I’ve started talking to regularly I’ve made it clear I just got out of a long term relationship so committment is the last thing I’m looking for. For some reason I still want to make these girls fall in love with me. It’s not even that, I more just want to be the dream guy that she sits in class daydreaming about, and the one who’s texts give her butterflies. I love validating their feelings and making them feel important and unique, seeing how happy it makes them makes me so happy. There’s this one girl that I’m way closer with than any other I’ve been talking to for a couple weeks now and she knows I don’t want a relationship but it seems like she’s falling for me and I have feelings for her too but I know a relationship is a terrible idea. Why do I still want to spoil her and give her butterflies?",11Oct2020,1
