1,"Throwaway for venting a bit, also first time user so sorry for any formatting errors, and sorry if this belongs in another sub

Me (18M) and my s/o (19) have recently gone through a rough patch in our relationship, and were on the verge of breaking things off due to my high libido and their low libido, causing problems in our communication about our needs sexually. I have been told that I have gas-light them and manipulated them into getting sex (which I've always worried about since we started dating) and that on various occasions they have been less than 110% sure about initiating / participating in sex. How do I learn how to control / decrease / understand my sexual urges and become a better person for my partner and myself? I don't want to do wrong by them, and I want this to work. We've already talked about it, and they want to work with me to get better at communication about sex, and possibly get me into a position to where I can see a therapist pretty often / work on understanding my triggers. Any advice is appreciated.",31Jul2020,1

3,"Hi All

A while back i put in a down payment on an apartment that was being built. Currently its close to completion (hoping to move in around november). Tomorrow i'm going in for an inspection and i get to do a little customization, so far all ive got in mind is a few extra power points in the bedroom and living room (for my PC) as well as a couple ethernet ports throughout the house. Also cat flaps in a few of the doors for my lil fur baby.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wondering is there anything else i should be looking for? any features that would come in handy? This is a newly constructed building so im assuming itll have all the bells and whistles, but curious if anyone with home building experience can recommend anything to look or ask for?",31Jul2020,1

5,"My friend is very, very mentally unstable. She was just sent to the psych ward for the third time this month, each time she made it less than 48 hours before getting sent back. She is very sick but she cares more about getting out than getting well and she won't take medication or admit she's not well. I believe she is a danger to herself and others. I've been talking with other friends, her landlord, her family and we're all in agreement but too scared to say it to her directly. The one friend who did go to try to get her to go back to the hospital fled because my friend threatened to kill her and kill herself. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has a court date in a week and i don't know how much information the judge will have access to since the friend who was threatened never talked to the police, I do have many screenshots from her Facebook page of her acting off her rocker, going through psychosis, threatening to harm herself, threatening to kill people (her page was since disabled due to this and to her being naked on FB live). She also has been arrested for being naked in public harassing people, harassing someone who has a protective order against her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone is very exhausted from her behavior, her job has fired her a while ago, she's out of money and maxed out her credit cards, and her landlord is ready to kick her out. Most people are too tired to keep care of her anymore, and while I want to I don't have a car to drive to her house to check up on her and I can't even talk to her on the phone anymore because her threats and outbursts have caused me to have anxiety attacks just through dealing with it. I want to make sure she stays in the hospital because they want to keep her for the rest of the year because if she doesn't I genuinely think she may be dead by the end of the year",31Jul2020,1

9,"Hello Reddit!

My mother is an alcoholic. 

She usually drinks herself half to death, deserts all her duties (work, taking care of the house, emotional presence, etc). During this time she is practically chained to bed, unable to do much without outside help. She needs to be fed, picked up from the floor, lead all around the house, etc. 

She becomes the worst version of herself, and we do not get her back for days, sometimes weeks. When she sobers up she is in constant, aggressive search for alcohol, and when she is drunk she begs for help and breaks down both physically and emotionally. 

I (18M) have been dealing with this my entire life, and the duties of taking care of her usually fall to me. My father speaks bad English, and I avoid including my sister (13) because I think she is too young and I know how much pain I was in her age. 

As usual, it is up to me to get her hospital appointments, alcohol treatment, etc. It is also up to me to talk to her and convince her to do all these things. Every single time, without fail, my mother does a little bit of treatment, and the moment she gets better she abandons it. 

She refuses to seek psychological help because she deems it too expensive (even after I tell her we end up spending more money on her alcohol/treatment when she has an episode). She doesn't want to go to Anonymous Alcoholics meetings because of the time commitment (even though, again, I tell her she spends more time killing herself with alcohol than she would speaking to peers and getting treatment.) She doesn't want to commit to residential treatment at drug rehab centers because she doesn't want to hang out with ""junkies and criminals""; she also claims rehab centers are prisons and don't help her. 

No matter what I say, or how many solutions I bring up to her - she finds an excuse to refuse it. Her personality is such that she constantly wants to have what she wants. She barely ever compromises even when she is sober; when she is drunk she never does.

Additionally, when she gets sober, bringing up her alcoholism is never an option. Every time she reaches for a drink we try to dissuade her and she claims we are holding her past against her. Every time she asks why we are having issues with her we tell her that it is difficult to mend our relationship after she crashes and burns everything with her drunkenness - she says we are bad family/children/etc. 

In fact, last time she was drunk my sister talked about it with her best friend for support. Mom read that conversation and punished my sister, as well as stopped talking to her for weeks. She always remembers the mistakes we make toward her when she is drunk, but never acknowledges that it is initially her fault for bringing us to that point.

She is currently in the hospital, and when I called her earlier today to get her to consider treatment she didn't listen and told me that she doesn't feel like talking about it right then. After a rocky confrontation when I told her that this WAS the time to talk about treatment since when she gets out of the hospital she might drink again, I dropped the phone. We were told by a family friend with a similar situation to ignore her until she decides to take care of herself.  

Now that you have some context, I have a question to ask. 

She is spamming my phone, my sister's phone, and my father's phone. She asks for support. She plays the blame game; sending photos of her sober accomplishments, such as taking us to the park and etc. 

She says stuff like;

""here, look how much good I've done for you. Are you going to ignore me?""

""Look at all the happy times we had together. Does this mean nothing?""

And so on. 

I do not know what I should do. I feel like the emotional, physical toll that this time took on us is immense. I do not think I should forgive her so easily. I do not think she deserves to do this to herself, her entire family, and then get away scot free while playing blame games and setting herself up to her next drunken episode (by refusing to get treatment). 

What should me and my sister do? Should we ignore her, act neutral, aggressive, or other? 

Thank you for the advice.",31Jul2020,1
10,"Okay to start things off I'm transracial (I was born a white girl and I transitioned into a black girl when I was 17) I took melanotan 2 injections to give me dark skin, I permed my hair and dyed it black, And got facial reconstructive surgery to look African american. 

 I was planning on having a child with a black guy, But ended up having one with a white guy bc black men my age weren't ready for that sort of commitment. My child is now 7, And every time i'm out in public with my daughter I get weird stares. ""why does that black woman have a white child?"" Is the sort of looks I get. It's embarrassing to say the least. I had a talk with my daughter that she should start getting spray tans and perms like I do, she got very upset and told me she doesn't want to. How can I make my child oblige to my rules? Don't get me wrong I love my child with all my heart, but she looks translucent. She's so pale you can see her veins. Should I inject melanotan 2 into her stomach while she's sleeping? I just want her to look more like me. Should I buy her a wig as well since she doesn't like the idea of getting her hair permed?

Moms, Any advice on what to do in this situation?

So basically i’m in summercamp and lately some people has been saying i’m ugly and it kinda makes me feel a bit mad and sad sometime. This one person used to call me ugly a lot of times but of nowhere he would  just randomly say i’m ugly. Then this friend i have which you might say he is bad but he really isn’t Idk if he is joking around since he smiled and laughed when he said it but he has lately called me ugly at random times for no reason but not every second. Then this dude  called me ugly too but he hated me so i didn’t care about his comment. Although idk if they’re jealous since they keep mentioning it but it’s bothering me and sometimes idk how to respond to it. Although it’s only been my friend that has called me ugly. The other 2 stopped calling me that. Maybe they’re jealous bc they’re  litterally desperate for girls and have tried asking girls many times and got rejected. But idk maybe it’s me overthinking. these kids are 11 and 8 btw and you guys might say oh they’re 11 who cares what they say but it still just makes me feel kinda bad",31Jul2020,1

I didn't have very many friends and boys would ask me out as a dare. I was the ""ugly and fat"" one in my group of friends. I got my first relationship at 15. He lead me to believe that I was ugly and no one but him would like me. And that irs a relationship where the guy was hotter than the girl. I stayed because I was just happy a guy ""liked me.""  On the other hand, I always had my mother gassing me up and telling me how beautuful I was. At 17, I lost a lot of weight and ""glew up.""

I even dated a male model for a little bit. It was weird. Really weird. I went from being this person who allowed people to walk all over me, and be bullied. I was soft and kind. A good person. 

This new found energy has given me an almost ""God complex."" I was so used to being treated like shit, that I became the person to do it first. I would rather be the bully than the bullied. I'd rather break a heart than have mine broken. Despite still looking in the mirror and being disappointed, I put on a mask of self confendece.  I miss how I used to be. Yes I was being bullied but I was a kinder, way nicer person. I've done so many mean things to people. People like me now but what good is it when I hate myself. I'm so negative.

16,"Disclaimer: I'm 17 but skipped a year so am about to go to my first year in college. I'll be 18 in 2 months.

My mom is a hardcore Christian and a die-hard Trump fan. I don't consider myself to be a democrat or republican so I would like to base my vote for whoever appeals the most to me.

I really don't like Trump due to his childish behavior, vulgar language, and sometimes he's a bit of a hypocrite too. Biden is also terrible but maybe just a little bit less so?

So the other day my mom kept talking about how great Trump was at handling the pandemic and it got pretty ridiculous. I don't typically talk back to her but that time was almost unbearable.

I then pointed out how stupid she was and said that I will vote for Biden.

The bitch BLEW UP on me and proceeded to want me out the house so I stayed over night with my friend's.

After 24 hours I cam home and she cooled off a bit but still hated my guts. 

She then told me how if I wouldn't change my behavior then I would be stoned in the streets (biblical reference). 

I kept my mouth shut for the past week but she still wants me out the house by the time I reach 18. I have a retail job but it's not enough to pay for rent/food/utilities. I have a federal grant for my college so the tuition is covered but I'm still pretty fucked.

19,"Kenny first stumbled upon when he saw her performing asa a clown at the carnival. He thought she was adorable and found her act hilarious. His attraction was further cemented when he realized that people viewed/treated her the same way that people viewed/treated him. However, she was very guarded and awkward nature around girls created multiple embarrassing/awkward misunderstandings.

However, multiple events led him to break down her walls and open up to him. Kenny would let her crash at his apartment whenever she was having rough nights. The two would tell ghost stories, play innocent pranks oneach other, listen to music, and share secrets that they wouldn't dare tell other people. 

Ru would often have PTSD nightmares at night, Kenny would comfort her with a lullaby. Kenny would also make her her favorite steamed pork buns and she would make him a traditional American breakfast in the morning for compensation. 

All of this led to a powerful attraction which led the two of them to start sleeping together and a romance began to blossom. Kenny would also steal nice things for her to give as a gift. Ru may have appreciated the thought but she did not appreciate his means of going about it.

1. I've heard a lot of people complain about Reddit getting worse and it's not the same and all of that stufd. I originally posted on WatchRedditDie because I was curious.. What was the old Reddit like? What's changed? &amp; What made this place do fabulous previously and not now? 

2. Communities/Subreddits.. are these different? Or just a synonym? I've seen awards that give coins to the community and just wondered?

3. Karma &amp; Coins.. what are these? What are they used for? Do I need these things, I'm a bit confused?

4. Up and down arrows.. don't worry I know it's ""up-vote"" and ""down-vote"" but originally thought these were used as a like or dislike a bit like FB or IG.. but the more I use Reddit the more I feel I'm wrong and wanting to know how I should actually use them? 

5. Bots and Moderators.. like I don't even know what to ask on this part.. I see bots on comments as such, but not really sure if they have a specific purpose or..? Moderators clearly moderate stuff, but do they get paid? What sort of work do they do? Just a bit of an overview would be fab :)

Thanks if you've stayed with me to this point and thank you for anyone willing to give some insight, as right now I feel like I'm an old woman, but I promise I'm a 22F that's been living under a rock. Sorry I'm late to the Reddit party! :)",31Jul2020,1

2. We both had ADHD did a lot of drugs, but I kept my habit very discreet and controlled.

I am gonna sound like a complete loser because I am but I have to be 100% honest to get the best advice to improve. I am 22 years old and am currently homeless living in a hotel room with my mom. We lost our house to foreclosure in January. We were living at my grand aunt’s house for 5 months until her granddaughter was no longer “comfortable” with us being there and told us to leave. We have been living at the hotel for over a month now. I have no job and only ever had one very briefly holding a sign about 2 years ago. I have been applying to jobs on indeed mostly but never can get any. I dropped out of high school, don’t have a ged and don’t have any work experience besides the previously mentioned job holding a sign. Me and my mom have been having problems always nagging me about getting a job which I understand but she seems to never be able to understand that I’m trying and can’t. She tells me to go look for a job in person but never tells me where and doesn’t take me anywhere as I don’t have a license and can’t even drive. I also have no money to pay for transportation anywhere. Recently she has been talking about taking me to a place to try to get me assistance for mental issues she thinks I have but I told her there’s nothing wrong with me to the point where I would get any assistance. She takes that as me not wanting to do anything to help out, it isn’t it’s just that I feel I wouldn’t because there’s people out there with mental issues who actually do need it and don’t. We got into a huge fight over her phone charger earlier today that she ended up finding where she completely overreacted and now she’s saying after this week’s stay is up I’m on my own. She always says this and things get better between us not too long after but it’s a cycle. This has been how our relationship has been for years. Me becoming independent is long over due I know so that’s why I’m here because I clearly can’t do it with her or on my own. The problems with my mom aside and if things are good between us again temporarily I have to be on my own. I know I’m gonna have to continue staying with her while I’m get my life together but I don’t know where else to start besides getting a job and don’t know how since I can never get a response and can’t just walk outside and find somewhere that’s hiring.

29,"I had a terrible thing happen to me involving famous people ruining my life. I’m a pretty intelligent nice female and my story is really interesting. It’s also tragic and I don’t tell the details but when I try to mention it to people they either ignore that I mentioned it, dismiss it ignore it or treat me rudely. The story involves Metallica and no one is like oh wow Metallica did that or they were involved. People get on their high horse and act weird or rude. The story isn’t a good thing but it’s definitely worth a normal response such as what happened to you? Or metallica was involved?? Are people jealous though my life got ruined by a terrible thing bc it involves famous people? Why would people react this way to something so outrageous

The story involves KIRK hammetts master  KIRK and James. It’s a long complex horrible thing which I’ll probably end up writing a book about to cope with how awful it was. The master knows me from other lifetimes supposedly and set me up to do this to me and show me the relationship we used to have and apparently he hates me and is jealous of me. I don’t believe in past lives and don’t talk abt this stuff with others. KIRK and James first did a spell on me after a show I went to and it was cool fun and positive. For one year they did things that only they have the ability to do. They also did cute things like post videos and post on Twitter the stuff we’d talk about. They court lots of women in lots of ways. They wanted to take me on tour. I was supposed to meet them but didn’t care. Things got bad a year later when the stupid master got involved and I had read about him online. I had a dream abt this master when I was three and he showed me the dream. I know his master too. He showed me that I came from a different realm and he knew all the friends I had and all my past life stories. The things he showed me I remember and am familiar with. What I was put thru involved hundreds of characters and was a long complex hell under mind control. But KIRKs master and their friends have abilities that no one has. 

This could have been an amazing experience since it involved in depth cute characters speeches comedies stories songs but it was a horror and tragedy and it involved my pets too. Some of the characters thought I would tell the world about it. There were many themes involved such as taking their anger out on me not the band members but the master and his friends. The master is also a dead being and I always knew that but he showed me what he looked like as a human and was a decent looking italian man. Some of the characters involved were Italian men. But he supposedly has sex with many of KIRKs girlfriends in some form. Supposedly James hates his daughter and decided to take his anger out on me and treat me the way he wants to treat her. She also knew of what was going on. But assumably they took their anger out on Australia by cancelling the tour bc of the stupid master and their friends doing something awful to me. James and KIRK were also characters in this long awful saga and they used all these cool cute characters and story to mask the terror that this was. Lars ans rob made it clear they were not involved or the master made it clear they don’t do this and lars wasn’t really involved anyway it’s a long story as to what KIRK and James usually do. But the master was involved in my situation that’s why it was so messed up 

Metallica has those cartoon characters the abcs of metwllica bc of this. They cancelled their Australian tour bc of something awful that the master did to me and James pretended to go to rehab. Metallica started a skateboard company bc of a guy I went out witu once who owned one and the way they write it is bc of a game group I went to once. They began playing in festivals because of something a guy around me said about Metallica. For one year they gave only 10k to charity bc when all this started it was rumored they paid a company ten grand to ruin my life. This is just the cute stuff they would do but some of it was mocking me for the torment I was going thru or about to go through. Some of my cats are in Metallica art hidden. I’m not making this sound interesting but it is interesting but more so horrifying and tragic. I could write a book about the hell I was put through. This went on for two years. There’s a lot more to it and it would take a book to describe it all.


This isn't a story. It's a real life horror it's like having the thin man come and invade your life. It's called live uncontained torture bc it's uncontained done in invisible form. KIRK hammetts master and their friends are entities and other invisible beings from a different realm. Demons and these beings exist in another realm that's common knowledge. But they normally don't bother and invade humans lives and ruin them. KIRK and James were alrasdy giving me positive attention before this happened and they weren't malicious. Even physicists believe In parallel universes. These beings know all about this but they have other abilities. They can undo something and pretend it didn't happen and even go back in time. They were supposed to fully restore everything and take me back in time and pretend I didn't go to the Metallica concert. That was the deal they had made. The tag line for this was “never go to a Metallica concert.”They were supposed to bring my cats back. This isn't fiction it's real. And it's not about anyone believing me Metallica band members were already chasing me before the master got involved. U can read about the master guy online I read about him many times. I just thought he seemed creepy. I had no idea He knew me. They put me in something called containment whuch is a prison program these beings used to put demons in to punish or mock them or just for fun. But they put humans in it too sometimes. They've done it to me before bc I know this stuff. No one here I'm sure knows what a containment entity is or what a torture murder party is. They put me in containment which is a prison program and they were supposed to do crap to me and then release me from it. They call it release bc it's a “prison” they create for other beings usually invisible beings. All they did was show me hundreds of creative ways they release you but they didn't fully release me from it. They release u feom the mind control and they have a committee full of beings that judges and mocks you. I'm sure they've done it to other humans who've probably just freaked out or wanted to kill themselves from being in it. They put demons in containment realms and kill them they're like darker realms and they kept showing me what those realms are. They even had James hetfield take me to a dark containment realm or what not under mind control. And it's not just mind control it's real containment for humans and it's a system they designed and it's terrifying and painful. 

It’s a real prison program and I was under mind control and they kept talking about how they put a human female In This and that’s why it was a big deal. They had cartoon characters and illustrations of this over and over. I had no idea what I was in but I also sort of knew bc they use their abilities in a way to make u bear the hell youre in. They use invisible things on you like a torture burning machine and can burn you and it's hot energy running through your body. They had been doing that to me and I had no idea. U don't feel lots of pain but u can feel the heat on your body and ur body hair falls out. They did all this as part of a real moderated production with moderators and KIRK and James were actual moderators and the truth is I was supposed to die within two weeks of this. The containment they put me in was a real prison program these beings created and they talked about it over and over and showed it over and over but they made it seem cute and lighthearted with cartoon characters and productions. They treated one of my cats like he was bad bc he bullied another cat. They supposedly broke his neck in three places and then undid it and took him to a different realm for a while. They can fully control animals and others can do that too but their abilities are different. They can lead ur pets away to other places and force people to take care of them. They can take over human beings and kirk and James can do that too but these things do it in a malicious way. What they first did to me was part of this program like it was supposed to be a “sick fucked up joke” and they fooled characters involved who had the ability to release me. They did a lot of things as part of the program which weren’t totally malicious but it wasn’t cool stuff either. It was stupid and pointless. Like forcing my cats to shit and piss everywhere which made no sense. These beings are intelligent ancient beings. They’re not idiots. They’ve been around for centuries. I don’t know why they did this to me and there was one being “hosting” it all and it seemed like a game show or something or endless  productions. It’s things that no one would have any clue of ubless they were put through it. They speak English. They create super cool cute characters with cool names. They put on comedies. They even gave my two year old niece stage four liver cancer bc they felt like crap for what they did to me and Kirk did something similar I won’t say but it wasn’t as bad. They can do this but most people don’t know these things exist. They don’t invade human lives this way only these creeps who hang out with Metallica do. These invisible creeps are friends of them but apparently they know me and not sure why If they know me so well and showed me characters I knew in other lives and friends why they did this to me. This is all stuff done by invisible beings who have abilities no human has and most humans have no clue they exist.
Most people would just have no clue what I’m writing about bc they don’t know what mind control is and what these beings or this master is capable of doing or that these things exist. It sounds sort of science fictionish unless it was all described in detail and in a way to help others comprehend what it is. They explained it over and over to me and showed illustrations and had hundreds of characters shows etc. characters called kirth KIrk hammetts master, these females, this guy your demon Kirk wicked idiot. Most of the characters had names with Kirk in them or kirks master. I don’t know how I survived it but it was nothing but endless pain and torment torture. They even used invisible machines on me to torture me for a few seconds then stop. It’s hard to describe how they did it but all they did was put me in pain. They also put my old mother in an orgasm program and they can do that and that originated from something Kirk Hammett did to me involving sex wth my old mother. It’s a horrid inside joke which he began tormenting me about before this all started with the master. Just nonsense stupid evil. The themes were burn and torture the pretty young female and give the old lady orgasms. Who knows why. 

They had James hetfield entity and he was a cartoon character I had dealt with before. They also tried to say that some of the people in my past lives were Kirk and James and in many past lives I had a romance with James hetfield and in a few I was bullied by them. They described several past lives and showed the stories. They had depictions of cartoon characters swimming in hell proudly over the crap being done to me mocking the situation and James and Kirk cartoons jumping and swimming in hell. They forced me to have sex with invisible cartoon characters. They said they can bring one of them back in human form some guy named kierth if I wanted a relationship with him. Apparently I knew the real guy in a past life and his girlfriend Kira some other character and they showed me the timeline and realm it was and I vaguely remember it. The band members were aware of the hell I was going through and didn’t try to stop it. There’s much more that happened and it was just a horrid thing. They burned my vagina over and over calling me a Virgin and mocking me for it and putting clearing energy in my car ac vent forcing me to clear it by standing up against it. Clearing energy is like cooling energy. When it first started they forced me to stop my car and bow my head to the ground and jump in a swimming pool another day and characters were bullying me and I was under mind control and had no clue what was going on. There’s so much more. It was a horrifying experience every bit of it.


I read what some ignorant minded creep wrote and seriously. Humans might be the dumbest creatures to ever exist. This isn’t mental illness how dumb and ignorant. How cruel and stupid. It’s a real experience and it involves lives death and cancer. Only minute minded idiots would say oh yeah this is mental illness. Huh?? And why would u keep coming back and reading it over and over. Humans are the dumbest beings to exist for sure. I didn’t even know KIRK Hammett was a band member until he began chasing me. I wasn’t a fan of Metallica and knew nothing about them. I just went to a concert and this happened to me. I had no idea who kirk was. My life was overtaken by KIRK his witchcraft and James. At first it was fun and positive. I don’t even like KIRK and he was scared If I met him I wouldn’t be attracted to him. He tried to get me to go to his Boston exhibit when he was giving a speech there. I wasn’t sure if he’d meet me so I didn’t go. He began making videos about his Salem exhibit and got me to watch them to see if I’d be attracted to him. My life was all about KIRK for a year as he chased me in some witchcraft form mostly. But because I didn’t go to Boston things got bad from there. Then crap started about KIRK having sex with my mother. My family knew metallixa was chasing me and everything was about KIRK Hammett. KIRK was supposed to take me to Hawaii first the Bahamas but it was mostly bullshit. Kirk even hated my brother in law who is a tiny bit famous bc Everytime I told him about Kirk he’d get jealous and didn’t want to respond. So KIRK ruined his career and used his abilities to take over him one day and write a bunch of weird crap and he got banned from some convention. I didn’t know he did that until he told me. My brother in law had no clue KIRK did that. KIRK has abilities but his master has more. This is horrifying stuff but at first it wasn’t negative. It’s scary stuff. It’s my fault for not stopping it and thinking it was safe and they’d never hurt me. KIRK wanted me to get attention for Metallica supposedly stalking me but no one cared. Then he said he’d one day give me money on twitter and make me famous. Then he forced me to post YouTube videos about it. I have a years history of KIRK and the stuff he did to me. I could’ve met KIRK and James many times they wanted me to go to their shows and even invited me to go on tour. I was supposed to meet him in Boston. I didn’t want to meet them or have sex with them bc I was told once they have sex with you they own you and I read about celebrities and the things they’re into. I could’ve met them at a concert but  it wasn’t a priority it’s not a big deal. I got a bad vibe from them at the first show and there was something creepy about them. I was amazed at the show and like a fan but wasn’t going to chase them. But they chased me ruined me. 

I also talked to Kirk on the phone twice and through messenger a few times. And I have plenty of proof with regards to their twitter and KIRK Hammett who did crap to me for a year. The video with KIRK and lars where he yells science rules was bc I told KIRK I like science. I don’t need proof anyway I knew KIRK long distance and he chased me for a year. Metallica began playing in festivals bc of me. Kirks good friend is Corey Taylor. I know detailed info about KIRK and James. So the deaths of innocent beings and the torture of a good human will be dismissed and mocked? People are so pitiful and sick. Also KIRK and James have tons of girlfriends and I wasn’t even a girlfriend just a victim. What I went through was beyond horrifying. I went through horrendous suffering and lives were lost. I didn’t even know KIRK Hammett existed until he began chasing me in this form. This isn’t even the real Kirk Hammett it’s a Hawaiian guy who’s some kind of actor or fill in. They do tons of crap to people that’s why they have that “and justice for all” crap. My sitaution involved kirks master and it’s such a horrifying situation I’ll never get over it. It’s horrific to dismiss such a horrible tragedy and mock innocent people just sick and pathetic. And no u can’t call the cops on witchcraft and what invisible beings do that’s why they do it bc theres no real proof.
KIRK and James have tons of real girlfriends and they court them and kiss their asses. I got screwed badly. I found a groupie online and KIRK freaked out and told me never to talk about her or mention her. I wasn’t a girlfriend. Kirks sick master destroyed my life. KIrk and James have tons of women they are nice to. What I went through is some of the worst stuff anyone can go through. Have a little sympathy jerks out there. I’m not lucky. I got ruined horrific crap happened to me. That’s not a person u mock or put down. Go mock their 19 year old bimbo women who they take on tour. They were supposed to meet me make it up to me and give me money. I was even forced to drive up to Albany New York chasing Metallica with promises of being released at the Metallica concert. I’m only writing this bc it’s too much for one human to go through. It’s beyond horrifying. I’ll be in shock forever. I’ll never get over this. I don’t even have ptsd it’s worse than grieving. I’m
In shock and horror and my body is in permanent pain from this. There’s so much more to it and More that happened and I’m in horror and shock.",31Jul2020,1
30," 

Gonna be a senior in high school next year.

For some reason, I always feel that I'm the only person in my school who has been a victim of something, who has failed at something, and generally whos life is an utter mess right now.

I have no friends, and I have barely chatted with anyone else from school since the pandemic became a thing. When I did, it was mostly about clearing up drama. As I'm writing this, I imagine everyone else at school excelling everything academically, getting great scholarships, have amazing friendships and relationships, and never became victims of anything.

I, on the other hand, am a total wreck. I wasted a lot of time ruminating over past hurts, despite confronting the perps about it and getting them to apologize. I had just failed 2 of my AP exams and almost got fired from my job, because my boss isn't happy with my work output.

What do I do?",31Jul2020,1
31,"This happened a year ago and recently I was very triggered and had a wave of memories come back. One night I went to a party with friends. No one was sober. There were guys I’d never met. One guy was very nice so we’d been talking a lot. I got sick and was so out of it I went in the room to take a nap. He got in bed with me. He started kissing my neck which felt nice, but then he pulled my shorts off and stuck it in with no lube or condom. It was the most painful experience I’ve ever had sexually. I told him to stop 10 minutes later because I was in so much pain from lack of lubrication. The reason I question this was because I didn’t say yes OR no. My friend said it was because he was so drunk. And the neck kisses felt good, which I don’t know if they would if it was rape. It took a year of drugs and living fast to finally sit down and realize how I’d been violated, but I still don’t know if I’m allowed to consider what was done to me rape or sexual assault. Can anyone give me some clarity so I can let go of these thoughts? Thanks",31Jul2020,1

I’ve always been interested in photography, but realistically speaking, can I easily make money from that job? Some other jobs I’ve looked into include a librarian, book editor, therapist, and interior designer. Does anybody have any clue how I can find something that I want to do in my future?

33,"My father desperately needs help, he’s suicidal but refuses to admit he has problems. The first time he tried to kill himself, I was 16 and I had to talk him out of it and take a gun away from him. He was extremely drunk and he acted like it never happened. He’s done that twice to me and I’m 23 now. He tells me every so often that he’s just going to disappear one day so that way I don’t have to be the one to find him. He tells me what to do with his belongings and his will. He tells me he’s done with this world and the pain and he’ll be leaving soon. Every time I threaten to call the police for a wellness check or get a hospital involved he either shuts down and tries to change subjects or he gets angry. He tells me no one listens and a therapist or a ‘loony bin’ won’t help him whatsoever. He’s said he’ll basically disown me if I try to force him even though I’m all he has. He has so much anger about it. This has been going on for years. I’m at point where I feel like I can’t just threaten it anymore and he’s closer to actually doing something to harm himself than he’s ever been. He texted me today again saying he was in too much pain and he’s ready for it to be over and that he’s going to do something but he doesn’t know when. How do I stop this? What do I do to get him help? I feel like if I act on something it will only push him closer to doing it.  I’m so lost on what to do and I have no one to help me. I just desperately need any advice that might get him the help he needs. tia.",31Jul2020,1
35,"I’m in grad school and have two roommates but one is out of the country. I’ve been living with my parents since lockdown started and I’ve been thinking about how life is gonna be different when I head back to school in a few weeks. 

I’m concerned about talking with my roommate about boundaries for our house. I’m technically in the high risk category because of my asthma and my mom has several autoimmune diseases (I tend to go home a few times a semester and don’t want to put her at risk). I’ve avoided getting sick this far, but I don’t know that my roommate is going to be okay with the boundaries I want to set. I don’t want to be unreasonable, but tbh I’m terrified of getting sick. 

The biggest issue is my roommate dates around a lot - please don’t read that wrong - I don’t care that she’s dating a bunch of people, I care because I don’t know them and I therefore do not trust them to be wearing masks, social distancing, etc. I honestly don’t want people to come to our house at all- even my friends. But my roommate has a thing for dating people who are in open relationships and her one boyfriend is for sure going to work regularly and I know that a few people at his workplace have tested positive. I’m pretty sure that his wife is also going to work. I don’t want to be unreasonable and tell her that she can’t have people over ever, but because the people she dates are often in open marriages/live with their significant others, they HAVE to come to our place. 

I’m trying to think of a good compromise that still makes me comfortable but also isn’t an asshole move. My one friend suggested having her guests wear masks when in the common areas, sticking to hang outs mainly in her room, and necessary cleaning after guests leave. While I think this is reasonable, I still feel super uncomfortable with the whole situation. If it were possible I would honestly probably move just to avoid any issues like this (I super hate confrontation). 

So Reddit, am I being completely and totally paranoid or am I only a little crazy? Any suggestions/tips for how to approach the conversation or other compromise boundaries are welcome. Please help",31Jul2020,1
36,"Last week my freezer wasn’t getting super cold so I turned it off for a little bit to try to defrost it. When I turned it back on it was the same thing but somehow even less cold. This week it gave up completely along with the fridge. I texted my landlord (I’ve only been here 2 months) on Wednesday and told him what was going on along with an unrelated toilet not working issue. 

He told me to unplug it for a few hours then plug it back in. I told him I tried that last week, but I’ll do it again! He told me he’d come look at it on Friday and he’ll look at the toilet, too. I told him since he’s coming Saturday to pick up the rent he can just look at it then (he lives about an hour away and I may be too nice of a person). 

All of the food in the freezer thawed and melted and the fridge is lukewarm at best so I had to throw almost everything away. 

How do I ask him to discount my rent to replace these items or is that a me problem that doesn’t concern him? 

The toilet issue is it’s not working and I have to fill a bucket from the bathtub to dump into the toilet to get it to flush. That’s been going on about 2.5 weeks or so but I figured I can make due with it until he came bc I hate to complain or inconvenience other people.",31Jul2020,1

43,"My very good friend (15 years of friendship) recently had an abortion. She came to my birthday party and told me she was pregnant. Then decided to do terminate a day later because there's a pandemic on, she's getting married in a month, and it's just not the right time. She told me this because we are very close and typically can be pretty honest in our friendship, we try not to judge each other for being human and sometimes shitty. But recently I am finding I sort of don't agree with her about a lot of things and feel trapped in this constant must be supportive mindset. She does not handle criticism or diverging viewpoints well based on my experience...but that hadn't been a huge problem in the past because I didn't really spend a lot of time with her. 


These are the issues I am having trouble dealing with, and taken as a whole, feel like my friend is just a bad person??? More so than the stray bad day. 


1) i am bothered by the abortion because she is planning a pregnancy in December, and will go through with the pregnancy regardless of covid at the time. Which leads me to believe she really only wanted this abortion because she wants to be free to enjoy her wedding. And I'm feeling put out that she wanted me to comfort her leading up to the abortion because she felt like an asshole. Man. Its hard as fuck to comfort her when I think she is being an asshole. Personally I don't think she had good reasons and I think she trumps up how much covid played into this...which feels manipulative. 


2) the wedding is out of state and a ""weekend getaway."" I feel a little burdened by this wedding. Risking health and safety for a two day (shared accomodations) destination wedding feels so selfish, let alone having a wedding during a pandemic in the first place. 


3) she drunk texted me about her resentment of her friend trying to get pregnant in the months leading up to her wedding.  (Pre-covid). She was mad that now that girl couldn't jetski or get drunk at the bachelorette party. I was just so unnerved by this. It felt absolutely nasty beyond normal crappy human behavior. Ended up being a small issue that did not last long because that friend is actually having fertility issues and can't get pregnant.  


4) before I was this main best friend, another girl was. That girl dumped my friend without explanation and really hurt her feelings. My friend has carried a grudge ever since. A month ago she was texting me that since they live in Texas and the girls husband is a Dr...and that my friend hopes they get covid and haha at them for being assholes, now they'll get they're comeuppance. When I was like, that's not funny...she got defensive and said obviously she was joking and treated me like I was stupid for taking it seriously. But it made me feel sick that she could be so petty and nasty to even be thinking like that over a ghosted friendship.


5) I have an unfounded sneaking suspicion that she likes it when I come to her to talk about things in my life that are bothering me. Sometimes I just feel like she likes to hear about them and offer me support about it because she's being like...some benevolent person. But also she likes to revel in my failures....it's hard to describe. And it's just me being maybe too paranoid?


Now being in her wedding she is constantly texting me and stuff. I can't seem to get back to ""small doses"" anymore and it's all souring my view of her. 


I feel conflicted because she tells me these things because she sort of expects me to back her up and hear her out and be a supportive friend...how can I use these deeply personal things against her? She doesn't voice them to others, just to me because I'm supposed to be able to understand they're fleeting and emotionally driven right? The biggest impact these decisions and behaviors really have on me at all is that they're making me feel skeevy. If I argued my disagreement on things it would be an endless battle all the time, I learned over 15 years to stop fighting when I think she's wrong...why waste my time and energy on correcting her when I disagree? Why make myself the center of conflict when I can just placate her and move on? But now I'm feeling like that's wrong of me and it's blowing up in my face...",31Jul2020,1

I tried to get over her by developing crushes on other girls, but it is hard to do so, when those other girls ignore you.

51,"My parents had a very successful restaurant, everyone knew and enjoyed it in town. 

My dad as always been... a piece of work.  At one point my mom tried to get hold of the finances but he would rage at her when she would find him transferring money to different accounts. He would make up all kind of excuses, lie about it, get into CRAZY debts, neglect everyone in his family. My mom got fed up of it, his cheating, his drunk shenanigans and left my dad, leaving him with me (I was 18 at the time) and my older brother (my sister was already away and sorting out her life).

From that point on the restaurant started going downhill, quality, service.... everything. I ended up going abroad as well when I turned 21, looking to improve my quality of life, worked hard and managed to live life and save money (got about 10k in 6 years of work). During these 6 years abroad I came back home from times to times, and it's painful to see what everything as turned into. I still try to help my dad and end up paying for things I probably shouldn't (bills, fixing his car, products he left unpaid...) He got into a debt last year and my sister ended up helping him so he wouldn't lose the house and the restaurant (20k), he promised that he would change, fix things, look after the restaurant and save money.

This year I came back home, and it's just heartbreaking. I can't sleep, the house is a mess, the restaurant is a mess, and he just doesn't care about anything besides going to drink with his ""friends"". They come here to eat and drink on lunch time and dinner time, after the dinner service he goes to the bar, comes back at 1 am with a bunch of these ""friends"" and stay in the restaurant until early mornings drinking and playing cards. (the house is just upstairs and I can hear everything... some things I'd rather not hear) and I barely see him! He just doesn't care. His brothers and sisters have tried to help him manage his finances and today I spoke with his side of the family (who criticised my mom when she left - probably because of my dads lies) and he is doing to them exactly the same thing he did to my mom. He owes them SO much money.

I don't feel comfortable telling him what I think because I'm here on holiday, and he lives life how he wants. But it worries me knowing that he drives around completely drunk (he picked me up one time recently and will not enter a car with him driving ever again, after what I experienced that day), I'm scared of getting a phone call saying he got into a serious accident, lost the house or whatever might happen with all this crap that is going on... And if anythings happens me and my siblings will have to pay the debts.

I believe that he has a good heart and his ""friends"" end up taking advantage of him, I have a feeling that there is something going on really bad and he will never tell anyone about it. I will try to have yet another serious talk with him tomorrow morning and get him to open up to me. I don't see what else I can do. I can't keep enabling this behaviour, that's for sure. I'm 28 and ONLY NOW I'm figuring out what to do with my life... I have my own problems too, and I just feel SO tired right now. I don't know what else I can do to save my dad.",31Jul2020,1
52,"So. This post needs some backstory.

Basically, me and this guy had been talking for 5 months and we became best friends. I genuinely cared about him, and we started to develop feelings towards one another. He has a girlfriend though, so we were strictly just friends. We were hanging out the other day, and somehow we kissed. We both agreed that it was a big mistake afterwards and that we should forget about it. He’s planning on telling his girlfriend that he cheated on her when she comes back from vacation, and I thought I could be there to support him JUST as a friend when that happened. But apparently not. A day after the kiss happened, he basically un-friended me. It was a huge slap in the face, considering he always told me that he’d never leave me no matter what. I thought we could help eachother through the pain and be there for eachother, but I guess I was wrong. So, here’s my issue;

I feel broken inside. Him dropping me feels like a part of me is gone. It feels like he didn’t actually care for me as much as he said he did, I feel used.

53,"Hello!

So my fiancee and I are getting a great deal on a trailer and I would love to use it for traveling until we save enough for a real home. Thing is, we would still need to be making money somehow.

I thought about selling things, and we could deliver them personally while exploring different cities, or ship them off from wherever we happen to be.

I am very crafty so I could do something on etsy, but I have no idea what. I have also always wanted a small breeding business for uncommon pets. Thing is reptiles take up quite a lot of electricity and fish dont do well in moving vehicles. Some kind of cool bug maybe? Though I doubt there would be much of a market.

Anyway I just wanted to see if anyone had ideas or advice on whether that would be a possible lifestyle or if it would flop. I appreciate feedback!",31Jul2020,1
54,"I cancelled moving in with a toxic roommate before we even moved in and now she wants me to pay 100$ in bills (I paid for the first months’ rent and then the landlord let me out of the lease since I haven’t/am not even lived/living there)

55,"Hi! I am going to try to make this short. There is a girl in my close group of friends from high school who is very attractive. She’s been model scouted multiple times and has dated a few high-profile men (just to give you all an idea of her and the upcoming jealousy issues I am going to talk about). We are all in our late 20s and out of the friend group (four girls), she’s the only one who isn’t married. My friend’s husbands all get along with her really well and only have good things to say about her (as does mine). She’s the one they all talk to the most out of the group. My friends are jealous and yes, have been immature and stopped talking to her when we were in our early/mid-20s because they knew their boyfriends (now husbands) were attracted to her. I always scoffed at the idea because like I mentioned earlier, she dates pretty powerful men, so she would have absolutely no interest in any of them and isn’t the type to try to steal someone else’s man. Now, I find myself being upset. We recently had a small get together. Everyone had gone to bed except her, my husband, and another friend’s husband. I was in bed, but could still hear them talking in the other room. I heard my husband announce that he was going to bed and then he asked her if he needed to tuck her in. I could tell by her tone of voice that she was a little weirded out and she said “no”, but he kept pushing it. Is this weird? I KNOW it’s not my friend’s fault, but now I feel I can’t trust my husband around her. Like, I truly feel this wasn’t innocent. Am I crazy/overreacting? Thank you!!",31Jul2020,1

I have to say NYC is the biggest pile of shit on planet earth. This city drains your fucking soul. I can’t sleep because of the noise. I’m surrounded by wanna be thugs who have less intelligence then a fly on dog shit. 

I’ve been planning an escape out of this shit hole of a city  here is  the plan:

Step 1: Get a job that pays $15-20/hr
Step 2: Work as many hours as I can possibly handle 
Step 3: Get $10000 before October 31st
Step 4: Move to South Dakota( It’s very cheap living and no income tax)
Step 5: Live the life I wanna live

Here’s the problem I can’t find a job where I fit the requirements in order to get paid $15 or maybe more. I only have a high school diploma

I told her don’t marry me to just to come to the U.S cause I’m a good guy if she wants to come to the U.S I’ll marry her and then just break up after she becomes a citizen after 3 years basically where we don’t have to become super close but she told me that nah she would want to stay with me yk basically actually be together and I’m down for it me personally I don’t want to speak much on anything about my personal life and what I do for a living but bottom line I love nothing and have nothing to live for my mother and father is still alive but I just never cared much about others only caring about myself cause feelings get you fucked but I’m feeling a bit of sympathy towards this girl and want to bring her to the U.S and be with her just any advice on anything because I would have to do very long distance for 2years and yk I’m pretty smart so ik it’s a process in order to get married in the U.S and the process of getting a green card type shit won’t be instantly but still quicker than any other method anything helps sorry for no punctuation but when I’m texting I don’t use it unless I’m writing a essay",31Jul2020,1
59,"My dad has had non-small cell lung cancer for 5 ish years (he never smoked). He was managing pretty well with treatment. Now it has spread to his brain. I’m completely thrown by this.

There’s also my fiancé and our 1 yr old son (dad’s only grandkid). Grandson seems to be what is keeping my dad’s spirits up. I can see how his eyes light up when we visit (with lots of covid precautions, I promise). I’ve brought my son to visit dad every day since we got the news about a week ago. We live pretty close to my parents so travel isn’t an issue to spend time with him. How can my family make the most of dad’s remaining time? We live in Iowa, so....not much to do here and don’t want to risk him catching covid by going on one last trip....or even in public really unless we’re suuuper careful

65,"Okay so, it’s been really rough lately. I have a couple things I need advice on so I guess I’ll just separate them accordingly.

1) I’ve had this guy friend that I’ve been friends with since 7th grade (I’m a 15F going into sophomore year), and we got into a fight and stopped talking for about 8 months. Long story short I felt really guilty and missed him a lot and I texted him and we’ve talked pretty much every day since. Things are pretty close to what they used to be, but one thing has changed. I think he has. Not necessarily for the worse, but just in a weird confusing way for me. He’s mentioned before that he thinks he might be a sociopath, and I think he’s right. He’s always had kind of an ego, and he has a pretty shitty family. He said that he hasn’t talked to anyone except me for 3 months, and he texts me first and stuff. One night we were talking and I asked him if he liked dating. He said yes except for the fact that when you date someone their problems become your problems. That hit me kinda hard because it just kinda seems to me that he truly doesn’t care. Which is obviously a red flag because, why should he care about me right? But it just sends me mixed signals I guess because I was talking to him about stuff after high school and I feel like he won’t put any effort in to keeping me in his life and stuff, I think this because he has a very fatalistic view on life, where he thinks nothing matter because everyone dies regardless and the universe is so huge that no matter what you do nothing will matter. He avoided me in his reply and basically just said that friends come and go. I guess I’m just really wondering if he cares or not.

2) My two other best friends (I’ll say one and two) I’ve just felt really weird about since we had a fight a few days before the Fourth of July. Nothing has really felt right with either of them. I had told #1 that I needed space from #2 and she said I get that and I had told her that I wasn’t mad at the #2 but I just needed space away from her and that I’d get over it in a couple days and then #1 told #2 what I said and started a big argument and I get that maybe I shouldn’t have been talking to #1 about it, but I didn’t really think it was a big deal and that everything would go back to normal quick but I can’t help but feel kind of betrayed by #1 because I thought I could trust her I guess, and I just think I lost all trust in her. She had done something similar to this before but I guess it’s my fault for trusting her anyways.

3) Lately I’ve been not really feeling much emotion. Like thinking about my other best friends: #1 and #2, possibly like losing them and other subjects that should get some kind of emotional reaction out of me just don’t. I don’t really know what’s going on with me but I’ve stopped caring about a lot of things, for example, I went to cross country camp and pulled my quad muscle, and at one point my coach had to carry me and I was a little embarrassed but I got over it within the same day because I just didn’t care. I’ve had some family problems lately, I just don’t care. And my mom asked me a couple days ago if I was depressed and that she’s a little worried and stuff and I didn’t really know how to answer. 

Sorry if this was super confusing, some thoughts on these things would be helpful. Thank you to everyone who responds :)",31Jul2020,1

Now while the Adults talked and had their own fun in the kitchen while me and my 2 older brothers (16 &amp; 19) hanged with our cousins. 2 of my cousins are female and the other 2 male and were around the same age as my brothers. Well while they played their violent video games i was too young to play, i would play with some toys they had in a closet (their house was used for as a daycare). Now one of my male Cousins i will call ""Ed"" would take advantage of the fact that all the attention was off me and would take me to his room upstairs (not by force, he would ask me if i wanted to do ""the thing"" and i would oblige since it had become a habit) and he would do whatever to me.

78,"I know this is a huge risk speaking about everything, but it’s bothered me for years. Now it’s starting to take an impact on my bond with my daughter. 

So imma try shorten this as much as I can. Long story short, I’ve been sexually assaulted/raped A LOT (well a lot to me) since I was 11. This has been with different guys, all different ages, different times, places, and ages (myself). I don’t know if it’s me getting myself into risky situations or not realising the worlds a horrible place.... but anyway, it’s happened. The last one was about 2ish years ago. 4 of the times it’s happened, I’ve tried to tell someone, 3 of those times it’s been my mum. Every single one has been a disappointment, (including the one time I told an ex) I either wasn’t believed, or blamed. 

I know this happens a lot, I know there are also girls out there that are sick AF and fake this happening too, I’m not one of those (I’m also aware lots get peer pressured into saying it was fake because they’re scared they won’t be believed). No I didn’t change my mind half way through any of them, no I never said I wanted it, yes I did say I didn’t want it on many of those times, but no I didn’t fight, fight (my mind just left my body after a while of saying no and trying to get up or walk away). 

Anyway, back to my mum, the first time I was 11. I told her what the shop keeper done to me, and she blamed me, she told me I shouldn’t have wore the skirt I did (she bought me it and chose when for me to wear it most of the times) and that I was probably being too nice to the guy so he thought I was flirting. When I broke down crying telling her to do something, she asked me what I wanted her to do, should she “call the police or something” sarcastically. I cried no, because I thought they’d shout at me the way she was, then I said yes and she shouted at me for being dramatic but called them. (I lost that court case but I won’t get into it). After that date every time an adult looked at me from 11-present, she’s blamed me. Even when I’ve been scared and asked her to protect me (at a young age), she told me I was being dramatic. 

The second and third time I tried to tell her she done the same, but as I was older, she told me I was probably acting like I wanted it. She said I was the attention seeking type. After that I stopped trying as it broke me. She told me that “a mother shouldn’t have to hear these things” and told me it was “part of life” and that I “should keep it to myself”. She had dealt with this stuff all her young adult life and I should too. 

Flash forward to now, other stuff’s happened but I’ve only ever told less than a handful of people what’s happened. Since I was 11, I’ve just, I don’t know... I don’t know if it’s lost respect, hope or I just plain up, hate her. 

She’s insulted how I look all my life it seems, if I’m too fat, too revealing, who I sleep with, the fact I’m bi, everything. She’s never congratulated me on any achievements but had for every small or big thing for my siblings. 

On the outside everyone thinks she’s this amazing mum because she’s never physically hurt us, she’s brought us up to want for nothing, and she’s helped with raising my child. 

Here’s the problem, we already had a strained relationship before I had my daughter. I tried my best to just act like nothing is wrong throughout the years, I rebelled a lot, and done a lot of stupid things because of it, but I was still on the outside the perfect daughter (besides once). Now I’ve had my daughter I’m terrified I’ll become her. 

I’m also terrified I’m being a total asshole for not showing my appreciation for my mothers help with my daughter. She babysits when I work, she helps with washing, when I’ve been in and out of hospital etc. Again, on the outside she’s been amazing, and honestly I couldn’t have done it without her. I’m constantly thanking her for it, buying her expensive flowers and chocolates just like the way she likes to be thanked, but apparently it’s still not enough. 

Since I’ve had my daughter (19months), my mother has become a second mum to her. She adores her as does my little one to my mum. It’s great, but the problem is she doesn’t let me mother my own child. Everything I do with her I have to run it past her, I get told I can’t look after her myself, I’m a bad mum, I constantly don’t do enough (when I try do everything, and try not to ask for help because I get sick of her and my sister telling me how under appreciated they are). I’ve tried feeding my child and she’s told me I can’t give her certain foods (that she gives her, herself), I’m not doing her nappy quick enough (as soon as I see its full I do it), how the baby’s not allowed to move out with me until she’s five, because I probably will mistreat her (and yes she says it in front of people and will get mad if I defend myself. 

Honestly it’s just got to the point where I’m like fuck, this shit hurts. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried speaking to my mum about how I’ve felt, but she keeps saying because of my past with her I have naturally built in spite towards her. She calls me a “victim” and says I’m “acting” again. I’ve tried speaking to my uncles, siblings and they all tell me my mums a saint and she’s right. I should be grateful for having her in my life. 

I just need to know, am I being ungrateful? Have I got something embedded into my head I need to get out that I can’t see? This is driving me crazy. Sorry for it being super long but you kinda need the whole story 🤷🏻‍♀️. 

Also goes without saying, if there is anyone out there who knows me, my family or my friends, I’d ask that you respect my privacy on the matter. Yes my profile has pictures but I know none of my family has reddit, so I’m safe. This is my safe place, so please don’t ruin that for me 👏🏻.",31Jul2020,1

82,"Hello Reddit,

I’m throwing this out into the void that is the internet, in hope of, well, I’m not sure. 

Some background; I just graduated from high school 2 months ago, and I live in a big East Coast city. I didn’t really care too much about my grades in high school, and thus graduated with a 2.3 GPA. I’m waiting to hear back from a local state school, but have no idea what’s going to happen in the fall. I’ve been doing some soul searching for how and why i put myself in this situation, but Im just trying my best to run with it now. I feel like I was slapped in the face, when I realized my best friends of 10 years, are moving away. I feel like I’ve barreled myself into a corner, but made no effort to stop myself. 

My current situation?: My mother told me last night, if I’m not taking classes this fall, she’s going to start making me chip in 1k/month for rent. She’s a first generation immigrant with only a high school education from a foreign country. Fortunately, my mother is kickass woman, and has been able to raise me by herself in the city. She has offered to pay for college, if I attend my local state school (not the one I got waitlisted from). The plan is to transfer to the original state school I was waitlisted from, after the fall semester. 

More info: I’m currently doing a paid internship that I also did last summer, and they’ve expressed interest in rehiring me full time. I feel like I want to go to college, as it’s supposed to be a super fun and transformative experience, but I don’t know. Until I was in my sophomore year, my whole life I’ve wanted to become a doctor. I was offered an amazing internship at a local hospital for a few months that year, and realized my grand dreams of saving lives were... not for me. For the last 2 summers, I’ve done a paid internship program with a large company headquartered in Boston which has been the coolest thing ever. Right now because of COVID, I’ve been doing it as a “virtual internship”, at home on my laptop. 

The advice I’m seeking: What should I do? Where do I go with my life? I been stalking through r/FIRE for a year now, I’ve worked 4 different jobs over the last 2 years, I have 3 side hustles, and have many many more interests beyond the stuff I was taught at school. I love photography as a hobby, but don’t know how I could turn that into a career. So many people now are turning to making a life for themself through the internet, and that’s what I think I want to do. I don’t really want to work an office job, for a big corporation, or for anyone really. I’ve thought about creating content for YouTube, and to start “selling through attention” online, but don’t know how feasible that is. 

Please, any thoughts you have, any advice you got, I’m all ears.",31Jul2020,1

Apologies in advance for length, this will likely go into absurd detail, but this isnt near the full extent of everything that happened. I will be censoring quotes within the post, if the mods would like changes to the censoring to comply with guidelines, please message me before deleting as I have attempted to follow community standards to the best of my ability. I included few identifying details and I would appreciate no doxxing attempts.

Background: We are both 20 M, we have known each other for 3 years, I have been aware of the extent of his views for about a year.

Back in 2017, I was a dumb high school grad heading to college. I lived in the school dorms for my first year and became friends with a guy I'll call Dylan. Dylan was a hockey bro, very tall, lanky and athletic, I would say of pretty average attractiveness. He was of Slavic heritage. We were both interested in similar hobbies and video games and also took similar courses so we wound up spending a lot of time together. As the year progressed, I began to realize that he had some generally anti-social tendencies, he wouldn't partake in group outings with other dorm kids and generally was uncomfortable talking to people he didnt know well. When he did, the conversation quickly devolved into an endless stream of ""edgy humor"". He also increasingly obsessed over finding a girlfriend. Being a bunch of single engineering students, we thought this behavior was weird but not particularly concerning.

I saw Dylan occasionally the next year, mostly just to work on assignments. At the end of second year, we realized that we both among a small number of students who were staying for summer school until August and neither of us had housing, so we rented an apartment for the summer and moved in together. This was where the real problems started.

We talked, got reacquainted and he kept mentioning his persistent struggle to find a relationship. He showed me his Tinder profile (I know bad way to meet people) which had no bio or interests listed. I pointed this out and he basically responded with ""I don't need one, girls only care about looks anyway"". Partially to prove him wrong, I overhauled his profile and wrote him a bio (I promise, I don't hate women for unleashing this man on them, I'm just dumb). This kept him occupied for a bit and he would often sit in our shared space browsing Tinder while making comments like ""does she look like a w\*\*\*\*"". He also made extremely derogatory comments about single mothers, gleefully swiping left while saying things like ""stupid s\*\*\* can't keep her legs closed, no woman will make a c\*\*\* out of me"". Often these comments included racial epithets, which I hadn't really heard him use before. I obviously began to regret my aid.

One day he was engaging in this behavior and I noticed that he was swiping left on 98% of girls, only swiping right if they were tall, naturally blonde, presumably virgins and extremely white. I asked him why this was. He responded with something along the lines of ""gotta purify the bloodline, how else am I going to make an Aryan baby?"". This reference made me think back to a story he had told me years earlier about his hockey days in bantam. His team had a kid on it who was small, weak and had an abnormally large nose. He recounted that his team (of which he was a captain), bullied and assaulted this kid (nearly requiring hospitalization) and referred to him using anti-Semitic slurs. I assumed at the time that this was him trying to get street cred, but now I wondered.

Several days later, he left his laptop open in the dining area, with the [incels.me](https://incels.me/)

forum pulled up. The next week it was [Stormfront.org](https://stormfront.org/). He started pulling me aside for conversations about the third-world invasion and the corruption of the white race. Being the over-tolerant debater that I am, I often tried to debate him on questions related to these topics. He also began blaming ""the Jews"" every time anything remotely went wrong. If he didnt like something, he would say ""well that's Jewish"".

Near the end of the session, Dylan developed a crush on a girl in one of our lecture sections without speaking to her. He would constantly come home after class and make comments about how hot she looked that day, what she was doing, where he had seen her. Eventually, I realized that he was most likely stalking her as he had most of her class schedule memorized. By this point, I was getting extremely sick of this so I told him, ""either ask her out, if she says no move on, or stfu about her"". He never did, he continued this behavior until the semester ended and went off on a rant about how she was probably ""just a decadent s\*\*\* anyways like the rest of them"" an well as a number of stuff Ill get 100% banned for quoting.

Fast forward through an internship.

Dylan is in online classes. His obsession with women has reached new levels to the point where he can no longer study or function. I genuinely feel bad for him. He has pushed away almost all his other friends and I'm scared for what will happen if I too cut contact. His academic performance this semester has tanked to the point where he will lose tens of thousands of dollars in internships and tuition. He seems almost suicidally depressed anytime I hear from him. He has told me set dates of when he is going to rope (die). I genuinely don't think he is the antichrist, despite how this post sounds.

I genuinely dont know how to approach this. Should I ghost him, help him, report him to his parents or the authorities. I feel like at this point I'm just enabling by supporting him in any way.

TL;DR: My friend holds sincere neo-Nazi and incel beliefs. It is ruining his career, his friendships and his mental health. I genuinely don't know how to approach this anymore. Should I ghost him, help him, report him to his parents or the authorities?",31Jul2020,1

These are things that I know I am capable of doing, but I am held back by always wanting to do things that satisfy me and keep me from being bored. I want the jobs that my friends have, I want a car, and I want to grow up. But I can’t because of this tie to being a kid.

90,"I’m looking into buying a car. I’m in Hawaii and something about Hawaii in general is that people rarely use craigslist. Not sure why, maybe it’s all the expensive cars or something but yeah. 

In the Island I’m on there’s only 2 cars of the model I’m looking at. One is a scam for sure. It has the phone number in “six eight seven” 

But, I’m talking about the other one. At first glance everything checks out. No major spelling errors, punctuation is alright, etc. they stated they’re selling because “she is having her second child” I’m like “?” Why would you call your second kid “her second” tf?

Anyways just thought that was weird. 

So text the guy and the wife calls instead I’m driving so I’m like “lemme cal you back in a few” so I do. A guy answers “that was my wife” alright sure they’re in a relationship it checks out. 

Then I’m like give me a few days but I end it with “can I get the cars vin?” And they never respond. 

I’m like, “it’s corona, everyone’s struggling etc so I might be able to lower the price a bit” so I’m like “I’m not gonna act like I’m desperate” 

So I see they remove the ad like 2 days after this and I’m like “must’ve sold it” but the next day it shows back up. Initially I thought they were just trying to not make the ad look old? Idk

So now it’s been up for 3 days so that eliminates that theory that they were trying to keep the ad new. The guy calls me in the morning “hey we spoke last Sunday about the car? Said you’d call back today?” 

I’m like “yeah, everything’s ready on my end(money) and he’s like “my brother in law is on the title, would that work?” I’m like ?? 

“Is the only person on the title? He’s like “yeah but he signed everything on the title and it’s ready” 

I’m like ehhh about it at this point but I’m like alright so I say, “alright I guess, can you send me the vin to get a carfax on it?” He’s like yeah and here we are. Never sent it. 

Like either way, In the ad he’s like “serious inquires only please” so I’m serious asf when I say, I’m not driving my ass over there without having a car fax first but at this point it’s beginning to feel a little fishy that he won’t hand over the vin. 

Like by the post maybe they’re older? In the pictures they deliberately left out the plates of the car by taking pictures with them out of frame so I’m like “maybe they’re older and didn’t know how to edit them?” The pictures themselves are detailed looks like a normal iPhone camera etc. the street does look from here etc. but again the not wanting to give up the vin is kinda creeping me out. 

Maybe he just forgot but then again, I left him last time on “can I get the vin?” And this phone call on “vin” he’s like “yeah I can get the vin from the papers” like ?? Ain’t this your car? Shouldn’t you be familiar with it?

97," I've been with my GF for 8 months, and for what i know, she has had episodes of depression in the past because she suffered emotional trauma from an abusive relationship. I have been kind and affectionate with her since the day we met and I make her laugh everyday, she confessed to me that she hasn't felt this great in a long time and that I changed her entire life when I came along. Yesterday, out of nowhere when we were strolling around she said that she had thought before about life having no purpose, that we live only to die and that she feels she'll never achieve anything in life. She told me how she wants to do something great and leave her mark before she passes, because she doesn't want her existence to become pointless. She also told me that she thinks about this before sleeping, and this is what makes her feel sad and depressed.

I told her that she matters to me, to her family and that her existence is not pointless or just a coincidence, that life is very rare and everything has a purpose, no matter how little it is. She didn't seem impressed, but she told me I'm right and she knows it's wrong to think about this, but she can't control it because her thoughts come out of the blue. I suggested she tries meditation and accept that death is inevitable and everyone gets there at some point, but that's not a turning point for giving up on life's entirety. I don't know what other advice to give her and I'm afraid she'll become obsessed with this subject in the future. She is not suicidal, she's energetic and funny, we meet everyday and we do alot of things together, it's only these thoughts that concern me and I don't know how to help her handle them, can someone help me?

She is also very afraid on this concept of aging, I mean veeery afraid, she mentioned this alot and I think it's connected to what she said above... She fears that she'll never be able to experience feelings and other activities like she can now. She's afraid of being even 30 years old (she has some health problems that are very difficult to deal with older, but they are not life-threatening).",31Jul2020,1
98,"TW/CW: rape, sexual assault

This incident happened a few years ago but will forever bother me. Keeping everyone as anonymous as possible... (Also apologies, this is long)

I have a brother who is a few years younger than me. I was in college and my brother had just started his senior year of high school at the time of the incident. Also typing this is hard because Im still so upset by it and thinking about it makes me shake but... my brother was accused of rape. The girl who accused him was a friend of his and she came forward with the accusation many months after the incident took place. I did fully believe her at first but I also started to doubt her story... Heres why:

I will start by saying that I am a feminist (not the TERF or radical kind) and I do believe that when women come forward with stories of sexual assault they should not be questioned, shamed, or doubted. In fact, had the person accused been anyone other than my brother I would have believed her 100%, no questions asked, and cut that person out of my life entirely. It's created a lot of internal conflict; I want to believe her but I also want to believe my little brother.

It started with the girl (N) messaging me out of the blue to ask me if my brother was ok. She asked me if I could check on him because ""he seemed upset"". I was home at the time so I asked if he was ok. He told me yea everything was fine he was just stressed, so thats what I told N. The next morning he was still in a really bad mood so I asked him again, this time mentioning that N told me to check on him. He whipped around with the most distraught and angered look on his face and said ""please dont fucking talk to N, she's telling everyone I raped her and I didn't do it"". And then he started to cry. I was infuriated and messaged N asking if she was accusing my brother of rape.

She didn't reply until I was heading into work and I decided to wait to go in so I could talk to her about it. I'll admit my first impulse was anger towards her, but I also wanted to hear her out just in case my brother had done something so I tried my best to remain collected and patient with her, reminding myself that this could be a victim and I couldn't point fingers. She told me what happened, and also told me that another girl had accused my brother of molesting her. I was distraught to say the least. Later, since he is my brother, I asked for his side of the story. He told me that they got high and N said she wasn't in the mood so they just made out. Then he said N offered to give him head and later on (the next morning I think) they had consensual sex. He also told me about the other girl accusing him. He claims that in that situation he was at a house party with his friends and everyone was drinking. He says the girl, who was in a relationship, grabbed HIM inappropriately and nothing else happened because he was there with his friends. He says he thinks someone saw her grab him and she feared they would tell her partner, so she accused him of groping her in order to cover her tracks.

My brother also said that N was falsely accusing him because a few months after their encounter they stopped talking to each other and that he made a comment to his friends that N wasn't as pretty without makeup (which he admitted was a dick move). He says that when N found out about the comment she called him and basically said she'd make him regret it. He also said that he called her after the accusations came out to try and talk to her about what happened and specifically asked her to leave me out of it. That same day I got a message from her asking if he was ok.

My brother and I were raised by a single mom. When she was busy working I took the big sister role and took care of him and made him food. I would dress up as a boy when we were little and pretend to be his big brother because he used to wish he had another guy around. He would cry if he hit me too hard and I started to cry. When I was repeatedly molested on the bus by a classmate in elementary school it was my LITTLE BROTHER who told my mom because I was too scared to do anything about it. The classmate shoved his hands down my pants against my will repeatedly, leaving scratches and bruises. My brother was the reason that boy got in trouble and I was saved from continued harassment.

I did believe N. I tried my best to continue to believe her but so many things about her story seemed suspicious. She claimed my brother was violent and aggressive. Then I learned that she was telling people different details. I questioned, if she really was raped, why she would go out of her way to contact the rapists sister just to ask if the rapist was ok... I know I'm severely biased so I believe my brother is innocent. But at the same time I fear that I may have made the wrong call. I'm tortured by what ifs.

Am I in the wrong for not questioning her story? I know the number of false accusations made against men is super low, so am I blind to think my brother could be falsely accused twice?",31Jul2020,1

100,"Hello! Long read kind of vent....really need help. Ok here I go. 

My parents has been living in this rental for 20 years. During this time, the landlord has stated that he did not want to sell the home. Well he did last year without a will. So the property went to his cousins. 

I told them that they need to find another place to stay after the landlord passed. They said they were going to see if they could buy the home from the family members. The reason why I told them to leave is because their credit is horrible and the income is very low. 

As I thought, they were denied for loans to mortgage the home. Also, I told them it would be ridiculous to buy the home because it needed major repairs and they don’t have the money or time to fix it. 

2 months ago, one of the family members came to appraise the home. They hinted at selling the house. I told my parents again for the second time they need to find a home. So they went to searching and found a home.....well their credit and income is too low to rent a home. 

I told them that they need to look into apartments and they have refused to do that. 

They asked me to be a guarantor for a home and I told them that I am unsure of that. I don’t want them to be homeless but they have a history of not paying things on time. Like now....they owe me $1000 in unpaid bills. 

What do you think I should do? I live 2,000 miles away and can’t help them. I also don’t have the money to take care of myself. 

They want me to be a guarantor for a $1200 home and I don’t even have the funds to make that payment if they don’t pay. My other family members have told them no as well.

101,"This is gonna be long.. long.. long..

i’ll put a TL;DR at the end.


this was a few years ago.. i’d say.. i was 14? 17 now.

They were pretty much saying that i was doing nothing for them, but i’ll get into the details a bit later.

One of them i met at 8-9, a sweet goofing around type of friend, but not the life advice kind, she left for a while until she returned as i made friends with someone totally new to the language of that country, i really wanted to help them and make them feel comfortable. I decided to let them meet eachother and tried to make a friend group so everyone would feel welcomed, something i never had any trouble in myself if it weren’t there, but know that others very much like. And i like to make people happy.

After a year someone new came, we knew them slightly, i decided to put everyone in a group chat including them and just talk a bit, be chill. They ended up saying they were sad never really having friends in school, so again i said: well you dont seem to be any bad whatsoever, would you feel comfy joining our safe little group? 

That was the group, basically, for me it was never a ‘ask for life advice’ type of group, but rather just buddies that make eachother feel comfortable, i didn’t really need it, so i only gave the support, sound like some kind of rehab, but it was all ment in kindness, and i mean look at them now, they fit in like they’ve always wanted, no worries here. it sounds worse then it was.

Now i’ll admit, I was stuck back then though. I was in both a manipulative mentally abusive relationship with my ex at the time and in a home with a mentally and physically abusive stepparent causing me to overreact and seem slightly toxic at times, i could never out myself even in the smallest ways possible.

Though i am someone who shows silently that i give a shit, right, i was saddened that they said i did nothing, i would wait in the rain for them for a long time, i would wait with them for their parents when they lost their keys to their house so they didn’t have to wait alone.. stuff like that, so i disagreed and they put up a bigass dramatic scream fight in the cafeteria where i sat and looked at them with a confusing look on my face. 

Now you can’t blame me here, i am a no bullshit and no drama person, and i’m pretty chill (if i do say so myself) so i felt uneasy with this strange confrontation. 

They’ve never given me any reasons or examples as to what i did that would make them feel like i didn’t care.

But really that was then, this is now. after that confrontation the friendship ended and we just never really talked again. 

It was my first little ‘friend group’ and i had no trouble going back to my own little natural lone wolf habitat, yet i was still confused as these were friends i had alot of fun with at the time, considering what i found ‘fun’ at the time.

though it was a little strange having been the one trying to make the group so that everyone would feel comfy, and then being treated from warm to cold within a day. 

And i’m no bullshitter, i don’t see the use in lying when i say that i genuinly have no idea what happend or what made them react the way they did, they never gave me any examples, i woulda fixed it if they had told me, though i would have distanced myself, since i find reactions like that simply very dramatic and not really a way of looking for any improvement but rather just trying to make a statement that goes nowhere considering the lack of context, for me it wouldnt be worth hanging around those types of people much.

they would pull this type of mean shit very often, anyway, more room for improvement, right?

Alot of people think it’s sad that i’m a lone wolf but it’s fun, i’ve always been and it’s just who i am. I’m not sad, i’m not depressed and i’m not to be worried about, i’m just vibing.

so i just accepted it, i started to only see room to grow as a person.

Altough it didn’t really start until a while after when my ex did some weird shit and prioritized themselves over a visit of my grandparents grave, (i loved my grandparents very much and i still do. )

But i could not leave the phone for they’d threathen me with harming or even killing themselves if i didn’t respond to a text. 

I don’t really see why i gave a shit, me now really would break up on the spot. 

i don’t like bullshit people but at the time i didn’t have time to grow nor see, i wasn’t wearing rose tinted glasses, i was wearing glasses covered with black paint. I could not see shit.

My stepparent had abused me and taught me REAL selfcare wrongly, like how to actually grow. during the breakup, moving away, getting rid of the toxic friends i slowrly but surely got so much room and immedeatly improved to who i am now, i taught myself everything i need by myself and i taught myself some more balls, since honestly, i don’t need a therapist to yell ‘grow balls and you’ll be good’ every week at 6pm, i could do it myself just fine, and i proved that point.

I finally taught myself not only what an argument was, but i found myself again, the self that was repressed by that stepparent, the toxic ex and later the toxic friends ontop of it.

Now, honestly i’m living the life and i strive to learn everyday. 

Not manners, not rules. No. i strive to learn me. That simple. and i will never stop. I simply love it. I love not having to put myself in a box.

Yet the idea of writing each of them a letter has come to me.

because i was still thankful for it, the stupid-funny shit that happend, i spmetimes look back on a joke and i smile, i see it as a memory, good in its past and i donmt miss it, but part of me wants to prove they aren’t a bad guy, atleast in my eyes.

now i don’t care about what people think of me, **am i being ‘too nice’**?? am i forgiving social neglect even though it didn’t really hurt?
why am i doing this?


I’m thankful for the times we did absolute dogshit weird stuff because i dared them all to and even though i’m glad we had all grown apart positively now i want to share that i do not see them as a bad guy in any story and that they maybe have made improvements within themselves and for themselves only, which is why we went apart. 

I was thinking. One last letter of communication to them to let them know that, and that i hope they find whatever ‘It’ is for them.

Now they might have not been the nicest, but for fucks sake i’ve been like this since i was a toddler, way too forgiving, ‘way too nice’ which i don’t specifically agree with vut has been told, and giving people too many chances.

I have moved on, my life has never been better. A letter without the adress it came from wishing them a happy live and a happy after.

i don’t think i’ll ever like them as the people they are no as a friend since we are qua personality very different

They have turned into very populair girls last time i saw them, but now that i have had the oppurtunity to be myself inside out again just like before all the drama i want to share that i simply have no idea what it was about, but that i hope that they find whatever is ‘it’ for them (i’’ repeating myself, sorry).
And that i don’t see them as an enemy but more as a good memory from when i was lost. The little spark was the fun times and i will not remember them for the end of it, but that that would be the last confrontation since we have grown apart.

Part of me thinks that i hope that these are all people that will improve, which really differs per person in my opinion, some do improve, others don’t. ever. and then theres a spectrum of how much they can improve.

The ones that don’t probably end up being karens, anyway.

am i being too kind? am i giving them what they want after ‘so long’?
should i even do it? 

TL:DR 
Why do i, a person that has moved on and improved my life so much that i don’t even reconize who i was when this happend, want to send a letter to my kind-of-mean ex friends wishing them the best?",31Jul2020,1

My charge nurse is a low key racist. I’m in charge of one wing of patients and spend most of my day with them, but if there is any change of conditions or if something significant happens I have to report to her. She has always made little remarks here and there but this time she made one that really upset me. POA of a 99yr old patient accidentally used their father’s(deceased) SS# on her paperwork. Anyways, yesterday she came down upset about it and was telling me about how the insurance told her what was going on and she stated that if she doesn’t have a SS# then she shouldn’t even be in our country.  This really upset me because I am married to a DACA recipient and I know for a fact some of my coworkers are recipients as well.

I have a friend who will message me, then I’ll respond. Then they’ll reply within seconds, and if I continue this conversation without waiting a few minutes, I will have to text them back all day long. Then when I think the conversation is dying down, they’ll START ANOTHER ONE

111,"note; was posted on relationship advice, didnt get many responses

hey everyone, i'm having issues coming to term if i'm  overreacting or being justified at being mad with my parents. lets begin

my parents, in general, are really condesending and don't take me seriously. they don't take me seriously when i bring up my mental health and my dad has said he thinks its all ""mind over matter"". for example when i was around maybe thirteen i expressed to my mom that i maybe had a sugar addiction, she just disregarded it as me being over dramatic and i never brought it up again. i still have an addiction to soda and am overweight, but am trying to lose weight. they also over explain simple topics and which makes me feel stupid. when i expressed the desire to get a tutorl because my grades were bad, my mom said sure, but then never did it.

mental health is a touchy subject in my home. its just, like never brought up and everyone pretends its not a thing, unless my mom complains about her anxiety every once in a while. my mom is definitely bi polar and just doesnt want to get help for it, because she doesnt believe in therapy. i had a mental breakdown in a guidance counselors office when i was in 8th grade and cps was called as a result. my parents treated me like i was a ticking time bomb, like i was about to meltdown and stab them at any moment. i was terrified of being treated like that so when i was taken to a therapy session i just acted fine because i wanted my life to be normal again. never sought help again after that. i expressed to my dad that i have the same anger issues as my mom and the only reason that i dont lash out is because i cant get away with it. my mom could have the biggest bitch fit you ever saw and it would be fine and my dad and i would just sit there and take it (until he got mad enough). however if i raise my voice im told im overdramatic and they tell me to be quiet.

let me just say this; i know i have issues. im suffering as a result because my parents wont help me. i cannot have a serious conversation with them because they want to pretend that they dont have another fucked up kid.

my mom has said if i went to therapy, my dad would be disappointed.
they have casually said shit like that. i will remember those things theyve said for the rest of my life.

funny thing is, THEY dont even remember when they say shit like that. they say im lying.

i feel shit like scratching nails all over me, im anxious  and just feel like im drowning all the time. i have no motivation and goals. i feel like a disapointment and a failure. i feel like im making it all up and that im a fake, dumb spoiled cunt whose making it all up for attention.

i dont feel motivated to go to work and when i come home my dad pesters me when im gonna buy a car and when im gonna help him outside after working 5 days a week.

when i try to take a step forward, like trying to drop soda and switch it with sparkling water. my dad told me if i want to lose weight i should go outside, even though im working the legal maximum for a minor and work 5 days a week. it just makes me feel like wanting to give up, like whatever i do isnt enough.

113,"So I’m gonna keep this short: I had my calc 2 final today. It was 10 questions which was suspect but honestly with a professor who didn’t even make his own videos and used webassign to make his quizzes and his exams I wasn’t *too suprised* So I took the exam, I was done 1.5 hours later, emailed a zip file of my work. No more calc yay! 


I go out with my SO for a few hours. I get home and decided to check my inbox to see if my professor said anything about when grades will be up on admin. Instead, I see a thread of students panicking about getting kicked out of their exam mid-way through. And I have an email of my professor informing me that I “took the wrong exam” he then sent out a 2nd email which stated that the new exam was due at noon tomorrow. 


Here is my problem: I have work at 8am tomorrow. I guess you can argue that I should have planned better. But the class was going to be over by then and that’s why I took the several hour shift. Which I would not be able to feasibly take an exam during. 


Should I email my professor and tell him that the time doesn’t work for me?? I don’t know what to do I’m still in shock. I’ve had professors forget to give access codes to exam procters before, or make substantial mistakes on the exam. But I never had a professor straight up give me and 39 other people the incorrect exam?

116,"I live in an apartment building and my (only) bedroom shares a wall with another apartment's bedroom. The wall is not very good and there are noise and vibrations coming through when the neighbor plays music or TV. I already talked to them and they said they're keeping it low, and the building management says the noise level is acceptable and there's nothing that can be done because the walls are thin.

The noise is indeed relatively low but what really annoys me the most is vibrations - I can feel the music in the wall and floor even. 

I know there's little I can do to absorb outside noise unless a new, soundproofed wall is installed, but that's not an option. 

What's the best way for me to dampen the noise? Would foam panels help even slightly or are they exclusively for noise coming from within the room? Is there anything else I should think about?

I got a ps4 around 2017 and started online gaming. This is where things went downhill. I started to become addicted even MORE than before.

122,"A few days ago we admitted my grandfather (late 80s) to the ER because he hadn’t been able to walk well the previous days and started talking nonsense that morning. After a few days in the hospital we were informed that he had a high fever caused by an infection in the bloodstream, they were unable to pinpoint the cause of this infection though. He was given antibiotics and sent home (this was 3-4 days ago) earlier than they normally would have due to a large amount of COVID-19 cases in the hospital. In the following days we were told to make sure he takes his medicine and then have a physical therapist come by to try to get him back on his feet.

This morning he slipped off the toilet and Potentially hurt his arm. The thing is that it wasn’t exactly noticeable but throughout the day he seemed a bit off at times and I noticed that his arm got progressively worse (went from not being able grip well, to not being able to articulate, not being able to move up and down well) throughout the day. We called a nurse because we were afraid it could’ve been a stroke or something of the like, that’s when we found out that he wasn’t fully there anymore. He knew about COVID and modern events but thought it was 1980. The nurse said it wasn’t a stroke or anything like that and that she thought it was just the infection acting up (he does not have a fever) and advised us to just wait and see. His confusion seems to come and go as a few minutes after the nurse left he was back to acting and talking normally. 

I’m kind of at a loss and would like to hear what you guys think. Could the infection really by what’s causing his current confusion? I know fever does and it explains why he was confused the first time, but would the infection itself be doing this to him now? Could the problem in his arms be involved somehow?

128,"Obvious CW/TW for sexual abuse

When I was in about 1st or 2nd grade, I experienced some sexual abuse(?) at the hands of my step brother at the time (our parents split years ago but they never knew about this)

It was something I always recognized as weird and uncomfortable, although I was never raped and it was never violent exactly..
There would be kissing and touching and him showing me parts of himself or him having us go through the motions of sex/impregnating although fully clothed. 

For so long and even still its hard for me to recognize that as abuse or assault or whatever for a couple of different reasons despite my therapist saying that was abuse. Firstly being that while he was older than me, he was still maybe only in middle school. I don’t think I necessarily understood the impact of sexual encounters in 6th grade, i’m not sure he would have, but i’m also not sure because he was doing it in the first place. He must’ve known something about it.

I remember a couple times saying no or just being weirded out by it all and wanting to like.. go play zoo tycoon or something instead lol but he would push to continue and I always did. It would happen maybe every couple of days or maybe there’d be a couple weeks in between one time and the other but it didn’t go on for very long, maybe 2 or 3 months at most from my memory.

I’ve struggled with intimacy issues for years and after thinking about it a lot recently I wonder if what happened was actually impactful and serious when I really kind of forgot it happened or would just brush it off as “some things that happened”, which is how it got brought up in therapy.

I dont want to go into it/explain it but some people found out last year and they felt I should tell him(??) or tell his dad (my ex step dad, who I haven’t seen or talked to in almost a decade) but idk, idk what that would accomplish or what i’d even say. Idek if what happened is even really “bad”, its all just kinda fuzzy n if anyone has any insight or advice that’d be v helpful.

I dont know if this is important to mention or not but he’s tried to get in touch with me a couple times over the years just to check in I guess. Mostly just to see how life was/how I was doing but he’s never mentioned anything abt what happened, i’m not sure he even remembers tbh.",31Jul2020,1

My biological father has been out of my life since I was a teenager. We reconnected in 2018 for a brief stint and there haven't been in communication since. I recently needed to undergo a background check for a school program, and under the residency history it says I(my full name) resided in my father's state (CO) from 2/20/2020-6/20/2020. I have never resided with my father. He is a diagnosed narcissist and bi-polar. He is very manipulative and will do anything for an extra buck or personal gain, thus the lack of relationship. I am so scared that this popping up is going to ruin my chances with my schooling program or give me problems with the government.

Was thinking earlier about some stuff which happened a few years ago - when my blog was like a lightning rod for idiots and trolls - and just wondered if even one anonymous user having sent one message would've been grounds to tell the police and have them do anything about it?

The message (in the example/s in question) was not threatening or racist, but I would get a tirade of insults mocking my appearance, all in one go. The people in question (inc. myself) were in their late teens, early 20s - if that makes a difference (does it become more / less serious the older / younger you are?)

It was also the case with some of the friends I had on there too (one time a guy had his FB tracked down and the Anon laid into his girlfriend based on the photos they'd seen of her, nothing else)

Don't suppose it matters at this stage, but I am curious for something I'm thinking of writing (not hate mail, dw 🌚). Would also like to know for how best to advise my younger cousins, should they start getting bother there.

Thank you in advance for any input &lt;3 x",31Jul2020,1
134,"Ok so I’m 16f and I’m Wiccan. I’ve been Wiccan for 2 years but I have been unable to do anything about it due to my mom being catholic. She knows absolutely nothing about the religion and says she wants nothing to do with that demon crap. I’m about to lose my shit and go against everything I believe to start some shit. I hate conflict and violence but I’ve been holding a lot in for a while 


The options I looked at:

1. Draw a pentagram in black sharpie on her kitchen counter, take her card and car and just leave. 

2. Draw a pentagram in black sharpie on her wall and wait for her to wake up to we can argue and have her kick me out

3. Paint my room with Wiccan symbols and do as I please without her blessing

4. Do nothing and suppress my feeling until I’m 18 

5. Fuck a bunch on shit up until she calls the police

If you guys have any other options please let me know.

137,"Hello Reddit. 
So I have been working at my current position for the last 3 years. I started from scratch and managed to land a promotion. Thing is I started working while I was very depressed and the job helped me get things straight.

Now my female friend asked me if I can help her get an interview, I agreed and that's all great. My supervisor loved her. The problem lays in that our mutual friends want me to set her bf with an interview. I'd be fine with that but the dude is not nearly qualified for the position and like for the last couple of months has been making fun of my job. Which hit hard considering of the 3 month lockdown we had here. 

So would I be a bad friend if I said no? I know that I will get our friends and maybe her furious but if he fucks up the job that will get me in trouble with my supervisor.",31Jul2020,1

However, my parents aren’t allowing it because family of ours who live far got COVID and now my parents are paranoid. I understand the reasoning, but my friend and his family recently(2 days ago) got tested and all came out negative. So the argument there doesn’t make sense, but still they don’t care.

139,"Two Thursdays ago, my mother suffered a stroke.  They released her to us (somewhat prematurely) the following Tuesday.  Two days later (last Thursday), she suffered a second stroke.  This stroke was accompanied by an infection that prevented them from treating the stroke until today.

We're going in to meet with the doctor tomorrow (despite COVID) and to see her, to whatever extent she's even conscious.  Today, the doctor called us to tell us about a few possible futures for her.  I think my dad (who ultimately gets to make the decision) is close to giving up.  I still think there's a chance.

So, if you've ever dealt with the direct care of stroke patients, I have two questions: (1) What do you wish you would have asked the doctor during the early stages of recovery? (2) What sorts of questions might I ask to give my dad hope?

155,"Hello everyone,

I just want to start this off saying I'm a liberal. I've always had been and I really hate president Trump with a passion, or that I've been surrounded by people that are for Trump, Trump radicals. I'm living with them, too. They're my parents.

Basically, I believe that I am deeply in some weird manipulative house hold that expects me to support Trump, but instead they would just throw flairs at me. My father requires that my Mom not 'butt in' when my dad is yelling at me, and I'm afraid that it will turn into physical abuse sometime. They're both in the their upper 60's.

I feel deeply concerned for my well being and at this point I don't really know what to do, or what to live for. I feel deeply distraught all the time just living here and going to work, because no one seems to understand the level of abuse I have going on at home.

I just don't know what to do, I thought I would have a good life, but I can take it I believe by just staying in my room and getting my LPN license. I don't mean to sound like the victim here, but it's honestly I guess I just need to vent. I'm working on it.

How do I cope in the mean time? I'm living in another state away from them, and they mentioned if Biden wins they won't know what they're going to do. I fear I will need to move out sooner rather than later, as my classes are this Fall and I suppose I should just save up money.

I'm currently in Arizona, and I feel by moving down here, asking if it was okay to do that, they agreed and said it was okay, that I would be fine. But it's come to a lot of factors. I suppose I also do mentioned my distaste of Trump on a semi-regular basis, but I was curious if anyone has any pointers?",31Jul2020,1

But every time I spoke with him I felt like he didn’t really enjoy talking with me so I started to keep a distance from him to prevent myself from getting hurt emotionally. Then I blocked him from every social media from absolutely nowhere. I did this because I felt like he really didn't like me, and I wanted to protect myself.

I cried for 3 days straight cause that's how much he meant to me. You see I've always had trouble getting friends and I've never really felt that I can have someone to talk to and I blocked the one person that I actually enjoyed talking to, for like real.

Months past by and I decided to re-add him on Snapchat, he added me back but didn't write anything to me, which I expected. After a while, I sent him voice memos when I was drunk, I got no response back. 

Now I've gone through our old texts and I don't wanna make a dramatic conclusion but I think he liked me. He called me cutie and silly multiple times, he was kind giving me encouragement. I remember mentioning that I made noodles once, then a couple of days after when I was asking him what he was doing he said that he was making noodles. This could be just be a coincidence. 

I remember telling him once that I felt imposing  when talking to him and if I didn’t wanna speak with me I could say it, to which he responded that he felt like he was the one who felt imposing and wanted to give me space.

What I really wanna say is that I want to start talking with him again, and I know what I did was a shitty thing, to block him. Cause if he really was interested in me and I just blocked him I guess I was hurt too. But I don’t know what to say to him please help what do I say to him?",31Jul2020,1

163,"So, sorry if this post is a mess, I’m not very articulate with writing, but anyways,

I feel like I have no autonomy. I feel like I’m not allowed to control my own time. I think I’ll start this off by showing the hard rules 

-be up by 8:00 (used to be 10:00, then 9, and now 8)

-make or help with breakfast and cleanup

-minimum 8 hours of housework per day

-help with supper, do all cleanup afterwards including washing tables, counters, and floors 

-if I do all that and make little to no mistakes, and there isn’t anything extra for me to do, I can have my hobbies for a bit

- in bed by 11 (used to have none, then 12, now 11)

So that’s the basic rules, but if I want to do anything, go anywhere, see anyone I have to ask their permission first and take my phone which has a tracker. I am not allowed to argue or (make excuses) if I do wrong or disagree.

I honestly don’t know, I’ve been trying harder and harder to be more responsible and not mess up hoping that these restrictions will be lifted, but they seem to be getting worse and worse while they tell me I’m so mature, yet also say I’m a slob and unemployable. 

I want to have a good relationship with them, I want to get along with them, but every time things seem to ease a little they just tighten more, and I get mad, and they tell me I’m being immature. 

I’m sorry if this is an incoherent ramble but I don’t know what to do or how to feel.

165,"A few months ago I consulted a Covid mental health guide and saw a post about counselling for LGBT youth, which is my demographic. I signed up and eventually got a counsellor. I had seen the organization name before from a time where I had gone to a mental health hospital in crisis and they gave me a sheet of resources so I didn’t think a lot about it.

I realized after a few sessions that they mostly work with much more vulnerable people than me, they serve pretty at risk people / homeless queer folk and I’m doing okay, employed and housed. I have been looking for queer specific and age specific resources for a while but I know I’m not what they’re there to support.

I’ve found the counselling sessions useful and no counsellor I’ve seen before has had any sensitivity training for queer people but I feel really guilty using them and I feel dumb for not doing more research. The content I saw in the Covid document and linked fb info emphasized them offering counselling during Covid so I can see how I made the mistake. 

I don’t even want to talk about it to the counsellor because I feel so dumb and uncomfortable. Even making this post i feel bad that other people will read it, like I’m so embarrassed but genuinely unsure what to do. The counsellor is aware of my education background and job and hasn’t said anything to me about not being allowed to use the service so I’m wondering if it’s up to me. 

I feel like I’ve done a pretty serious mistake, I feel really distraught.

I will definitely donate to the organization now, and would continue to regardless of if I use their services.

166,"Using a throw away account. I'm just feeling so lost and need to talk. Better yet if someone else can listen and provide their thoughts.

I feel like I missed life as a child and teenager. My entire life feels like it's been ruined in tiny ways by my parents' divorce and both of their personalities.

The divorce took all my family's money.

My dad is fucking insane and manipulative, he's played mind games with me until I feel extremely messed up in the head. I can't tell whether I'm normal or not. As a kid he yelled at and scared off my friends and their parents, and I was known as 'weird' for that.. and my race. My mom isn't fully black or white so neither am I. To be short- I was in an all white school and kids and teachers pointed me out. I remember a specific teacher pointing me out when we discussed slavery in America and made a comment about my race (No pioneers looked like her, though) Killed my self esteem.

Anyway my dad has gaslighted the hell out of me and occasionally physically hurt me or attempted to. He liked to trap me on long car rides and run my mind in circles until I cried. Once I remember asking him to please let me out so I can walk home.. Instead he slowed down and tried to push me out of the car, but since there aren't any other witnesses and he's better at manipulation, he insists I tried to jump. I feel like I can't believe my mind anymore.

I've basically developed selective amnesia from 16-20 because of him.

My mom's also sort of manipulative. I've never been able to talk to her seriously. She gets mad at me for showing any sign of emotion, and acts extremely annoyed when I needed anything. I stopped asking for anything. Even a ride- and stayed out of her way but at this point I feel more like a ghost than a person. She's also extremely sheltering and starts yelling at me, crying, and playing with my mind if I even hint about wanting to move out. She yells at me and calls it betrayal.

Eventually my dad managed to evict his own family and from 20 to 23 I lived in a hotel room with my mom. I was in college but we drove really far that day and ended up in a hotel across the state. I missed my finals and got put on academic probation, now it's a mess and I owe the school $2000 for my transcript, now full of F's, if I ever want to even try to get a degree.

Retail stole my soul. I'd rather die than go back. Dealing with engry customers nearly gives me PTSD of my dad being angry and 'always right'.

I'm 23 now. I'll be 24 in 2 months. We finally got out of the hotel but I still live with my mom. We've saved up a lot of money since and I plan on paying off the $2000.

It makes me so sad that I'm old though. I haven't done a lot of things. I've never been on a vacation or even to a concert, because my mom wouldn't drive me and the closest ones were hours away- I didn't even ask to borrow the car. Not to mention she wouldn't be happy with my music tastes.
I feel disgusted that I'm basically still a trapped kid. Teenagers have done more stuff than I have and aren't afraid to anger their parents. I still am, because my parents are scary and unpredictable. The only time I feel like a proper adult is when she leaves me at home for days or weeks and I can do whatever.

I forgot to mention that my dad stole a lot of my personal documents when he made us leave. I can sometimes get away with flashing my 2016 license but I'm scared. It's been hard to get one without a proper address then hard to get one with Coronavirus. Tbh coronavirus feels like it's just trapped me all over again.

I just feel like I'm plain naive and ruined my life. I have absolutely no friends anymore. 
I feel too old to go back to school and finish my degree. I wanted to be a biologist but now I'm interested in conservation, ecology or teaching, I thought about going over to Canada because it's cheaper and I've always wanted to travel up there.

But at this point I feel too old for everything. Especially after moving I don't care anymore. I shower every day and work out, run, but I think my mind is broken. It doesn't feel anything. I don't care about conversations anymore. I don't care about anything. 

I used to be so passionate about getting my degree, now I'm not. I think it started last year. Last winter I decided I was going to freeze myself. I never did but the thought got so intrusive I didn't trust myself anymore walking from work and quit my job.
Suicide has been on the table since then. Instead of by cold, I think about ordering some bottles or nitrite off the internet or driving to Oregon and try to get my hands on seconal. Why not.

I've fucked up my life. Gone absolutely doomer. Tired of the fuckups. Tired of being useless. I hate how inexperienced I am at this age, it's a shame that I can't get on my feet. I feel like I missed the world before everyone got crazy, technology got crazy, before climate change seemed real and people are talking about mass immigration and shit. Even if I get out, I'm at the bottom of the ladder in a recession.
 It's painful being trapped and alone. Who would want to associate with a piece of trash like me? I wish I could get this shit called life over with quickly.",31Jul2020,1

He said well why wouldn’t I like it and he said he was sure it wasn’t as bad as I thought it was. So I sent the pic. 

And he didn’t like it. He first didn’t say anything. So I was like you don’t like it? And he tried to sugarcoat it by saying that he isn’t looking for perfection and that it was confident of me and confidence is sexy. 

But he obviously didn’t like the pic. And when I asked him if he liked the pic itself or just that I was confident enough to send it. He didn’t reply so I felt bad and just told him not to worry about it. And then he replied that he thinks we should just not talk about it anymore. 

Well since then I’ve been crying my eyes out. And idk what to do to feel better. I feel awful and I feel stupid for thinking he would like my photo. I’m way too fat to be sending something like that. And I should have just never sent it. It’s been over 24 hours and I still feel devastated. Idk what to do to feel better. 

If anyone wants to talk to me that would be nice cause I don’t have anyone to talk with about this. If you have any advice on what to do would be nice too. 

Thank you!

169,"First and foremost, I’m sorry if this post is messy. I’ve never really asked for advice about something like this and I’m not entirely sure where to start. 

So, I grew up with my friend T for most of my childhood. We were best friends throughout high school, and friends for our first year of college though we attended school in different states. We connected extremely well, and I genuinely believed our friendship would be lifelong. I thought really highly of her, and honestly I probably depended on her attention a bit too much. I really wanted to be prioritized by her as much as she was prioritized by me. It’s likely, though, that that was the case from the beginning and I fucked up by believing otherwise. 

We had this other friend, S, who was really terrible to me. She would constantly belittle me every chance she got. I’d always cry in my car on the way home because of how small she made me feel. She’d make passive aggressive remarks about my artistic abilities to make hers seem better, my looks, my style, my academic tendencies, she would indirectly claim that my disordered eating was attention seeking, and actively exclude me from meetings in extracurriculars then sort of shame me for not doing enough. It had a serious impact on my self esteem. I would occasionally mention it to T, but never in detail. i.e I’d say something along the lines of “S has been kind of passive aggressive to me lately for literally no reason?” and T would respond with something like, “what the hell, that’s so weird.” That was the recurring conversation, so I’m not sure she really knew how much it affected me. 

This is where I messed up. My resentment for T started to grow after we graduated and attended university in different places. S and I unfortunately ended up at the same place, and I was stuck with her since we share the same interests. Mostly I could get by without having to interact with her, but in some cases it was unavoidable. It was daunting and exhausting; I would notice that T interacted with S a lot more on social media than with me, and I took it personally. Most of her moral choices, I also took personally. T and I lived very different lifestyles at this point; I was in massive debt and fell into a huge depression because of my academic stress, and her parents paid for her out of state classes that she would choose to frequently skip so she could drink. I stayed silent as opposed to addressing my concern for her, and my resentment began to build even further. T ended up developing an eating disorder, and I felt for her completely, but seeing S act super supportive to her for something she belittled me for made my blood boil. I know that it wasn’t T’s fault at all, but I was so hurt and so angry that I acted rashly. The boiling point for me was witnessing T praise S for being such an amazing friend when S was feeling low, meanwhile I was drowning and T didn’t say a word. I kind of lost it, and removed them both on all social media in an impulsive rage. I think it was just painful for me to see the person I considered my best friend treat such a toxic person in my life with more kindness than which she treated me. 

After everything, she confronted me about blocking her, and I backpedalled and froze. I told her it was nothing personal and that I needed time away from social media, and she knew it was complete bullshit. She was hurt that I cut her out, seemingly out of the blue, and called me out me for not communicating. She was absolutely right, but even still, I couldn’t express how I felt and continued to tell her that my decision had nothing to do with her. At the end of our argument, she asked me if I considered her my friend or not, and I told her that I valued her and it was her choice. Since then, we haven’t spoken. A year or so passed, and after everything settled, I barely thought of her at all until now. 

Here’s where I need advice. I tweeted some irrelevant joke yesterday, and since we have a couple of mutual followers, she ended up seeing it and liking it. I’m not sure if she realized it was me that made the post or not, but seeing her name pop up on my phone made me curious to see how she was doing. I checked her profile to see what she has been up to, and after having not talked for nearly two years, it made me reflect on my actions and acknowledge that I was in fact, in the wrong. I realize that there is no way she could have possibly known what was going on without me telling her, and she must have been so hurt and confused for me to drop her out of nowhere at a difficult part of her life. I want to apologize genuinely and sincerely for my actions, for cutting her off without warning and for sucking at communicating, but I don’t want to reopen old wounds, or seem like I’m justifying what I did when really I just feel she deserves an explanation. I’m not sure if it’s too late, or if it would make her angry to even hear from me. I want her to know that I’m genuinely sorry and I don’t expect anything of her in return, but even thinking about reaching out to her terrifies me. 

So, what should I do? Do I apologize to her, or just accept that I fucked up and continue to learn from my mistakes?

TLDR; I cut off my best friend because I let my resentment build for her instead of communicating. After years, I realize she deserves an apology but I have no idea how to go about it or if I should even reach out.",31Jul2020,1

171,"Mmk so i stared vaping abt a week(?) ago- i’m 13. i don’t believe i’m addicted yet due to the fact i can go over a day or two without wanting it. But i don’t want to 1: Get caught 2: Get extremely addicted bc i don’t have the money for that.... But it genuinely is calming. And there’s nothing else that is currently relieving my constant stress besides my music and sleep. and i’m slowly growing tired of both. I also feel like i can peacefully be in my dream like state without having a panic attack while doing so. (i always feel like my mind is away from me but my body is still in tact). Self Harm is another way i can go about it, but for obvious reasons, i can’t keep cutting. i’m running out of spaces that can be hidden. I’m not looking for anyone to fuss at me...i’m just looking for genuine advice as on what to do.

172,"I’ve recently started spending more time with an old acquaintance of mine (we’ve known each other since fifth grade, but we aren’t that close) because we decided to take the same summer class together. Before this class, I’ve almost never hung out with her one-on-one before.

Fast forward to now: we see each other twice a week, and we also hang out (in a group) after class due to mutual friends. After spending more time with her, I realized that she is *so* negative to the point that it’s irking . For example, the first thing that she told me after we haven’t seen each other in over a year was “you bring out the worst in this [mutual friend]” (context: we were hanging out in a group and I was innocuously joking around, which prompted my other friend to laugh, and my negative friend told us we are “out of control”). The atmosphere became kinda awkward and tense...I just feel like the way she made that comment was so rude and inconsiderate, even though her intent may not have been malicious.

Her insulting remarks got worse as time progressed. I realized that when she is in a group hangout, she is very quiet and reserved. However, when alone, she is super pessimistic. As we started seeing each other more (due to class), she would repetitively criticize the clothes I wear; she told me how she doesn’t like my shirt’s material, how she thought my tote bag was ugly, and made snide remarks about how I wear sandals daily (to my defense, it’s 40c where I live). In my past 22 years, *none* of my friends have criticized what I wore like how she did (I actually dress quite decently). Also, when we eat together, and I eat something she doesn’t like (she’s a really picky eater), she’d always say “ew that tastes so bad, why would anyone order that”. 

We are 22 y/o college grads now, but why is she acting like such a middle school tyrant? It’s starting to get really annoying, and I’ll be stuck in the same class with her for almost an entire month. It’s not like I can run away because we have so many mutual friends and we are in the same class. I just feel like she doesn’t have any social manners. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with her excessive negativity? (for context, she criticized my bag today, and I made clear that I didnt like what she said, but she didn’t seem to get it— she just kept on criticizing my bag even more.)",31Jul2020,1

174,"Third party pest control guy to be specific, large apartment complex. I left my apartment to go get some food, came home and realized someone had been in the house.

176,"I have no issue with him inviting his friends, it’s his birthday he can do what he wants I just want advice on how to approach the situation best. 

One of my (17M) bestfriends is turning 18 soon and hes asked our small group of close friends to get food with him or something else and we all agreed. He just told me today he invited some other people and most his friends are nice guys I jsut don’t speak to them a lot but the one friend he said is one of the few people I despise in this world. 

All I know about this guy is he severely bullied my cousin both verbally and physically. My cousin got to the point where his doctor said due to his mental health he had to leave school TWO years early. He caused my cousin to be so fucking depressed and I didn’t know it was going on because my cousin was just so terrified of them getting in trouble. That was 3 years ago now sure but I can’t forgive him because the school didn’t punish him or anyone else involved. They thought it was resolved because my cousin left.

Just today I was playing a game online with my best friend and this guy joins and we talk and it’s okay. He talks about his old friends and how they were awful and what they did to him and then added a part about “Im a hypocrite though I’ve treated people like shit a lot but whenever it went too far I’ve tried to fix it and I’m trying to stop doing that shit nowadays.” He doesn’t know Ik what he did to my cousin but he seemed genuine when he said he was trying to change.

Im worried about being face to face with him though. Idk how I will manage. All I’ll see when I see him is my cousin, hating himself and in pain and wanting to fucking die. My aunt struggling I get him the help he needs and struggling to speak to him. My cousin being so filled with anxiety about people using his words against him that he can’t even tell me how he is when I visit him. 

I don’t want to cause trouble at my best friends birthday and ruin his day but I don’t think I can enjoy if I have to spend time with this guy.

178,"I’m a college student deciding if I should stay home and do classes virtually. Or go back to school in person and do classes virtually on campus. 

So basically my parent is emotionally and verbally abusive to me. I can’t really do anything about it because culturally I can’t overstep boundaries. Anyways...if I stay home and do virtual classes I will save money. But I go to school I will have to pay for housing. Which should I do? 

If I stay home I’ll be here with the abusifs parent until January. I know it will be hell because I don’t think my parent likes me at all. They physically hurt me too but I can’t do anything about it because it’s “their culture”. 

If I got back to on campus housing, I will be away from the parent but I will also have to pay for on campus housing. 


TLDR: should I stay home and do virtual classes with my abusive parent. Or should I go do In person classes on campus away from them even though it’s expensive?

188,"Context: she’s in a relationship with him because he’s the father of her child. They have been together off and on for a long, long time. She’s smoking hot and she messaged me out of the blue one night. We had slept together one night a few years ago, and the sex was really good. Turns out she had been thinking about it. Then shortly after she messaged me, one thing led to another, and I had the absolute best sex of my life.

The passion is so intense. I’ve never desired someone this much in the bedroom. But she’s also really fun to be around. I like talking to her. We chatted for nearly 5 hours the other night. We’re sexual, but we’re also very affectionate with each other. Think good morning and goodnight texts with lots of heart and kissing emojis. Things are getting very deep and I’m feeling this attachment grow between us. We’re practically inseparable.

This has all happened in the span of a week. I have slept around a lot, and I haven’t felt this close to anyone ever. I didn’t even like my gf this much when I was in my last relationship.

I then had a text message from one of his friends saying that our relationship was toxic and that we should move on (our relationship isn't toxic, we both have mental health issues but we help each other and make each other happier) and then i asked one of his other friends (who is my friend too) if my boyfriend was still with him (because my boyfriend just hung up and i was worried about his safety because he was really upset) and his friend said he was, but later texted me saying ""yeah i lied i know i'm normally nice but he's my friend and you're on his back"" and after he said that he has been ignoring me to this day.

Do you have any advice for someone who's going to turn 18 soon and is still in high school for getting their first apartment? 

Ok so, here's a story part, might not all be relevant so sorry if I end up rambling. 

Little info for on me, at the time of the part that I'm going to say rn, my mom hasn't been in my life to much because of drugs but had barely started being clean after years of rehab and is living with friends I believe. All other family I was close to was dead or were my siblings whom out of 15,i lived with 4,my sister and the 3 kids my dad had with his gf over the 3 years they were together (talk about a weak pull out game) 

So me and my girl friend have both been kicked out of our homes. Me was because my dad is to be honest, a shitty parent and bad with money. We got kicked out our apartment because he spent the money(has just got income tax) on stupid things. Like I'm talking inflatable pig and T-rex costumes for him and his gf, and buying all her kids and her a lot of shit, he had a really bad paying job and so we were in housing and food stamps and once we got money for once he was stupid with it, so then when that happened he and his gf and her kids went to go stay somewhere, and me and my sister aka the kids that don't belong to his girlfriend he just abandoned us.This was March 2019.Forgot to mention I was 13 when that happened, and my sister 14.I turned 14 that April and she turned 15 that March.She ended up getting pregnant from the person she had to get stay with and I had to stay with my grandma(dad side,one from mom side killed herself 2 years prior) for a few month(Horrible greedy money hungry person and they had me slaving around 24/7 being they're personal maid and stuff) then after that I was fortunate enough to stay with my grandpa(mom side of family, one from dad side left when my dad was born) and he had just recovered from stage 4 thyroid cancer, I was there for a few months but had to leave because he ended up getting cancer again(3rd time, first time was his liver) and this time it was worse, he was already in bad shape from the previous one. He had multiple cancerous spots on his legs, chest and neck. By cancerous spots I mean that he had cells there that had mutated to cancer cells. And he ended up dying, so I had to come back down to where I was, and I stayed with my friend for a bit. Got kicked out in June of this year. Wasn't mad bc they let me be there for so long. Go live with my grandma again, but this time my dad and his gf and her kids, and as you'll see in this next part, my gf comes and moves in about a week later. Sister doesn't live there as that time she's 16 and living with her bf and 8 months pregnant (they're relationship is toxic, he always cheats, she wants to get out but is forced to stay because she has nowhere to live) 

Now here we got to my gf, shorter story, her mom left when she was born, ended up wanting the kids later on, gets dad deported so she can get kids all to her self, time passes and yeah.

Now that you're a bit more caught up on her ig, we'll start when she gets with me, it's September 2019,im 14,shes 16(I was 6'3 and looked much older and she was 5'2 and looked much younger, plus she's more childish and I'm way more mature due to past which we'll not get into so the age difference doesn't really bother anyone or affect us at all at that time)
So she was living with her mom, her siblings and her creepy and controlling step dad. 
Her step dad and tried to get in bed with her, touch her, watch her change and a lot of stuff and had cheated on the mom, hits her brother bad, shitty parent to his kids and what not. 
That November she turned 17.
Time goes by, she continues to deal with her situation, I end up getting sick really bad, doctors say it was early covid. Time goes by more and I turned 15 that April and got better too. In May she and her brother and sister that lived with her went on a vacation to her aunt in Wisconsin (we live in Texas) things happen and the aunt ends up trying to keep them alot.Ends up letting my gf come back but not her siblings. The mom couldn't call the cops because the aunt would call cps and the mom knows that wouldn't got well for her plus the step dad convinced her to let the aunt keep the kids and convincing her to not let my girlfriend back home either(it's June 2020 by this time). So my girlfriend comes to be with me at my grandma's. It's the end of June, once July started this month we've spent over $1,500 with rent and food and stuff combined, wasted all the money we've had saved up and everything, my dad pays rent here too, but he just got a job, he's been paying his rent with the money my mom pays for child support for me and my sister. 
I left out a lot of details but me and my girlfriend only have until November (when she turns 18)to be here, after that we have to go get our own apartment (I'll be 15 still then) and here it's impossible to find a job that hires under 16,been looking for since I was 14 for a Job that would hire me when I was 15 but no luck, I have to wait till I'm 16,not even Mc Donald's would, I've tried every location within a 10 mile radius. 

A little time line since this is all over the place
March 2019-Got kicked out/went to stay with grandma
April 2019-turn 14
June 2019-went to stay with grandpa
September 2019-get with gf who is with her mom at the time and I move back down and now we live in the same city, I live with friends
November 2019-grandpa dies/gf turns 17
June 2020-get kicked out of friends (wasn't mad, they let me be there for so long) /gf gets kicked out/we move into my grandma's. 

I apologize for all this extra info, have a lot on my mind, I can't work, my gf is, we'll barely have any money saved up by November, just enough for a down payment, we have no choice but to get an apartment, we have no where else to go. 

Do you have any advice for us?",31Jul2020,1
201,"I dont know why but I MUST, have my room look and feel immaculately clean. It has to be litterally perfect. I'm talking dusting, cleaning the baseboards, vacuuming behind the bed, clothing organized by color. Which dosen't sound like much I guess but I have to clean the area multiple times to feel ok.

Thing is, I noticed a water stain on my matress when doing my laundry and taking the sheets off. It upset me so much without thinking I put a bleach mixture on it. When that didnt do it I used shout and baking soda and water.

My room reaks of ammonia now and I'm on my third day of not sleeping in my bed. Today I have tried to put baking soda on it and let it sit over night and vaccum it up.

No matter how hard I try to clean this matress though, even when I do get the smell out my room just feels dirty if that makes sense? Like I dont wanna walk on the carpet even though I vacuumed 3 times cause oh there might be hair or dead skin there, but this behavior is only for my room.

Can someone please tell me how to ease my anxiety when it comes to having a clean room.",31Jul2020,1

203,"Hi everyone, wanted to hop on here as i needed advice on somthing pretty major. My best friend is has been getting drunk every single weekend to the point where she doesnt remember what she is doing and starts to get withdrawals from the alcohol. Just last time, she was drunk for 4 days straight and ended up having bad withdrawals and shakes from the alcohol. 

Ive mentioned it to her before but she just brushes it off and says “ it’s summer “ and acts like its no big deal. Also her mother doesnt seem to care much and im getting worried because she is drawing my brother into it and he gets drunk with her and her brother and his friends every weekend.  ive tried to talk to my other friend about it but she doesnt see anything wrong with it and just uses the same excuse of “ it’s summer who cares” I’m just worried as a friend that this turns into alcoholism and she becomes like her uncle who is an alcoholic. 

Also, i’ve seen that she gets annoyed whenever i try to tell her anything about her drinking and acts like its no big deal but im just worried about her and dont want her life to spiral out of control and for her to potentially influence my brother.
  
Any advice would be great",31Jul2020,1
204,"AH! OKAY! So I’m a 17 year old Female, and I’ve had eating problems since 2015 or maybe even sooner. I finally recognized it a year ago and have been trying to get better. I wanna eat healthier and more.

Extra read: I have digestive problems and trying to figure out what I can’t have. This has caused me to be scared to eat. At first it started with me not wanted to hit puberty. I heard lack of eating stopped periods. In the end it didn’t work. I tried to get back into eating because I didn’t wanna live like that anymore since it wasn’t working and I knew I’d have to get worse for it to work and didn’t wanna go down that rabbit hole.


I started having horrible digestive problems that I don’t wanna go into detail with. At first I thought it a fairly allergy, but now I’m thinking it might be gluten. We did blood work a year ago and they found nothing. I’m gonna go back again to get checked out since it’s really unhealthy.


Since we’ve all been home for months I wanted to start working on exercising. I used to do dance and everything before. Since I’ve been home I realized how much more I ate because of school. I’m losing energy fast and I want to gain weight to get in better shape. My mom does this diet where you eat a certain amount of food, no bread, lots of meat (I don’t like meat, I’m not a vegetarian, I’m just not a fan) and try to burn all that just gained weight and calories to turn it into muscle. I wanna do that.


A problem is I don’t like admitting I have a problem. My mom has realized I’m definitely too thin, my friends have realized I’m too thin, and I don’t want to tell them they’re right. I’m too stubborn. I also don’t want them to worry. I know I can do it on my own, but I need someone else who knows what to do to help me. Where do I start? What’s the best way to go about it? I know that if anyone actually reads this I’ll be told to tell people, but I’m trying to avoid that. I hate the attention, and someone in my friend group even lied about having problems for attention, so it doesn’t seem safe to bring up. I also used to be very suisidal, and my friends know that. I’m no longer, and in a much better mind set, but I don’t want them to think I’ve gone back to that either.

205,"Ever since I turned 19 my parents have brought the subject of marriage up multiple times with indirect hints (i picked on this after a few times). Recently however they have been pushing strong with the subject will bring it up ever chance they see. For example just recently, my parents and I were cleaning a room and they found my old toys. They were like you wont need to buy toys for your kids anymore cause you have a lot or just tonight they were talking this girl they know that is looking get married soon. 

I am only 20 and I have a whole life ahead of me.  I'm in university doing my undergrad and then heading to law school to study contract, tort, and real estate law. What is freaking me out is that I know I will have to pull loans for law school. But my parents want me to start a family all awhile studying, and I'll end up relying heavily on credit for A LOT of things, which will set me back more on my investment goals and career. I have goals and aspirations to do many things before I settle down like travel. 

Every time they bring it up, I  will do one of these:

\- Get up and leave the room feeling uncomfortable and stressed 

\- Eyeroll 

\- Ignore them for the rest of the day

I realize that some of this could communicate that I am shy or embarrassed about the topic cause I am interested. However,  it is quite the opposite; I get mad, or frustrated. Its gotten to the point where I won't talk to them about my personal life and whats going on. I find that it making me more distant cause my parents still do not understand my goals. I have expressed multiple times I would like to invest my money into stocks and real estate, but they would respond with that it would be better to use it towards a wedding. THIS LITERALLY FRUSTRATES ME. 

How do I get them to stop talking about the subject of marriage and having grand kids? (I get their excitement), but I am personally not ready for that kind of stuff. Their comments make me feel like some kind of baby maker for them and that's my only purpose. I will also mention that we are an Indian family, so marriage is big deal in our culture, however I have no interest and don't plan until on getting married until around late 30's.",31Jul2020,1
206,"I’m stressing out really badly right now. So I was molested and raped when I was 5 years old by my older brother’s friend, who was 16 at the time and was frequently at my house. 

Well, I’m currently 20 years old &amp; took a few gap years after high school. I’m just now starting college and was really excited. I’ve learned that the person who did this to me attends the same college. However, he is a junior in the computer science program whereas I’m in the STEM program, so it’s unlikely that we’ll have classes
together. 

However, the thought that I’m going to be on the same campus as this person is so fucking nerve wracking and terrifying. And stressful. It’s not that big of a campus either. If I see this person I don’t know what I will do. I just know I’ll freak the fuck out. I don’t know if I’ll just fucking attack him, if I’ll go into a panic attack, a combination of both, I have no idea. 

Please tell me what to do. Should I come forward to the university about it? The incident was reported to the police about a year after it happened so I can probably provide proof to the college if they need it, I’ll just have to badger the police department I guess. he had done the same to three of my friends and one of them had said something about it to their parents, so there was an investigation, however he never served jail time due to being a minor. 

Please, please help. What can I do. I already have waited so long to go to college, and this person has already taken so much from me.

I have vomited twice. First time because I forced it with two fingers. I felt so awful from the alcohol. Second time was natural but i wasnt prepared and now I got a food piece stuck in my throat. I have tried drinking it down with water or coughing and it doesn’t move away.

A few times I’ve stepped in it and it pissed me off. Today I almost slipped not seeing the piss. I yelled her name and told her I’m kicking her out if her dog doesn’t stop.

The owner has never expressed any form of gratitude (or whatever they’re supposed to feel) towards them, almost treating them like they are scum and basically just picking on Jane and their family. The owner has been especially toxic during these past few days bc i think Jane has taken a bit longer than expected to move out.
Last night, the owner came in and just started yelling at them bc they had a mess in the house still which was barely anything—the owner was exaggerating and wanted the house vacated already. The owner kept yelling and insulting told Jane that the house needed to be left exactly the way they came in (which was in the same mess as it was now and with the grass and weeds grown out) and that they had to mow the lawn before they left. Jane didnt take any of her bullshit anymore and clapped back and the owner looked so outraged it was comical bc the owner started losing their shit and cursed out the top of their lungs and the last thing they said was, “i expect the key first thing tomorrow in the mailbox”.

Here’s the thing, I’m 23 and just feel ready. My partner and I are engaged and have been together for nearly 8 years (since high school). This year we purchased a unit together and have a lot of savings. We know what we are doing but don’t feel supported to go ahead with our plans.

215,"Today just reminded me how distant and upsetting my relationship with my father is.  We rarely get into fights but when they do happen, they are awful.  He even smashed my cellphone once and broke the glass screen protector because I was ""disrespecting"" him (I wasn't).  Mind you, his anger issues have declined in comparison to how he used to be.  That's only due to the fact that he's been arrested in the past and doesn't want to risk anything again but we don't need to go over that ridiculous story.  


Anyway, today I asked my dad for a small favor and he acted like I put him at a huge inconvenience. Usually he leaves for work at 9:25AM.   There's absolutely no problem if he could just drop me off my doctor's appointment set for 9:30 because it is literally on the way.  So then he starts stressing himself about needing to leave earlier.  My mom told him to relax and he proceeded to raise his voice at her, which I fucking detest.  That was when I said I would just take the bus because things started getting heated for no logical reason.

I should mention that I almost never ask for rides; I try to be mindful that people have a life and have shit to do.   Still, it bothers the hell out of me how my dad doesn't seem to mind giving his co-workers a ride home but when I ask it's too much for him to handle.  I hope I'm not coming off like I'm overreacting but it's the idea that he doesn't seem the slightest bit inclined to help me, even though I never ask for anything.  

( BTW, I'm in the process of paying for college so buying a car during a pandemic is out of the question)

I sense that he feels like he owes me nothing, especially because he's my family's only source of income at the moment.  He frequently reminds us how he's the one that pays the bills, subtly guilting us for not being as productive as him with a job.  As if there isn't a pandemic and lack of job openings.

I admit, I'm not a perfect daughter.  I don't ever try to make conversation with him unless I'm in a really good mood.  But after years of verbal abuse and witnessing his alcoholism get worse, what else can be expected?  

I don't just want to list the negative things either.  We go on bike rides/runs when we can, and we sometimes share laughs about dumb things. But there's so much emotional trauma that makes me overlook those things.  


I didn't know where else to vent about this.  Sometimes I feel like I can't tell my own best friend about these issues. She texts my dad every so often (he's been trying to help her learn a language), which highkey bothers me as well.  The fact that he's more outgoing with other females, such as his co-workers and even my best friend, really hurts.

My (18) old friend, who I'm going to call A, was my closest friend for 3 years from 8th grade through my sophomore year of high school. Calling him a manipulative narcissist probably sounds like pretty strong wording, but it gives you an idea. 


I've always had low self esteem, but A took it to a new level. I was wrapped around his finger and he got everything he wanted from me. He said nasty things about my other friends and had me convinced that he was doing me a favor by loving me despite who I was. I lashed out and lost the few friends I had before that. I got moody and depressed.
I'm not saying I'm perfect, because I definitely messed up from time to time, but the constant barrage of manipulation ran my self esteem into the ground.


Since then, I've matured. A lot. I've learned from my mistakes. I started working more and found healthy hobbies. I can definitely say that I've gained a good support system in my friends. I'm not a confident person, but I'm more confident and secure than I've ever been. I know a lot of that is probably because of maturity rather than being away from A, but still. 


 I constantly compare my actions to his. If anything I do is close to something he would have, I feel insecure. Realistically, since I'm aware of it, I'm sure that I'm nowhere close to being A, but its made it difficult to improve myself further and I feel like I've hit a wall. I still struggle to initiate friendships, and I've been pouring myself into work because that's the only place I've felt cared for in a long time- and thats really only because they can't afford to lose any more trained people because the turnover has been so high with Covid. 


Two days ago, his 9 week old puppy was stolen from his car because he left it there in 90 degree heat during his shift at work. I felt guilty just for thinking that he was a negligent person for doing that. 


Today I ran into him. He didn't say hi, but as soon as I saw him looking at me my stomach dropped and I felt like throwing up- like all the anxiety I used to have had come back. I walked out and sat in the car. I've been sitting in my room for 3 hours and it's all I can think about. I feel like my old self. The last time I ran into him, I didn't feel it quite so hard and still spent the next week thinking about it. Its been two years since I've talked to him, and really three since I respected him in any fashion, and yet he's still got me in this mindset that I overreact to everything (honestly, I don't have drama, I feel like I would if I overreacted) and that I'm a horrible person. 


In two months, I'm going to be moving away for college. My parents don't believe in counseling and have ostracized me for mental health in the past so I'm going to wait until I move to start counseling. The time and distance will be freeing from a lot. As of right now, I'm using healthy coping mechanisms (although I'll admit food has been a problem). I'm embarrassed to really talk about anyone with it because it seems like it should have been petty high school drama and they'll judge or pity me for holding onto it like this. 


How do I feel normal again? How will I ever trust another person enough to have a romantic life, or even a close friendship? I feel like I'd be such an emotional burden on others if I tried. If I go off to college, and nothing changes, what happens? I can avoid A for two more months, but seeing him made me realize how abnormal I feel despite having improved and matured. 


Thank you guys",31Jul2020,1
221,"I'm from Ohio, friend is from Washington, we know each other through our parents who met in college. Needless to say, we don't see each other a whole lot since we're so far away, but we go on vacation once or twice a year with our families. I've known her my whole life but I became friends with her a couple of years ago and we now text or talk every day. We have been in a mutual friend zone about as strongly as can be and although we are very good friends there has never been anything even close to going beyond that. Also, she is bi, and from what I can tell leans towards liking other girls more than guys.   


We were on a vacation in Montana, a pretty typical outdoorsy 5 day vacation for us. I'll call my friend E. The first three days were typical -- fun but not much to talk about. But for the last two nights we stayed in a hotel that gave us extra rooms because our reservation or something was messed up due to COVID. Anyways, I got my own room and E and her sister, L \[14\], got their own room. Since my room had two beds (well, sort of, a queen bed and a pullout couch that was basically a single bed), they wanted to have a sleepover type thing. This isn't unusual on its own, we're comfortable with each other and whatnot. 

The first night we all played various games and watched some TV for probably about an hour before L fell asleep, and because E and I weren't tired we went to sit on the couch bed. We read through old text conversations (between ourselves) on my phone and at one point she put her elbow on my shoulder like you would put your elbow on the window of a car to rest. This was definitely pretty unusual, as we aren't touchy people and the only physical contact we'd ever had was fake hitting each other or wrestling for something, like a phone. Anyways, at one point we got to some photos that she sent in messages and she tried to take my phone so we wouldn't look at them, but I pulled it away and basically ended up lying down on the bed trying to keep it away. Usually at this point she would just give up or maybe reach around to grab it, but she just laid on top of me with one hand on it and eventually gave up, but didn't move, and rested her head on my shoulder/chest for what was probably half an hour before it was super late and we both decided we should try to get some sleep. We slept for maybe an hour (in separate beds) before someone made a loud noise in the hallway and we both woke up, although her sister somehow slept through it. E came back and sat above the pillows and played with my hair for a while, which was also unusual. Then she said she was tired and crawled down into the bed and just laid next to me for the better part of an hour. Keep in mind that this is an extremely small bed and there was nothing comfortable about this from a needing to sleep perspective. Then her sister started to shuffle around and E jumped up quickly, and at that point we were all up and went about our day. No mention of anything at all, except for one point in the morning where E made some awkward compliments about my hair and eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

The next night was the same situation, except L fell asleep much faster and E came over to my bed again, and this time put her head on my shoulder pretty much right away. We were both very tired since we barely slept the night before, and she laid down again next to me and said she was tired and asked me to put my phone away, which I did. We laid down for a while until she said she was going to go sleep. She also patted the top of my head when she said this which was an interesting gesture and I still don't exactly understand that. Anyways, she sat up and then gave up on standing up and laid back down, and about 10 minutes later she did the exact same thing and eventually got up and went to sleep. Notably, every time her sister kind of shuffled or the door creaked or something, E sat or stood up, so she clearly didn't want other people seeing what was going on... 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a week since the trip, and while we've texted every day as usual since, there has been essentially no mention of these nights except for her saying that she misses the pullout couch bed because ""it was comfortable."" I really cannot stress enough how nothing like this has ever happened between us before, how even a year ago her accidentally brushing my leg made her say ""ew."" Also of note, I didn't really initiate any contact or anything. I went along with it because I didn't mind at all, but she did initiate basically everything. I really just don't know what to do now. The last thing I want to do is jeopardize a good friendship, but I am also curious about why she did what she did those two nights. 

TL;DR: Spent a couple of nights with close friend where she was unusually touchy and close, but there's been no mention about it since, idk why she did what she did or what I should do now.",31Jul2020,1
222,"At the beginning of the year, our company moved to a new location that was capable of producing 10x our current production capacity of a certain consumer good. This move was in planning for a good two years and employees were promised ultra-modern equipment and near full automation in the manufacturing area.

The transition, though, has been utterly botched and has taken a huge toll on the employees both mentally and physically. To make a long story short: employees with no permits were made to operate scissor lifts and forklifts to help in building the new plant. Equipment was nowhere near automated and extremely poor quality, resulting in frequent breakdowns and lots of unpaid overtime needed to make up the lost time. The place is still an active construction zone and employees need to dodge carpenters, electricians, and plumbers while carrying out their work. And in March, all employees were “asked” to take a voluntary pay cut of 20% due to COVID.

If we weren’t in the middle of a pandemic and worried about finding a new job, I believe most of the employees including myself would’ve walked by now. My mental health has deteriorated so much in the past few months that I’m considering quitting anyway, due to the effect it’s having on my home life and my relationship.

So what exactly do I say to my new boss in that meeting? Lay everything out on the table or suck it up and pretend everything is fine? I’d be grateful for any advice you have.",31Jul2020,1
223,"I feel like I'm not alone here as I have unfortunately seen many breakups here recently especially due to COVID-19 which makes me even more sad just reading them.

To keep it short, me (US, 20M) and my girlfriend (China, 24F), met last summer in Korea (she's been studying in Korea) and our 1st year anniversary just passed. Because I'm Taiwanese American and now studying college in Taiwan, my family's background is still stuck in the last generation of China and Taiwan tensions so my family dislikes her. And this is not even topping off how long distance is taboo as well as basically knowing your SO through text messaging since we didn't actually talk and meet up again when I visited Korea and met her. Anyhow I thought her personality and habits matched me and she came to Taiwan during winter break and it was a great 9 days but then coronavirus happened and we have not met each other for over half a year now.

Because of our age gap, culture/political tensions, our own family problems. and just not knowing when we can actually met each other again, I'm talking to her right now about taking a break. She's giving me the usual attitude that most girls give when they're sad and try to hide the fact that they're actually sad inside and it's obvious especially since we've almost broke up 2 times before (not because we didn't match each other, because of my family mistreating her).

I just want some advice on if we are making the right decisions, below are some concise points that I am stating for the reasons why I think taking a break should be better.

1. Age gap - she's 4 years older than me and has one more year until she graduates from graduate school while I have about 1 to 1.5 years left of college.
2. Coronavirus - it's already sugarcoated that the vaccine is going to come out in a year or two. While Taiwan has the virus completely under control with 0 cases for the past months, Korea still has some cases and every country still has strict travel restrictions.
3. My mom has severe OCD and that leads to the already racism and assumption the older generation of Taiwanese and Chinese have towards another to become even worse. She actually thinks my girlfriend is a spy and essentially any good alternative thing I tell my mom about my girlfriend she'll just go for the worst assumption/scenario.
4. From that last point, my mom basically spread the worst news to all my friends and family, even my sister is now against my girlfriend.
5. Both me and my girlfriend have family problems and being stuck here in Taiwan and Korea of hoping to meet each other and not going back to our countries does not seem like the best bet right now.

Sorry that it is still kind of long, I hope ya'll can give me some advice. I'll probably edit some stuff I forgot or correct some ambiguities.",31Jul2020,1

226,"I’m 25, wasted from 2014 to early 2020 at a job and it’s pretty much my only work experience and I know they’ll give me a bad reference. For reference, I started there at age 18 and left early 2020 due to them just not caring, so I stopped caring. They refused to install a needle drop box even after I got stabbed by discarded needles and had to be put on anti hiv medication twice for precautions, they refused to give me more than 1 day a week even before covid and would give a racist employee who flat out called a customer hard r n word on because he was pakistani and from what I read the government pays some of the immigrant wage. I have no problem with foreigners, the person I want to marry is filipina, but I do have a problem with people coming in on a power trip and insulting customer and employee alike. He did it to an elderly woman I worked with and they threatened to fire her unless she dropped it, and this guy personally trash talked me and when I had enough, walked up to him and said, Syed, stop doing things like that, he just didn’t react at all and acted like I wasn’t even there.

228,"This is so difficult to write because it forces me to face the reality of my situation. I've been pretty unhappy for a while, but I've felt especially empty this past week. 

I'm a 26-year-old guy still living at home with my family. I'll be starting a full-time job once the COVID situation dies down in a few months, but it probably won't pay me enough to move out. I live in one of the most expensive housing markets in the U.S. A crappy one-bedroom in a bad neighborhood would cost upwards of $2,000 a month. So I'll be continuing to live at home for the foreseeable future. I'm grateful to have a job and a free place to live, but living at home has really taken its toll on my mental health. My family members, especially my dad, are incredibly disrespectful to me and each other. I just can't take it anymore. If I could move across the country today, I would, and I wouldn't look back.

At the same time, I have no support network whatsoever. I have no one to complain to or who will sympathize with me. I have no friends aside from some old coworkers who I haven't seen in months, and who, in all honesty, I'm not that close with anymore. I haven't been in a relationship in about two years. This is in part because I'm introverted, awkward, and just don't do a good job of meeting people. I don't even know where to begin. And living at home isn't making things any easier. I feel like I'm a slave to my household ""responsibilities,"" which for some reason fall on me and no one else in my house. I'd really like to move to a different region of the U.S., but that won't happen for at least a few years.

I'm going to spend the next two weeks eating healthier and trying to make other positive lifestyle changes, but beyond that, I don't really know what to do. I think my mental health is a product of my crappy living situation and not vice versa. But I can't presently escape my living situation. I don't know how to go out and make friends when I'm basically starting from zero. I don't need a lot of friends. To be honest, I'd rather have one or two close friends than a bunch of acquaintances.

Me and my friend, let's call her S. So we have known each other for 11ish years now (we met in kindergarten) and I had feelings for her through 5th grade, then I moved to another state, but still liked her (keep in mind this entire time she had feelings for me, but we both were too scared to admit it at the time). Then in I believe 8th grade she got a boyfriend, (and still has that same boyfriend) and this made me loose interest in her in that way, but we still stayed great friends. But recently I have regained feelings for her.

And when I realized I have feelings for her again, I felt really weird because I basically have a girlfriend, she has a boyfriend, and I am 99.9999% sure she won't like me like that again. I just don't know how to feel about all of this, Of course I would never act on it, S is happy with her boyfriend, and I am happy with my ""girlfriend' I just cant shake these feelings, and It makes me feel weird.  


Basically I just feel really weird about liking her again, and can't shake the feelings, even if I wanted to, and trust me, I have tried

230,"Some backstory. 
I stopped talking to my mum for two years when I was at university because she constantly made me feel like shit, belittling me and just being downright controlling. When covid happened, I decided to make amends and move back to her home (abroad in Canada). Now, almost 6 months later I’m kinda done with living here, she turns off the Internet to “make me do stuff” and she’s removed the lock on my door because it’s “her house and she can do as she likes.”
Not to mention any chance she gets she likes to remind me that I’m mental (I’m depressed and not even severely and have anxiety which has been way worse since coming back). Being here reminds me as to why I cut all ties- shes a narcissist, and a massive TERF, as well as being incredibly biphobic. She also says I’m an alcoholic because she found bottle of vodka in my room, and has taken to sniffing at my drinks to see if she can smell any alcohol in them. 
I’ve got savings both in the UK and here in Canada, I’m planning on leaving in a month so I’ll get a couple more pay checks between now and the time I leave. I’ll be moving in with my boyfriend who has been ridiculously supportive (she said it will end in tears and he will get bored of me), despite me not even telling her about him she’s somehow found out (I keep my relationships a secret because she gets rude about them). 

Anyway, me and the boyf are sorting a flat to rent in Plymouth where he’s attending uni (I’ll be working full time). I’m going to be booking my flight in the next week, and then I’ll need to tell her, though I’m petrified because she’s going to be unbearable for the next month. I doubt she will give me a lift to the airport or even let my other family members cuz they’re all scared of her too.

235,"So a month ago I bought a vape through my best friend’s cousin. I’m 15m, and I know I shouldn’t have a vape, but that’s not really my point at the moment. The vape was mine, the first thing that I bought with my own saved cash. It is the first and only thing that I have owned for myself that did not previously or concurrently belong to any of my brothers. However, I’ve still been nice enough to share this vape with my oldest brother (17m), against my best friend’s advice. He knows my brother, and he already warned me from the start that he’d just end up “reappropriating” it from me. And it finally happened two weeks ago when he banged on my door demanding the vape.

He lives in my aunt’s house across the street, while I live with my grandparents along with my middle brother (yes I’m the youngest and no our parents aren’t in the picture anymore). He demanded I open up, and I stupidly did so. Then he quite violently demanded the vape to “give to a friend as a gift”, even though its mine and he has no right. I refused for a whole hour while he tore my room apart and started to destroy the house, all the while being quite physical with me. My grandma began to cry because this “is the only house we have” and that was the thing that made me finally give up the vape from its hiding place. Then he left and we didn’t talk for a week.

Now, I wasn’t mad at my brother because I already knew what he was like and expected this. In fact he kept referring to it as “our” vape from the very beginning, and kept trying to take it home with him at night. I always refused because for the first time, this was my own personal belonging, and he could not control me or enforce any terms upon me to use it. Needless to say, he didn’t like not being in control, and that’s why he did what he did. I did feel pretty hurt, though, that he would want to take away something that I could finally call my own with so much force. So when I visited him yesterday, and saw him using my vape so casually in front of me without even saying a word about what had happened, I got pretty upset. Seeing this, he offered me the vape and said “go on, you can hit it once”. Just. Once. As if it was now his. As if he didn’t blatantly lie about “gifting” it to someone. As if he didn’t take it from me by force.

So I stole it back from him today. I went across the street and took it from his room while he was at a friend’s. Since it’s already dark I thought I would just hide it outside of the house tomorrow. Except he noticed the missing vape much sooner than I expected about half an hour ago. He called me a dozen times the moment he got home. Then he came banging on our house door demanding to be let in. Luckily for us, it’s late and it was locked already. I told my grandma to not answer for now and that whatever he wanted could wait till the morning.

But I realize now that I hadn’t thought stealing it back from him through. He’ll be mad, really mad, since I stole something out of his room. Even though it belongs to me rightfully and he stole it from me first, he won’t see it that way and he’ll see this as me blatantly stealing something from him after he let me try it. I can hide it so that he doesn’t get it, sure. I can even destroy it so no one has it anymore. But if he can’t find it, I’m just afraid that he’ll get even more frustrated and angry, and I don’t know what to do. My middle brother cares nothing for either of us. My grandparents are old and can’t stop him. I’m small for a fifteen year old, and have always been the littlest in the family. Somehow I feel like I made a mistake taking back what’s mine, even though it belongs to me in every way shape or form.

At this point, I just need some advice for the next steps I should make, because clearly I’m not thinking this through enough. Giving it back to him and begging for forgiveness is out of the question obviously, since it’s mine. But is that what I should do? Or should I hide it and just keep hoping he won’t actually be that mad about it, since it’s actually MINE?",31Jul2020,1

I can't disagree with anything he said. The problem is, I don't see how online dating can possible work for someone who isn't attractive.

I mean, being unattractive is pretty much a prerequisite to dating *anyways*, but when it comes to online dating in particular, where so many are are instant knee-jerk reaction ""like or dislike?!?"", I just don't see much purpose in investing myself in that.

One in particular he recommended, it *requires* like six pictures. I've literally not taken a picture of myself in several years, and I active avoid even being *included* in pictures (like, I've berated friends and family for trying to take pictures without telling me; it's a source of a lot of insecurity for me).

Which, I imagine that's difficult for most people to relate to. *Everyone* wishes they were *more* attractive, but I wonder how many people actively avoid seeing themselves in reflections, or avoid taking pictures, because of how much they're ashamed of how they look?

I dunno. I guess I really don't see any hope in the online dating thing. Hell, not sure I have much hope for dating *in general*.",31Jul2020,1

My place has been in quarantine for over 4 months now and I feel like I turned into a different person.

Back then, when I was enjoying my college life, I felt happy most of the time, felt occupied with orgs and acads, was so sociable and friendly and got along with everyone! people tell I'm kind (and I can see it ngl). I was determined to. 

But now, I was given the opportunity to reflect. During this quarantine, socializing with people became awkward for me (maybe I just enjoyed being alone so much in my own little world that i no longer like the company of others?) My habits are also a mess, Ive been struggling to build my habits but over time, I lose the drive and it makes me miserable again.. I also gained weight (gained 10kgs and now I'm over 90kgs and that makes me feel sad too) The only things that really really made me happy this quarantine were webtoons and masturbating (daily and more than twice)

I realized that I became short tempered (like getting mad and shouting when interrupted while reading webtoons),, i sometimes resort to violence (smackijg people and dogs) when I get really angry...

245,"Me and my friend met each other in college two years ago when we both lived across the hall from each other in a dorm. We were extremely close and spent a good deal of time together. Towards the end of our freshman year, she got a girlfriend and I started hanging out with other people.

During sophomore year, her girlfriend began acting manipulative and would yell at her constantly. I would frequently give her advice and tell her to break up with her. I would feel frustrated that she didn't listen to what everyone was telling her but I understood it was easier said than done. My friend is also a very nice person but I get concerned people take advantage of her sometimes.

One night, we were hanging out together and in lighthearted fun, I suggested we marry each other if we were both single in our 30s. I believed it would just a joke but I began to get flirty vibes from her.  Every since then, there was a shift in our relationship. I noticed she started calling me pet names like ""Baby"" and calling me her wife around her girlfriend. It made me uncomfortable so I asked her to stop and she was pretty understanding so she said would. 

However, she still kept using other pet names, acting affectionate, and clingy in general. She will often text me about how much she misses me, how I'm her best friend, and that she needs affection. I had allowed her to log into my Instagram account so she could see something and I believe she stayed logged in. When I get sent flirty DMS, my friend will probe me and ask who it is. She tells me she loves me when we hang up on the phone. All of this just makes me uncomfortable?

At one point, she broke up with the girlfriend but continued to talk and act as if she was in a relationship with her. She would frequently have breakdowns over her and always come to me. Again, I would continue to give her the same advice. I just don't feel like I'm invested in it anymore. I feel bad and wish her the best.

I recently learned I won't return back to our college and I told my friend. She told me that she wouldn't be able to survive without me but I just don't feel the same way and said she was going to cry because I was her best friend.

To pursue this, I had planned out since I was a kid to move to the states at some point in my life, (I live in a shitty ass 3rd world horrible country) I have family there so that’ll help me up with money a little (until I find a job) I have some saved up and my parents are going to help me too, ONLY IF I go to study a Masters in my field. I don’t want to do this, I already wasted 12 years of my life doing things that I don’t want to do,  I was thinking on taking my parents offer and secretly trying to pursue my passion but a Masters degree takes time and dedication and money, I really don’t want them to waste anymore money on me, I am done I can’t keep living a life that I don’t want to live. I’m at the edge, If it were up to me I would just get an immigration visa and fly as soon as Covid is somehow managed and just purse my passion without looking back. I daydream about this so much, since the last 15 years of my life or so. 

So idk what the fuck should I do, help me",31Jul2020,1

256,"This is a big one.

Around four years ago I met a group of people online. Wanting to impress them/be taken seriously I told them I was 4 years older. It escalated to the point where I created an entire fake person I'd take the role of (up to name, ethnicity, siblings etc.) They currently think I'm a couple years into college, about to move into dorms.

As I matured I realised they werent throwaway relationships, I really valued their friendship. They've helped me through hard times and I'll always be thankful for that. Recently we've been discussing plans to meet IRL, and I knew I'd have to make another lie to not go. This really made me realise the guilt of lying I'd been carrying for so long.

I know people will tell me that if they're such good friends I should just tell them. However, I wonder if it would be better to let them believe. I'm still a minor, and they're all adults. There has not been any grooming or sexual relationships between any of us (I'm a girl if this changes anything). As stupid as I may have been, I'm so glad I practised online safety. However, there are definitely moments that would feel different looking back at conversations. I would hate to be the reason for anyone's discomfort.

I've had thoughts of telling one them lately, and I've hinted I have a big secret to tell them eventually. However I'm having second thoughts. I don't want to place all the burden on one person, but it's taken so long to even consider telling someone, let alone the whole group. I know they'll all have to know at some point, and I don't deserve to think about myself in this scenario.

257,"I used to believe in God and Christianity and stuff, but now I really don't feel like ""following"" Christ anymore, if you know what I mean. I'm sure that not believing in a certain religion is normal, but my mom and her friends do believe in God. 

Just a moment ago, my mom's friend (a Christian) asked if I wanted to become baptized.  And since I don't really want to tell my mom that I don't really believe in that religion anymore because I'm scared she'll start treating me differently or whatever, I don't really say yes or no. A problem is that none of them know that I stopped believing. Last time I was at church I still sort of believed in God, but then there's a pandemic, and I don't have to go to church anymore so none of them really know that I don't believe in God anymore.

258,"So here is the issue.

My gf(21) is insured via my(23m) father. Last week she canceled a important insurance without talking to me or my father first. Maybe this sounds dumb at first but she was told, that the insurance company would not pay the insurance if needed, this is bull. The people who told her that do not have enough knowledge to say something so rude.
You now may think I'm petty, but my gf lived with me and my parents for 10 months for the cost of heat and electricity, so basically free and then she does not have the backbone to talk to my father about the insurance but does this on a Sunday, sends my father a short text message and cancels the insurance via a third party and directly to the company.
You still may think I'm petty but at first my father, who contacted me and I thought she did the cancelation via a lawyer. That would have been a deal breaker and most likely I would be single now.

The good thing is she at least did not intend to do this via an lawyer, it was over a website and what I know an automatic response.
She also knows that she messed up.

I really want to work past this, but when I look at her, it doesn't feel like before.

260,"TW for sexual assault, incest. 
Recently i graduated high school, and along with that i began to grow more and more angry at my family. It got to the point i went off on my mom so hard on Christmas eve night that it ruined the entire Christmas day, and every few months i go off on her for letting what occurred while i was a child happen. 

I’m not sure when it started, but i know i told my parents what was happening when i hit six year old. they believed when one of my brothers confessed what he was doing, but the other one said i was crazy and just was making it up, (my brothers were both teenagers). My parents believed him, which i now know is called “gaslighting”. i wish i knew that term when i was younger. the abuse continued less frequently from then on until i was 10, and then one morning when i was 14.

This led to me feeling insane when i was younger, so i would always hit my head on walls and wouldn’t be able to talk to friends about it because my parents said that they could get in trouble, which i didn’t want at the time because i care for family and the thought of anything happening to them scares me.

flash forward to now, i can’t hold a stable relationship, i am cold to any males in my family who are older than me (even my dad, who didn’t assault me and doesn’t deserve it, i cry frequently because he is so nice but i am so cold and unresponsive). I frequently get angry and frustrated at my mom at random and go off about how i think it’s unfair she still gives them all the support (both financial and emotional) they need, and one of them despite pushing thirty still lives in the same house i do. I was afraid for my little brother and tried my hardest to protect him, until i learned it was too late for him too. the night he told me what happened i thought intensely about ending my life, i felt like i had failed him. I obviously didn’t go through with it because i knew he needed someone there for him. My little brother is what keeps me going in life, he’s the one person i know will always be there for me and he knows he can depend on me too, which is why he told me. 

I just can’t keep going on like this though. every time i bring it up my mom acts like i’m a burden, gets angry at me, and tries to get me to talk to them about it, even though that’s the last thing in the world i want to do. i know it’s a hard topic for her, but it’s even harder for me to have to live with it and just see the rest of my family treating them like they are angels. I get so mad at them, and it’s led me to become a cold and hot tempered person towards my family even though my parents don’t deserve it. they try hard for me, and i know i shouldn’t let those mistakes define everything but i can’t help it. How do i bring it up in a way it’s comfortable? is that even possible? Has anyone gone through anything similar to this and is willing to offer a helping hand? i can’t move out of my house, that is not an option. I just want to mend my relationship with my parents and stop crying because i feel so bad for my coldness that i can’t seem to control.

I’m sorry that this was jumbled and long and probably didn’t make much sense, i’m crying while i write and my thoughts are going everywhere.

TL;DR: How do i fix my relationship with my parents after they gaslighted me upon finding out about my brothers molesting me continuously as a child, and now they refuse to talk about it civilly with me?",31Jul2020,1
261,"(summary) (Girls 18) Okay I met this girl the other night, we played pool for hours and hung out for a bit, got her number and all that jazz, well she invited me out to a local park to help a friend of hers get some pictures, we did kinda BF/GF or Husband/wife like photos (nothing like actually kissing or anything) I want to ask her out, we have alot in common already more than my ex

(The problem) She mentioned shes been fucked over by bfs/GFS alot I have also (were both Pansexual) and I said I was perfectly fine just being friends and didn't flirt at all when I met her after we got to talking And explained stuff, she seems almost like a female me, and we seemed to automatically click, she wants to give up on dating in her life entirely but said she hasn't decided yet, I want to date her because I know I wouldn't ever do anything willing or on purpose in my life to her that would make her cry or hate herself. But I can live with keeping her as a friend but don't want a$$holes fu#k her over   , I'd also feel horrible if I pushed her away by asking her out because she has hardly any friends like 3 total she still talks too and all 3 are moving for college (her ex screwed her social life)

266,"Throw away account for reasons. So I have an online friend who I’ll call E for the sake of my explanation and I have two irl best friends who Ill call N and C. So a few months ago I met E online through a reddit post and we actually hit it off pretty well at first. After awhile E started opening up to me more about their depression and self harm/suicidal thoughts and at first I was happy to help them with their problems. Well E eventually went into detail about their anxieties over opening up to people because they’ve lost a lot of people of their depression and so this lead me to get caught in a cycle of wanting to be able to help them, but also dealing with my own stuff that I wanted to ask them for help with, but I couldn’t because they didn’t want to talk about depressive stuff. Now another thing to know about E is that they have a mentality that even if something offends someone, they wouldn’t care as long as it doesn’t affect them (i.e they don’t feel wronged by saying the r-slur and they used to say the n-word and their not black btw, but after being threatened to be doxxed, they stopped saying that at least.) So heres my situation, I introduced E to N and C a few weeks ago and it didn’t go well. E, not really knowing much about my friends started acting like they would around their type of friends by saying lowkey offensive stuff to I guess seem cool to them. Well my friends didn’t like that and it eventually lead to them hating E and hating on me for “enabling their behavior.” I, myself am I relatively non confrontational person so that’s the only reason I didn’t actually fight against E even though I knew what they said was wrong. Now the current situation is that Ive cut E off for a few weeks because on top of the situation between E and my friends, their constant need of help with their issues but not taking my advice on actually trying to receive help finally broke me. I couldn’t take it anymore so I just stopped responding and at first it was liberating, but now I’m not so sure. While yes, I understand that their behaviors were completely out of line, I still miss the friendship we had and I’m considering at least messaging them and telling them how they’ve affected me.

So like many others around the world/country (usa) I was hit pretty hard by the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns.

Anyways I qualified for unemployment for the first 3 weeks of lockdown since our restaurant was 100% closed. As time progressed I was called in to work more and more but still not anywhere close to as much as I was working before. I averaged about 15 hours which put me about 60 dollars above my weekly benefit amount meaning I no longer qualified for benefits and am now reliant on my 120 dollar checks.

269,"relevant backstory: i've known my best friend (T) for about 8 years now. she has a bird that likes to scream at everyone so her family has a spray bottle they use on her when she gets out of hand. we're both 17 yr old seniors. i'm diagnosed ASD, and i have many sensory triggers. that part will come into play later.

she called me and asked if she could come pick me up and we could hang out, which is normal for her. in this i refer to myself as K.

I get back to her house we and start playing some card games. the entire time we're playing her bird (R) will not shut up, so she finally sprays her and she stops screaming. she starts pointing the spray bottle at me, knowing that one of my sensory triggers is being sprayed. i jokingly say that if she sprays me i'm gonna key her car. now obviously, i wouldn't key her car even if she sprayed me. i said that i wouldn't actually do it, but that if she sprayed me i would ignore her for a long time.

she started getting upset and i kept saying ""well then don't spray me and i won't do it"" to which she went speechless and dropped the bottle without spraying me.

now some time passes and T's mom gets home from work. we all go outside to greet her and the first thing T says is ""K said she was gonna key my car!"" to which i am dumbfounded because that had passed and i had obviously told her that i had no intention to do it. i explain to her mom who said my threat was a bit far, but after being reassured that i wouldn't have actually done it she let it go. T however did not like this and came over to me and grabbed me and stated she was gonna put me on her shoulder.

now, i hate being touched, hence the ""overreaction"" to the possibility of being sprayed. she grabbed me by the arm and i smacked her on the back to get her off of me. T then got extremely butthurt and started over exaggerating and acting like i had stabbed her, when in reality i smacked her about as hard as you would smack squishy jello or cake. 

T's mother then told us to knock it off and go inside where i realized that T does this type of thing all the time, make me the center of her jokes and manipulate situations to be in her favor. i told her she needed to take me home and she did and i told my mom what happened.

i'm not very aware of how i get treated, but i frequently have people tell me that it seems like she always is out to make me look bad. she's also v disrespectful abt boundaries. her house has 2 fridges and 3 freezers, both her parents live in the same house and she always has food and snacks and lets me eat her snacks. but when she'll come over to my house, she'll eat us out of house and home. we have one fridge, a very small freezer, and a small cupboard for our other food. i live with just my mom, and she works 7-7 shifts and we barely make ends meet. it's gotten to the point where my mom would buy food for me and she would just take it without asking. we now hide food so i have stuff to eat during the day.

I'm trying to work on that, really. And it's getting somewhat better but it's still not great.  Recently a friend of mine brought it up when I was ridiculously late (like 45 minutes) for a small 7 pm. beer at his place.

285,"Hello! I hope if your reading this you and your family are doing well. I feel like quarantine has enabled people to transform their bodies either for better or for worst, and in my case it definitely got worst. Im a college student (22 F) and weighed 126lbs at 5’4”. I lost a lot of weight in 2019 and although 126lbs wasn’t my goal I was content at that weight in 2020. When I heard we would have to leave campus and be quarantined I began to worry that I would fall into my old habits and gain weight. I was used to ignoring my hunger by sticking my head in books and studying all day at school. I love cooking and baking and keeping myself out of the kitchen allowed for me to keep the weight off during the beginning of 2020. I was used to not eating very much because I spent most of my time on campus doing schoolwork and would only eat once I got home which was usually around 8-10pm. However, during quarantine, especially now that I am on break I spend most of my time in the kitchen. This is mainly because I love to bake and cook, but I’ve gained so much! Now I weigh 140lbs and barely fit into my clothes. I feel disgusted with myself and find myself constantly eating, snacking, and I am not that active either. I have sciatica, but I can do most excercise as long as It doesn’t involve much jumping/hopping/ or greatly extending my legs. If anyone has any tips for self control or discipline when it comes to eating please share! Thank you! :)",31Jul2020,1
286,I’m very different from all of my friends. I feel as though I’m alone even when we’re all hanging out. I see them every single day. Does this mean it’s time to move on and find friends more similar to me??? I’m very torn about this because I do have great times with them but every so often while we’re hanging out I feel as though I’m not meant to be here. Am I over thinking or should I find people more similar to me???,31Jul2020,1
287,"Everything from the following is strictly what she’s told me over the course of our friendship, we’ve known each other a bit over a year and got really close half way through it. She lives no more than a few miles down the road, and we’ve never met up in person anywhere because she’s so afraid of her mom. Her mother is a police officer who suffers from PTSD, and had an ugly divorce. This is her excuse as to why my BF needs to sleep in the same bed with her, even tho my BF has her own room &amp; bed. The mother I guess cannot sleep without her daughter by her side. I don’t think this is sexual, there has NEVER been signs of this, so I feel as if it’s toxicity to the extreme. My BF just turned 18, has a car signed with her mom and is NEVER allowed to drive it or go anywhere with friends EVER. She NEVER asks because it always results in her mom yelling at her. Her mom has refused to let my BF get a job her entire high school career. My friends self esteem is a bit below average, she tries to model clothes on Instagram and do little TikToks her own mother calls her ugly or not good enough to do those things. My BF has a unique look and style but she can most certainly become a model in today’s world. She’s such a sweet person and I want to finally meet her, but all we can do is FaceTime, her mom and I have chatted over FaceTime before and she seems like a “fake” chill. I honestly am at a lost for advice and reasoning that my BF could make with her mother, I don’t know how she will ever escape that household. The mom is super protective because of her police work and thinks our town is dangerous 24/7/365. I don’t understand how that is an excuse to let her daughter not have any other social interaction or freedom. Her older brothers mid twenties or so, have been drug addicts, one is an underage alcoholic who has to be picked up by my BF, one of the only reasons she’s allowed to go out of the house. She’s extremely lonely throughout the day, and her mom is typically in a bad mood most of the time. She doesn’t have a lot of friends mainly because of her mom, I don’t wanna see her stuck with her mother for a majority of her young life, she should be taking the biggest risks and trying new things! Most of what I stated is believed to be true, her and I would be on FaceTime and if the mother has work the next morning, she NEEDED to hang up because her mother insisted it was time for bed. She texts me crying from what her mothers said, and constantly says we can’t hangout because of her mom. I just wanna meet my friend, and see her be happy and enjoy freedom as a teenager!",31Jul2020,1

I am too ugly to date and it has been such a frustrating and demoralizing experience. I’ve done everything in my power to fix it, I’ve lost 80 pounds, I bought all new clothes, I bought a car, I’ve held a job down for over a year, I go to college, none of this even matters. I’m still so ugly that it just doesn’t make sense for any woman to settle for me when they can find anyone with the same traits as myself but aren’t repulsive.

I’ve been on tinder (paying for gold since March), bumble, okcupid, and hinge since October and between all of those apps I have around 10 matches combined between them and 0 dates. I’ve had my friends take pictures of me, help me write a bio, and I had my friends who are girls who are pretty experienced with dating apps look over my profiles, but none of that matters if you’re as ugly as me. I’ve asked out girls in person as well, the last three were people I would consider good friends of mine and they all three said yes. Not a single one of them showed up and not a single one of them told me beforehand that they weren’t coming, I’m not worth the effort I guess.

I’m very good with people, I have two different friend groups who invite me out to be the “funny guy”. I have lots of girls who are great friends with me but when I ask them out they want nothing to do with me. For example, I’ve asked three girls who were good friends with me in the last 6 or 7 months and they’ve all said yes, each time they’ve seemed very excited to go out with me but out of all of those times none of them even told me they weren’t coming, I’m not even worth knowing that you don’t want to see me, I’m worthless.

I don’t even have anyone I can turn to, even my mom and sister told me that despite losing 80 pounds that I’m still a 2/10. What else am I supposed to do at this point? I’d get plastic surgery but I’ll never be able to afford it. I just feel like my only purpose is to be an inconvenience to women who are looking for men who aren’t subhuman vermin. I don’t even have a career to look forward to because I decided that it would be a good idea to take on lifelong debt for a fucking history degree. It feels like I have nothing to look forward to, poverty? Being alone forever?

What do I do?

291,"Okay you may read this and have one conclusion to what I'm about to type, and yeah you're probablly right, but lets get some backstory first. Also sorry for posting this here, the WIBTA subreddit is private and I just want to get this out. Idk if the contents are okay to mark SFW since I see others not do so either on facebook, but I'll mark it NSFW if I need to.

Anyways, I'm at my uncle's house to learn how to drive 10 hours away from home, as in my hometown the rules are ridiculous there and my mom works so much she has no time to teach me, so I'm here until I learn to drive. My uncle is pretty okay usually, hes married and has kids and they all seem happy. I sleep in my aunt's sewing room, as they made room to put a bed in there for me so I have my own room.

Now, the point of why I'm even writing this. For the last week he's asked me weird things and his weird jokes and actions like 3 times. The first time we were out to try and get me an ID for the state. My aunt was in a building for a doctors appointment and he suddenly asked me if I had lost my virginity yet. Shocked, I awkwardly told him no because I've never been social enough in life to even consider it. He said he wasn't sure if I liked guys or girls (I'm pansexual). Then he said if only he wasn't my uncle he wouldn't care if I asked him to take it, which made me even more shocked. He saw how shocked I was and claimed it was hypothetical, and not to tell my aunt or or which I saw as a red flag. I told my friend though and she said it was creepy, which I agreed to. The next time was like 5 days later when he came into my room while no one else was inside and asked me if I thought about his question. Obviously again I said no and excused myself to use the bathroom when my aunt called his phone. He went away when I came out. And now the last time was just an hour or two ago, two days after last time. He came in again and asked me what I do at night when everyones asleep (I'm a night owl). I use Discord constantly and that happened to be up on the screen, so awkwardly I explained what Discord was. He then joked that he thought I would be watching porn or something like that, which shocked me that he'd think that. I mean its not a shock that a teen watches porn but I didn't expect him to tell me that. I just nodded and looked at my screen until he said sorry for bothering me and left. I'm super uncomfortable at this point, but I really don't wanna ruin a marriage and family by telling my mom and aunt about this and break their hearts, and my uncle can also just be really stupid sometimes too, but I told my friend and other friends and they gave me a big yikes. And if I don't tell anyone else then I'm stuck here until HE teaches me how to drive, which could lead to 3 more months of this at least. I cant sleep now and I locked my door because I don't know what to do but don't wanna hurt anyone else by telling them what happened, but I'm super uncomfortable and don't know what to do and wanna go home.

294,"Alright, this one is rough but I honestly dont know how to move forward. 

BACK STORY: I (21F) live about 45 minutes to an hour away from my family and where I grew up. I'm going to college and live completely independent from my (52F) mom. My mom lives with my (62F)Aunt currently as she lost my childhood home to foreclosure 3 years ago. My grandparents were extremely abusive and my mom and aunt have never really completely grown out of those abusive tendencies. My grandparents were the type of abusive to make their kids jealous and hateful towards each other so my mom and Aunt dont like living together. However, they have gotten better. My mom has always been a mooch. When our house foreclosed, my mom and I both moved in with my Aunt as we had no where to go. I paid rent to my Aunt the entire time and for 6 months I paid my mother's rent also because she refused to get a job. She's that kind of mooch. She eventually paid me back which was surprising. There is also some other trauma from my mom that I have never been able to forgive her for. My aunts house used to be my grandparents. I was sexually assaulted there as a kid so that's another traumatic discomfort to revisit. 

THE SITUATION: 2 weeks ago, my mom called me explaining that she woke up earlier that week with partial paralysis in her legs. She couldn't really get around. My aunt was taking on a 2 week gig 30 minutes away from her home that paid her pretty good money so she couldn't take care of my mom and asked me to come take care of her. I had a trip planned on the 25th to scout out some areas in Oregon where me and my partner want to live. I was also finishing a summer internship at the time. Because of my aunt taking this job (which I don't blame her for because it's good money she needs), I had to stay with my mom for a week and a half to take care of her. I had to cancel my trip, finish my internship abruptly with some unfinished projects, and not be able to work at my part time job which I need the money. This, of course, isn't my mother's fault but having to take care of her in a house where I experienced trauma while putting my life on hold has been really tough. It also doesn't help that my mom has mentioned multiple times that she feels bad about this situation because she wouldn't do the same for me if the roles were reversed and I believe her.

My mom had her surgery to repair the paralysis earlier this week. The doctors wanted her to be discharged to a rehab facility after her hospital stay in order to help her recover. She found out today that she cannot afford it and will have to go home in the next few days. My aunt keeps extending her paying gig so I do not have any idea when she will be coming back home, it looks like another week. My aunt came home briefly today to do some cleaning at the house. She tried moving my moms car to mow the lawn and broke the key in the ignition. I understand mistakes happen, but the entire conversation she was deflecting her blame, saying my mom shouldn't have bought this car and it's the ignition switch going out. My mom has had this car for only a month. It's the first working car she has had in 2 years. My aunt called me to tell me this just to ask to see if she should tell my mom or if I should. Another thing I have to deal with. If the roles were reversed, my aunt would have lost her shit and demanded that my mom paid for the damage. 

I really can't afford to miss another week of work. I start my semester on August 17th. When I start back, I will only be able to work weekends if I even have the energy as I will be interning 8 hour days through the week. I don't think my mom or aunt really understand how much I've had to sacrifice or how much they're putting on me to take care of mom, drive back and forth, try to take care of things in my own life, deal with them complaining about each other to me, sort out my moms finances through this, etc. They've become so dependent on me that I do all the household shopping, I have to find a new bed for my mom for recovery, figure out what I'm going to do when my mom is discharged from the hospital, and now fix the car. 

I really dont know what to do. I have been given no choices in what's been going on. I feel like they both depend on me for so much but I really can't handle much more mentally. I feel like I'm going to come out of this financially and mentally drained. I'm afraid to tell my mom just how exhausted I am because I dont want any added stress on her so she can focus on recovery. I don't know if Ishould explain this to her anyway or talk to my aunt or beg the hospital nurse care manager for some other options or what. What do you guys think?

TL:DR my mom who I live an hour away from has had serious health complications. Both her and my aunt depend on me to take care of her while my aunt works an almost 3 week gig now. I have put my life on hold and havent been able to work because of this. I don't feel like I can keep this up anymore and I don't know what to do when my mom gets discharged from the hospital.",31Jul2020,1
295,"I had to repair two trucks recently, and a particular girl working at my local autoparts store proved to be extraordinarily helpful. The first time I went in, she stopped another employee form giving me the wrong parts. The next time she rerecorded products that worked instantly for the cleanup I had to do. After that, she recommended several techniques for changing a break caliper that made it possible for me to do the work at all. After that, she remembered the weight of my truck from 8 days prior and made sure I didn't buy a jack that would fail if I had tried to lift my truck with it.

&amp;#x200B;

If she worked at a small family run store, I would expect her to remember me, but this is actually a big chain store and regularly has 8-12 people in there at any given time. I blend into crowds pretty well, and find it amazing she not only recognized me but remembered what I was doing, and the specific weight of my truck (she didn't estimate, she remembered the exact value on the data sticker.).  


The entire time, she was kind, patient, and cracked jokes (including a fat joke about herself that was actually quite funny). I feel like she did way more than any retail employee should have done, and that makes me feel like I should return her kindness somehow. Howeaver, I am autistic, and many social ques are beyond my grasp. I do not know if it is appropriate to so much as bring her a soda as a thank you for what I see as going above and beyond the call of duty.

&amp;#x200B;

I am aware that it is inappropriate to ask someone out at their place of work, and in truth I don't want to do that even though she's pretty cute on top of being weirdly nice to me for whatever reason. She's probably got her whole life in order already and I dont want to be perceived as creepy or sexist or narcissistic by offering her dinner as a thank you (though personally I would love to be thanked with a trip to a restaurant). I don't think I am allowed to tip workers at this particular store, so I can't just give her money, but I still feel like I should do something.

&amp;#x200B;

She ensured I didn't die when a truck fell on me because I would have to hammer on the thing to get a part to come off. You know?

Should I do anything? If so, what is appropriate?",31Jul2020,1
296,"Introduction:
For about a month and a half I've worked at a local fast food restaraunt. Its a really popular family and truckerstopping location. An Indian couple bought the place from a long time owner about a month before I got hired. The man is very passionate about making the restaraunt as profitable and efficient as possible. I respected this a lot and worked really hard sharing some of his passion. The woman is generally laid back and likes to talk with me a lot about schooling and our common interests. I only ever worked with these two. The mans job was to cook food, the woman's to take orders and mine to put condiments on and pack takeout bags. Most days it was really slow so the woman would tend to doze off and sleep in the back. The man would prep food and I would ask him if there was anything for me to do but most times he told me to stand at my station waiting for customers. Whenever a customer came it was my job to tell the man so he would wake his wife up to take the order. There was never a problem with this other the it would keep the customer waiting a little longer. The man would get a little frustrated at his wife for sleeping at the job then they would talk in their native language for around 10 min loudly across the kitchen. While this happend I always do my best to ignore it and talk to customers. 

Incident:
After her falling asleep that day their argument went on longer than usual around 30 min. She fell asleep again then they had another argument. This time it was around 15 min across the kitchen till she left the cash register and went into the back with him. Meanwhile there's 3 customers lined up some burgers on the grill, fries in the fryer and just me to handle it. I was never trained in using the cash register so I didn't want to mess anything up naturally. I was also told at the start that only he touches the meat because he know how to cook it and if I or the woman poisoned someone it wouldn't be good obviously. I decided to finish what I knew how to do, condiments, fries, onion rings, etc. When I was completing the last order I heard a slam noise of wood falling on the floor more yelling to the point of borderline screaming, crying and another wood slam. I assumed from the sound he threw a wooden broomstick hanle that was leaning against the wall at the time at her. The customers were just starring at me while I acted calm and finished the order. Burgers are looking almost done so I flip them. Check them like he usually does to make sure its cooked completely till he comes out from the back while I'm checking them grabs the tongs out of my hands and says loudly ""fuck you doing man"". This shook me so I jumped back to my station and didn't say a thing, he then looked at me and yelled ""You always standing wasting money I work like donkey all day then you ask for work like a child just work don't talk"". About 3 min later she comes out with teared up eyes sniffing holding her right arm on her chest with a cloth. This imidietly put the thought in my head that I'm in danger. I knew my parents were going to come for dinner here that day so while working I thought of what I needed to take with me to leave and guarantee my parents don't come. Lo and behold my parents arrive at the same time it gets a little busy. During all these order I'm working really hard to make sure the mans job is as easy as possible. My parents decided to stay and eat outside meaning I had to wait till they left to leave. I realized that the best option was to wait till the man went to do something in the back then leave grab my water bottle act like I'm going to the bathroom drop my work attire on the sink counter then just leave. On the last customer the man decided to yell at her once more then storm into the back. She went and put a burger on the grill and stood there holding her arm with tongs in hand staring at the meat. She forgot to give the customer his receipt so she walked back but this time removed her hand holding the cloth on her arm to click ""no"" on the machine and I saw a small bloody mark on her elbow surrounded by a large bruise on the arm. I instantly realized I had to go now. She went back to the grill I grabbed my bottle walked into the bathroom took my plastic gloves off then walked out the door. Forgetting to take my work attire off I got in the car saw the man standing out the back in view of my car. He heard the car starting and stared at me while I drove off. 

Conclusion:
Right when I got home I told my parents about what had happend and what I did. They told me to text the owners saying I left because I didn't feel comfortable and that I won't be working there anymore. Sent 3 days ago they haven't responded and my next shift is in 4 days. I still have a weeks worth of work I haven't been paid for and the work attire. I don't know if I should call the cops and possibly take legal action to get my pay. I'm worried to go back and speak with him because I'll just get yelled at or something. I'm kind of lost as for what I should do...",31Jul2020,1
297,"So essentially every weekend my friends get together and throw a light party or hang out session with 10-15 people, and I’ve always had to be worried about my mom blowing up my phone. She stays up until I get home, so she wants me home at like usually 1-2am, but cool stuff sometimes happen during like 3-4am.

 I’m 20 years old and live at home while going to college, so it’s always been a big issue about having restrictions. And I had to fight for that time and 1am is the usual time I get home but sometimes I find myself worrying about my mom rather than just being in the moment at the party. 

I’m sometimes the first one to leave, but I can’t even spend the night at a friends house or it’d be humongous deal. And it’s like I’m 20 years old so it’s getting kind of embarrassing to be like oh I gotta go my moms on me.

299,Im a girl Im about to be a junior in high school. My first year I went in hardly knowing anyone since I went to a middle school with only 38 eight graders. In my science class I sat with the only friend I knew the next week we got assigned seats and I have trouble talking to people. I got sat next to this boy and he was really blunt and funny. He tried his best to not make me uncomfortable. He was the first new friend I made at that school. Despite only knowing him for about a month he tells me he likes me. I didn’t know what to say because the thought of him romantically never crossed my mind. I rejected him immediately I didn’t know what else to do. I thought of him as the first friend I made in high school. Anyways long story short we were in more classes next year we were still friends obviously and it was still word that he still liked me. Since corona I haven’t talked to him no reason in particular I wished him a happy birthday in June and last week he came to mind. I decided to hit him up and ask how he was Yk what anime he’s been watching etc. The conversation took a turn when he told me he still had feelings for me. As a matter a fact he told me he would called it love. I’m selfish for wanting to have a friendship with him right? Aren’t I bringing too much pain for him. Should I stop being friends with him for his sake. I feel like the more we keep contact his feelings won’t go away. Hopefully some of you read the whole thing if so please give me advice.

301,"Hi there y’all,

So I’ve (21F) been struggling a lot recently thinking about my mom and how worried I am that I’ll inherit her mental illness.

For background, she lost custody of me when I was 12 because of her delusional behavior and mood swings- she was formally diagnosed with DD (delusional disorder) during the court case, but my family and I have always thought it was more than just DD. My dad thought she had BPD/maybe bipolar as well, it’s hard to pin down. Her main symptoms are unpredictable mood swings and persecutory delusions, a lot of which come from really traumatic past experiences. She doesn’t hallucinate or really have any negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and though she’s currently employed she’s relatively functional and has held down many jobs before. She’s been like this my whole life though- earliest memory of her chaotic mood swings was when I was 3 and she was in her early 30s. Her parents tells me that she’s always been “sensitive”, which I assume is code for struggling with mental illness (her parents  are a little bit out of touch). 

My mom and I are very different people in terms of personality. She’s very sensitive emotionally (my grandparents were right about that) and I’m not...I’m a fairly happy and casual person and my mom is very intense and cries a lot. She’s paranoid and fragile, and I’ve never been that way- I do have anxiety and OCD, but I’m on meds for them and I’m managing it ok. I smoke weed too sometimes, which I may quit because I’ve heard it can trigger psychosis. 

Despite being separated from her now and knowing our personality/life differences,  I still worry that I will become like her one day. I know that psychosis can be hereditary and can happen during mid-life, and I’m worried it will happen to me.

Any advice on how to cope with this? Anyone else have mental illness in their family? I’m trying to see a therapist but I can’t for a while.",31Jul2020,1
302,"So this is about my best friend and how he is paranoid about how his parents judge him. I’m not that good at writing but hopefully you guys will still understand. And for context his parents are divorced. It all started when he was a kid and whenever he would be in public with his dad. His dad would look at people and judge them by things like the clothes they wear, he would call people “faggots” over stuff like that. He would also say stuff to him like “all YouTube videos are shit.” After him saying all that stuff, my friend became really insecure about what he should be and should not be interested in and wouldn’t watch YouTube videos when his parents were around. Fast forward to a few months ago, he got interested in furry things and eventually became a furry (I think I’m the only person who knows about that). But also in the past few months he has been sending me dms on discord talking about how he is scared of his dad finding out about this and whenever he goes to his dads house he wipes his phone’s data. He also gets really nervous when talking to him and can’t look him in the eye straight. And when he’s at his moms house where he has a pc, he has developed a habit of alt f4ing the programs he has running when someone enters the room. His mom thinks he is watching porn when he does that but he is just extremely paranoid about being judged by his parents. His mom also judges his friends over things that his twin sister describes his friend group as. She says stuff like “the group of people that you hang out with is at the bottom of the social structure and is full of wierdos and ""the nerdiest kids"" and people don't like to talk to them because of how they act/present themselves.” I am deeply concerned for my friend and I don’t know what to do to help, or how to get him help. All ideas are appreciated and thanks for your time reading this.",31Jul2020,1
303,"Alright, some disclaimers: while being new to this sub, I feel like I am probably in a privileged position here. I don't have many issues except for a pretentious family, toxic friends, and shitty grades. I'm fifteen years old, my mom is still half convinced that all games are trojan viruses, and my family won't trust me with a credit card until I'm 18, for the sole reason that I  apparently will be to busy paying for stuff in college, rather than ""wasting money on games or technology"".

Okay, now I'm not expecting this post to pick up much speed, but here goes: I love video games. Like many people, videogames have given me some of the best experiences of my life, and I really want to have more of those experiences, and I want to be a part of all the different communities surrounding it, because I fucking love what I have seen of them so far, and I want to relate to my friends in that aspect. As of writing this I have 8 games I have purchased on steam, all of them under 20 bucks, only having convinced my mother to swap the fee from my dollar bills to her credit card for two of those games. Others, I had to sneakily buy a steam giftcard for. I'm not usually interested in $30+ purchases, but I would be willing to spend $60 bucks on one game if it would last me a long time.

On to my setup: My family has two laptops. One is an old beaten up MacBook Pro with very limited space and a broken wifi antenna that will only connect you if you are five feet from the router. The only thing good about this hunk of metal is that it still runs Mojave, which supports 32-bit games, which are most of them. My dad is the only one who uses this computer aside from myself every now and then, which leads to me not using it very often. The other computer is the one I use most often, our family MacBook Air, which has completely normal wifi, and is also close to running out of space, which means I can only have two games downloaded on here at a time, it also runs Catalina, which only supports 64-bit applications (thanks apple), which is really limiting on the games on the market. Since it's a family computer and all my older siblings have their own now that they're wriggling their way through the expectations of college, I mostly share it with my mom. The good thing about that is that she's very generous with it, and usually let's me have it during the night, when I'm hanging out with my friends online. She also is the only one working as an essential worker in the house, so I have it for most of the day over the weekends and some week days. The fact that I use macOS also sucks because it eliminates about half the games on steam from playability. 

My mouse is a shitty dell mouse that has lasted me three years that I got from a gift shop. It's large a large clunky average office mouse with an extraordinarily slow dpi. My headphones, on the other hand, are the only things I'm grateful for. They have a decent adjustable mic with them, and overall good sound quality, and I got them on amazon for only 34 bucks. 

Most computers I've been looking into are cheap enough for me to save up for, though seeing as that's relying on family members sending holiday money as a gift, which is more kind to me than they know, savings don't seem too reliable. For anyone who's going to suggest it, talking with my mom about negotiating a purchase is a no-go. My mom loves us all very much but is a terrible listener. So... pretty much a normal parent. In terms of money, I apparently have a good 1,000 dollars in my bank account from some really old stock in McDonalds that my grandparents bought, but I want to use that for a car, so that I can get a job in town. I have about 50 dollars all together from shoveling the neighbor's lawn and stuff like that. I'm scared that it won't matter because I'll have my own laptop by the time I'm in college, so please, if anyone has survived this kind of situation, I would love some advice!",31Jul2020,1
304,"Introduction:
For about a month and a half I've worked at a local fast food restaraunt. Its a really popular family and truckerstopping location. An Indian couple bought the place from a long time owner about a month before I got hired. The man is very passionate about making the restaraunt as profitable and efficient as possible. I respected this a lot and worked really hard sharing some of his passion. The woman is generally laid back and likes to talk with me a lot about schooling and our common interests. I only ever worked with these two. The mans job was to cook food, the woman's to take orders and mine to put condiments on and pack takeout bags. Most days it was really slow so the woman would tend to doze off and sleep in the back. The man would prep food and I would ask him if there was anything for me to do but most times he told me to stand at my station waiting for customers. Whenever a customer came it was my job to tell the man so he would wake his wife up to take the order. There was never a problem with this other the it would keep the customer waiting a little longer. The man would get a little frustrated at his wife for sleeping at the job then they would talk in their native language for around 10 min loudly across the kitchen. While this happend I always do my best to ignore it and talk to customers. 

Incident:
After her falling asleep that day their argument went on longer than usual around 30 min. She fell asleep again then they had another argument. This time it was around 15 min across the kitchen till she left the cash register and went into the back with him. Meanwhile there's 3 customers lined up some burgers on the grill, fries in the fryer and just me to handle it. I was never trained in using the cash register so I didn't want to mess anything up naturally. I was also told at the start that only he touches the meat because he know how to cook it and if I or the woman poisoned someone it wouldn't be good obviously. I decided to finish what I knew how to do, condiments, fries, onion rings, etc. When I was completing the last order I heard a slam noise of wood falling on the floor more yelling to the point of borderline screaming, crying and another wood slam. I assumed from the sound he threw a wooden broomstick hanle that was leaning against the wall at the time at her. The customers were just starring at me while I acted calm and finished the order. Burgers are looking almost done so I flip them. Check them like he usually does to make sure its cooked completely till he comes out from the back while I'm checking them grabs the tongs out of my hands and says loudly ""fuck you doing man"". This shook me so I jumped back to my station and didn't say a thing, he then looked at me and yelled ""You always standing wasting money I work like donkey all day then you ask for work like a child just work don't talk"". About 3 min later she comes out with teared up eyes sniffing holding her right arm on her chest with a cloth. This imidietly put the thought in my head that I'm in danger. I knew my parents were going to come for dinner here that day so while working I thought of what I needed to take with me to leave and guarantee my parents don't come. Lo and behold my parents arrive at the same time it gets a little busy. During all these order I'm working really hard to make sure the mans job is as easy as possible. My parents decided to stay and eat outside meaning I had to wait till they left to leave. I realized that the best option was to wait till the man went to do something in the back then leave grab my water bottle act like I'm going to the bathroom drop my work attire on the sink counter then just leave. On the last customer the man decided to yell at her once more then storm into the back. She went and put a burger on the grill and stood there holding her arm with tongs in hand staring at the meat. She forgot to give the customer his receipt so she walked back but this time removed her hand holding the cloth on her arm to click ""no"" on the machine and I saw a small bloody mark on her elbow surrounded by a large bruise on the arm. I instantly realized I had to go now. She went back to the grill I grabbed my bottle walked into the bathroom took my plastic gloves off then walked out the door. Forgetting to take my work attire off I got in the car saw the man standing out the back in view of my car. He heard the car starting and stared at me while I drove off. 

Conclusion:
Right when I got home I told my parents about what had happend and what I did. They told me to text the owners saying I left because I didn't feel comfortable and that I won't be working there anymore. Sent 3 days ago they haven't responded and my next shift is in 4 days. I still have a weeks worth of work I haven't been paid for and the work attire. I don't know if I should call the cops and possibly take legal action to get my pay. I'm worried to go back and speak with him because I'll just get yelled at or something. I'm kind of lost as for what I should do...",31Jul2020,1
305,"I'm only 18 years old, literally just turned 18 a few months ago and I'm scared of how my life is going.

I'm a toxic person. And I fear the posibility of not being able to change myself, to become better.  
Everyday I try to change, be optimistic, don't let my anger issues ruin my relationship with my parents and friends; but everytime I just end up fucking it all up and go back to being a stupid asshole.  
I don't want to be a villain in my parents' life, I don't want to make them suffer, but it's just routine. Every conversation turns into an argument and it's my fault. The mood in my home is suffocating and I'm the one to blame.

Sometimes I really feel like it'd be better if I just died, to be a tragic story with an abrupt ending and prevent myself from making the people I love suffer more.

306,"TLDR: A bunch of teens cause chaos in my neighborhood at night and I caught one of them dancing on top of my car. 

For context: I live in a nice neighborhood. Nothing fancy, but it's in a nice part of the suburbs, near some elementary/middle schools, and two minutes from a police station. My townhouse is right near a small parking lot. Not huge, just like a long line of parking for the neighbors / one small park. 

Also I know I complain about teenagers a lot in this, but I am actually a teenager myself.

Every night, after about 10:00 pm, my neighborhood comes alive. Small groups of teens occasionally hang out in the parking lot in their cars, some of them play music or yell. 

But it's been getting much worse lately. Some have set off fireworks nearby. There are constantly loud booms from unknown sources (not fireworks). They broke into my garage and stole two bikes. Once they rang my doorbell rapidly at 2 in the morning, which sent me into a panic attack as I thought robbers were trying to kill me (I have issues with anxiety). 

Tonight (or this morning if you get technical) at 1:00 am, I heard some talking/laughter so I look outside. My car is parked out front of my house, in the parking spots for the community, under a small street lamp. And under the light of this street lamp I can see A TEENAGER DANCING ON TOP OF MY CAR WHILE HIS FRIENDS FILM HIM. I am very protective of my car, and I pride myself on keeping it in pristine condition. So to see this kid ON TOP OF MY CAR ignites a fiery rage in me. 

I whip open my front door and stand on my front porch until they notice me. The kid that was on my car is now stumbling around the street, clearly drunk. He notices me and says ""hello ma'am."" I tell him and his three friends to get away from my car. His friends seem extremely embarrassed and start apologizing profusely, saying it won't happen again. I say good, because if I see you near my car again I'm calling the cops. The friends start apologizing again, saying there is no need to call the cops and that they won't touch my car ever again. The drunk friend tells me to tell the cops that he says hello. They all walked away, the one stumbling and laughing.

So I have two questions:

1. Did I do the right thing in telling the teens to get away from my car?
2. How do I deal with the unruly teenagers in my neighborhood? More importantly, how do I keep my property / car safe? I don't have room in my family's garage to park my car.",31Jul2020,1
307,"  

I am very unhappy and isolated at the moment, and don’t know what to do with my life. I have a few options but don’t know how to make such a big life decision without being too biased.

I graduated college in June and moved back in with family, who I am not close with, out of state. I don’t know anyone here and have never lived here before. I have been applying for jobs all summer, but am having a hard time finding any, especially any that pay decently. I miss my friends, who I am very close to and who live near where we all went to college. I got into a master’s program, but unless they offer me a good amount of financial aid, it will be expensive. Plus, I would have to find an apartment, which I have never had to do before, especially long distance. However, getting a master would make getting into a PhD program down the road much easier. If I don’t go get my masters degree, I plan on applying for PhD programs this fall/winter, which would theoretically be more well-funded, and hopefully a more traditional school setting if covid has died down some. If I wait a year and do this, I don’t know what to do in the year leading up to it- find a job where I am and hope to make friends/get a life, or move to live near my supportive friends and work there. My friends, the master’s program, and the PhD programs I plan on applying to are all in the same region of the country. I think I would be happier moving, but this would mean I wouldn’t be saving as much money. 

I know this is a dumb reason to ask for advice, but I am really conflicted, and would love to hear some outside opinions.",31Jul2020,1

309,"I started talking to my girlfriend in February and we made it official in March. A few months later we found out she’s actually pregnant with her ex’s baby (we think). We think this because her doctor said it was a certain weeks old and it’s a 2-3 weeks off from when we first had sex. 

I was hesitant at first but decided to stay with her because she’s actually a great girl and I really like her. I’m not sure if I love her fully but I definitely have thought about spending the rest of my life with her. It’s just that we are kind of different people with different views. We have similarities but it’s more differences than anything. This is what is making me a little nervous.

Onto the baby. She’s due in November and we initially decided to not tell the biological father because he was abusive. However apparently he needs to sign the birth certificate or something to give up the rights to the baby. This means that we have to tell him.

We don’t want to. She’s scared for her safety and my safety too. 

To avoid this, she suggested that we get married in the sense of going to the court house and signing the legal documents so we are married. This means I will sign the birth rights (or whatever it is) and we don’t have to tell the biology father. I was and am hesitant about this because I’m not 100% sure if we are going to work out. 

I’m just thinking about myself in the future. We’ve only really dated barely 5 months. We’re in long distance. She’s still in school for another 10 years at least (regular + dental + Ortho). She still lives with her parents and probably will for a very long time. Im moving closer to her. I do want to live with her alone but she wants to live at home until married. Sorry, guess I needed to rant too. 


I guess I want to know a few things:
1. Can the biological father really sue if we don’t tell him? 
2. Will a prenup even make a difference?
3. Is prenup the right thing to do if all I want to ensure is that I don’t have to pay child support for the child that isn’t mine if we ever get a divorce?
4. Does anyone have some experience like this and have advice on what to do? 
5. Any other thing I can do? 
6. Am I the asshole? Lol",31Jul2020,1
310,"I’ll try to keep this brief and let people ask for more details if needed. But here it is.

My husband and I have a friend who started having marital problems early this year, which led to a divorce. Her living situation with her ex was toxic so we encouraged her to come stay with us for a few months while she figured things out.

Well after a month or so of her living with us it became clear that it wasn’t going as expected. We had told her in advance that we didn’t expect any rent money out of her, just that she help out with cleaning communal areas (pretty much just kitchen and bathroom) and share in the cooking with us. She ate meals we cooked all the time for the first several weeks, (which we said she could do) but never cooked for us in return, although she cooked for herself daily. She also never participated in the cleaning she agreed to, really the only shared chore she participated in was the dishes.

My husband and I did our best to let it go and talked each other down from our annoyance, reminding ourselves and each other that she is depressed and going through a lot and struggling to work up the energy to help out. We didn’t mention it to her for quite some time, but it came up recently (she’s been here over 3 months now) and now she claims she actually has been cleaning all along, (I’m positive she hasn’t) and that she didn’t remember ever agreeing to cook. She feels its unreasonable that we expected that out of her, but we werent asking her to do much, and she never said this in the beginning when she agreed to it.

Another issue that came up recently was that she and us clearly had different expectations about the social aspect of this living situation, which I think was a communication error on all of our parts, honestly. She thought we were going to want to talk to her, hang out and pay attention to her all the time. My husband and I are introverted, and generally make social plans with friends no more than a couple times a month, and our house is small, so we weren’t prepared to be “on” 24/7 for her, so yeah, I fully admit we have spent a lot of time ignoring her. And as time went on, and we started feeling more and more taken advantage of by her and resentful of her constant presence, working around her, and our lack of privacy, we felt even more burnt out and ignored her even more. This understandably hurt her feelings. 

We’ve given her an end date for her time living here now, which is the end of the four month mark, and it doesn’t even seem like the friendship is going to survive. I’ve just been bouncing back and forth between feeling irritated and taken advantage of, frustrated with her seeming lack of gratitude and dishonesty/selective memory, but also feeling guilty for not being there for her in the ways she expected that we would be. 

I think it was a mistake to let her come stay here because I think it created an unhappy and unhealthy living situation for all three of us, I’m not sure whose fault that is or if it’s anyone’s fault, but i have no idea how to address it moving forward. It’s looking like there will be very little communication between now and the day she moves out, and I don’t know if I still want her in my life after this is over but I’m not sure it’s right of me to abandon her. 

There’s a lot more to it than that but that’s the basic gist of the situation. Any opinions or advice is appreciated.",31Jul2020,1

He's gay so there is no Love or sexual stuff involved.

So we were best friends, had a big fight, I started ghosting, he started insulting over and over, I cut contact. Blocked him everywhere.

Then he started trying to come back into my life. Made fake Instagram accounts, convinced friends to be invited to parties that I was invited to. Tried to befriend my Bf. 

While he was doing this, my feelings towards the situation can be categorized into 3 stages.
1. It hurt me, because the ""wound"" didnt heal yet.
2. I thought it was funny, because I started to forget and live my life normally again, while he can't seem to let it go, it was so desperate that I thought it was funny how pathetic he is.
3. It started to annoy the fuck out of me. Just makes me angry.

Right now I'm at stage 3, my Bf and friends seem to be at stage 2, which I understand, I also thought it was funny a while back. 

Then he contacted my friend, asking her ""what did she tell you about the fight we had?"" And saying ""you can't trust anybody 100%, I just want you to be safe, there's people that will always stab you in the back, no matter how much you think you know them""

My friends all think its funny, and dont wanna block him, and I get that, I also thought it was funny. 

How do I get home to stop? I dont wanna talk to him, cause that's what he wants. He always leaves me alone for like 2 months, and then tries to sliver back into my life, as if he doesn't want me to forget him or something.

I don't know who my roommate is, I can't bring most of my stuff bc the beds are different sizes, and the rooms aren't really rearrangeable and they're kinda small. On the other hand, the place looks really cool. I mean there's a freaking koi pond! And this isn't something that I'd ever be able to afford in any other situation.

There's a shuttle to the school and stuff, so there's no worry there, but what do you think it'll be like? It's not the typical commuter situation or regular dorming.

This past month, my friend has been texting me ALL DAY EVERYDAY asking me to go for bike rides (He can’t even keep up with me and stops for a break every 500 metres). Whenever I try to turn him down he says stuff like, “cmon man” or “ I was really looking forward to this.” Whenever I do turn him down, he always wants to know when I’ll be available next. And sometime later he starts the same conversation all over again and my response is the same. We often play game pigeon games and he wants to play the same thing over and over again back to back. I’ve told him I’m introverted and that I like my time on my own. I’d also like to spend time with other friends. This has gone to the extent where he has taken all my time away from me and I’m not able to keep up with my daily routine and I wasn’t able to respect the curfew my parents gave me. Whenever I have school work I tell him that when I’m done I’ll ride over to his house but while I’m doing work he says things like, “when will you come?” “You done yet?” “So you coming?” “Can you leave now please?” “Have you left yet?” Litteraly every 5-10 minutes it drives me crazy. He can’t take any of my hints either so it’s like I need to spell it out for him and be straight up and lowkey rude. He always calls me and texting me 24/7 and it’s really annoying and he’s become a nuisance. At times I enjoy his company and all but he’s so needy and annoying. Whenever we disagree on a topic he’s always criticizing my opinion and my thoughts on a certain topic and constantly trying to persuade me into agreeing with him. Example: He’s vegetarian and I’m not and he constantly reminds me and over exaggerates about how meat is very bad for you and it’s like tobacco and cholesterol etc... not to mention he the conversation revolves around him and his lifestyle and he doesn’t shut up at all regardless of what we’re talking about if we’re not even talking.

328,"I rent a part of the house in which I use the neighbours washing machine. She's the one renting out so it's all cool. Good verbal contact.. However for a month, the machine has been broken and as someone who hasn't got a lot of clothes, this is messing me up.

I'm too poor to get one of those small washing machines or to just buy more clothes and I have a really bad back issue where I at only age 20 can't do dishes without severe pain.

I've been manually washing my underwear and socks at least to make sure that front is covered but I'm starting to feel really nasty wearing my clothes that now haven't been washed in way too long.


Any advice on how to deal with this? I live too far away to use friends washing appliances, even when they've offered. Honestly though I might consider taking them up on it soon even if it means hauling laundry on a 2h commute.",31Jul2020,1

Today was the straw that broke the camels back. 

Going to visit a friend at a coffee shop I was driving and a ups driver ran into the street, the suv in front of me stopped short and I slammed on the brakes but not in time and i rear ended the suv. My grandfather left me this car before he died in 2012 and today I crashed it. The car is very low value so the estimate to fix the damages will very likely be more than the cars worth and it will be totaled. My father saw the car before it was towed to my friends shop and said “you fucked up... this was my fathers car.... where were you goin? That’s gonna be an expensive coffee” as if I needed to hear any of it. 

I used to work but I’ve been collecting unemployment and I’m low on cash. I need to replace the SUV’s rear bumper cover and either fix my car or make a down payment on a used car. Either scenario will leave me with nearly nothing. 

What has really had me down and what made this the last straw was what happened with a girl I’ve been in love with since I first met her when we were 14. It took me 6 years of on and off being friends with her and friend zoned to finally kiss her in February. We kissed for about ten minutes and cuddled for awhile. While cuddling she asked me for a hug which I gave her, she hugged me and after a second or two she squeezed tighter. That was the happiest moment of my life. She told me she was so happy I finally kissed her and how she wanted me to months ago. We eventually kissed goodnight and she left my house. Two days later we met at a coffee shop and she told me she didn’t want to start a relationship and no longer wants to be friends so I’m not “led on”.  She wouldn’t say why she felt like this and we hugged and I left. We have had very minimal communication since then. I am still very much in love with her. I think about her everyday and it’s during times like today where I miss her the most and just want to hug and hold her because I feel like such a fuck up after the car accident. 

I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom and very powerless, unloved, and useless. 

Please someone give me advice on the girl or overall positive comments I feel the lowest I ever have.

Thanks",31Jul2020,1

331,"My boyfriend has been asking to have a threesome with another guy because he wants to ""watch someone fuck me while I blow him and etc"" (his words). The first couple of times he started asking was months ago and he started bringing it up again so I finally agreed to try it. 

He brings me to hang out with his friends often, I enjoy my time they are nice people and we always have a good time together so It's not like I'd be doing it with someone I don't know or get along with. But he wants to do it with his one friend that is also his roommate. I don't know if maybe it could get awkward? I mean his roommate hears us having sex I'm sure but then seeing him everytime I see my boyfriend too afterwards if we had a threesome might get weird too. 

Another thing that I was unsure about is the age gap. I brought this up with my boyfriend but he just said we would just get drunk and it wouldn't matter and it would be fun. Which is probably true I would be less on edge of I was drunk . I'm 19 he is 26 and his friend is 32. I know that dating a 32 year old right now would kind of be red flags but we will probably just have sex once so there isn't any of the weird power dynamic you'd have in a relationship? I guess that's how I'm thinking of it. I already told my boyfriend I would but I want other people's opinions and/or advice for this because I don't know if I should regret this or not.",31Jul2020,1
332,"I know the simple answer is get a job. I did have one and unfortunately had to quit/was fired(both on the same day so I dont know what's on record) 
I had attendance issues due to anxiety, stress and an aversion to fluorescent lighting that causes me to be physically ill. In my job the lighting was fine(LEDs in the store) but the stress also caused me to be physically sick. And being anxious about being sick multiplied it.

I've had anxiety since I was 8, and now having a sensitivity to certain lighting and stress amplifies it and in turn makes my nausea so bad I'll be laying in bed for days sick and miss work.
I dont think I can get disability for this and I would rather avoid that anyway as there are people who actually need it, whereas I'm sure my problems are solvable but I have yet to find a solution.

I've applied to the same retail job as it seems I can go about four months before it gets so bad I cant anymore so I can earn some money. However I know this is probably going to be a vicious cycle the rest of my life and I need advice and alternatives so I can work and make money regardless of my issues.

I live in the USA and I'm a 19 female. Is there legal work I can do from home, or ways to cope with my physical issues?
I tried to sell feet pictures online as I heard it's a good way to make money but only scammers messaged me, I do digital art for fun and have sold some in the past. However even if I make money these ways it's not a sure way of income.

340,"Hi! This is a bit complicated but I’m going to try my best to explain the situation. 

I have worked at this place for 5 years. A friend of a friend (I’ll call him Adrian) got me this job; he’s worked at this place for about 6 years. Adrian and I have always been friendish; we used to hang out in the same friend group in high school. He’s been in a relationship for 4 years now and they’ve lived together for 2. I’ve met the girl a handful of times but I don’t know her well at all. About 3 years ago a girl started working with us (I’ll call her Natalie). Natalie and i became very very good friends. I’d call her one of my best friends. When we all met Natalie she was engaged. In December I found out that Natalie and Adrian had been sleeping together since August 2019.  Since then it’s progressed into them saying “I love you,” talking constantly, messaging while Adrian and girlfriend are on vacation, etc. etc. Natalie ended her engagement in May basically to be with Adrian. But Adrian is still with the girlfriend and Natalie simultaneously. Adrian claims that his girlfriend is a horrible person and he’s too afraid to end things with her — but to me, and everyone besides Natalie (who believes everything Adrian says), the girlfriend doesn’t appear to be horrible enough of a person to be cheated on for a year. It’s really been bothering me since the relationship between Adrian and Natalie has progressed this far and Natalie ended the engagement, but Adrian still hasn’t. The girlfriend caught them texting last October but it wasn’t anything too bad apparently, just a bit flirty. She sent Natalie a text basically saying back off, but as far as I know she doesn’t know it’s still very much in full swing. There’s a lot of ins and outs to this — for example, Adrian’s brothers are very high up in the company. It’s possible I could lose this job if they find out I told this girl. But is it my responsibility to tell the girlfriend that this is happening? It’s really really bothering me. And yes I obviously got too close with my coworkers but I’m now stuck here. 

TL;DR: 2 coworkers I am close with are hooking up. One is now single, one is in a live-in relationship. My responsibility to tell the live-in significant other?

341,"I almost posted this on AskReddit, but luckily I checked the rules right before hitting post and realized this is too personal for that subreddit. This question is more than just a “first job” question, but I wasn’t quite sure what to title it. Basically, i’m going into highschool this year (which will take place online due to covid) and I have really been considering getting a job as early as possible due to the fact that I want to make a lot of changes at home. I’m going to do my best at not getting too into the personal stuff, but i’ll give you the idea of it so it’s easier to understand the situation when giving your advice. The household is my older brother in his early 20’s who doesn’t work and hasn’t in a long time, and my mom who is working her ass off. My brother is difficult, so without getting into it let’s just say him working isn’t in the picture. for a household of three people, one person making minimum wage just doesn’t cut it and a lot of the stress has been put on me while “growing up”, so I guess you could say it made me grow up faster. After years of seeing no one make anything change around the house, I’ve began to feel like it’s my responsibility. It’s hard to dance around the details of all the certain things that bug me without feeling like i’m just whining or ranting, but many small things like a broken washing machine and a clogged kitchen sink that we can’t fix due to the financial situation (and use buckets in to keep them from filling up) are just a couple of the things that contribute to stressing me out as I go about my day. They just aren’t things you can ignore and along with many other things, it piles onto the stress every time I go to grab a plate and they’re greasy because we can’t thoroughly wash them in our clogged sink. I also share a room with my so called “difficult” brother which is in no way a joy. now that you have the background information without getting too personal, it’s time for the questions. Given the circumstances, should I feel like it’s my responsibility to fix these things? i’m willing to start doing packets for school so that I can work full time as soon as I turn 16, but after things like even just car insurance and gas I am not expecting much money to spend on other things. That becomes an issue because I feel like the only way I’ll have my own room is if I start contributing towards rent, but that leaves no room for personal needs like a new mattress, bed frame, room decorations (when I eventually have my own space) and food. It becomes an even bigger issue when I realize I’ll have no money leftover to spend on my hobbies like guitar, skateboarding, and occasionally making beats on the computer and I won’t even have time to spend on these things with how much I plan on working. I know these things aren’t my responsibility, but it feels like they are due to the fact that i’m the only one who’s willing to change things while also being the only person here who can’t work yet. The question isn’t whether I should sit around at home vs. work my ass off, because I know the answer to that is working. It’s more a question of what should I do for money? The first step is obviously to get my first job, but it’s hard to know where to go from there when I won’t have any money leftover for myself and I need a plan to get a more stable income and move out whenever it’s possible. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for listening and hopefully this wasn’t too personal or all over the place. If you know a better place for this thread, please suggest it in your response. I may have left out something important, as It’s hard to know where to even start for a topic like this but if your advice requires a few factors that I didn’t mention or clarify then feel free to ask.

But that’s not true they can’t be what they want. Because life’s fucked up. And yeah I kinda just want to die but I would feel bad for my family.

343,"I legally changed my name over the summer because I’m starting a new chapter in my life. my family was able to get involved with this somewhat; I chose my first name and they chose my middle. 

when my sister finally graduated and walked the stage a week or so ago I was very surprised and put off to hear she had added my old middle name behind her own, and even more so to overhear her later excitedly discussing with my mom taking it on legally herself. 

she never asked me how I felt about her doing this but it makes me extremely uncomfortable. my old name is connected to a lot of painful memories and self hatred (not directly, but because it was who I was during that time), and when she says she wants to take it it feels like she’s taking that disgusting pained being I no longer am and pinning it proudly to herself. 

Presumably the reason she wants to take it is because it is our great grandmother’s (my mother’s father’s mother) name. But my old name was my given name. It was GIVEN to me upon my birth. It was mine to use and then leave. My mom wants me to reconsider because it is a family name she doesn’t want to die. But my current middle name is my grandma’s (my mother’s mother) maiden name, which I took specifically for them as a peace offering even though I honestly don’t like it that much. My mom says the two names are from her fathers and mothers side and I am only preserving one with my new middle name. 

I am very frustrated and beyond angry that my sister only considered my mother’s feelings on this and didn’t even think to ask me how I felt about it or any negative associations I have with it. Now it’s immortalized on the video of her graduation. I just want that part of my life to die so I can move on but it feels like she won’t let it even though I know that’s not her intention. 

I can’t actually have a conversation with my sister about this because she’s highly reactionary and a little emotionally unstable and she’ll think I’m attacking her or something and I still have to live with her, so I’m fighting with my mom over it. 

I’m at a loss over how to reconcile this without actually talking to and upsetting my sister. Should I just suck it up and get over it?",31Jul2020,1

People keep saying that I’m over-exaggerating, that I just had the flu. I took the flu test, strep test, and blood analysis test multiple times, and they all came back negative for anything of that sort.

I went to vent on a different subreddit and (I reported this comment already) this person told me that I was weak and pathetic. That I just had the flu. I didn’t list all of my symptoms, only a handful because I was venting more about how this was the first time that I ever truly wanted to die. I felt so sick, that I kept asking God to kill me. 

I just want some advice on how to deal with people who don’t believe me when I describe how sick I was. My mom who took care of me when I had it says that I 100% had it. A couple of my family members think I’m just over-exaggerating. It feels so saddening and annoying. I can’t even express how I felt without being told that I’m just weak or pathetic.

353,"There's this girl who I don't really know. We've had a handful of classes together and she's really nice, caring and I think socially awkward (kinda like me).  The problem is, I'm actually really scared of talking to people.

For more context, basically my whole life, I've tried many times to make friends but, it always ended up being a disaster. From ghosting, bullying, spreading rumors, pretending like I don't exist anymore, moving without telling me, backstabbing, the list goes. Plus, it was heavily one-sided like 99% of the time (on my end).
To sum it all up, almost all of then were being less then decent people. I've only had one, yes one person, actually tell me what I did wrong and just moved on. I'm fairly confident that she'd tell me if she didn't want to but I really don't know for sure.

However this girl, who I barely even know, makes me feel really strongly about her. Like I just feel like something is pulling me towards her. I'll just list some reasons why I think so :

  - She's always made an effort to try and include me in conversations. I don't talk much but, I'm still appreciative for it.

  - Not too long ago, my hands started to get really bad like full of scratches, red, had a really rough texture and was kinda painful. She took notice and hounded me for weeks to go to the clinic (my mom thought that I wasn't a big deal so I didn't). Then they started to get ridiculously painful and a really bright red color. She took notice instantly and kept scolding for about two days, saying that she was going to drag me to one herself if I didn't go soon (I didn't really push my mom to take me to a clinic because, honesty, I don't really care about myself). Seeing her worry so much made me feel awful, for letting worry for so long so, I argued with my mom the whole day until finally, she said we'd go the next day. We got this stuff that healed my hand pretty quickly. The girl was really happy and relieved when I told her.
 Sorry for this one being so long.

  - Before the whole pandemic happened, I was going through a really rough time and I didn't tell anyone. Some of my casual friends started to figure out that something was up but, they didn't knew exactly. Without going into too much detail, my mental health was the lowest it ever got. Anyways, I guess that girl I think noticed some patterns and started to check on me almost daily, letting me hug her for a bit and just treating me like a person. I've never had someone go out if their way for me and, I really do appreciate everything she did. Even if it seems insignificant to her. Though, I wasn't there at all before the whole thing happened so, I don't know how she took that. I hope she's doing well.

While she's just really an awesome person in general, there's still another issue, or maybe two more issues.

One issue is that I really don't want to hurt her. Considering how my mental health is and I really can't get help for another year or two, who knows how unstable I am. I just have this feeling that I'll do something that I regret/unforgivable to someone or something. It might not happen but still. I'm not well mentally and I don't want to risk hurting another person because of it.

The last issue is that... I might like LIKE her but I can't tell if it's out of extreme loneliness or genuine. I'm worried that I might only think like this because she's bi and/or nice to me. It would pretty bad if that were the case.I mean, ever since school stopped, I just missed her so badly for some reason. Lately, I've been missing her so bad that, I just hope that school will be open for one day. So I can maybe ask to get to know her or talk to her on idk an app or something. I just really miss her, you know. I just feel like I'll just regret running away this time. Obviously, of that's the case, I'm going to put her as a friend first. Just incase she isn't interested in that way, probably isn't anyways.

I don't know what do honestly. It's all just so confusing. A part me really hopes that I'm just overthinking all of this but, I also hope I'm really not. Should I get to know her? Or should I just keep my distance? Any help will be greatly appreciated. 

Also, I'm sorry that this is so long.",31Jul2020,1
354,"So with this COVID situation, I (M25) and my brother (M21) came home. He's in college 2nd year and it's been around 4 months since we are stuck at home. In these 4 months, there has been a lot of fights in my family. Majorly because of sleeping till 12, not respecting elders, for being on his phone all-day, for not studying and his behavior. 

Whenever my parents point out his mistakes he starts arguing and it always turns into a big fight. With them trying to make him realize his mistake and him arguing against it. He will say really mean things but I know he doesn't mean it, it's because he's angry. I think he's in a lot of mental stress.

He has no respect left for parents and feels that they think ill of him. He now has this fuck-all attitude like fuck parents, fuck education who needs a job, whenever we try to discuss something he goes like so what? He feels we are bullying him and he's the victim, but when we are trying to help him.

He has some serious temper issues and gigantic ego. I wouldn't say it's all his fault, parents are orthodox and not very lenient but they don't mean ill. I tried talking to him and figure out things but his hatred for parents has already taken deep roots.

Today after a fight he left home and we don't know where he is. I hope he calms down and comes back soon. What do I do, how can I make it right?",31Jul2020,1
355,"I don't feel like I love my partner. I used to be super infatuated with him 2 years ago, over very logical reasons like how responsible he is, how kind he is etc and wanted badly to win him over (he kept being unsure about whether to commit to a relationship so i guess i took it as a challenge). During my ""tough times"" a year ago, I kept thinking of him to get me pass them, just the thought of him makes me happy. I would travel very very far just to be able to see him and spend time with him cos it makes me happy too. But, I keep doing things that makes him upset and disappointed.. 

So I was just coasting along in my relationship. We haven't really communicated much during COVID because I was busy with school and he's busy with work. I started a new online game and met someone on the game. You see where this is heading. After maybe about 2 weeks of chatting with this guy, I ended my relationship. Not necessarily that I want to be with this guy, but I just don't feel the same way over my relationship. Also, there were stuff that I was unhappy about in my relationship that was never resolved despite me voicing out multiple times, so I was just like ""ah, f-it"" and decided to end it there and then. 

In the end, the guy asked to meet up with me irl and we started to just casually date for about a few weeks. I was definitely feeling very infatuated ie. heart beating fast and excitement. I found out some stuffs about this new guy and said we shouldn't continue to date, but I don't mind just being friends and just chatting. But he still has feelings for me..  I question how genuine the feelings are for me though but that's another thing altogether, I feel he likes me so intensely because his rs just failed months ago and that we're able to click and connect well. For me, I still want to talk because I want to just be a friend and be there for him esp because he's feeling really sad that nothing is going his way right now. But, I still have some feelings. Somehow logically it just doesn't make sense. In terms of character, I feel my current partner is way more ""solid"" and reliable well just based on these few months alone. but I'm definitely more similar to the new guy in terms of how we act and behave ... (impulsively?)

Meanwhile, with my ex, he was super depressed after I initiated the breakup and kept crying so much and barely eating at the thought of me not being in his life anymore. We were in NC for a very short period of time, but he said that he promised me to help out with job hunting so he started chatting to me about it. Eventually I said that we should try again with our relationship after I found out things about that new guy and was pretty upset. All the stuff I had issues with in the past, he works hard to resolve them now. I tried to break up again but barely 12 hours later his family member texts me and said that I broke his heart and that he's crying badly again. 

Now I'm in NC with the new guy, it's not even a week but I keep thinking about him and how I want to talk to him, and wondering how is he. It's like, I just want to be able to talk and not necessarily be in a relationship. :/ 

I've been super honest with my partner about how I feel towards the new guy, and we always just debate about whether we should just let go of our relationship or not. But I also feel it' would be such a mistake, cause now I have no problems with the relationship except about how I feel towards him.  

\----

**I think I'm mostly seeking advice on whether all these feelings (of not feeling love?) towards a partner of a few years is normal. Was it because I based my judgment to enter a relationship on ""logical"" reasons, and that's why I don't feel ""love""?**",31Jul2020,1
356,"This is embarrassing/difficult for me to talk about to the few people I know, so I'm turning to the random people of the internet for advice.

My dad found out he had stage 4 cancer that was basically untreatable and I quit my job and moved my husband and toddler to my family's farm and tried my best to help them out for the last couple of years. My father passed away recently and now things have gotten weirder than I was expecting.

My parents have several children, I'm the youngest and have always been the kind of ""go-to"" kid for them when I came to helping around their house and property. They honestly weren't good parents, there was a lot of mental abuse and some other things I don't care to talk about. Basically I was raised in a sort of cult-like manner and groomed to be their permanent live-in servant who shouldn't question them about anything. Once I was allowed to go to work (due to my parents needing more money) in my early 20s I realized my life wasn't normal and began sneaking to therapy sessions thanks to an amazing boss and coworkers who covered for me.


Eventually I met my future husband, and we moved in together, which finally got me out of my parents house. They were not happy about that and badmouthed myself and my husband to anyone they could, that is until we had a baby. Once they had a new grandchild they wanted us back in their lives and acted sweet and caring. I fell for it because I wanted it to be true and when my dad got sick I, stupidly, came running to help.

My siblings and I had always thought/hoped that it was mainly our dad that was the controlling one and that once he passed away (I know that sounds terrible) maybe our mom would be able to break free of all the cruelty and mean spirited actions. Turns out we were wrong, our mother is the worse of the pair of them and she's been being horribly manipulative towards all of us. 

I'm done with her. I need to move my husband and our child away from her as fast as I can. We live in a small rural area and jobs are hard to come by, we live on roughly $800 a month and a government food allowance. My husband is trying to find a job in a bigger area so we can move, but jobs are hard to find during normal times let alone right now. One of us has to stay home with our child because we can't afford daycare and have no one we trust that can watch her full-time.

My mom found out we're planning to move and now I'm scared that she'll do something to the trailer we live in to force us to move in with her. That's what she wants, a live-in servant and a toddler to indoctrinate into her twisted lifestyle. 

What can I/we do to get help? I don't know what options poverty level people with poor credit and student loans have. Any advice is greatly appreciated. And thank you to anyone who reads this, I know it's quite long, I apologize.",31Jul2020,1

360,"BACK STORY: I (21F) live about an hour away from my family. I'm going to college and live completely independent from my (52F) mom. My mom lives with my (62F)Aunt currently as she lost my childhood home to foreclosure 3 years ago. My mom and aunt come from extremely abusive parents and havent had their trauma treated. There is also some trauma from my mom and in that house I’m still recovering from. 

2 weeks ago, my mom called me explaining that she woke up earlier that week with partial paralysis in her legs. My aunt was taking on a 2 week gig 30 minutes away from her home that paid her pretty good money and asked me to come take care of her. I had a trip planned on the 25th to scout out where me and my partner want to live. I was also finishing a summer internship at the time. Because of my aunt taking this gig, I had to cancel my trip, finish my internship abruptly with some unfinished projects, and not be able to work at my part time job which I need the money. This isn't my aunt or mom's fault but having to take care of her in a house where I experienced trauma while putting my life on hold has been really tough. It also doesn't help that my mom has mentioned multiple times that she feels bad about this situation because she wouldn't do the same for me if the roles were reversed and I believe her.

My mom had her surgery to repair the paralysis earlier this week. The doctors wanted her to be discharged to a rehab facility after her hospital stay in order to help her recover. She found out today that she cannot afford it and will have to go home in the next few days. My aunt keeps extending her paying gig so I do not have any idea when she will be coming back home. My aunt came home briefly today to do some cleaning at the house. She tried moving my moms car to mow the lawn and broke the key in the ignition. I understand mistakes happen, but the entire conversation she was deflecting her blame, saying my mom shouldn't have bought this car and it's the ignition switch going out. This is another thing I have to take care of for them.
I really can't afford to miss another week of work. I start my semester on August 17th. When I start back, I will only be able to work weekends if I even have the energy as I will be interning 8 hour days through the week. I feel like I’m being used because they know I’ll always help them. I don't think my mom or aunt really understand how much I've had to sacrifice or how much they're putting on me. So WIBTA to tell them I can’t keep taking care of my mom?

TL:DR my mom who I live an hour away from has had serious health complications. Both her and my aunt depend on me to take care of her while my aunt works an almost 3 week gig now. I have put my life on hold and havent been able to work because of this. I don't feel like I can keep this up anymore and I don't know what to do when my mom gets discharged from the hospital.",31Jul2020,1
361,"This is not a troll. This really happened to me.

I’m 18M.

A little background: My dad and I never got along. He’s extremely narcissistic and controlling. He has a really hot temper. If anything isn’t done his way or on his own time he’ll flip his shit and yell insults and threats for hours. Growing up I’ve always avoided him in order to minimize any conflict. Since he pays for my college my plan has always been to lay low until I get my degree, get a job and move out.

About a month ago or so my dad was doing something with the internet and needed to come to my closet since the router is there. While there he saw a bowl of noodles that I had eaten the night before. This made him angry and he did his yelling and that was that. I will admit though that it was an honest mistake on my part since I forgot I even put the bowl there and it could’ve attracted ants.

Earlier today the exact same thing happened except this time but this time I cleaned the bowl and put it in my closet to bring down the next day. This time though my dad was even more mad and went to complain to my mom. They got into an argument and it eventually got to the point where my dad explicitly told me “You ruined my life, I’ll kill you if I have to.” He also said that he’s going to divorce my mom and that he’s taking me to court.

So right now I’m still at home. I’m scared for my life because my dad is pretty crazy when he’s angry and I’m not sure what to do right now. I don’t have a job or car, and I don’t have any money saved. I really don’t know if this is the right place to ask for this but I just need someone to guide me in the right direction from here.",31Jul2020,1
362,"Hi everyone, first off thank you for taking your time reading and giving me advice (anything helps honestly)!

I (F/21) recently just graduated college with a Bachelors in Media and Communication - and I finished getting my BA a bit before the pandemic hit and then ""attended"" the virtual graduation.

I initially was planning to do many internships (content creating &amp; wedding planner assistant) and they either transitioned into remote - and some are on hold because of the pandemic. I'm still working a lot of building up my resume like learning how to build a website and working with different softwares like Adobe and others relating to my field. 

I've been doing a lot of research and learning about what makes me a great candidate to get hired from honestly any companies that needs a content creator or anything related to a tech/digital media field... but I keep getting rejected because of my lack of experience. Are there anything that a tech job would look for, in a recent grad student that may stand out?

I'm just getting more and more stressed out about it... so if there's any advice/tips/ self experience related to being a recent uni grad, that would be great! Thank you!!",31Jul2020,1

365,"Throughout high school I (now 18F) had a friend (19M) who would frequently give me large amounts of money as gifts, without expecting anything in return. I was foolish at the time, and without a job, so I always accepted. Now that we have both graduated high school and I have started my own job, albeit quite small, the arrangement has ended. Naturally I went and totalled up all that I had been given over Venmo:

$5365 over the course of a little over two years. Which is a LOT for gifts from friend to friend. And now that I'm older and have realized this, I feel absurdly guilty.

I don't even know how long it would take me to save up enough to pay him back, especially while having to pay car insurance and saving up for school, but should I? At what point is a gift too much?",31Jul2020,1
366,"So to be clear, i’m at summer camp for three weeks and mine and my friends’ things have started disappearing and reappearing in weird circumstances.

One of many examples:
A friend is going home to day and she couldn’t find an article of clothing yesterday. We looked everywhere, especially behind the toilet cause she remembered putting the clothing on the toilet seat. 
Then, she told another friend, who promptly asked her if she was sure it wasn’t there, then went into her room and then into the bathroom. When she came out, she had the missing clothing in her hand. 

This has happened with some other items (mostly clothes), all of which were pretty expensive. When you tell that one friend, the lost item mysteriously reappears. 

Now, I personally like this friend of mine a lot. She’s usually totally ok and chilled out, but recently she’s been acting different, I might even say a little toxic.

She’s already got some mental problem history, specifically depression, self-harm and anorexia (she’s been in a mental hospital for five weeks). She’s also nicotine-addicted (smokes, juuls) and drinks a lot. This wouldn’t be weird for and adult, but she’s in her early teens. To sum this paragraph up, she’s just a really problematic child. 


Now that you’ve got some background, we can get to the part where I need advice.
With the stealing, I first thought it might be kleptomania caused by all her other mental problems (she still regularly has breakdowns) and that she might need help. But now that I’ve read up on kleptomania, I doubt she’s struggling with it. She steals stuff she personally wants, not random stuff she doesn’t even need. She also doesn’t seem to be guilty afterwards or have any other urges. Thus I don’t really think she need mental help.

So please, what do I even do? I’m struggling here, and I’m really not interested in any kind of drama.",31Jul2020,1

This year, I graduated. Or...at least I was supposed to. Due to Covid, I fell into a deep depression and had little to no motivation to finish the last few months of classes I had left. So I failed them. But I’ve done this before so my teachers enrolled me in summer school to make up the last few credits I was missing.

The problem is, I didn’t do those either. I still feel terrible everyday, and every time I tried to get a single assignment done I just couldn’t. But now, the new school year is starting again and just about everyone in my life assumed I graduated already when I haven’t at all. When my parents asked if I completed everything, I agreed in a panic.

Now, I’m terrified to tell them the truth. 

Personally, I don’t think graduating a year late a big deal, I don’t mind it. But I’m petrified of disappointing them. I already did this once but I gave up and did it agin, so just thinking about how they would feel makes me feel even worse than before. 

So how do I go about tell them this without upsetting them?

I just don’t want to keep this up and have a letter come in saying I’m still a student, I want to tell them myself. But I’m terrified. Any advice helps, thank you very much.

It's nice of her to watch my dog because she is a lot cheaper than a regular dog sitter. She has done nice things for me but she has also done rude and mean things as well and i'm having a hard time deciding whether I should keep her as a friend.

\- She has put me down in front of her boyfriend and then encouraged him to do it too. (He didn't thankfully)

\- One time I spent ages doing my makeup and the first thing she said when she saw me was ""wow you look tired""

\- She has told me that the way I look makes her feel bad about herself so she didn't even want to go out with me anymore.

\- I listen to all of her problems during her depressive episodes and have given her nothing but encouraging words and then when I have a problem all she says is ""get better soon""

\-One time she let my dog off leash next to a busy roadside

I mean that's just the tip of the iceberg to be honest. She has a key to my apartment because she dog sits and then she tries to show it off to people like a trophy. 

I have never said anything but encouraging words to her, I have done my best to accommodate her problems, I even helped her boyfriend find an apartment and she didn't even help or offer any. I offered my home as a safe space for  her if she ever needed it. I found out I had heart problems and all she said to me was ""wow that's crazy, sorry about your heart."" and then proceeded to just talk about herself and her problems.

Life has felt so slow all throughout HS and now that i've graduated I feel like i'll be getting old any second now. I moved out with my BF after graduating and almost done my first year of uni. Im turning 19 in DEC and I feel like this year flew so fast, I feel like my two younger siblings have already grown up so much and my older brother (20) has already acomplished so much as his age. I'm worried I wont be able to do as much and my younger siblings will even do more in life than I will. I feel like I've already wasted so much valuable time and money and i'm like lowkey panicking lol, my parents have struggled so much and I want to be able to create more good memories for them and for them to retire happily and soon.

379,"Couple days ago, my sister asked my mom to walk the dog. Knowing she has arthritis and pain in the legs. I know deep down my mom didn't want to. But, you see my sister will get mad at her and my mom will feel bad. My mom isn't the most dominant with her siblings. I used to argue with her a lot, and she tends to say nothing. I stopped and calmed down after realizing this. Because, I felt really bad. 
Moving on, I told my mom "" she doesn't control you.""
She replied "" What! She doesn't control me..helloooo."" ""Im only gonna walk her in the front."" I was outside and as soon as my mom was approaching the door, my sister yelled ""Mom! Walk her more, that's not enough! My mom walked her more farther down. What happened to only walking in the front? You see how my sis can be mean n kinda controlling over mt mom.

381,"So, a few weeks ago, my cousin confessed to our family that my father sexually abused her a few times between age 6 and 12, before I was born, 25 years ago. My father admitted the facts but talked like if my cousin was ok with it. It seems that he didn't used violence or threat. However, she was still a child so, whether or not she objected, she obviously could not consent. My cousin decided to press charges against my father and I'll support her decision. I'll never defend my father's actions. However, I have no idea how to act towards him after that.

First, I was shocked and had no idea what to do. I couldn't do anything else than speaking to him normally, because he looked really weak emotionally and I was afraid he might commit suicide. Also, sometimes, you hear about people who killed their whole family after such revelations. My father never was violent or anything so it was not so likely to happen, but after learning what he did , I was still a bit anxious about him feeling hopeless if I stopped talking to him like before. 

Fortunately, I don't live with my parents anymore so I can avoid meeting him for the moment, but my mother and sister still live with him and I won't be able to see them anymore if I don't visit them. My mother won't leave my dad (for now at least) and is already quite depressed due to her family side being in conflict with her for not leaving my dad instantly. I always had a good relationship with my father and he never did anything bad to me, I'm grateful for the quality of life I always had thanks to him. The facts are not recent and I want to belive that the father I know is a different person now. He's also currently facing a lot of other troubles. Even if it will never erase what he did, I'm also glad he admitted his actions instead of letting this be a word against word situation where it's hard for the victim to find proof after all this time. For these reasons, it's difficult for me to entirely cut my dad out of my life now.

However, the facts happened, what's more, a few times. My father is not the victim here and acting like nothing happened doesn't sounds right to me. I mean, of course he'll be judged for what he did, but is it really enough? If he was not my own father, I probably wouldn't have talked to him anymore. I feel like it's not right to keep the same relationship with him as before, because it would be like if I had forgiven him for what he did, which I have no rights to do since i'm not the victim here.  But, for the same reasons, it's like I'll never be able to decide myself if he can be forgiven for what he did either. 

What am I supposed to do?   
Had anyone ever been in a similar situation? How did you manage such relationship?

My hobbies are frowned upon and dangerous.

I only have two actual friends. I rarely hang out with them. I fit into no group. I feel like I am better friende with a group of people I met online than my real friends. 

I've been so hurt and been made vulnerable by all of my past relationships to the point that I don't care to get a girlfriend or pursue a relationship at all anymore. As in my whole life. I seriously see my self dying alone.

My dad is deployed in the middle east and it's better at home without him but I can't say that.

I don't really care for much right now. 

I wake up late as fuck every day and have no reason to get up earlier. I want a job but at the same time I don't and thanks to Covid, I can't.

I'm mad at the world and easily pissed.

I gained loads of weight and started to try losing it. Not sure how that's going anymore.

I spend my day running errands, being pissed, and sitting behind my computer.

I haven't felt like this in a while. I feel like right now maybe I'm just having a really bad day or something but this is how I feel right now. 

I had the first serious suicidal thought today since ages. Thought about drinking the anti freeze or cooking up some potent poison through my hobby.

This was kickstarted by finding out that the job I had thought was a good fit is actually a horrible idea and that other jobs I'm not really interested in are better. 

I still see no point in life. 

I'm tired and hungry. I want to sleep but don't at the same time. My throat is sore. 

I don't know what to do. I'm not sure I'm even asking for advice. Just talking or something. 

I feel like whenever I am not distracted for a while like I am now, I actually realize and wake up to how fucked up the world is and how lost I actually am.

Sure I'm young but I don't feel young. I haven't had a group of friends for years. I don't go out. I'm not sure if I even want to. 

Right now, I feel like I wouldn't mind fading away into a sleep to never wake up again. Maybe it changes when I do wake up. I don't know.",31Jul2020,1

385,"I'm 22 now. I live in Europe - 2 years ago I moved from my home country and started studying abroad. I study in a really prosperous country with a lot of opportunities. I am studying international trade and marketing and it is okay, but it always feels like business studies are not really serious, and you really learn when you do the job rather then when you study. Most of my friends abroad are interested in entrepreneurship and travelling, which is great, I love it too. I joined local climbing gym and met amazing people. This place also allows me to work and save plenty of money. With some effort and good time management it is possible to have an amazing work-life balance and really do a lot of stuff.

On the other hand there is my home country - I have always been the dreamer kind of person with a lot of plans, ambitions and stuff I am genuinely interested in. I love all fantasy, sci-fi etc. Back home I was always going to different conventions, meeting people and enjoying this kind of life. I feel like this part of my personality is kind of supressed when I'm abroad. It is not that easy to express myself (we all speak English, but for none of us it's our first language) and also there's not that many people with such interests around. People are more into partying etc, I enjoy it, but partying is not something I wouldn't be able to give up on.

Because I'm not really sure about my studies abroad and the employement after getting the degree, I have enrolled for a remote education back home. It means I can study online (degree in IT), but approximately once every 2 months I need to be at uni for 3-4 days for the exams and workshops. I'm still not sure how much time and energy it will absorb.

Living back home also means living at my parents' place - it means I don't have to pay rent and despite the fact of earning much less, I will still be financially sound.

I love my life abroad as well as I love my life back in my home country.

387,"So it's a bit of a long story and I'm just wondering what you would do if you're me. I've been friends with this person for a while. We lived together in college for 4 years and it was great. After college we decided to rent together again with my boyfriend and another friend. Ever since that things started to change.. I want to say she changed but I know it's me, and I know it's me with the problem here I just want to know how to get over it. So since we started renting this place shes been (I feel) trying to be better than me all the time, especially in front of the others. In the last year or so in particular. Just a few examples, when I started planting and propagating, she started growing stuff, when I started painting again, she started painting (with my paint and brushes too), when I started baking over lockdown, she started baking (again with my flour and sugar) and then parades her finished work in front of my boyfriend and friend.. There's a lot more stuff that she's doing (leaving me out of conversations, always acting like she knows something that I don't, and much more) but I won't go into that. The point is I'm the only one that's annoyed by this and I'm so angry that even when she comes into the room or if she sits beside me or my boyfriend I feel so angry or on edge that sometimes I even feel sick! Like when I'm around her I feel like a cat that's got their back perked and ready to pounce. We have some mutual friends that love her (and clearly more than me) that I don't really want to loose but I feel like I just need her out of my life!

392,"Basically up until this point in my life I've kinda been going with the flow. Now however everything is just tying together snd making things complicated for me.

Basically I've been working for a company now for a year now part time. The pay is alright considering I live with my parents, I'm in community college, and take care of my own personal expenses without my parents help unless they ask to (for example sometimes my dad tells me HE WILL pay for my tuition fee for a particular month, and I don't say no since he's stubborn). The store also just has a lot of issues management wise. Granted I love all my coworkers there. 

However before all of the events that are happening in the world right now hit, I got an interview for another company that I really like(keep in mind both jobs are retail but I won't name any companies). I got the job, I was lucky enough to keep the job, since a good portion of my coworkers left or got laid off. The pay is better and I get a bonus based on my sales in the job (no it isn't commission based, i just get a decent bonus for each item i sell and based on entire store success). Although all of my coworkers are a bit older and the work is hard sometimes it pays off as I get a great discount for any new dope shoes I really like, and for the most part all of my coworkers are really cool with me. 

Today I decided to go shopping with my sister and went into my first job (since I work at a mall). I went in and after buying my sister a few things my manager pulled me aside. She offered me a promotion which guaranteed me 25-30 hours a week, keys to the store (i think), and a pay increase (I'm not sure how much but there should be an increase in pay), which would also give me a manager position technically speaking (correct me if I'm wrong but the position is ""Sales Lead""). I never gave her a end all answer and told her I'd think about it as excited as she and my coworkers were for me to earn the opportunity of the position. 

That all sounds great, but I have a second job, and I'm a community college student. Not only that but although my second job offers 15 hours a week guaranteed, I usually end up getting about a minimum of 20. Not only that but the stores discounts are super nice for buying even family members who need things shoes, and they are paying for half of my tuition for when I move to University as long as I stay with the company. 

If I were to accept the position and work my second, newer job, I'd have to work about 50+ hours a week considering my other job also gives out hours generously as well. My parents also feel if I work too much that I'll stop focusing on school and focus on money, which is the same mistake my father did which is why he is so hard on me about college. The only reason I'm even going to college is for job security, I could really care less about a triple hundred thousand digit salary. 

I guess I just feel overwhelmed by all the opportunities that are opening up for me. Any advice?",31Jul2020,1
393,"It was a nightmare. I cannot stress this enough. I. Fucking. Loathed my first actual day. I work at a fast food place, the shift was 5PM to 2AM. Already that's shit, standing in one place all day, doing nothing most of the time, I didn't know the bleak hell I was waltzing right on into, so I stupidly accepted the full time hours. Not a single damn manager mentioned to me how terrible closing was going to be. Stacks of dishes, trash that weighed as much as my own fucking body. Mopping the more greasy areas. They're desperate to hire closers because the place has a high turn over rate, and now I know why. No one even warned me that it would be so grueling and painful. This is coming from a new adult, that's NEVER worked a day in fast food, and has, AT MOST ever only had to carry something as heavy as Turkey. On my way home, I actually hoped I got into a car crash so I could have an excuse as to not show up to work, it was so terrible and I felt like I was the victim of an underhanded trick. On top of that, I wasn't ever set for full time, I vividly remember being put on for PART time.

I want to bring this up to the manager when I work tomorrow, which is another hell shift. Sticking through it is just not an option, this isn't something that gets better with time, and if I have to experience 2 more identical shifts, I'm going to lose it.

I need advice on how to go about this. I don't want to be a dick, but I know my worth, no amount of money could justify me going through this, I wanted a job, but it seems I wasn't specific enough, I want one that WON'T make me want to drive right into a ditch, one that DOESN'T make me genuinely want to cry.",31Jul2020,1

After the trip, I went up (both of us masked) to give them their key. They gave me a little care package: two chocolate bars, a handmade card from the kid, and $100. 

I know they feel guilty because the mom cat was a bit of a pill (she door dashed three times, she destroyed the litter box somehow so I replaced it with something sturdy and bought litter, I had to buy a scratching board to stop her from ruining the carpet, and likewise brought up my weights and yoga mats to again keep her from scratching the carpets at the doors), but I really did mean it when I offered to do it for free. I knew she was going to be a bit of a pain anyways, I used to volunteer at an animal shelter a few years back and stray unspayed/neutered cats always have an adjustment period.

408,"I’m going to level with you guys- I’m hella lazy.

I’ll just begin this with I know that I’m smart. Not to say that without sounding cocky which I’m sure it does come off as, but I am. I was that kid in primary school that could sleep through class, never turn in homework and still top the class when exams came. 
I made it into the top girls only ‘gifted’ schools in my state with only a couple months of prep- focussing on how to do the exam not so much the actual content.
I was that kid in grade 7-8 who didn’t do any work and still was ‘above average’ even in this gifted school.
Life kind of took a turn for the worse when grade 9 came about. Suddenly I couldn’t just cruise through things and still made the grade. Not to say I started failing or anything- again still making average. But that was a big drop from top of the class to just ‘average’. And I pretty much stayed like that throughout highschool. 
I did the bare minimum work. I turned up late. I slept through classes. And I was getting average grades (mind you in this gifted school so ‘average’ there was still pretty fantastic). 
Entrance exams into uni? I literally didn’t go to class (external reasons- let’s just say it involved a particular teacher and the police). My attendance was maybe 30% for that year in total. Barely studied more than an hour each day (and ‘study’ was 90% browsing the web). 
My ‘dream goal’ was a 98. Without studying or attending class I got an 88. Again. Pretty average. And I kick myself because if that’s what I can achieve with doing nothing, why the fuck can’t I put a bit of effort into doing something and getting what I want?

At uni now and it’s pretty much the same. Not attending classes. Not doing any of the extra work. Or any of the actual work set. Literally going in to exams having only been to less than half the lectures. 
Still getting credits with a couple distinctions scattered around. But if I want to change to the course I want, I need a majority High distinctions/distinctions. Which I’m not getting. But I could if I tried. Fuck, if I went to all the lectures I could probably get distinctions. 

But I’m just so... unmotivated? Which is stupid because I want this. But I just? Don’t? Want? To?

I just can’t sit down for more than a few minutes at a time without needing to jump up and do literally anything else. Until I become obsessive over one thing and do that for the next 6 hours. Which unfortunately rarely aligns with the work that actually needs to be done.

And now my dreams are slowly slipping away and I’m just letting them? Just don’t know how to come back from this. How to even start improving my life. Getting where I want.

But he usually popped in a piece of gum every couple of hours and that would cover it up for the most part. so it wasn’t as noticeable at first and easy for me to over look - since I enjoyed his company so much. 

Now that we’ve moved into together and he’s getting a little more comfortable, the gum chewing has stopped completely... and I feel like I can now smell his breath in all it’s glory. It honestly disgusts me and seriously is a really huge turn off. It smells like straight tonsil stones. 

I’ve tried to be nice to him and hint at him about it. I’ve even convinced him to get a waterpik and suggested him to try that. But that’s not really helping at all. Now I’ve gotten to the point where I just straight up tell him that his breath smells bad and to brush his teeth - but even after he brushes his teeth... the smell returns after 30 minutes or so. I don’t want to sound like a bitch and tell him that he needs to seek medical help for it, but it’s seriously getting to that point. I don’t even like him kissing me anymore because I can smell his breath lingering on my skin afterwards. 

It really sucks because I genuinely like the guy. He opened up to me about having tonsillitis and having to get his tonsils removed. I really think whatever problem he had from that is still affecting his throat, which is why he has such bad breath. 

Can anyone help? What do I do? I seriously can’t take it anymore.",31Jul2020,1

However; her face is not hidden in any way and it makes me feel vulnerable. Unfortunately for both of us, we look the same and there isn’t anything we can do to change that. However; is it unreasonable to request that she crops atleast half of her face so that I don’t get recognised for her actions? It’s also just a weird mind fuck, seeing essentially my body (yes, it looks identical) being sold for a price. Obviously the risk of this affecting me directly are low but not completely impossible. My sister seems to be in the top 3% (apparently) so I presume a lot of people are subscribed... 
I also know for a fact that people she knows from reddit have seen me and where I park for work which just makes me feel even weirder. Who else knows or has seen me without me knowing? 
She has also written an ‘about me’ section on her OF stating ‘I’m an identical twin’... she doesn’t mention our other siblings so I can only presume it’s there as some sort of bait. Again, weird and uncomfortable.

412,So im using a separate account bc my gf follows my main but i wanted to ask a few question.This all takes place over skype/discord btw. So like 20 mins ago we just had a fight where I stopped our sexy talk bc something came up and I wanted to tell her. And after she becomes upset and i ask what's wrong a few times and she denies anything is wrong so i just try to continue conversating and then I ask a bit more bc hes giving me one worded replies and she still says no. I just kinda take a deep breath and kinda sit around and she gets upset at me for not like confronting her about what's wrong. I stood up for myself and told her that i asked her several times what's wrong and she told me nothing was wrong but it was my fault bc its been 3 years we've been dating and I should know when she's upset. In the end i just apologized and she hung up upset and is probably on tiktok for the rest of the night. Im at a loss of what i could have done better in this situation.

I moved into my current living arrangement back in May, I’m 27f and he’s 28m. I’ve always had reservations about living with a man because of the drama that CAN ensue... but I decided to go through with it anyways. Fast forward to earlier this month (July), he comes onto me really strong, and we end up sleeping together. Not just once, but three times. It became a weekly thing until he decided to bring a date home that I walked in on as they were watching movies together; that happened the day after we celebrated his birthday together. Naturally, I was very upset and didn’t talk much for about a week until I saw that he had surgery, that kind of broke the ice again between us and eventually we slept together AGAIN. We were hanging out on Wednesday afternoon when he ordered Chinese food, he asked for extra fortune cookies and was pretty annoyed when they only put two in the bag; so I went out to the Chinese place and bought a box of them, came home to surprise him. He showed his appreciation for it and then proceeded to be super fucking rude to me afterwards. He starts being semi nice to me again, talking to me telling me how he’s planning a cheese and wine night and all that bullshit and how he wanted me to join him for his 6am workout in the morning. I told him I was down for some cheese and wine after I got back home from dinner and he agreed to it. I got home about an hour later than I originally planned to after taking my friend out for her dinner, I said I wanted a glass of wine and he replied “if you replace the bottle that you drink you can have it”, I was surprised since I’ve never been asked to replace any of the alcohol from the bar before... so I decide to go to bed instead. I asked him if he still wanted me to join him for his workout and he said “probably not tomorrow, I’m staying up late and probably won’t wake up so no”.

I never had friends growing up really quite a lone wolf. Here and there i would hangout but that was every once in a blue moon type of vibe. In High school friends weren't on my mind until I got to junior year. I started to party smoke weed and hang with 4 ""friends"" (they were friends at the time I just realized later on that they were on a much lower energy then me and i really didn't jive with them). It started great but I was in the relationship to fill my void and in the end I search for something to complete me (weed, love interests, ect). Yet later on all these things were filled with so much negative feelings (petty jealousy, temptation, spitful envy, tbh the list could go on and on.) Nothing has really ever helped. Now that the some of the background is in the open I guess I will keep it pushing. I have dreams and aspirations but I don't know where to start. I am stuck in my place held down by chains while pit bulls tear the flesh from my legs. Pain is all I feel. I ha e forgiven myself and othersfor the things that have transpired between us, yet I still feel the same. Nothing seems to change. I have rearranged myself. Outgrown those around and adapted to me and have always pushed myself to grow. But I still haven't made a sense of success. Not success I guess positive change. When something does change its more out of a place practically and usually isn't what is like. Yet how do you strive for the things you want while keeping your sanity and your material self from falling apart. 

Tbh I don't know what else to put in so I shall end it here.
Anything helps and Thank you again

418,"Hi guys, I (25F) really need some advice. I’ve been with my husband (26M) for a long time, we started dating about 10 years ago (although we broke up for some time) and have been married for going on 6. We don’t have any kids, only a dog child. My husband is in the military (Air Force) and goes on TDYs (Temporary duty) where they go away for a bit and work. Well we are overseas currently and I just found out this morning that he cheated on me from a random message from a temporary profile on Instagram. He was on a TDY over a year ago for like 2 and half months and this person that messaged me was there with him. They told me he cheated and that they weren’t the only ones that saw. They also told me that they wouldn’t be visiting that profile again so messaging back is useless (i still did it anyway) and they just wanted to let me know about it cause they said they’ve been there before and someone did this for them and they were forever grateful.

Anyway so it’s like 5:30 am when I read this and I shoot up so fast and wake up my husband crying and saying he cheated on me. He was saying things along the lines of “no I didn’t” “was it just a dream?” “Who told you this?” Etc. So I read him the message and he freezes and stays quiet for like a minute or so (but it felt like forever). So I said “I’m your wife, we’ve been together so long.  We started dating 10 years ago... i deserve this much.” 

And so he told me that he got so drunk and slept with someone else on the beach and he told me who the girl was. He told me he was researching what to do about it on the internet the next day and was throwing up for two days after that. He just kept crying &amp; saying he hates himself and he’s felt guilty since it happened. He also said it was eating at him everyday. 

But about this girl, LET ME TELL YOU, I had a GUT feeling about this girl before. I asked him about her when he got back home and I remember I wanted to message her about something but he kept telling me no and was so defensive about it. I was thinking like “okay.... weird. My feelings should always trump over how any other girl feels.” We argued about it cause i was hurt that her friendship or whatever came before my feelings.. anyway, i just brushed it off and said “okay...  i don’t have proof of anything weird... maybe I’m just being crazy.” Come to find out my gut was right...

I was giving him so much trust on this trip. I let him party all he wanted, i only texted him and called him when he was available... like i gave him SO MUCH TRUST and space, SO MUCH MORE THAN USUAL tdys. Mind you, I’ve had to work on trusting him again because he’s done a similar thing before where he kept a secret in our marriage for two years. Soo essentially I gave him all my trust again and he broke it. 

The thing is... he said he felt so guilty and it’s been eating away at him ever since but... THEY HUNG OUT NUMEROUS TIMES AFTER THAT in group settings (there may be others I don’t know about) and they both follow each other on Instagram. 
If he felt so guilty, why did he continue to hangout with her? Why does he follow her? Why would he want to see her face if he was “so guilty”? Why didn’t he tell me if ‘the guilt was eating away at him?’ I don’t know what to do or how to feel, I’m just so hurt and confused. His actions don’t match what he’s saying.

He kept crying and saying sorry and he hates himself over and over again and worried about our families knowing (we grew up around each other and have been together since we were teens). I was like “why are you worried about what they might think? You should be worried about how I feel.” It truly hurt me so much that he was mentioning how everyone is gonna know now rather than my heart just being shattered... why is that important right now?

So i said i needed space and went on my balcony and told him to get ready for work. I started wondering if he wore protection cause i remember sex hurting when he came back and if he used protection &amp; bought it, then he planned it, but if he didn’t then it wasn’t planned (but then it’d he this whole new level of f*cked up w/,possible STD problems). 
I came back in after his shower and asked him. At first he lied and said “yeah i did” and then I was like “how’d you get the condom then?... cause if so then you planned it because we don’t use any.” And then he was like “oh no we didn’t use a condom.” I was like “WHY LIE to me?” And He just responded “idk why but I’ve just always done that since I was a kid.” and was bawling his eyes out saying it. Like???????? That is not okay. 

Anyway, I just really need some advice. Is this marriage worth saving? cause I just keep trying to make excuses for him and trying to protect how people view him but my best friend said i shouldn’t be protecting him like that, that my feelings should come first and that I’ve been helping him with his shit for so many years that this time, i need to come first. I’ve only told her so far and she thinks I’m under reacting. I love him of course but i can’t trust him one bit. The thing is.. he’s going to Korea for a year after this without me and I don’t think i can do it... the trust is out the window. I just need some outside opinions ):",31Jul2020,1
419,"Hey Reddit

Hopefully I hope can get some good feedback from the wider online community.

I work for a construction firm that does a lot of insurance repairs ( eg storms, floods, lighting, fire etc) we also do private work as well.

After a recent storm, a client asked us to give him a quote to replace his roof, which he wanted to submit for an insurance claim. His insurers refused to to pay for the roof replacement as it had not been maintained and was generally not in a good condition.

However, the insurers have said he can claim for any resultant damages from the storm (i.e water damages from the roof leaking but not fixing the roof). 

So I have just gone out to quote on the resultant damages which in my opinion and 17 years of experience, was very minimal. However the client has asked me to quote on resultant damages to the same value as the roof he wants replaced.

He wants to be cashed out for the resultant damages so he can use that money for the roof! Which as I see it, is him openly admitting to fraud.  

Even though he has come to us as a private client, I know who all the claims handlers and assessors and loss adjusters are. And they will phone me straight away to discuss it.

But my dilemma is that we would really like the roof work, but not like this!

What do you think?

420,"A long while back I had gone out drinking with two friends and we came back to the youth shelter blackout drunk. Irresponsible, I know. While I ended up passed out in my room, apparently my friends experienced some sort of breakdown and tore up the shelter property and attacked some of the staff. They were arrested and obviously kicked out. I understand that it is for the best but I feel awful that they're gone and that I didn't stop anything from happening. I spent the next few days helping them move out.

  My problem is that ever since this incident, my other friends at the shelter are colder to me. They never acknowledge me when I wave and they wont speak  to me if they could help it. No one told me why exactly they are upset but it was suggested that I was a bad influence on them and  I also wasn't around to help them, showing that I didn't care. 

I tried messaging them if we could talk about what happened, hoping I could understand why they were upset and then apologize but I've been blocked on social media and I've received no responses otherwise too.

423,"I(23m) have been dating this girl(21f) for about 3 months now. It is someone I’ve knew from a while back, but never really talked to in private until she contacted me out of the blue about 3 months ago. We started hanging out frequently and are really having a good time together, and I can say I have definitely started catching the feels. 

A little about our situations, I work on a cruise ship and during the summer I have worked for 2 weeks at a time all summer long. When I have been home we have spent alot of time together, including lots of cuddling and kissing and hanging out together with both of our friend groups. The thing is I got out of a 3 year relationship about a year and a half ago, I’ve been doing some dating after that but never anything long term as I haven’t been emotionally available myself until recently. My last break-up was pretty rough, and it took me a long time to get over it. After that I haven’t even met someone who I would’ve considered being worth it to commit to, until now with her. 

And her story, she kinda recently, about half a year ago got out of a really messy and abusive relationship and she is still kinda scarred from all of it. But then out of the blue she contacted me and said she had been having an interest in me for a long time and would like to get to know me better. I was hesitant at first but she really kept chasing me and finally I agreed to a date. We really hit it off from the start, until recent times when she said she really likes me, but is not ready to commit to anything serious yet. 

I understand her really well, having been in her situation myself before, the only thing is I dont understand why she has even taken things this far with me and then saying she will not be ready for anything more for a long time. 

We still talk alot, we hangout, sleep together etc. But I’m not feeling it like this, it feels like she is just keeping me there until she finds something better. I don’t feel like waiting, because as things are going I’m feeling more and more like this is only going to end up with me getting hurt and heartbroken. I don’t think I’m ready to throw away all my mental wellbeing over something like this.

I know I really should get out, the red flags are there. It just feels so good after a long time to have someone to talk to who really shows interest. I haven’t told her yet how I feel about all of this. Would it be okay for me to just tell her and see her reaction. Give her an ultimatum, tell her if she wants me im here, otherwise I will be gone. Whenever she is ready she knows where to find me, and if she wants to talk I will be there for her. She keeps telling me she is really interested and wants to keep seeing where things will lead, but she is not yet ready to take the next step, which is something I would really like to try.

431,"3 “friends” of mine no longer see or talk to me.

Here’s why..

1 of those girls introduced me to someone on the day of her wedding. She had said to me that I needed to meet him weeks before her wedding as we had a lot in common. I thought, oh okay cool 🤷‍♀️ didn’t hear of this guy before and I’ve been friends with all of them for 15 years. We met, instantly connected it was like an immediate thing, crazy. 4 years later... we are getting married in 70 days! 

Noooow... when we first got together my friends including the one that introduced us started acting very strange towards me. I could tell they were visibly jealous. 1 is a single mother and the other 2 are miserable in their lives. They would tell me things that would make me doubt my relationship etc. They were just fake! After a few more weeks the single mother had stopped talking to me completely and the other 2 started keeping a distance and being weird. 

Anyway, I asked 1 of them to their face what the problem was and what I did to everyone? She then told me that everyone is very upset apparently because the single mother liked my fiancé and I stole him AND I cannot blame them for being upset. So, ummm my fiancé was her friend and they would all hang out in a group, which was weird as I was friends with them too and I didn’t know this guy existed. Had no idea she liked him! Once again.. didn’t know who he was until that night! They have never spoken about him before, it was almost like she knew we were similar and didn’t want us to meet. My fiancé didn’t know she liked him either nor did he like her in that way and nobody else knew she had a crush on him. She had liked almost everyone’s partners before but didn’t stop speaking to them, just me. They have now made it seem like I knew and still went ahead with seeing him. Regardless, if a guy doesn’t like you and likes your friend instead should you not be happy for them?? Especially after the abusive relationship I got out of which they all knew about... wouldn’t you have been happy for me finding someone great?? No? I currently have not seen any of them in 3 years. Best part is I don’t think they know the one who got married planned on introducing us, so she doesn’t look like the bad guy. 

They don’t talk to me unless it’s a msg on my Facebook wall for my birthday. I’m getting married with 25 guests after cancelling a big destination wedding in October and I have no friends to invite and I feel awful. I did nothing wrong.

433,"This question will be a bit sexual. Hence the NSFW. I’m overall ashamed, and want advice if this is normal or anything. 

As a child, I was diagnosed with sensory integration. I can’t wear pants, skirts, anything (excluding underwear) with a band. Anything else is fine. Whenever I do wear pants, I find myself growing INTENSELY aroused that doesn’t  go away unless I take off the pants. I mean so badly aroused I couldn’t focus in school, and days were torture because I just waited until the day was over. Or when I was in private I would do the nasty, just for the feeling to come back just as strong moments after. No matter how many times I ahem, “finish” the intense sensation of being well turned on, comes back seconds later. I could “finish” 27 times and I’d still get the sensation stronger than ever UNLESS I take the pants off. (Sorry don’t want to be too graphic! Not trying to make this gross just trying to get a understanding of the point.)  

It’s horrendous, and I’m so shameful. It’s gotten better. But it lingers, or I get so uncomfortable wearing pants I just have to take them off. I hate it. I can’t be normal. Have you guys ever heard on this before? Anyone know any solutions? I’ve tried physical therapy, trying different sensations (certain fabrics, items, to help me work through it.) trying to power through it which literally enables me to function or do anything because all I can think of is, “I’m really turned on.” or “This feels so weird I’m two seconds away from ripping this off”. Other therapies have failed. Is this even normal with sensory integration?

To be honest I feel like they’re slowly becoming strangers, year by year. I don’t know how to talk to anyone else besides them (and I even struggle to talk to *them*). 

My mum has battled with alcoholism and chain-smoking for over a decade straight. I can only presume that she has been unhappy for a very long time.  Whenever I get a call from her I feel as though I’m moreso listening to her speak, rather than talking to her - I have a mental barrier that prohibits me from starting an actual conversation and learning how she’s going at the time (this also applies to anyone else that calls/ talks to me). I haven’t lived at home for a few years, but I constantly worry about her outlook on life; whether or not she enjoys life; if she has hobbies that give her happiness and satisfaction.

My dad is similarly in a negative mental state as their relationship diminished several years ago. He also worries about her but I believe that he is also in a state of hopelessness or uncertainty on how to make changes in his life, let alone hers.

I don’t know how to make a first step to helping her. I can’t reverse time obviously so every day of inaction is another day that she isn’t being helped. I have no idea where she’ll be in 5-10 years. 

How can I start to help her? Should I work on building my social skills first?",31Jul2020,1

So, to make a long story short, I was s\*xually abused by my slightly older cousin (we're both girls, she's two years older than me). She mostly just did s\*xual stuff with me when I was 9-10, but then at 10-11 she forced herself on me. That's where the PTSD comes in.

I was diagnosed last February with PTSD, and it's hell honestly. So far, only three people know about it. Abusive ex, sister, and brother. My brother doesn't know how I got it, sister does know. I told her what my cousin did. (While I'm thinking about it my sister said something that irritated me; ""I still like her better than her siblings"", because her and her siblings aren't the nicest sometimes, but still I don't want to hear that after I tell you that). 

Anyway, neither of my parents know what she did. She knows, she told her mother, and I think she told her husband (don't 100% know). I don't know who else she told, and frankly, I don't want to ask. As long as she doesn't tell my Dad I won't have an issue (my Psychiatrist asked me what I'd do if he found out, I told him I'd k\*ll myself, that nearly got me admitted). 

Here's my issue: my emotions have taken a rollarcoaster, and I feel like my mood/personality/thoughts toward things are constantly changing. Some days I think ""sure, Mom can know"" to ""NO ONE CAN KNOW"". My mental health is not really brought up in the family, as when I was 15 I told my Dad I wanted to d\*e, I began seeing a counselour at school, and he said verbatim (I know because I dedicated it to my memory) ""Who the f\*ck are you talking to? How much attention do you need?"". After that, I've been shoving my issues down.

I promised myself I'd never tell him anything relating to that part of my life ever again, as I remember exactly how he sounded when he said that and I'm trying not to duplicate it. He's getting better though in some regard and talks openly to my little brother about his mental health, which I appreciate, but I can't help but feel a little ""where was that compassion with me"".

This is getting long so I'll get to the point: I don't know what to do. I can't stand human contact anymore, I can't stand talking to people, and I honestly want to d\*e/live in a cave somewhere. I'm honestly more su\*cidal than I've ever been. If I wasn't home and I was at my dorm, I'm pretty sure I would've done it already. I don't care about dying anymore. I just want all of this to go away. However, my brother made a joke that if I died he'd kill myself and now I'm panicking so bye.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks.",31Jul2020,1
436,"I’m a 30-yo male. This will be long, so...
Tldr is it wise to tell my ex-gf of many years ago—especially now that we’re married to other people—about how sorry I am for how we broke up?

When I first went to college about 12 years ago, I chose the one that my high school girlfriend was going to. A lot of my hs friends were also going to be attending a nearby college, so I followed her there. 

I broke up with her the day before freshman year started. Why did this happen? We had been dating for two years in high school, and the summer before freshman year at college, there was a Facebook group for incoming freshmen. On this group I made friends with a different girl. She liked a lot of the same music and films that I did, that my hs gf wasn’t as into. While I didn’t end up dating this girl, it was this interaction that caused me to think, maybe Hs gf and I are not the perfect match. Maybe I’m supposed to allow myself to experience romantic emotion with many different ppl before I decide to perhaps marry. 

Hs gf did not take it well. It was a small school so I knew this wouldn’t be the last time we saw each other. This would come back to haunt me. More than once. 

One day when i was walking across the quad, another girl who was a year older than me noticed me and looked me up on Facebook. We had a lot of the same interests—music but mostly media—and we would chat on Facebook messenger. It was an obvious connection from the first time we chatted on that platform. 

I later found out that the day she saw me walk across the quad, she said to her friend she was sitting with on the grass, “that’s my prince.”

We started dating and doing so much fun stuff together. She introduced me to a lot of new things in terms of movies and stuff like that. I couldn’t believe how well we got along. Me and my Hs gf were both pretty extroverted, but my new gf was comparatively introverted, but importantly still very sharp and funny in conversation. We were magnetic. 

Time passed and freshman year was over. I lived many states away so we chatted online over the summer. 

Fall Sophomore year comes. I can’t remember how, or why, but I started talking again with my old Hs gf that fall while I was still dating my new gf. At age 19 with girls apparently clamoring to talk to me (I am much taller than average with a symmetrical face, and that’s as far as I’m gonna go in complimenting my own looks), it must have been thrilling to me to have this opportunity to see how things had been going with Hs gf since we last saw each other. We had after all been close for a long time in Hs. I don’t know or remember what the stupid reason was. As far as I remember, nothing was really wrong with me and my gf’s relationship at the time. 

One night that fall I was sitting in the passenger seat of Hs gf’s car in the college parking lot. We were talking. I don’t remember about what. Eventually we were holding hands. That’s when my gf and her friends walked by. It was a calamity for her. An absolute calamity for her. 

The words I’m trying to use to describe my gf’s feelings at the time are inadequate. She ended up going to the hospital. I did not know about this until much later. If I had known...I like to think I would’ve gone and seen her. Maybe take it back. But I’m so.........so scared to think that maybe 19 yo me still wouldn’t have gone. I just want to go back in time and shake some fucking sense into myself. I’m so...fucking fucked. I know I’m being hard on myself. I know I’m being hard on myself now. I say again, I know I’m being hard on myself. But I deserve worse.

Hs gf and me kinda-sorta got unofficially back together. It was a really shitty time in retrospect. Like I said, we’re both extroverts. We fought all the time and eventually stopped seeing or talking to each other again that same semester. Believe it or not.....this is not the last time I would go back to Hs gf. 

Spring of sophomore year brought a new season and a new gf, whom I met in band from the new freshman class below mine. She was a very sweet and nice girl but who still knew how to have fun, and she is leading a very successful life now and I’m happy I knew her. In total we dated for 4 months, into the summer after my sophomore year. This time I didn’t go home but instead stayed in-state to work on campus doing groundskeeping all summer. Guess who else was working on campus that summer and living in town? Aitch ess gee eff. (Hs gf)

There wasn’t really a red-handed situation this time, but my gf knew that it was time for us to break up. My god I’m such a selfish piece of shit. Hs gf and I fool around for about a month afterward, and it ends in a high-octane screaming match again, per usual. 

Intermission:
I’m so embarrassed about how hard on myself I am about this now at age 30, about how long it took for me to realize how badly Ive treated all my romantic partners in terms of commitment (despite most of my relationships being pretty long-term). I can’t believe how selfish I was. I can just imagine, any of my ex-gf’s or their friends reading this, and thinking, “uh yeah you’re selfish. Of course you are. You always have been.” Like it’s my defining character trait. And I don’t know how to fix that. And that’s part of why I’m writing this. Because they don’t know how just full of regret, that i am. 

Back to 10 years ago. Junior year of college is spent entirely abroad in europe. 

When I get back for senior year, my first college gf, the one who called me her prince, had switched schools (and majors—this is important) but was still in town. Her friends were still around and in town too, and I went and saw one of our mutual friends who had gotten her own apartment. I was also living off campus with my younger brother (so effectively alone, since our friend groups didn’t really overlap). 

I had been single since breaking up with band gf two summers previous, not counting a handful of flings while studying abroad. Prince gf was dating someone new who looked suspiciously a lot like me, but was actually pretty introverted, like prince gf is. I don’t know him that well but he seems pretty smart if dull. He also came from a much richer background/family than me, but I’m pretty sure that has nothing to do with how they met or why they became attracted to each other. I still feel like it’s worth mentioning though. But personality wise we’re really not similar at all. And in fact... they got married about four years ago or so and are married to this day. 

Getting distracted describing prince gf’s now husband—let’s rewind to fall my senior year. Me, prince gf, and our mutual friends started hanging out together a lot more often that fall. We went downtown to drink a lot. Prince gf’s now husband was pretty much never there with us. Over christmas break, prince gf and I were talking online a lot again. Prince gf’s birthday is actually in December, and we were online together that day. That’s correct: her now-husband did not have any plans to do anything with her on her birthday that day. Treating her as an afterthought, if he was even thinking about her at all. I remember we were in a turntable.fm web page/quasi-chat room together and it was my turn to choose the song, and in the chat I said, “this one goes out to [prince gf]!” She sent a smiley in chat. I don’t think I’m ever gonna forget that moment. 

Second semester senior year. We resume going downtown every weekend to drink with mutual friends. I should clarify: these mutual friends are chiefly prince gf’s original roommates from before I was even a freshman, so she trusts them completely. One night as we’re going home, drunk as fuck, me and prince gf start holding hands as we’re walking. Our mutual friends are behind us and see this. They bring it up to me later and we all chalk it up to being really drunk. And we were! But it still didn’t feel wrong. It felt right. 

Another weekend out. We’re back at mutual friend’s apartment after drinking. We’re watching a movie. Mutual friends leave or go to bed. It’s just me and prince gf. And we have sex. It’s been over 3 years since we dated at this point. 

Another weekend out. Mutual friends need to step out for some reason, leaving me and prince gf alone in their apartment again. We have sex before they come back. 

Eventually prince gf starts coming to my apartment to hang out and have sex throughout the rest of the semester, and let me remind you she’s still “dating” my smarter if duller doppelgänger, ie, her now husband, this whole time. One pretty much has no choice but to put “dating” in scare quotes here because it’s clear he wasn’t showing her any interest. I’m honestly not sure why they kept dating.

Another intermission: I’ve been thinking about all this for about a month now, and typing this out has just made me realize.............why did I never ask about it? Why didn’t I see if there was an opening to be with prince gf forever?? The answer of course, now that I think about it, is obvious: I’m a selfish piece of shit. Moving on!

Immediately after graduating I get a new gf—four years younger than me—and we date on and off for quite a while, almost 2 years, while I get my start in the working world. This gf in terms of personality was closer to my Hs gf.

It was when I graduated and got this new gf that Prince gf and I stopped having sex, because of course I was no longer single. But we stayed in touch. 

It is now 6 years ago, or 2 years after I graduated college and broke up with that just mentioned gf. I’m living in a housing room share situation. Prince gf and I agree to hang out at my place one time. But this time, when we’re in my room, she kinda gets a worried look and leaves almost as soon as she got there, not more than 10 minutes. I understand her decision of course, because she’s still dating that guy this whole entire time, her now husband. And I guess, in that moment, she decided she would fare better with him. 

Look, she’s not wrong. remember I mentioned she switched majors after switching schools (private&gt;public)? Had we stayed together, she would have had a lot more debt and a much more useless degree. So it’s almost like, was that what was supposed to happen...? (I hate to think that something like debt or socio-economic status should have such a huge hand in deciding who ends up with whom as we grow older...but here we are.)
I also mentioned the family background difference thing between me and her now husband. And hell even when I hang out with them this very year, in 2020, I see a dynamic between them that, at least on the surface, looks special and unique. But what was with their stagnation in between? Just how much was he ignoring her? And for how long was that lameness in their relationship continuing after we stopped having sex after I graduated?

In all this time, I don’t think we ever spoke about the first breakup when we were actually a dating couple. About the time she went to the hospital. About how she felt then and how i now believe I should have felt. 

Let’s talk about my wife, for the first time in this post. We met in college, freshman year, and she was dating someone else that entire time, but we were pretty good acquaintances that entire time as well, sharing a lot of classes. She actually married the guy she was dating during college. 

5-6 years ago, my wife and her then-husband asked me if I wanted to move into a room share situation with them. I had (and have) a lot of college debt and had a low-paying job that worked second shift, so I also had next to no friends. So of course I accepted. 

It would prove to be the downfall of my now wife’s first marriage. I actually got them jobs at the place I was working at, and my wife and her husband’s shifts didn’t usually overlap. So my wife and me were home alone together a lot. 

One time her ex-husband came home and caught us in my bed red handed. Let me be clear: I do NOT get off on getting caught doing that stuff and it was pretty traumatizing, I’m sure 10000x more so for him. It had been a little over a year since we all moved in together. I immediately moved out into my own 1-br apartment, thankfully having gotten a pretty good pay bump at work recently to facilitate my ability to live alone while paying off student debt. It was still tight though. And still very sad. 

Many months after they divorced, my wife and I got in touch for the first time in a while and then continued to see each other. Eventually i said, let’s just get married since we’re seeing each other all the time now. And we did that 3 years ago. our student debt and it being her second marriage meant for a very small ceremony: just immediate family. 

We’ve been having a lot of problems lately. Even though we’re both kinda chatty and lean extrovert, she is an extremely sensitive individual due to her traumatic upbringing. Most days I don’t have the patience for her mood swings. It was really, really, really bad our first year of marriage. Now in our third year, there is still love, but also still a lack of understanding on my part as to why she can’t get past her interpersonal issues with me. We never seem to agree on anything. And she has embarrassed me in public, in front of friends, more than once. Not in a ragging me way, but in a public meltdown mood swing way. Sometimes she acts more like a child than even my Hs gf did. She is in therapy. We have tried couples therapy as well but due to a scheduling issue never went beyond one session. 

My wife and I’s birthdays are very close to each other’s, and we just celebrated our 30th a little while ago at prince gf’s house with all our mutual friends. It was the first time in quite a while that I had seen prince gf, and along with turning 30, it caused me to start to think about all this. And think about all this I have been doing for about the past month. 

Listen, i understand that problems with my current marriage is of course gonna result in a bunch of rosy red glasses on all my previous ones, especially if I’m still friends to this day with prince gf. But I still feel like a piece of shit about what happened. And I want her to know how sorry I am, even though it doesn’t mean we’re suddenly gonna destroy each other’s current marriages and run back to each other. That would be evil. But for some reason I still want her to know. That I am so sorry for how I treated her. 

I really don’t think it’s a good idea to work up the courage to broach this subject out of nowhere with her. I’m sure she does not feel this way about what happened anymore, or about me. It very much feels like a 10-year delayed case of “what goes around comes around” in terms of the pain suffered. I’d much rather try to bring it up tangentially, but the hard part is that we don’t really talk one on one anymore in the first place. 

But maybe I can tell one of her friends, who has also been my friend for all this time (10+ years)? And through the grapevine, she could find out that I’m so sorry and that I hope she forgives me for being so selfish. Maybe the fact that we all still hang out together, is her way of forgiving me. But for some reason i still have this deep aching desire to want to prove to her, and our mutual friends, that I recognize my past selfishness and feel immense remorse over it, and that I’m a piece of shit for taking so long, and needing to experience my own rocky marriage, to arrive to it. How do I redeem myself from such a self-interested journey?

437,"I do not give permission for my post to be shared on any other platform of social media. 

Also, TW mentions of child abuse

I want to apologize in advance if this sounds confusing or is hard to read, all of this just happend about 20 min ago and im fuming, confused, and all over the place right now. 

So my partner and I have been together for 4 ish years and we have always had a loving relationship. He has never once given me even the slightest hint that he is a creep or somebody who fetishizes children. 

My partner and I's relationship in the bedroom  has been pretty dry these last few months and I decided to snoop on his internet history to see what kind of porn he likes. I thought maybe I could use this info to spice up our relationship a little bit. So I know that this was a really bad idea. I should have just asked him before going behind his back. But at the same time, I feel kind of glad that I did that because I discovered that he is possibly into high school girls (I feel disgusted typing that holy shit) 

So he typed in things like ""barley legal, virgin porn teen,  porn first time, tiny small girls porn, high school porn, high school 18 porn, young teen porn"" oh God I feel so wrong typing that all out. I took a video of it in my phone so that I have proof if he deletes it. 

I instantly woke him up absolutely furious and im going to leave and go to my sisters tonight.  He denied it completely and then said that is just a sub genre for porn and has nothing to do with children. Like,  he swears up and down that these categories of porn do not include actual children. I dont know what to do with this information or what to think about it. I dont even know if I believe him. 

I don't watch porn so I honestly have no idea if he is telling me the truth or not. I dont know what to do. I feel so disgusted. I want to believe him but I don't even want to google to find it out because I'm afraid of what I might find. 

I posted this on another sub as well and I wasn't 100% convinced that the general opinion was non biased. I was hoping if I posted here I would get a more broad spectrum of advice. 

1. Is searching for the above phrases wrong? Should I re consider our relationship or be concerned that he is a pedophile? 

2. Should I re consider our relationship over this, or is it just some normal thing that a lot of ppl fetishize?",31Jul2020,1

439,"I've had anxiety for years, and it's gotten worse since lockdown began and I've been stuck with my parents. The constant walking on eggshells, the constant fear. The lack of security (I don't have a fucking door). The looming realization that I might never be able to escape, and that I may be stuck with my parents for decades when I want to cut all contact with them.

The stress has been causing a lot more physical symptoms now that I'm spending all of my time with my parents. Some nights I physically cannot sleep, and I've never had that problems. Tonight, 2 nights ago and 4 nights ago were some of those nights, mostly due to the fact that I'm bloated and have trouble sleeping (started on the 27th). Could it be because of stress?

On another note, I've always had trouble with food, but last year I went on a ""diet"" of 1200 calories worth of TV dinners. I lost the weight, gained it back, and have had low blood pressure ever since. 
It's caused me trouble in the past, and while talking to a psychiatrist about other symptoms, she told me that I might have POTS and that I need my thyroid checked. My parents booked an appointment to do that next month. Could it be that instead?

I've talked to my parents, and it took a lot of begging, but today they'll take me to a clinic. But in the meantime, it's been awful. My parents have made lovely comments such as:

""You're a waste of money,""
""You're not trying hard enough,""
""Nobody will help you if you act like that,""
""Even the doctors have given up on you,""

I'm worried. My mom doesn't trust doctors, she believes that they don't know anything and are just out for money. She reads and believes every little word she reads on Facebook. She doesn't believe in mental illnesses, but Facebook told her that lemons permanently cure anxiety so she believed it and put a lemon in my room.

They absolutely hate when I ask for help when I'm sick. And I've been getting sick a lot now that I'm stuck with them.

I really need good sleep, and I have sleep problems going back many many years. She tells me to go to bed earlier, which A: I'm lucky if I can fall asleep at all- and B: for 30 minutes past our bedtime yesterday she laid on my side of the bed watching Facebook videos!!

451,"So this whole mess started with the corona lock down. First of all sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes, English is my second language. It's going to be a longer story, sorry for that aswell but I really need as much advice as possible right now. It's not going to be clearly sorted cause I can't sort any thought right now even when I write it down. 

Hi I'm someone, 21 male a student of theater and sociology. I always thought of myself as a mentally fit person and never had any problems with mental health in general. Never had to worry about a lot at the same time. Even when I had to I was able to surpress my feelings or just lock them away until nobody would care about them anymore and the  topic was done. 

I had a Girlfriend 20, she stayed with me for the first 4-5 weeks of the lock down. We were in an open relationship cause we both need the space to explore our sexuality a bit and we are both human-loving people. I get so much quality of life out of talking to people and meeting new people.

Anyway I have a small 10 square meter room in a shared house with 6 other students. After a week or so I got a tonsillitis and she took good care of me. After that 4-5 weeks I had my first breakdown. Ever. I've had never experienced anything like this. Everything was just too much. Ich had to quit smoking for that time cause of the tonsillitis and I turned into kind of a douchbag sometines, even towards her. Which killed me. I had no place to go back to and have a little privacy that I needed so badly. And the thought about this deadly pandemic just made me loose my mind. I felt numbed (Not sure if that's correct grammar) 

During the first weeks I lost the interest in everything. I didn't work on my university stuff and also my enthusiasm for activism (I'm part of a climate activist group) just dropped to zero.

I talked to her and we decided that she moves back to her trailer like thing. It's not like the typical trailer, but more like a tiny house which she renovated herself.
Everything was great after that and I got my freedom back. Just a couple days later I discovered scabies on me wich was like a punch into the stomach. I knew how long a friend of mine needed to get rid of them. So I started my treatment and she did it aswell but we sometimes couldn't keep our hands of each other and had sex. We reinfected each other all the time and I became kind of paranoid about these little motherfuckers. In the end after another 6 weeks I had gotten rid of them but some marks and red spots were left. The problem now was that I had gotten paranoid in connection with the scabies and the anxiety that they would be back. But not only in connection with the scabies but also with everything regarding my health everything was a possible thread. 2 weeks later I got diagnosed with 2 different STI's which I had to take antibiotics for. And then out of nowhere 2 or 3 weeks ago i started to become short of breath and had a little cough. My first thought it couldn't be corona. Never had contact to anybody that looked sick or was infected, nah it couldn't be. So anyway still there is this problem with short breath and I have to be honest here I do smoke a lot of weed and when I smoked one a few weeks back I gasped for air and my thoughts spiraled out of control again. I became kind of a hypochondriac worrying about everything in my body and looked up all the possible illnesses that fit the symptoms. I took a corona test so that I was allowed to see the lung specialist. It came back negative and even after leaving the doctors office I wasn't any smarter. Nothing was able to explain my shortness of breath and this narrow feeling in my chest. So there it was the first struggle I got through the corona virus.

Let's keep going. As I told you before university never got much attention from me during the time and I pushed everything into the future (can you say it like that? Idk). A few weeks ago there were all these deadlines and things I had to get done in time which gave me a lot of stress and anxiety to fail. I got everything done now but in the end it was a shit ton of struggle and stress for me.

At the same time I had to worry about my best friend. I moved to this town two years ago and he was my best friend ever since. We were inseparable, on the same wave length. He taught me his philosophy of life and love and I was amazed and adapted it. He has had anxiety for a while and they killed him back when he was 15. But somehow he got rid of them and turned into this guy who was able to light up your mood by talking to you. He has got this Charme its unexplainable. It was always him and me. So half a year ago another dude joins our friendship and we were three people. It started out slowly he sometimes hung around with us we smoked some weed talked and just did stuff. I wasn't conflicted about it in the beginning. But now...
At beginning of the lockdown the dude moved into my best friend's apartment. He always slepped at other places and never at home cause he has got a lot of problems with his dad, which is totally fine but he always acted like he was homeless and had nowhere to stay. So there we were. I had my girlfriend with me and the other guy stayed with my best friend. They got along quite nicely and had a similar energy that we had. Not the same but definitely compareable. The envy really kicked in when they both started creative projects together. They started rapping and producing and started to write a TV series. Both projects are amazing and I'm sometimes invited to join but when I sit there I just feel sad and there is no creative energy coming out of me. Not only sadness which is a huge part but also anger towards the other guy who started to steal my friendship. Even though he probably isn't doing it on purpose, I'm not sure, I've had that feeling inside me that he was stealing my best and only friend. There was just this anger and sadness all the time.

So all of this shit I had to worry about at the same time. I recognize how it changed me and the way I behaved. Towards the new friend in our group towards my best friend and my girlfriend. 

That's a little bit of the backstory I'm sorry it got so long. So anyway over the last weeks I recognize a loss in feelings in general. I always felt kinda sad and bummed out all the time and I was thinking about everything but always in a negative way. The whole world was against me and I felt Lost.

I quit my relationship with my girlfriend a day ago. I just haven't had the feelings anymore and it scared me. She was this little tiny human that has helped me through so much and loved me and needed me (she has psychological problems herself) but the more time past the more this feeling came up that I didn't loved her anymore the same way. We got together on the 31st of December half a year ago. And now the feelings are just gone. In retrospective it was always the same with my relationships. I get head over heels into this relationship without checking my feelings first and after a few month the breakup comes. And if there is any doubt about anything it just gets pushed away. We had sex on new years and since then we were kind of hanging out and I was convinced she had developed feelings for me. I told her I was in no way ready for a monogam relationship. So we decided to open it up. But it still is a relationship which takes a lot of work and time. It is also connected with a little bit of pain. No one can be in such a relationship without having that little feel of envy inside of them but for the right person it is easy to surpress. There were a couple of things that pulled up over the last few months. Like we never got over the basics of smalltalk. I wasn't able to open up about my feelings but when I did I never got anything helpful out of her not even something that would cheer me up, just a sound of recognition. I stopped opening up aswell cause she never opened up herself. I got to know the person she tries to be by seeing the way she talks and behaves but not the person she really is under the facade that everyone in the world is wearing. Sometimes she told me something that I completely didn't care about and it annoyed me several times. It was just so trivial all the time. 
I want to be a person of big talk and I know, sometimes I am not that myself but I try to be. There were moments when we talked about nothing and just stared at our phones all the times. I wanted to talk about something but there was just nothing I  could think of and this feeling of having lost the connection was present all the time. Now I feel like she isn't the one for me. Not the kind of person I need right now. I need someone who can help me understand how I feel who is more grown up and older than me who can teach me about myself while talking about herself and other things. On the other hand she started to open up a bit yesterday. we had a good talk about feelings and anxiety but my brain just kept telling me that she is just doing this now to keep me from breaking up. We had that ""we need to talk about our communication"" talk before and nothing changed during the time. Also once this feeling of maybe not feeling the same towards her came up I couldn't push it away and thought about it for a long time and it teared me down. I know she has a lot of struggle and its really hard for her to open up but I can't wait for her to do so. She is this great person I really don't wanna loose and that I wanna help. She is still in reach cause I left some sort of door open to me when we talked. But this is just hurting her more. I don't know what to do. My feelings are gone for a lot of things and I decided to get help from a psychologist but will I be able to love her again. Is it possible to love someone again after the feelings have gotten lost somewhere? 

I feel torn apart right now. Desperate to solve all my problems. The fact that I am not able to solf anything right now puts even more pressure on me. This feeling of numbness and just being lost. 

What is happening to me? I don't want to act that  way and I can see from an objective perspective how I have changed in the way I'm thinking and acting and it scares me. How do I handle any of these problems? 
The girl that needs me but that I can't help at least as a boyfriend. I want to help her get out of this hole  that she's stuck in but I ve hurt her so bad and she doesn't deserve it. I'm just not sure what I feel in relation to everything right now. Everything is just unclear to me and my thoughts are running wild while background music is playing in my brain. 
This is just a little scratch on the surface of my struggles there is definitely more which I have to figure out and what would take to much time. 


Any advice on anything is appreciated. 

TLDR: I lost my feelings for anything and energy for life and love. Which gives me the feeling of moving away from my friend but which I don't want. Now it got my girlfriend.",31Jul2020,1
452,"Hi
I (18m) am currently on holiday with my best friend (19f). The holiday has been amazing up until an hour ago, where I said something, that understandably deeply hurt my friend. 
Everything was fine, we were in a great mood and were on our way to the beach. We were talking and joking with each other, and then I said something which I don’t want to go into detail with. I gave her the impression, that I enjoyed and liked the thought of her traumas, which she has recently opened up to me about, despite it being very hard for her. She is also in the process of getting professional help, which has been a huge step for her. 
I deeply care about her and love her, and wouldn’t want anything more than for her to not be affected my her traumas, which deeply disgust me, and which I in no way what so ever enjoy knowing of. I understand her and I wish for her to feel good about herself, because she is such an amazing person.
However, I made a comment that made it seem as though, I “enjoyed” her having these traumas, which I in no way do.
She got really sad and questioned whether I actually enjoyed her traumas when she opened up to me. I didn’t.
Now I’m sitting at a bar by the hotel, because she wants to be alone.
My question is: how do I convince her that I in no way meant what I said and that I said it in a dumb way, that made her (understandably) misunderstand me and how can I gain her trust again?

463,"**Please hear me out before commenting!**

I'm always open to new friendships and alliances. At school I try to talk to everyone, sometimes I get a great conversation and a new friend out of it, but other times I don't, that's just part of it. 

However, when I start a conversation with these 'bullied' kids, I get the feeling that a remarkable number of them are not taking me sincere and aren't interested in what I have to say.   
They don't completely ignore me, but rather give me a half-hearted friendship out of loneliness. 

I had this boy in my class who was bullied and had almost no friends. I tried to be friendly towards him, and instead of being grateful and accepting my efforts, he would ditch me and run after the 'popular boys'.  *(I did get along with the class and had quite a few friends, was just not the most popular of the bunch)*   
He would also deliberately try to **exclude** me in group work with my friends (which he failed miserably at, making him even more unpopular), and almost screwed me over on a dutch assignment.   
After that assignment, I didn't take him seriously anymore and made other new friends. 

I have the impression that a remarkable number of these so-called 'bullied' kids have flawed personalities themselves and are only interested in mingling with the popular kids. They aren't friendly towards the few people who try to converse with them.   
I don't discriminate anyone and I **condemn bullying**, but if I put my time, sweat and effort into you, I want something back, not in the form of money or homework, but **friendship**.

**What are your experiences with trying to be friends with a kid being bullied?**  
**And should I make an effort to stop the bullying?**

&gt;**Note, my opinion does not reflect on all kids getting bullied,** but I have seen this happen a lot. One of my best buddies as an example, stopped the pestering of a boy in his class, only to get ditched after the bullied boy made new friends. I don't want the same to happen to me.

However, I must admit, I made friends with this goofy kid who I wouldn't say was bullied, but often excluded. He turned out to be one of my biggest allies, often brought a smile to my face and saved my ass lots of times.",31Jul2020,1

469,"My dad has had a pretty tough life, having a schizophrenic, abusive father, having to earn for himself and for the house since he was around 12, having to get an education for him and his siblings with no support from his father. I live in South Asia, and it's part of the culture to spend a lot of time with your extended family and for them to practically be your only friends, but my dad's relatives never liked him, and were jealous of his success, took advantage of him, bullied him, etc. His siblings, who he practically raised, ended up wasting his money, taking advantage of him, and being all around assholes. He persevered through all of this and learned, but the lessons he decided to take out of these experiences were very unhealthy. He believes that everyone is horrible, because our relatives are horrible, and our relatives are everyone, he believes this world was made to torture people, and that there is no way to be happy, because there will always come sadness.

My dad's mental health was already deteriorating from not having any social interaction because his relatives were not worth building a relationship with, and, because of our culture, it didn't occur to him to find friends elsewhere. Then, his mother (my grandma) died, and she was the only good person in his life, the only one who had cared for him. We had moved to the US because my dad got a job there, and my uncles were taking care of my grandma, and since he already hated them and knew them to be horrible people, he blamed them for her death. He was absolutely devestated. We moved back home right after that.

My dad has always been a bit of a germophobe, but it went to the absolute extremes after that, probably because he was more anxious about the germs, and also because taking these extreme precautions made him feel good. He also got extremely protective of my little brother, demanding that my mom watch him literally at all times. Our culture also doesn't really promote empathy, so while my dad thought of this stuff as caring for us, it was actually absolutely useless and just making our lives very hard. He also thinks a bit too highly of himself, like he just keeps giving to people and they just don't appreciate him. Back to his relatives and siblings, though they were assholes and could've handled things smarter, it seems quite obvious to me that he was an asshole too, because after hearing insults about them my whole life, I'm on the other side of this, and it's not because I want to take from him or I hate him, but it's because he's not being realistic and he has mental issues that he needs to resolve. My aunt, my dad's sister, did deal with everything smarter and didn't let my dad be a dick to her while also not being a dick to him, and in the time I spent with her I heard many stories of how he thought too highly of himself in their childhood, even though he did enroll them in school, and support them financially, he was a lot like his father, demanding everything from them and insulting their character and crushing their spirit. If you haven't experienced this before you may be thinking that he's allowed to call them names sometimes after all he's done for them, but it's not just calling names, it's very mentally damaging, and it's just human nature to not look at the other factors that aren't as clearly visible. Again, my aunt was smarter and did see those factors, so she's still on speaking terms with my dad.

So, nowadays it's gotten really rough and there are ""fighting weeks"" every month or so, where there's a fight every day or other day for a week, and every fight gets us closer to separation and divorce, and I've tried my best to be nice to him so he trusts me and I can talk to him and try to explain the reality of the situation, but he's just so close minded, and he's starting to get mad that we're trying to change him all the time, when we've changed everything about ourselves, and though we very often try to change him he hasn't changed a single thing or listened a single time. An hour ago he accused my mom, someone who I know to have no particular interest for sex, someone who is very honest about everything, someone who would never lie or cause anyone harm, someone who only cares about the betterment of her family and herself, of cheating multiple times. Back when my grandma died, my dad took the next flight right after he got the phone call, and me and my mom and my little brother were left in the US all alone (I have a sister too, she left with dad) for four months. It's possible she did cheat earlier on in the marriage, because I don't know much about how she was the then, but while we were worried about how we were going to pack up the whole house all by ourselves, how we're going to financially support ourselves (till my dad got a job back home, about a month in), and especially about how dad is going to be? Like I was literally disgusted that he could even think that. And he said he was 100% sure she had an affair then! That's the one time he was 100% sure of! Also I should mention that he's had multiple affairs, he literally looks at pictures of naked women all day, he messages them all the time, he's literally like the bobs and vegana guy, he recently told me to install WhatsApp on my phone with his second number, and multiple women have sent photos, and he's specifically said not to open his messages, and he has a history of hiring women in his office.

He also thinks that God is putting thoughts in his mind about how the universe works. That, the fact that he thinks my mom was having an affair, and many other things leads me to believe he might be schizophrenic. It sort of runs in the family too, his dad is schizophrenic, his brother is schizophrenic, and I've gotten symptoms before. I know that he isn't really like this, he's just had a rough time, and tbh everyone needs female attention sometimes, and it's not like him and my mom are that close, and she doesn't mind that much either. I just don't know what to do or how to help him, he just told me that I should start earning for myself because he started much earlier (I'm 15), and I have no idea how to do that either. I don't want to just leave him, because if I do there will be no hope for him, but at the same time I'm really tired, and college is the perfect opportunity to leave everything behind (I'm a bit young for my grade so I'll be going soon). I just wish I had a normal life, normal parents, normal school.

472,"Sorry I didn't know what to title this lol

I've (16m) been extremely depressed and it just doesn't seem to get better, and alot of people don't seem to care. This started since a bad breakup with my ex (16f), and I truly loved her with all my heart for as cringe as that sounds. (*7 months ago)
She has a very verbally abusive father and she doupt herself alot, and eventually are relationship. No matter what it seemed that I did to show that I cared for her she believed otherwise, and this built up stress for me. This stress really didn't help when the breakup finally happened (a month before our anniversary) as it made me unrational and just making the situation worse.
It wasn't long before she started talking to other dudes and flirting with them and that really hurt me. She made me feel like absolute shit and made my ""friends"" do the same, via spreading rumors about me that I was some horrible person. Then not even 3 months later shes dating who I thought was a bestfriend. I was just tempted to pull the trigger at this point.

Now we have this pandemic and Im home all the time with a extremely dry phone, I feel alone and slowly losing interest in things that I used to love. I don't know what to do anymore.

473,"Hi there.

I'm inviting people over to play poker at my new apartment tonight, and I've never hosted a hangout before.

Maybe it isn't a big deal, but I feel very anxious about it. I am exhausted by thoughts of ""what happens if only one shows up,"" ""what if it's super awkward,"" ""what if they want to leave but feel trapped here,"" etc. to the point where I just want to cancel the whole thing and spend my Friday night watching Netflix.

I just want people to have a good time, so I guess I'm asking for advice in two parts.

1. What are some tips to prepare for having friends over?

2. How do I stop holding myself accountable for the feelings / emotions of others?

474,"I’m currently 23, and I’ve lived with my aunt and uncle for the last 7 years. When I was 15, I left my own home because it was abusive (my older brother hits my mom regularly and gave me death threats). For my own safety, I left my home and hopped houses (staying with neighbours and distant relatives) until I was 16. My mom and I didn’t keep contact. 

At 16, my aunt and uncle willingly took me into their home and that’s where I’ve been for the last 7 years. It was a wonderful 7 years. They treated me like family, gave me a room, fed me, they saw me graduate secondary school and enter university, they’ve seen all my firsts (my first job, first boyfriend, first heartbreak). My aunt and uncle became the father and mother which I never had. The only downfall about staying with them was religion. They’re extremely religious but I’m not, so this is something I had to hide from them. 

Now, finally, I’m moving out of my aunt and uncle’s place. I thought on this day I would be happy. I was finally going to have freedom. I could finally express myself. I didn’t have to abide by religious rules and laws anymore. To my dismay, those were the last things I’m feeling. I feel like I may have regretted my decision to move out of their house because my aunt and uncle have a stable, functional family unlike my own. With them, I feel safe, like I’m normal, like I have equal opportunities as everybody else to succeed in this life.

Right now, I’m moving back into my original home. My abusive brother is finally kicked out of the home but my estranged mother is still there, along with my grandfather. I made the decision to move back because I’d like to live with my 80 year old grandfather before he passes on. But I’m having mixed feelings about moving back, even though all my things at my aunt and uncle’s house are all packed already. They’re sad to watch me leave too. Can someone explain why I’m feeling heavy hearted? Did I make the right choice to move out of a good home?

I struggle to with severe social anxiety which has just gotten a billion times worse during covid (I really started to isolate myself). On one hand I want to meet my friends because I know it’s important to do so in order to maintain our friendship. On the other hand I dread going and feel down because of it. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I do. I am scared that we won’t have a lot to talk about or know what we should do (we haven’t planned anything concrete, just to meet up at a specific time). It makes me so anxious just staring to think about it and then I know I will be keeping a close look at the clock the entire time to know when I should get back home. We have known each other for almost a year, but at times I don’t feel like we know each other that well and that it’ll be awakened and ugh yeah, I hope some of this made a little bit of sense.

479,"Over quarantine I didn't see alot of people for a long time. This made me more productive, I finished assignments, I got up early and got the day most days, there was and still is consistent positive progression in my life. I became a functioning sad person who was largely going through the motions.

However, as you can probably predict it got kind of lonely, I had my parents and all but it's not the same as talking shit with friends over a couple beers to decompress. I've realised that the occasional drink with good people really helps me stop taking life so seriously, which is a major cause of suffering for me.

Some of the people I hang out with are cool and I feel they have my best interests at heart where as others I never know where I stand with them even after 20 years lol

I just want to find a balance of relaxing with friends and improving my life, but some of my friendship circle have a tendacy of making me feel bad about myself and leading me down a road of beer, cocaine and moaning about life.

Before quarantine, life was kind of just passing me by and quite frankly I was scared of the world, even though deep down I was always in love with it. I think possibly I just need to be patient finding more positive friends and hanging out with the good people in my life, but these negative folks are always at social events that I go to and we've known each other for so long that to a third party we'd be seen as ""close friends"" and they are weird respected/feared  by alot of the people that I like.

480,"I don't know what to do, I (18M) have been with my girlfriend (18F) for around 9 months now and last night, we were hanging out and she randomly told me that if she had the opportunity to sell her nudes online or to people around us, that she would do it. 

That made me extremely upset internally, because I'm an insecure person and knowjng that she would do that stuff for other guys makes me sick to my stomach. I havent told her how i feel yet.

Before she was ""officially"" my girlfriend she asked me if i would date someone like Belle Delphine, and I said no, because that would make me insecure about the relationship and because exclusivity is important to me and she still decided to accept to be my girlfriend.

She also said that it's okay for her to do it, since she wouldnt mind if I did it. But the thing is that I feel like thats not fair, because no one would want to see me naked (not that im interested in selling nudes) and shes Literally a model so tons of people will definately watch her nudes. Obviously, my opinion is stupid and probably wrong, but it still makes me feel like shit and idk what to do and how to tell her that i would really like her not to sell her nudes. 

Basically what im looking for is advice on either, how to get over that insecurity about other guys/girls seeing her naked OR someone to tell me if its okay for me to be upset by this? im so conflicted, because on one hand, i want us to remain exclusive and feel comfortable in our relationship, but on the other, I dont want to keep her from doing something that she might want to start doing for money one day.

also please tell me if i would be an asshole for trying to get her to not get into that kind of stuff.

I tried talking to girls for about a month after it happened, but I quickly gave up on that. Even when I didn't have an intention, when I was just being friendly, girls would instantly reject me. They seemed to be scared of me. I mentioned it to my therapist and she said:

&gt;Maybe don't talk to complete strangers anymore, because chances are, you're not going to get a good reaction.

So yeah, my wife is going to have to find me, apparently.

The thing is, though, those girls probably have someone they admire. For that reason, every time I see romance around me now, it seriously feels like an insult.

&gt;Love makes the world go around. 

Believe me. I know. How do you manage the constant reminders?

486,"Here is a link to his apology https://imgur.com/a/WHnmb3T

My(24f) boyfriend (24m) and I have had it rough lately, and I’m pretty sure I’m leaving soon. Ive honestly expressed this to him. One of the big reasons is a lack of trust. I catch him in small lies all the time. 
   Yesterday morning I took his car to the store, noticed a $50 bill in the visor. Which confused me, because to my knowledge he was broke, as he asked for lunch money the day before. He only does this when his wallet is bone dry. 
   I ask him about it and he replies with: he took the $50 out of his fathers stash, for gas or whatever. That was the money he was going to replace it. 
I immediately get upset for him stealing, and he replies with he knew it was stupid, he didn’t even use the $50 and was just going to put it back. 
However he uses the “I was going to” line on an almost daily basis, and I don’t believe him when he uses it. It’s super old and another reason I’m deciding to leave, his lack of responsibility. 

   Fast forward to his apology... it does not sound sincere to me. I think if it was he would have left out the part about not using the money. All of his apologies, even our “heart to hearts” sound fake and sort of rehearsed. 
Idk if it’s just me being weird, but I would like a second opinion on the apology and if it sounds rehearsed to anyone else.",31Jul2020,1

492,"Obviously, I’m poor. My family just about manages to keep going with money. Like most families in my school and most my friends. My best friend however has always been known to have more money than us and to be doing better. She’s got a pretty big house, her own garden where they grow their own food. She’s got a good life and I’m happy for her. 

Recently, there’s been a lot of things about “eat the rich” and me and my friends have always hated the “elite.” Those who are too rich for their own good (which isn’t my friend she’s not THAT rich). Anyways, my best friend is constantly posting memes and articles about why we should “eat the rich.” And I agree or find most of them funny. 

Anyways, my friend (17F) has just been given permission to access her accounts. She came to me bragging about how rich she was, told me how much money she had and I had to tell her that wasn’t a lot. Well so I thought. Turns out she’s got a lot of savings accounts and over the course of 3-4 years her family have set up a Uni account for her. They’ve saved up enough money so far to pay her entire tuition at this point. Within two years they managed to save up basically the same amount of money that my mum saved up in her entire life. 

That’s not what angered me. What angered me was my friend said “I just wish they’d give me access to it, so I can put that money towards a house and I can just get a student loan and pay off the debt.” Idk why that angered me so much but I just to see her have the privilege and opportunity that so many of her friends and people I know never have or will have and to be able to avoid worrying about being in debt due to Uni and she would CHOOSE to be in debt? 

I don’t get it. Why would you choose to risk being in debt? Chances are even if she took that chance she’d pay that debt off pretty quickly with help from her family and her own money. I don’t doubt that a bit but why would you do that when you don’t have to? I may have been harsh to her but I ended up calling her an idiot for being so willing to just throw away that opportunity, I pointed out how her uni fees were almost the exact same as my mums life savings. How she needs to realise how fucking good she has it and to stop trying to act like and be poor to fit in with her other friends. 

She can share the same political views as us and share memes saying “eat the rich” all she wants and she can genuinely hate rich people (which I don’t hate rich people only the likes of Jeff Bezos etc) but the fact that she’d be willing to go into debt just so she can be relatable and not be one the “the rich” that she hates so much confuses the shit out off me. 

How tf can I/ would I go about convincing her to not waste such a great opportunity?",31Jul2020,1

On the one hand, I have obviously agreed that I would go already, I'd like to celebrate with him, if I pull out now I may anger him and/or my other friends, and we're all young so are at low risk of having serious consequences arise from any possible infection; on the other hand, attending would go against government advice (I live in the UK), and I feel like would betray the sense of responsibility I feel to other people who are more at risk than I am, as if infected I could pass the virus on to them.

510,"

So I met this guy a few weeks ago and we had sex and it was great, it was only his second time but I wouldn’t have known unless he had told me afterwards, everything was fine and we still talk everyday and want to meet again, he’s not in his phone much because he’s busy with training and doesn’t have good internet where he lives but nevertheless he finds a way to text me at least once a day. The thing is he showers me in compliments whenever we talk, like I can do no wrong and we were going to sneak out to meet one day and he fell asleep, he apologised profusely and said he’d get me a present or something the next time we met. We talk about sex mostly but he will happily have a proper conversation too. I met a guy from tinder and I told him
Afterwards about how it was a disaster and I think he got jealous because he made a tinder afterwards and matched with me, also said he wanted to meet to make up for the bad date.  I’m just very confused if he just thinks the sex was amazing and wants to stay in my good books or he’s trying to hint at maybe more ? It seems he’s doing a lot just for another meet.  

Summary: slept with a guy and it was very good now he’s being very nice and complimenting me all the time and wants to buy me something to make up for falling asleep.",31Jul2020,1

512,"Last night I went over to an old coworker's house to hookup for the first time. Let's call him E.

I've known him for about 3 years, but we didn't talk for 2 of those 3 as I had a boyfriend (now ex). Before I got in my relationship however, there was some flirting between myself and E, and we started a small ""fling"" that kind of died down after a few months.

Anyway I've always been into him and now that I'm single (as of April), we've been talking and things progressed and we both wanted to have sex.

I am a super anxious/awkward person when it comes to being intimate with someone new. I had a drink about an hour before I went over last night, and then my friend got me to take TWO ""shots for courage"". I was definitely feeling the alcohol when I was at his place.

So here's essentially what I'm dealing with:

1. I was tipsy last night so I'm going over anything I could have said that was stupid/made no sense to him, because he was sober. I'm worried I was noticeably intoxicated (neither he or I talked about it though which makes it worse).
2. I had a period of about 5 minutes where I couldn't get fully wet (def from the mix of nerves and alcohol). It was really frustrating and I felt bad for him because he was trying to help (fingering me, kissing my neck/chest, etc). So I tried going down on him, it worked but I had mild dry mouth so it wasn't as wet as I wanted. Eventually I got on top and started riding him and then I got really wet, so we were able to fuck then. We tried different positions too and he finished so I'm not worried about that specifically.
3. We were only able to have sex once, because the lead-up to it took too long and then after, we just lay together talking and catching up and laughing, lost track of time and it was already 2:30am so at that point he drove me home. 
4. I woke up this morning feeling really anxious. I'm upset at myself for drinking beforehand because I think that was the root of all my issues: couldn't get wet easily, worried if I was making a fool of myself, and so on. I also feel like I could have performed better...I've been better at other hookups and I just dread how last night unfolded.

Does anyone have any advice to help calm my anxieties/worries? Has anyone else experienced this before? I feel so embarrassed.",31Jul2020,1

Once when I was 7 my bio dad let me drive his truck cause he said he was driving at that age so so should I. Cool. Well I almost killed us. He screamed and belittled me and terrified me of ever getting behind the wheel. 

For a long time I didn't know that that anxiety was what was holding me back from driving. It just sort of clicked for me recently. 

I was passed around from family member to family member. During the years I was supposed to be learning how to drive I was basically forgotten about and I also did not make it a priority for myself to learn. I went straight to working hard and making money and that's basically what Ive been doing since. Nobody cared if I learned to drive and neither did I. I got to work no matter what, bus, Uber, walking if I had too. 

Even after I had my daughter at 20 I never had an issue making it to doctors appointments cause where there is a will there is a way. 

But after having my realization about WHY I didn't want to drive I've been having this itch to learn but I have no idea where to start. 

I really don't have any friends or family to help me and I hate asking for help anyway (being raised by alcoholics will do that too you). 

Where do I even start? I am from Florida (Pinellas county) do I need to get my permit? Do I have to have it for a year? I do have one person who can help me drive and let me use her car but she is a pain in the ass. I'll push through it for the sake of getting my shit together but she isn't the type of person who will help me find this information. 

There are so many different driving school things when I googled it I cant tell what is real and what isn't. I'm very good at following directions but I just need some directions to follow lol. 

Sorry for the long read. Just don't know what to do and I hope someone can help me navigate through this weird time of mine. Thanks.",31Jul2020,1

530,"Hi there!

&amp;#x200B;

Like most children, I never really liked vegetables. I don't know whether it was the taste, some mental blockade or simply wanting different kinds of food I liked more, but there were little to no kinds of vegetables I liked, regardles of the way the vegetable was prepared or incorporated into a dish. However, through the persistence of my parents, I began to 'tolerate' some odd vegetables here and there, such as broccoli or string beans (I don't know whether this is the correct translation, English is not my first language). 

&amp;#x200B;

However, over the course of the years, the only way I could still 'tolerate' these and other kinds of vegetables was through masking their taste with for example cheese or different kinds of sauces, such as mayonaise or bbq-sauce. Even though I was able to ingest vegetables and thus the required nutrients this way, it has resulted in me never actually having learned to appreciate the taste of vegetables.

&amp;#x200B;

Skipping forward approximately 15 years, there are effectively no vegetables I like and I am pretty overweight, seeing as the food I do like to eat is generally relatively unhealthy. And besides the health benifits, it bothers me that in restaurants I ignore half the menu (and therefore possibly delicious dishes) as a result of me not being able to tolerate any veggies. 

&amp;#x200B;

These factors combined made me determined to try and learn to eat vegetables, and try and come to like them. I've purposely decided to eat a wide variety of vegetables, regardless of how much I dislike them, and incorporate them into a dish but make sure not to mask the taste with something else. I have tried this for approximately a year now, but have not made any progress. Strangely enough, I noticed that what seems to be the main issue isn't me not liking the taste of something but rather a mental blockage as a result of the mental image and awareness that I'm eating vegetables. For example, when I made some dishes with courgetti (there's no English translation for this as far as I'm aware of, but basically it's different kinds of pasta made out of zucchini instead of some sort of dough) I noticed that even though it tasted virtually the same as with regular pasta (which I liked), but I could barely bring myself to eat it simply by realising I wasn't eating pasta but zucchini.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, my question is whether there are people that have been in the same situation, where not the taste but the mental image prevents you from liking vegetables (or any other kind of food for that matter), and if and how you managed to work around this?",31Jul2020,1

We got into a conflict, with me stating that if it’s safe enough to go on a trip, it’s safe enough for me to move out, and that I was only going on the trip as a compromise to prevent turmoil against me moving out. I also stated that I wanted to leave or not participate in any activites if I was no longer allowed to move out, to which my father told me “Our family unhappiness is because of you. The reason why we’ire miserable is because of you. You are one of the most selfish people I’ve ever met” (I wrote it down verbatim because of how hurt I was).

539,"So a few months ago a male coworker sent me a photo of himself in pink lingerie with his whole dick out. Then he kept sending me messages about what he wanted to “do” to my wife and I, asking if we were open to “playing” with him and just a bunch of disgusting stuff. I reported him to my bosses immediately, but they claim that since he sent it “outside of work” there wasn’t anything they could do except keep us separated. I filed a police report, and the officer who took the report called the coworker and said that if he continued to bother me at work, I would have grounds for harassment charges. 

Now we’re a couple months out from the “incident” and this coworker has started ignoring the fact he was told by my boss and police to leave me alone. He keeps coming into my classroom when I’m in there alone, and while he doesn’t *do* anything, it makes me uncomfortable and feel unsafe. I sent him a text warning him to stay away (also as a way of documenting he isn’t leaving me alone) and he came into my class the next day. Then later that day I went to the front of the school and found him holding my 2 year old son. I literally saw red and snatched my kid away and yelled at him to never touch my kid. He laughed at me and I stormed away. He knows it was my kid, and he has zero excuse for being around him since my son is in a toddler class and this coworker works with school age. 

I feel sick whenever I see him, and my bosses are no help. One of them told me that I shouldn’t take it so personal, that maybe it was his way of coming out as gay to me, since I’m gay, and (in her words) because he wanted to involve my wife, who’s a trans woman, so there’s a lot of transphobia to unpack there. 

I don’t feel safe at work, and last night I had a really bad nightmare of him doing something to me.

Have a nice house, went to a private school, they have always showed me love and treated me and my two older brothers (21 and 23) equally. Everything was great. However back at around thanksgiving of 2018 things changed drastically. 

I share a room with my brother (21) that we’ll call T. T was at school at the time so he was never around for this. But from my room I can hear everything that is happening from downstairs so long that I’m not doing anything noisy in my room. I would hear my parents argue. So one day I decided I would eavesdrop just to see what was happening. Apparently this is what was happening

My dad would rarely show or even not the love and affection for my mom that she deserved. So because of that my mom was getting a bit flirty with someone that she works with in her building. I don’t know how but my dad discovered this and lost his shit obviously. Eventually this led to a downward spiral and my dad found emails and text messages that they were sending back and forth to each other. My dad got over it and gain trust back in my mom. Everything was normal for about 2 months until my mom kept up with her antics of talking with this guy. My dad now completely furious said to my mom that if she does not leave her job and find a different place to work that a divorce would be happening (This happened about 1 year ago). My mom said that she couldn’t because she has benefits at work that if she lost them, financially they would be screwed. So because of that my dad has zero trust in my mom.

At first I thought that my mom was a complete asshole to her whole family because of the way she would in essence “cheat” on her husband. I still cannot forgive her for what she was doing. However back in May, she talked to me and my brothers about everything that has happened the past 2 years. She apologized for what she’s done and that she made the biggest mistake of her life and that it will never happen again. And by the way she sounded and acted, I do believe her on that. The problem is that my dad still does not 

Because of this (according to my mom), my dad went full stalker mode. He tracks my moms phones to know where she is at all times. Tracks phone calls and searches on her phone. He’s even gone as as far as to put on a disguise and follow my mom and the guy my mom flirted with (separately) around all over the place (my mom also works in a high school). Now my dad is now sleeping on the couch because of everything and is rarely home. My mom is not starting to treat me and my brothers like shit. 

I have two brothers (23 yr we’ll call J) and (21 yr we’ll call T). T and I both work the same summer job together lifeguarding. T also has a part time job working at Amazon. J has a full time 9-5 job working as an engineer but still lives at home. Because of this, J and T are always working and when they aren’t working, they’re getting drunk with their friends at someone’s house. I did used to work at an ice cream shop but quit a month ago because the people I worked with treated me like shit so I just quit. BOTH my parents got furious with me and started telling me I dont put in any effort to anything and that I’m just gonna sit on my ass all day. However I work 40 hrs lifeguarding with my brother and I also do doordash (food delivery) on the side and got mad at me when I quit my “side side” job. 

Now I have a bit more free time at home. My mom does not want to talk to me. Doesn’t like T that much because he drink with his friends too much. Only likes J because he has a normal 9-5 job like anyone else. I do hang out with my friends but there’s really nothing to do because of all this COVID shit so I just end up being at home. 

I’m going into my freshman year of college and I move into school in like 3 weeks. In the meantime. I do not know what to do. I’m basically in limbo. Do I just wait the 3 weeks out? Do I try to fix something with my parents? Is there anything else I should do?

547,"So here's the situation: I am a bisexual heteroromantic guy (can have sex with anyone, but only want intimacy with the opposite sex) with a large sexual preference toward women. Tbh, I think I may just be a very horny person. As much as I want to be in a relationship and get married and all that, at this point I've pretty much given up on women. I really couldn't tell you what the problem is, but they clearly don't like me.  After a long time I finally got a match that consistently responded to me on bumble, but she ghosted me after we met and didn't seem too interested anyway.

I could go on for ages but the point is it's probably time to call it quits. The thing is: gay men love me! Like if I go on Grindr I get called hot regularly and can find someone to sleep with pretty much on demand. At this point, I think it may be time to just live as a gay man. I don't think I'll ever want a relationship or could have a crush on a man, but I wanna have sex regularly and it's just not working with women.

The problem is, I'm not exactly ""out"". My sexual and romantic preferences are hard to understand, unfortunately most people would just assume I'm a closeted gay guy no matter what I say. Since my preferences are so close to ""straight"" and girls generally don't like guys that sleep with guys, I tell people I'm just straight. I have had sex with men before, but rarely and generally because of a dry spell. So everybody in my life would have to change all their ideas about me if I just decided to live as a non-committal gay man, and I wouldn't be fulfilled, but I'm also not happy being forever alone and having to be discreet when I do decide to hook up with men. Basically my options are: keep doing what in doing now and be sad because I'll always be single and going from dry spell to dry spell, or, change my sexuality and live the difficulties of life as a gay man, while still not getting in a relationship. Both not ideal scenarios, but I can't figure out which would bring comparatively more happiness.",31Jul2020,1

550,"Hi. I’m young and so are my friends (early teens) so that’s another reason why they are probably acting like this. I just need advice. So I was in a group chat with about seven people. But I left the group chat and now I will tell you why.

So one of my friends in the group chat is white. And everyone else (including me) is Hispanic. So   one of the people in the group chat would always bully her for being “a basic white girl” and make fun of her for being American or a cracker. I know that isn’t racist of course (because white people are not oppressed) but if someone takes offense to something you shouldn’t do it anyway no matter what it is. Every time she said something the other person would invalidate it and say “ur white” I mean? I think that’s kinda mean...and considering all of us are white passing. Let’s call the bully friend A.

Friend A got upset at my white friend aswell for not being ACAB and getting ice cream from an ice cream truck during corona. I was surprised at this because she always preached supporting small businesses. I’m not gonna state my stance on the ACAB part because I don’t wanna any people upset at my stance here in the comments section biasing the replies.

Now the second problem. One person in the group would say the n-word. And so Friend A kicked them out. That is totally valid and I agreed with it. It’s a terrible thing to say. The only problem I have is how that person got kicked out for saying the n-word but friend A can openly say “chingchangwannabang” about a korean idol. I feel like that’s racist aswell. And in the gc there’s also a person who says “Ching Chong” on a regular basis but they don’t get kicked.

Friend A also has a “not like other girls” sorta thing going on and an individuality complex. She implies that you can’t be funny unless you have some type of trauma (also makes fun of my white friend for not having any) and says certain things that we do “look too straight” and is really against straight people. I’m bisexual and literal no one in our group chat is straight but I still feel uncomfortable with her saying stuff like that.  And this girl prides herself on being lesbian (which is okay) but always talks about it like it makes her better than us but has a boyfriend which confuses me. 

!!!!!(TW s*lf h*rm &amp; ED)!!!!!

Friend A and her followers in the group chat would also say really triggering stuff in the group chat like self harm and eating disorders even though me and another person said that it made us extremely uncomfortable and if they could talk privately about it. The constant talk about that kind of stuff made my mental state pretty bad and negative. And they really glorified it and made jokes about it which I also really didn’t like.

Yeah that’s it. So I left the group chat because I found it unfair. But now I have no friends. Should I try to make up with them? I totally cut them off. I don’t know if I should try again because this is the second time I’ve left the chat for stupid reasons.",31Jul2020,1

554,"I never tell this story. It's a crazy story, but absolutely true. I won't tell it to anybody in real life. Not to Hannah, who inspired it. Not to any friends. So I'm telling it here.

I am a 22 year old geek.

Last year I was a 21 year old, glasses-wearing geek who was a senior in college with nearly a 4.0 GPA. And I'm still (blush) admittedly a virgin. I'm only about 5'7, a ""studies-while-eating Doritos"" belly on an otherwise normal frame.

I told my friend Hannah about how I like to wake up very early on some days and head to the local nature preserve before class. I'm always alone, and it's beautiful.

She told me that her and her boyfriend used to go, and sometimes, she would strip to the nude.

My eyes bulged. She giggled and said it was not sexual at all. It allowed her to be ""one with nature"".

She said ""You should try it sometime, if you ever got the balls. Literally haha"".

Yeah right. I never even take my shirt off at the beach.

Then, one Tuesday morning at 6:30 am on a bright, sunny, only slightly brisk early Spring Tuesday morning...I got the itch.

I don't EVER do anything out of character. Why not just try it out? Nobody will ever know.

I actually undressed. I took off my heavy boots and long socks. My sweater. My pants. My undershirt.

There I was, shivering (it wasn't THAT cold, just a tad chilly, but the nerves got to me) in nothing but my light blue boxers.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and slid them down and kicked them off into the pile.

Now, clad in only my glasses and as bare as a newborn baby, I cupped my package with my hands, and I timidly walked towards the lake, about 50 yards from where I left my clothes, and I looked up at the gorgeous view.

The trees. The mountains. The beautiful, clear, blue lake.

Without even thinking, I placed my hands at my sides.

And there I was. Martin the virgin geek.

Naked.

Buck naked, in fact.

More naked than the trees, which were ""clothed"" in leaves.

More naked than Adam in the Garden of Eden, who at least had a fig leaf.

I was exposed. Not just physically, but exposed to new excitement and beauty.

Inspired, I even walked around the entire lake, as naked as the day I was born.

My round, bare belly shaking. My white-as-a-ghost ""bubble butt"" that Hannah would also make me blush over that she said I was always ""hiding"" under my nerdy khakis jiggling behind me. And my small package (hey, it's a throwaway!) bobbing in the brisk air.

I walked around the entire lake.

The crisp breeze occasionally startling me by caressing my bare butt. The tickle of a few flowers on my belly and package as I walked. The feel of the fresh grass through my bare feet as I walked.

Standing there, basking in the view, it was then that I heard it.

""Beautiful, simply beautiful.""

It was a woman. About 43 years old. Pretty, with a slight hard-to-pinpoint foreign accent.

She had a GIGANTIC, expensive, HD camera. And directly taking photos - OF ME!!!

I stood there frozen in shock, eyes wide, mouth open, as naked as a newborn baby with my hands at my sides in the bright sunshine for about 5 full seconds.

Then in a panic, I cupped my package with my hands and I ran behind a tree as she giggled and kept snapping photos of the scenery.

I poked my head out from behind the large tree, hiding my vulnerable, naked body behind it, with the now colder breeze attacking my bald, defenseless white buttcheeks behind me.

""You can't take those pictures!""

She said ""I sure can, sweetie. We're out in a public space. Nobody forced you to go traipsing around in your birthday suit.""

I replied: ""You can't share those photos!!""

She said ""Relax, and don't be so embarrassed. I've seen many men in the nude over the years. I'm no virgin here.""

That made me blush beat red.

She said ""For ruining my carefully planned shoot, I'm going to use these photos to create a painting.""

As I spoke up, I felt my naked, white butt-cheeks jiggling as I was shaking in panic and anger.

I said: ""A painting?! Of what?"" as I clung desperately to the tree shielding my body from her gaze.

She smirked. ""A painting showcasing true bravery and vulnerability.""

I said ""I'm no model for a painting.""

She replied: ""Oh, but you are, nude boy. It's one thing for some confident, viking man to walk around here. You're not one of those types, with some big, silly penis flopping around to show off.""

I subconsciously placed a single hand over my package, even from behind the tree.

She said: ""But you. You're the true picture of vulnerability. Your lily-white skin. Your adorable chubby belly. A hint of a bosom on you, even with hard nipples in the cool air.""

She giggled. And I subconsciously used my other hand to hide my nipples like a damsel in distress.

""And your little penis exposed for the world to see. Standing fearlessly, without cover, in the open. Clothed by nothing but your smattering of body hair, and a slight, endearing pink blush across your cheeks. I'm going to paint you.""

My ""pink"" blush turning RED as I cried: ""But you can't!!""

She said ""I can, and I will. Google me."" She gave me her name.

""Your bare body will be in my gallery in a few months.""

Defeated, I said ""Well I'm going back around the lake, the least you can do is give my dignity and avert your eyes.""

She said ""I'll do no such thing. I have more photos to take. Now go run along, naked boy. Get that cute tushie running around the lake and get dressed, it's getting cold.""

As I ran around the entire lake, with absolutely no cover, feeling my bubble butt literally shaking behind me, I turned to see her unflinchingly smirking and staring at me. And even snapping a few more final photos.

A few months later, I did Google her, and sure enough, there I was.

A sight that a girl had never seen before, my naked body. It was expertly painted I must say, with unfortunately exquisite detail. A lush greenery set against beautiful mountains, with my blushing, eyes wide, mouth open, naked spectacle, arms at my sides, standing in front. My small penis and balls prominently displayed right in front.

With 2,000 favorites on her website. She displayed it in a gallery. It was sold for $5,600.

I usually always listen when they are telling me something and do my best not to be a bother to them. However, recently whenever we hangout I notice they talk to each other about things while intentionally making sure I can't hear them, making sure I don't fully understand what they're talking about by for example using placeholder names so I don't know who they're talking about, and even showing each other texts and facing their phones away from me. Normally it's fine to have your own secrets, and that doesn't bother me. Although what does bother me for my closest friends to go so far as to make sure I'm left out sort of hurts. Sometimes when they're telling me things I commit it to memory to remember what they say because that's just what friends do, but I notice sometimes I'll be telling them something and I'll stop mid way through and it's so clear they aren't listening because they 1) aren't looking at me or 2) don't ask why I stopped. They have helped me out in times when I felt helpless in the past, so that's why I've just been thinking that maybe it's my fault. Recently I have been feeling pretty low for reasons unrelated to them, and always acted happy and fine around them because I didn't want them to worry, but maybe that has played a factor in the way they act.

565,"I have a love/hate relationship with sleep. I've gone through lots of different phases through my life regarding how I sleep, how long and when but right now I am really struggling.

So to give you a brief history, up until 2017 I was used to going to bed late, mostly because I was working until the early hours of the morning, going to bed and just waking up whenever I was good and ready. In 2017 I began working an office job alongside this other job and doing night classes at college, so I was going to bed around 2am-3am almost every night then getting up at 7am. I got used to this routine and I got used to functioning on around 4-5 hours of sleep every night, this continued even after I was no longer working those jobs.

Midway through 2019 I managed to actually fix this to a degree, going to bed at 10:30/11pm and waking up anywhere between 7-9am. I'm at uni so this wasn't always possible, but I felt way better, finally getting the right amount of sleep most nights. Fast forward to March this year, I had just been through a breakup and come home from uni just in time for lockdown (I live in the UK) and I decided to get on top of everything. I started a skincare routine morning and night, got organised  and got into a real daily routine, I started going to bed at 10:30pm each night and would automatically wake up at 9am the next day and it felt GOOD.

Now onto my issue... I have always had really vivid, dreams, but for the last month I've literally been having vivid, weird and quite often unpleasant dreams which leave me feeling tired still when I wake up, for the last 2-3 weeks I've also been waking up consistently around 3-5 times every night. This is really starting to take its toll on me now and I am waking up most days with headaches, feeling exhausted and today especially quite irritated at every little thing. 

There are a few things I have tried so far to fix this and my new routine looks like this:

* Skincare routine
* Change display on phone and laptop to ""night mode"" or turned on the blue light filter, putting all screens away an hour before I intend to sleep\*
* Switch to dimmer lighting (switching off the main light and using a table lamp)
* Write a to-do list for the morning or write in a diary some nights
* Listen to calming music or nature/rain sounds
* Read for 10-15 minutes before sleeping\*
* Spray pillows with This Works: Deep Sleep Spray\*
* Only get into bed when I am going to sleep\*
* Set an alarm for the next day and use a clock on my nightstand, leaving my phone out of reach from my bed\*

\**Introduced one at a time to my existing routine*

I have also decided that tonight I am going to take a warm shower a couple of hours before sleep, I have bought some chamomile tea too as I've read a warm cup of tea before sleep is a good idea. Now that the gyms have re-opened where I am, I plan to try and get there a few times a week and maybe this will help?

So far, none of the things I have tried have made any difference to my sleep, last night I woke up at 12am, 12:50am, 1:10am and 4:00am (approx.). There isn't any obvious reason for me waking up and I just would like to know if anybody has any advice or tips on how I can fix this? It is really starting to get to me in a big way...

TL;DR - For a few weeks I've been waking up several times through the night, every night, and nothing I've tried so far has helped. It's really taking a toll on me. Pls help.",31Jul2020,1
566,"Has anyone ever told you, ""you're not the same person I knew you as before."" 

I came across people who were super nice, the most sweetest human being ever - then a few months/years later (depending on the person) they changed - the way they talk, their attitude, etc. They are no longer the sweetest person who people can push over and be mean to. They don't smile towards everyone (even the mean people) when they used to. 

Did they fight their inner battles of being to nice? For me, when someone is mean to me and acts as a victim when it's their fault/gives me a hard time - when I see them, I automatically smile when I don't want to at them while they roll their eyes at me or look down on me.

He was my best friend, he knew everything as I confided in him. I was hesitant (maybe because it was my first time) and was vocal about everything.

577,"So I’ve been consistently weightlifting for about a month now since gyms have opened. I never look at myself in the mirror since there isn’t much to glorify ar 5’10, 165 lbs but at the same time I don’t think I can call myself really “small” and rather about average.

Meanwhile, anytime I do glance at a mirror and someone is standing or sitting besides me, I seem awfully skinny and small. The person can be taller or shorter so it’s not like I’m comparing myself to some 6’5 270 lb tank of a guy, everyone is relatively average and probably weigh anywhere from 150 lbs to 225 lbs. 

Family members say I look just fine but I don’t think I can rely on them for any realistically honest advice. So what gives? Is there a condition (mostly mentally) that causes this? Anyone else have / had this issue?",31Jul2020,1

I hate that I make him feel this way but I am just ready for the next step and he’s not and it can be a little frustrating. How do I have patience when it comes to this? Sometimes I can get so upset knowing we are stuck in what feels like a “limbo” state because he doesn’t feel ready. I want to state again that we are both on the same page about being together forever, just not on when the actual engagement &amp; marriage will happen.

580,"I (19M) am a 2nd year uni student trying to get into post graduate med (in Australia you have to do a different degree first). I went straight to university after graduating high school and have always had the plan to go straight from my undergraduate degree into medicine, which means I won't graduate until I'm 25. After that, to get a job you need to move pretty quickly into residencies and other learning opportunities so I basically won't have any chances to do something big until I'm about 30, by which point I'll be in the workforce and starting a family.

To get to what I need help with, I've always wanted to travel. I've been on a few holidays here and there with the family but I want to be independent. Go off and see the world, go experience things I may never have the chance to do again. I feel like I want to have a few months off to do this but the way my degrees work is that they're on a yearly cycle, meaning I can't start halfway through the year. So if I go away for a little bit I'll be left behind by my cohort and my other friends with the same career path.

583,"I (22F) started renting a room from a family about a year ago while in grad school. The owner of the home (55F) works two jobs—not because the first job doesn’t pay well, but because she spends her money on things she brings home but never uses and vacations frequently—so she is almost never home. This obviously wouldn’t matter much in a normal situation, but she has a ten year old dog that isn’t potty trained. When I wake up in the morning, if our other roommate (65+ F who does it other rent and lives downstairs with other tenants) has gotten up and come upstairs to sit before me she will clean. And if not I will. But between the time the owner of the home leaves from work and the time we wake up her dog pees all over the floor. And he’s been doing this for years. Yesterday I spent the day at home cleaning and doing laundry, so I had time to prompt her dog to step through his doggy door and go pee. And there were only two slip ups. But then I went to go get pizza for the downstairs tenant’s birthday celebration and when I went back upstairs to sit with the owner of the house and the older roommate, I heard the older roommate tell the owner “your dog peed in the house again” and the owner responded “because you all leave him alone”. I didn’t even know how to respond to that. It’s not our dog or our responsibility and any normal person would have had their dog trained by now. This morning I woke up and our other roommate was awake, sitting in the dark on her iPad with her feet in dry dog piss. I cleaned it because we have an open concept living room/kitchen and I wanted to be able to cook and eat in a clean environment. I have also found myself cleaning dishes that aren’t mine the past few days, too, bc my roommates leave so many dirty dishes in the sink that it becomes unusable. And I’m the only person who ever cleans the bathroom. If I miss a Sunday cleaning no one else makes a point of cleaning our shared space. I’ve grown very tired of cleaning up after my adult roommates, but the rent is fairly cheap and includes everything. I am not very confrontational but I am INCREDIBLY frustrated.

They always call muslims terrorists and pagans and they'll say lots of ignorant and microaggression statements about the black community.

590,"(places mentioned in this post are in India)

I want to travel the whole world. I made up my mind that I'll become a travel photographer when in March, 2019. It's been more than a year. I have been to some places( Spiti, Pushkar, Jaipur and Darjeeling) after that. Now I have a connection with each place that I visit. I have the privilege of capturing what I felt in the places I've been which I can relive again and again through my photographs. 

I miss Spiti Valley everyday. I really miss being there and I wish I did not fall sick when I was up there. I could've enjoyed more, but I am still very grateful for getting the opportunity to go there and see that beautiful place. I met so many amazing people too. I'm very thankful. Spiti marked the beginning of my new life so the trip holds a very special place in my heart.

In Darjeeling, I was in peace. Not for the whole time though, the time I really felt the peace in Darjeeling was when I was walking alone, without my family. I can't explain the feeling properly, but I was in a state of euphoria. It was magic. I felt so much peace. The pink sky, the hills, cute dogs..and such a pleasant weather. I knew at that moment that I had to come back here. I only had 2 days in Darj so that was a bummer. But it was still fun.

Now, this is probably very stupid but, there is this girl, she kinda reminds me of that walk I had in Darjeeling. Such a sweet and pleasant girl. How can someone be so perfect? She is so beautiful. I can't get her off my mind now. I'm in love with her. I wanna let her know all this stuff. But I really dunno how to tell her that. I can't face rejection from this girl. Her voice is so sweet. I can't take it anymore. Never felt this feeling before. I might die idk. 

I rly didn't ask for this shit. I can't sleep till I'm completely exhausted. Actually, I can't sleep.
I don't enjoy food that much these days. I just eat something to stop the stomach ache. Heart is racing all the time. My skin feels a lil diff. The only solace I get is when she texts back.
Can't help it man. I sometimes wish I wasn't capable of getting this feeling. But for some reason, it also warms my heart thinking about her. Like now, and I'm smiling as I'm writing this sentence.",31Jul2020,1

594,"My girlfriend has a roommate whose cat is pretty aggressive and I volunteered to take care of their animals while they were all on vacation. 

I had never met the kitty before today but I know she's been bitten a few times by him and the marks he left were fairy deep and concerning. Those times she's told me he sought her out while she was like chilling on the couch or minding her own business. 

They normally keep the cat in one bedroom the entire time since they learned he attacks my girlfriend and even though I knew he had issues I said they could let him free roam while they were gone. 

Today I visited their place and the little guy was immediately rubbing up on me, purring and meowing for attention. I gave him a few rubs, filled their food bowl and then walked passed him as I tried to go upstairs. 

That's when I saw his ears go back, which I know is something scared cats do, and not even half a second later he tore into my thigh. It's really deep and hurts like a mother lmfao. Blood was everywhere yadayada 

I knew the cat had a history of aggression but I wasn't expecting him to be on a hair trigger like that. When I came out of the bathroom after cleaning up he was back to 'normal' and let me walk back down the stairs. 

Does anyone know why this is happening and how I can deal with this? Today was only the first day of me feeding all the animals and I don't wanna give up. He's only ever attacked me and my girlfriend but never the roommate or his boyfriend. 

Any advice on how I can either make this cat more comfortable or at least make it easier to take care of everyone else?

596,"I have been working at a manufacturing plant for over a year now, and since we have reopened in May it's been an awful experience. 

First off, the environment is stifling and depressing. I can't really put it into words. It's a factory. But I started working there during a really bad time in my life, and being there is just a reminder of it. 

Second, I don't feel respected by my cell lead and I just feel like I'm a burden to my supervisor. I get a sexist vibe from my cell lead, I just don't like the way he talks to me. I'm always having to go up for assistance to my supervisor and feel like I'm annoying the crap out of him. Same with HR. I walked in one day to talk about a COVID case in our workplace and the HR girl said ""oh jesus"" under her breath when I walked in. So I know I annoy her. 

Since we've reopened, the workload has doubled. I am used to running 1-2 machines at a reasonable pace and now I'm running 3-4 at full speed, with parts all over my workstation, falling on the floor. And yet I am still expected to inspect every part throughly and make sure everything's perfect. It just doesn't seem reasonable to me. I'm making mistakes all over the place, have been written up 3 times now. 

While we all wear masks, no one social distances at work. And if you do, you are ostracized and not respected anyway. People take it personally or argue about it, I have had a coworker literally come up to me and say ""Oh my germs!"" and walk away laughing. She leaves me alone now, but is still rude whenever we interact and her group of people don't like me, either, and I think they're trying to sabotage me. I have even had a cell lead confront me about social distancing, saying that people are complaining about it, and straight up telling me I am rude. I have asked HR to spread awareness about the importance of social distancing and asymptomatic transmission, and nothing has been done about it. 

There was a COVID case on paint line a few weeks ago and they ran a limited schedule in my department the following week. Mostly everyone was going to stay home and they walked around asking who would volunteer to work the limited schedule, which was on paint line. I obviously said no, cuz of the COVID case and they know my mother who I live with is high-risk for the virus. The next week they tried mandating me to work the paint line. 

And now that I am on sick leave for what I thought might have been COVID, people are now complaining to management that my shorts at too short. They're normal fucking shorts. They are like an inch or less shorter than fingertip length. And they were never a problem, my supervisor never said anything, HR never said anything about them until people started complaining about them. Which again is why I think they're trying to get me to quit. 

Overall I'm just done there. I don't like the environment, I feel disrespected, there's a sense of hostility and now I can't even wear my damn shorts to work, and I'm not going out and buying more. On my off days I have anxiety about going to work, and it's just taking up too much of my energy and time at this point. 

So I'm thinking of just straight up not returning monday.

603,"Hello everyone,

My (24f) roommate (21f) moved out of our apartment in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She currently lives with her family about 20 minutes away. Originally, when we started living together, we were friends. That is gone and I receive little to no communication with her at this point. I won't go into the how and why... that is for my therapist. I have spoken at length to my therapist about this situation. 

Since she has moved out, I have texted her whenever I have changed anything in the apartment from installing batteries in our smoke or gas detectors, to the installation of our AC units, to even replacing a broken toaster. She did not respond to any of these.

In early June, I asked her when she planned to move back full time. She said she would have an answer for me soon and has not given me that answer. It is August as of tomorrow. Our lease is up in November.

She has only responded to one text besides the moving one. I texted her to let her know that I was having a friend take care of my cat when I was gone for 3 days. She asked the length of time I would be gone and did not ask anything else. She then cleaned out a good amount of her stuff from her room while I was gone but nothing else from the apartment.

Our names are on the same lease. We have each paid our half of the rent for each month or at least that is what we agreed on when we started living together.

I am not sure if she has been paying her rent since moving back with her parents in March. Her mail is still sent to our apartment, she still pays my requests on Venmo for utilities, and my landlord has not approached me about rent payments.

I have continued to pay my half of the rent on time since the pandemic started.

The eviction moratorium for my state stopped on July 25th. I have not received an eviction notice from landlord as of today, 5 days after.

I guess my question is what should I do? Do I approach my landlord first or my roommate to see if rent payments are owed? Do I hope for the best and let sleeping dogs lie? 

I have enough in savings to pay my landlord for all missed payments, however, it would literally be all of my savings.

The whole things has taken a huge emotional toll on me. I have asked friends, and my therapist about next moves but I am still unsure. I just want to feel secure. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",31Jul2020,1

I saw her on my birthday and then 2 days later she broke up with me. I was hoping that considering the reasons we broke up that we could be friends but she started ghosting me and I wouldn't hear from her from days after I'd send a message but lately she's been in a really bad mood and shes getting angry really easily and I hate to see her like this.

I have told her that I still love her but she has told me that she doesn't know if she loves me in return and I don't know whether or not I should text her. Is it a good idea or not.",31Jul2020,1
605,"I am a 30 y/o man with a Master's degree and a middle-class career. I have always been very close to my grandmother, she and my grandpa helped raise me, and we share the same worldviews. She is in her 80's and has health issues. I also have some health concerns that put me at higher risk for complications from COVID. She and I both agreed several months ago, before the pandemic, that I should move back in with her, after living alone in my own apartment, so that I can help her out, we can keep each other company, and so I can save for a down payment on a home of my own. During this pandemic, my uncle, and others, have been coming over to the house a lot, not wearing masks properly or socially-distancing, and I know are going to restaurants and travelling. I told my grandma that I feel uncomfortable with anyone coming over right now, and if we can't agree on isolating, I need to find a place of my own. She begged me not to move out, and said she would talk to him. After their conversation, he accused me of manipulating her and said I don't get to make any decisions regarding her! My dad unwillingly got involved, and I guess it turned into a yelling match between them. I'm not interested in managing her finances or medical care, I just want us both safe from this virus. I'm wondering if my best course of action is to move out. I make enough money to do so, though it will derail my financial goal of homeownership, but obviously my safety comes first, and I will not be treated like a child. I also worry about my grandma, as I have had to take her to the hospital twice in the last 4 months. What should I do?",31Jul2020,1

Constant sexual jokes, when we play whit balls you constantly hear ""stop touching my balls"" and a guy keeps screaming  ""whit your hairy pussy"" to females in the group. One day, they where playing a BDSM game whit ropes as a joke. When i left i sarcasticly said ""i tought this was scouting, not group rape"" to a girl (idk her age probably 12-13).

When i was 14 we where being dropped of and a few 11-12 they where talking about whores. I said sarcasticly that i was a whore. They asked me if i knew what a whore was i said ""a prostotute""... quietly

611,"Me and my twin sister were walking and we came across this poor small bird that was half dead. We didn't know what had exactly happened to it but my guess was it was hit by a car then played around with by some animal since it's wing looked crushed then there was feathers and bits of the bird all over the place. At first I just thought it was dead and tried moving it so cars wouldn't get bird all over their tires but then it moved a tiny bit and I saw it barely breathe.

We had no idea what to do. My sister wanted to call some rescue place but we were far away and neither of us had a phone. Even if we were to carry it the 40 minute walk home, we didn't have anywhere to carry it and who knows what diseases it might have.

There was chunks of it's body missing and even if you could save it, it wouldn't of had a good life after that. We decided to do the right thing in our opinion and put the bird out of it's misery. I've never done anything like that before so I was actually kind of scared. I found the biggest rock I could do I was sure it was over the quickest. Then I did it. It was really hard to do and it may sound dumb but I had a few tears in my eyes.

When we got home, my sister told my parents what had happened and what we did. My mum was furious with me and is calling me a murderer. She says she didn't think I was capable of doing something that horrible. I feel really bad, I was just trying to do the best thing but now I'm not sure that was the best thing.",31Jul2020,1
612,"My (25f) oldest friend (also 25f) is getting married in September and the closer it gets the more unsure I am about it. While Canada is not the worst place in the world for COVID, I still don’t think having any sort of multi household celebration is a good idea.

She lives in a small town where they thankfully haven’t had many cases, but because of this I don’t think she realizes the scope of the virus herself. I know she doesn’t keep up with the news past any of the stuff she cares about (ie how many people can be in a building together at a time now). Meanwhile I live in one of the largest cities in Canada and it’s an unavoidable truth where I am. 

I’m not sure how many people are even coming at this point - I know everyone invited from my family and my boyfriend are all refusing to go. I have no idea about her other friends and their partners. 

Her parents and other family are a huge worry. The majority of the family who loves close to her is all elderly and/or sickly. My only way to get to her wedding at this point is 2 buses which will take 4 hours to get to her wedding venue. I don’t want to potentially catch anything on the way up and pass it onto anyone attending the wedding and I also don’t want to potentially catch her anything and bring it home with me to spread to my bf, the landlord who takes care of his elderly father and anyone else I am come into contact with. 

The wedding is in a town no one lives in - when it was planned that way it made sense since it was the half way point for all the close family and friends so no one was driving or travelling a longer way - especially older family. With the pandemic, I can’t afford to rent a room for the night, nor the isolation I would have to do at home after. 

I tried to talk to her about changing the date. The venue gave her a very generous offer of changing the date without a fee cancelling with no fees until the pandemic is over, but she’s determined to have this specific anniversary date. I tried to convince her to do a courthouse wedding with her parents since they’re the most important ones who need to be there, and have it social distanced, and we could have a party and ceremony later but she’s adamantly refusing. She says she just “believes” it will be okay. 

Here’s where it gets extra tricky. I’m the maid of honour, and I’ve been one of the only stable people in her life for a long time. She accused me of not wanting to go because I didn’t support her and saying that if I really wanted to go I would find a way. I know that she’d be hurt if I didn’t go, it’s not as if I don’t want to, but there is a pandemic outside and I can’t believe she’s being so stubborn and just refusing to take other peoples safety into account. 

Ever since moving in with her fiancée, she’s turned into a different person. It’s not because of him, I see it in a lot of things but she’s become pretty selfish and a stoner with no goals for the future. At this point, I’m 99% sure if I don’t go that she’ll cut me out of her life.

I’m really torn about what to do. She’s like family and even if she’s been as asshole for the last while, I love her. I want to support and go to her wedding but unless things really get better soon I don’t want to put myself and others in danger by attending. 

TL;DR: my friend is getting married in the middle of the pandemic and if I don’t go she’ll cut me off but if I do go... well you know. Pandemic. What do I do?",31Jul2020,1
613,"Long post:

So I will give a brief history, before I was with my ex-fiance, who I will call X, I was in a relationship with his best friend J for a few months. He was my first ever boyfriend. Long story short J forcibly tried to impregnate me, cheated on me with 5 other girls, left me for the county bicycle, and told me that I sucked at sex (I was a virgin before J took it). Then along came X, who had graduated college. We hit things off and began a relationship after a few months. 

We were GREAT together. And after eight months together, I found myself engaged to him. This is where J comes in. Shortly afterwards J starts trying to gave sex with me behind X's back and the back of his new girlfriend (I will call her G). I still had lingering feelings for J as J had always made it clear that he still loved me even though he screwed up. I realize now I think I was only in ""love"" with J because he took my virginity and showed me attention (I had a childhood coated in abuse).

I mean J would put down G and X and try to have sex with me constantly. I was on my way to telling G and X after refusing for the fourth time and then I caught menengitis. It nearly killed me. X stayed with me in the hospital and was there for every test and things. Meanwhile J was telling him that I cheated on him and was on hard drugs (speed, purple). 

After the hospital X would ask me continuously about the drugs. Like picture a serene perfect date and you're in the middle of eating some steak and then your fiance asks if you're sure you're being honest about drug usage despite being there in the hospital when they tested you for every drug imaginable as well as diseases. X even offered rehab. And all of this was while I was still trying to recover from menengitis and it took me awhile to put myself together.

When I was fully healed I told X and G about J. G left J and moved out while he was away at work and X supposedly cut off the friendship. J afterwards would stalk and make threatening messages to me until I got a restraining order.

Then all of a sudden, one day there was a dating site account made in my name. Now I used to frequent this dating site before I met X and quit it after we got together. My old account pretty much laid out that I was looking for something serious and no married men and had uo to date pictures. This new account had pictures of me from high school and said along the lines of ""Looking for nothing serious, hit me up;)""

His friends had found it and alerted him of it. One of them even spoke to ""me"" and I told them I had a bf but he dont gotta knoe. Of course it looked bad and I do believe to this day J had something to do with it because he was the solve instigator in telling X that I was a pill head and a cheat. And I found it funny that after he got served a restraining order there is now a dating site up about me. X was still skeptical and would continue to accuse me of cheating. For example, I was in a group project. Well my phone says so and so [picture]. It doesbt show a preview of the pic, only the word. So if a guys name showed up with the pic caption it was obvs a penis pic. No way could it have been the project we were working on even if I showed X that it was indeed the project picture. I went to a friends house and obvs I was out to see my gal pal to scope out men. I detest cheating and was a victim myself so I wouldnt subject anyone to that.

My family told him he should leave me. My sister and my dad reported him to ICE (his grandparents were from mexico) and caused that problem (my sister and my dad are not nice people and go out of their way to make my life hell for no reason). Ans X was jealous. I had a fwb who I'll call C. X would ask about him like what does he do, where does he live, and no shit, how big is his dick and do I like it better than his.

Obviously I wouldnt answer all of them all the time so X would nag incessantly and eventually I told him your penis is good enough for me, yes he is bigger than you, but hes just a fwb nothing more. LIES! X Bellows. There was also a time where I visited C without letting X know. Nothing happened just wanted to visit C after a bad fight.

Then there was X going out with his friends to places without me and stating that they are bad places and I shoukdbt go I'm too young. I half way expected him to suggest us going out to chucky cheese. He was visiting bars and shady hole in the wall places. And I went without him because I wanted to have fun too. 

I can be harsh in my own right and sometimes I myself can be cruel. I suffer from a personality disorder and can be out of control. I wasnt easy to deal with at times and I take the blame for those instances. I am currently medicated and receiving help. And yes I have made mistakes and I wasnt very mature at the time so I I responsibility for that.

Plan B. We were always taking it even if we didnt need it and there was no fighting him. And he was pro abortion I was not. X made it clear that if I kept the baby he would sign over all parental rights if I did not get an abortion. And I told him he couldbt come back and be a revolving door dad if that happened. I actually miscarried his twins (he was out trying to find medicines I could take to induce an abortion) and when I told him he phewed like hed dodged a bullet. 

We eventually broke up and had an fwb thing because I cannot seem to let people go. He wanted to get back with me AFTER mcat because I caused so much havoc and hell in his life. And this went on for a year and a half with me trying to be better so we could be together, and after the rona hit I had to wait longer because mcat was pushed back. 

I love him with my entirety but I feel like I'm wasting my time and if it's even worth it at all.",31Jul2020,1

615,"This might sound ridiculous. Maybe it is. Still, I don't really wanna see people telling me to stop worrying about this because we're too young, and that life keeps going. It is my first long term relationship. We've been dating for over a year. She means a lot to me and we've shared so many things I just thought we were a really good couple. God, I thought we were meant to be.

We weren't ready for a LDR. We didn't plan it at all. We saw each other almost everyday and so we didn't call or text that much. Everything we shared in person was great and we had nice conversations but we saw each other often.

I haven't seen her since March. It's been six months, half a year, half of our relationship. And there's no way of seeing her. First, her parents won't let her see me, they don't know about our relationship because we're lesbians and they don't approve it. And we barely call because of time or because she doesn't want to.

At first we had a lote of hope and determination. But then things just got awful. I'm too insecure for this. I need to see people to know what they're feeling. Sometimes she ignores me. And I just think it's all my fault.
I've been feeling so insecure about myself and she has too. I don't know how to read emotion through text messages and they've always made me anxious. 
She gets angry at every little thing and I overreact.
I always try to speak things at the moment, she never wants to talk about it, unless it's face to face.
Yesterday it was our anniversary and we fought again. Because of something so small. I was feeling ignored and neglected by her. So I told her and she got mad. This is just an awful mess.
Now I know we're just suffering and hurting each other. I would love to take a break or to end things until we see again but if we do she'll block me from everywhere.

I know things would be different if we could see each other. We were the best couple, we always had so much fun or meaningful moments together. We laughed, cried and got to know each other in the best ways. I'm not even asking to see her every day, I just wish I could see her one time. 

I think we should breakup. Doesn't matter how hard I try I can't stop being anxious. It's my fault but I don't want to. I don't want to lose her, lose the chance to see her again. She's worried about her health too and I just want to support her but I think we're breaking each other. I will never stop regretting not seeing her one more time, hugging her or kissing her. I guess so is life, but I feel so weak and selfish. And it feels so wrong. I know I'm young but that doesn't make it less hard. We had a lot of plans and dreams for the future. 

So if anyone has any advice I would love to read it. Please be harsh if you want. I just want some advice. Thank you.
And sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker.",31Jul2020,1
616,"I really need everyone’s opinion on something that has been eating me up inside. Recently in my boyfriends “hidden” section in his camera roll (which also has pictures of myself) I found a screenshot of a message from his ex. All I could see was “I know you probably won’t get this but I hope..” I instantly confronted him and he tells me he didn’t read it (but the message was opened and the chat was muted) and that he took a screenshot so he remembered to tell me. I got upset and asked him to tell me if he replied back, he then told me no. Later on his ex sends me the screenshot of what he said, basically saying he couldn’t read her message because he was with me at the time and he is glad she is doing good, they will definitely reconnect in the future and he cherishes all the amazing times they had together. I then asked him if he replied and he says “I did, but I told her to stop texting” which obviously was a lie. I showed him the screenshot and he tells me she said she missed having someone and just wanted closure. They dated for close to 3 years, I am extremely upset and cannot stop thinking about this situation. He says he no longer has feelings for her and if he did he would date her. I love him and want to trust him but when he lied and kept it from me I don’t know what else to think.

He won’t really explain to me why he feels the way he does, he’s been on medication but it’s making it worse. He’s really effecting my mental health, I find him so negative, he always has something to complain about. He lives at his moms while we are apart and works 16 hours a week. Since we went into lockdown in March I’ve been home with our autistic 6 year old, he works in a store and we decided that at the time it was safer for him to stay with his mom. From him moving out every other weekend he would take our child for a couple of hours once a fortnight, we agreed in June he could start doing it and he’s flaked on taking him a few times now. He spends a lot of time playing on computer games etc and I daren’t say I’m tired or anything because all I get back is same it’s like a competition. I have a condition which means I’m fatigued and in pain all the time and have a hour to myself between our child going to sleep and me going to bed. Our relationship right now just doesn’t make sense but I keep putting it off because I know he needs to work on himself, I’ve been burned by his actions through drinking and his mental health before that I just won’t allow it anymore.

619,"So I really don't know how to start this, but I'll just jump right into it before I change my mind again. I really need advice on something that happened to me when I was 18 (which was two years ago). At that time, I hardly ever went out with friends or had any social contacts at all. It didn't really bother me though, as I've always been very introvert and liked being alone. Nevertheless, I was heavily influenced by the internet and by my family who told me that I needed to go out more often and that this was supposed to be my time to make experiences and stuff. So I really thought I was missing out on something and therefore decided to hang out with two boys who went to school with me. They had already tried to convince me to go clubbing with them several times before. I only knew them from a seminar we had to attend because of school, but I liked them. So 18 year old me naively went to meet up with those two boys. It was really a nice evening at first; we went to two or three bars and had a few drinks, we talked and played table soccer and stuff like that. One of the boys then offered me to come to his place and sleep on his couch as it was already very late and the train connection between the city and my little home village was really, really bad. If there had been the slightest sexual advances from his side at that point, I most definitely would have said No. But had just been behaving like a normal, platonic, good friend all evening. So I agreed. At about 2 am, we went to his place. I was already really tired and just wanted to sleep. He, however, wasn't tired at all and convinced me to watch a movie with him before we would go to sleep. I agreed once more and sat down next to him on his bed. We were just casually chatting about the movie when he, out of nowhere, started holding my hand. I really tried to it lightly. I actually remember having thoughts like ""Don't be such a prude. This is just what friends do. Just chill."" Well, one moment later he said ""Sorry, but you're too beautiful"" and kissed me. I didn't kiss him back. I didn't move. I didn't do anything at that point. I just really didn't know how to react or how to reject him without being a prude or being rude. So I just let it happen and then turned away, when it was over. He apologized several times and I told him it was fine and he shouldn't worry about it. This, however, seemingly made him think that it was okay to kiss me again and so he did. Once more I didn't know how to react or what to say. I was so insecure and shy at that time and simply didn't want to hurt anybody. But when he started undressing me and touched my private parts, I repeatedly said No. At least five times I pushed him away and said No. But that didn't really stop him. He just continued touching me until I didn't say anything anymore. I really, really, really don't know why I stopped saying pushing him away and saying No, but I just kind of.. gave up? He didn't exactly rape me, I guess, but he sort of went down on me and touched himself while doing so. The next day, I just acted like everything was perfectly fine because I just wanted to go home and not think about it anymore. I actually continued texting him and talking to him. I didn't want to realise that he had really done something bad to me. Actually, I still don't know how to think about this. It doesn't feel like sexual assault to me because I.. just let it happen at some point?   
Now my question is.. Would you consider that sexual assault? If so, what should I do about it? Or should I just forget about that at this point?",31Jul2020,1

627,"When I first started I got on with everyone who worked in the office and I was so excited. During the first month or so my boss would frequently come into the cubicle I share with my other colleague and talk for quite some time. This is pretty normal as the other colleagues do the same and everyone just seems to joke around and stay pretty relaxed. But after a while, when my boss was out of the office, people started making comments about how my boss has a thing for me and how he gets upset if he thinks I don’t like him. They also said he never came around and talked to this degree before I started. I brush it off because they’ve all had beef before so I figure they might be seeing things through a jaded lens. 

But in the last couple months he’s gotten increasingly snappy and rude with me despite him giving me a raving first review. Every time I get lunch with the other people in the office or talk to someone besides him for an extended period of time his entire attitude will shift. He will either stop speaking to me completely, become very short, and/or treat me like I am dumb. His wife works here as well and he seems to treat her like this pretty frequently too. I don’t know if it is a possessive thing because he is not like this with anyone other than his wife and I. It feels like he is trying to isolate me and it is really freaking me out.

I don’t know how to act now. I refuse to not speak to my other colleagues to satisfy his ridiculous and creepy behavior. But I hate being on the receiving end of whatever type of control issues this guy has. There isn’t really a way to report any of this and have him not find out and I’m fearful of greater retaliation if I do. I’ve already started searching for another job but this kinda seems like the best I can do until I finish taking some courses I need to be able to get into my program.

I know there are a lot of people that struggles to find a job, and that I should be grateful to have one, but I (and my family) don't need it. Fortunately for me, where I live college is not that expensive, so the problem isn't about the money (which if it were the case I would completely understand).

But now my parents are forcing me to work a full-time job, which leads me to drop out college. 

A few hours ago, they started making me feel ungrateful about this situation, and I'm starting to feel like I overreacted. But I know deep down that I want to finish college, and I don't think wanting to finish it will make me ""ungrateful”.

I worked very hard to enter the college and to pay it, and now my parents are forcing me to quit.

I don't know what to do or how to feel. What should I do now?",31Jul2020,1
630,"I have a blog where I mostly post nude women and memes to share among friends.  Nothing explicit, mostly naked models that I find on Reddit and other message boards... literally just copy and paste images already hosted online.  The blog started among friends but now it gets shared and now I have a couple thousand views a week.  Nothing great but not bad.  

Some of the memes I post are political.  I try to keep it neutral but, to be honest, there’s far too much Trump buffoonery to ignore, so it’s a lot of trump jokes. 

Every once in a while, I’ve gotten thinly veiled threats posted as comments on my posts.  Pretty sure it’s the same guy.  Lately though, the threats are on each post.  The threats are usually in the vein of “if you don’t stop posting anti MAGA, the SJWs will find out about all the naked girls you’re posting and shut you down.”  Kind of a weird way to go about it but I suspect the threatener is trying to conjure some plausible deniability. 

Lately, the threats have morphed from getting “shut down” by SJWS
to getting doxxed by SJWS and that they will ruin my life.  To be clear, I don’t think SJWS give a shit about my blog, I think this guy will do it and claim it was SJWS, just like they “warned” me. 

As the frequency of the treats have increased so has the apparent anger behind them.  It’s Wordpress so every comment requires an email address but they’re all throwaway emails.",31Jul2020,1

I’m a girl and I’ll be 20 in a month. My family is muslim, so there’s that. 

All my friends live in another part of our country so does my significant other (6 h away from where I live) and I wanted to study there too, but every time I even talk about visiting my friends over there my mother gets really defensive and talks about how everyone is leaving her and that someday she’ll be gone. It’s really hard to get into university where I live it’s way easier where my friends are, I’ve already waited for 2 years and I don’t want to wait any longer. 

My mother is a single mom and recently lost her mother, my grandmother. We were really close to her, we even lived at her place for 10 years and losing her really messed with us. I’m her only child so my mother doesn’t have anybody else. I have three uncles two of them are mentally and physically sick und the other one we don’t talk to. She has a boyfriend who we want to move in with but I feel like I’ll leave her all alone if I move out.

I feel so unhappy here, I miss my friends, I want to see my boyfriend again, I want to start studying, but I know it will hurt my mother and there’s no one else to look for her. My fear is that she’ll do something to herself she’s already really depressed and I don’t want her to do something stupid because she’s not in the right state of mind. At the same time this place makes me depressed and anxious, I feel lonely without all my friends and my boyfriend, but I don’t want to be selfish.

638,"In 4 hours, I have to upgrade my phone and one thing they’ll ask is “Do you want a new phone number?” And, I think I want to say “yes“ this time. 

I’ve had a fair amount of communication issues lately, and despite how much effort it will be to change them everywhere, I’d like to dump my email and phone number. 

There’s a guy I trained at work, nice, effeminate, really smart—-like me. We’d chat for whole days, after he quit I kept bumping into him at university. Then, when it seemed all hope was lost during the current pandemic, he messaged me out of the blue—-presumably using the old emergency contact list from our work, and we started chatting regularly, 9 messages per person every four days or so. He didn’t respond for a while then came back at me telling me exams were more important than messages, keep messaging,  not to message him during exams, didn’t say when exams were and he said not to text anything personal and keep it general. It was 6 or so messages, so confusing. 

I’m autistic, all my social skills are learned, I find people complicated enough as it is. This just twists my brain like a water wheel. 

Another thing, I’ve been converting to Judaism for 4 years. Despite the community knowing me as a “crazy liberal” people keep asking my thoughts on the Israeli/Palestine crisis, and I tell them and now nobody is speaking to me. That includes the orthodox rabbi who mentored me, I messaged him for guidance and I explained my issues with the others. Also. things are making it tough to hold onto faith like the more people saying you believe in G-d or science not both, and the people who hate converts. Like I said, guidance. He probably just saw Israel/Palestine and cut communication.  They all only have my email, this is what I mean. I want to dump it to make a clean cut from these people who, if they socialize with me again it will be out of obligation. 

Should I change my email and phone number? I know it’s not really a clean start, but damn, the first three weeks of it will feel good.",31Jul2020,1
639,"Ok, this might be a little lengthy so be warned.

So I've been in the same social circle as this guy for around a year (I'm 16, this happened in school), and we chatted during that time, but generally only within the group context or when walking to a class we both had together. We have a decent bit in common; we're both philosophy nerds, love music and have a somewhat similar sense of humour, so we had pretty good conversations. I enjoyed our discussions and I assumed he did to.

Fast forward to about a month ago, he asked me out on a date. I sense that he was going to starting about a month before that. At that point I didn't know I felt. It wasn't a definite yes or a definite no. But I though, what's the harm? It's just one date. After that I could decided whether I wanted another one or not. At this point we're also texting a decent bit, but only ever platonic discussion. I assumed, wow, we have really good intellectual chemistry if we can talk for so long about these deep and complex issues. I wasn't certain if I was interested romantically but I certainly thought I'd hit a jackpot in terms of someone I could connect with intellectually.

The date comes around, we eat out and go bowling. We got separate checks, which was OK. (Honestly it was my first date and I don't really know what the etiquette is. It's less about the fact that he's a guy and more that he was the one that asked me out to somewhere that he knew would cost a decent amount. Also he has a job and I don't, which knows, not saying that means he's obligated to pay but at the same time he knows I have little money to throw around so why did he take me there?). It was ok for most of it. It felt like hanging out with a friend, expect kinda worse because of the awkward air of his expectancy of it becoming something more than that.

Later on, he reached out for my hand and after asked if it was ok. I said 'um.. ok'. That wasn't really true, it felt like a violation of my personal space. I guess I just thought 'This is what people your age do! And you like him! You'll start enjoying it eventually'. So we walked around like that for a bit. It was okay, but kinda felt sweaty and unnecessary.  Like holding hands with a friend. Now I've never been touchy feely at all, but I could tell it was something he needed, not just from how soon he initiated hand holding but also by seeing how he acted in previous relationships. I even remember before he was even on my radar I'd see him holding hands all class with his current girl, and cringing a little bit like I usually do at PDA

Near the end, we're sitting ata bench, and he's only responding in short, dismissive ways to the things I'm saying. I deduced that he wanted to kiss me. That's when I first felt strongly one way or the other. My body told me 'No. This is not right. This is not happening.'. So I tried to being up conversation over and over, but he kept shooting it down. I look up at the sky and around the park and said 'It's a nice day, huh? Especially for July (it's winter in Aus)!' But he just laughed. Anyway this went in for what felt like 10 minutes but was probably more like 2. Then our lift came and I was so relieved.

I didn't really get the opportunity to tell him then and there that I didn't want to go out again. So later I sent him a pretty long winded text explaining how I felt with as much candor as possible. I still think I made the right decision in doing by text. Firstly, it allowed me to draft exactly what i wanted to say and how i wanted to say it before sending. Second, it was only one date and I don't think there's an issue with saying you don't want a second one over text. And the only reaso I made it so long was because I knew that he thought it went well and I wanted to be sensitive.

I said I would understand and accept if he was made at me for wasting his time, but he sweared he wasn't. I believed him. In hindsight I realise that I should've made sure. Said something like 'Seriously if you are, please just be honest and tell me. Resentment is a bitch and it's way worse letting that build up than expressing how you really feel healthily'. I think since I had been very candid and open about how I felt, it wouldn't have been too much to ask him to do the same.

So we decided to just be friends. Now I thought this'd be fine. Slightly awkward at first, sure, but then everything would be back to normal. At first I thought it was. We interacted within the group, and walked to our mutual classes together. But then I started noticing something when we would talk on the way to class. He would not really engage with anything I was saying like he used to. One time he talked the whole way without letting me get in a word, and I'm sure this was intentional since it was a pretty mundane topic and he barely even paused to catch a breath. Another  he barely said a thing and when I asked him things he'd give super stock answers, and frequently dismiss things that I'm saying or just laugh at inappropriate times.

So, I'm not tryna be some cocky psych student who thinks they can psychoanalyse anyone at any moment. That's why I'm asking you guys if I've got it really wrong. But I reckon he resents me, bad. But I'm also calling in to question whether ever really liked talking to me in the first place. And that now that he doesn't have a chance of getting his hands on me (in both senses of the word), he wants nothing to do with me. But he doesn't want to leave me alone completely. He wants to spend every minute that he has with me taking out his oent up frustration on me. (By the way, it's possible that it's not just me. I know that he must've somehow ended things with that girl I mentioned before, and I also know that he dated another girl in our circle, very briefly as he did with me. So it's possible he's just generally frustrated with girls and taking it out on me). Regardless, I think if this is so it's still cruel and unfair to take it out on me. I also think it's very immature of him to lie about it and keep his resentment even when I gave him a safe opportunity to express his anger.

So my questions are: Does he resent me? Is he trying to make me feel bad? Did he know ever talk to me, even when it was about intellectual things that we had a mutual interest in, because he thought he had a chance with me? And finally, did I dodge a bullet? Or am I just being flat out crazy?",31Jul2020,1

REPORTING IT TO A HIGHER AUTHORITY ISN'T AN OPTION.

I have had this lecturer for 3 years, on two separate occasions, other people reported his behaviour and both were given the ""boys will be boys"" response.

My lecturer is abusive both verbally and sometimes physically to those in our class. He mocks my weight, calls me autistic, heckles me about my (lack of a) sex life and in the 3 years I've had him has gotten me in 5 headlocks.

This is common and happens to others in the college class also. He is stronger than others in the class and reporting his behaviour is hard as nothing gets done and it's hard to prove; they'll take his word over ours. There aren't other options for my course around here so I've had to put up with it.

People have genuinly left this course because of him (I came very close to doing so) and his response to someone calling out his bullshit behaviour is ""I'm using reverse psychology; motivating you to prove me wrong!"" which even if he isn't lieing, doesn't have that effect; in fact makes things worse.

now this is where it gets even messier

i was so blinded and i thought she loved me because she gives me the time of day, so we ended up getting into an ‘entanglement’, for lack of better words. though sometimes i didnt want to do anything, and i’d say it, she would get mad and say very mean things, stuff like ‘dont ask for it when you want it then’ or ‘im doing you a favor no one else would’ she knew saying stuff like that would work and she would end up having her way with my body, even though i wasnt 100% comfortable with it

long story short, she very much crushed my self esteem and image, made me feel worthless, ruined my reputation too, made me lose all my friends and not make any new ones because ‘she was the only one who cared’ as she would put it. and yes, we did break up very messily, and she told me the exact moment she fell out of love with me

so anyway, somehow we still managed to stay friends after that, even though i tried to bring up the fact that she hurt me, she brushed it off and we never spoke of it again. so yes, we are currently best friends, and shes grown and is a totally different person now(which is great) but i still struggle everyday with depression and anxiety that she caused and she doesn’t even know it. i feel like im too deep in and i dont know what to do. i don’t really have many friends either

657,"I (F18) will be headed off to college in less than two weeks. I am super excited to go, even though I will miss my family, especially my brother (M16) whom I am super close to, a whole lot. 

The college I am attending is only about 45 minutes away, something that did not factor into my decision, but my parents were excited about once I made the call (I also had shown similar interest in a school about 2 hours away, and one 8 hours away.) They are excited to be able to visit me at school, something that I normally would be happy about; however, right now I am concerned. 

My dad (M50’s)has a lung disease that makes him highly likely to develop pneumonia if he gets sick with COVID-19. My brother is currently healthy, but he has struggled with autoimmune disorders in the past, and my mom is also over 50. I am mostly worried about my dad, but my mom and brother’s health are also concerns of mine. 

I know that out of everyone in my family, I am at the lowest risk for getting extremely sick. I plan on observing all of the rules set by my college: staying 6 feet apart, wearing a mask everywhere, using hand sanitizer. I don’t want to get sick or be sent home. However, I don’t know if my roommate or friends will obey the rules all the time, and I am worried about getting the virus from them and giving it to my family, who has frequently addressed their plans to visit me somewhat regularly. 

Would telling them not to come visit me be a good idea? I don’t want to alienate them because I love them, but at the same time I want them to be safe. 

(Before anyone judges me for going to college with sick people in the family: the school I am attending was my first choice school, and I was given a full tuition scholarship that would be revoked if I took a gap year or did community college first.

But ive recently begun to learn more and more about the commoditization of college and universities and already have student loans so i struggle with the idea of “feeding” the system. 

But also recognize degrees do hold prestige and do to a certain degree offer better opportunities.  Also based on the university access to alumni networks and employer connections. 

Looking for advice on what to do next, what institutions to look at, critiques, and everything in between.

I(15f) recently introduced my bf(16m) to my sister(22f) since she is my legal guardian and she wanted to meet him.

We ended up playing PlayStation most of the time and mostly got along really well. Before he left me and him were talking and he kept joking about how hot my sister was and I told him to knock it off and quit being weird. I meant this mostly as a joke but he got offended at me saying this and told me that I need to learn how to handle a joke.

675,"I (22F)came into work (small company I’m a receptionist) &amp; the office manager (50F) was talking to the owner about something in a hushy tone so I was curious. 
Basically what I’ve gathered is that she came to work &amp; went into the women’s bathroom to what looked like a murder scene. Blood all over, paper towels &amp; bloody handprints. She assumed one of our male employees accidentally cut themselves &amp; didn’t clean up the mess. She’s upset bc men aren’t supposed to be using our bathroom (only us 2 women work in the office &amp; the guys have 3 other bathrooms to use) &amp; she had to clean it all up. She had everything scrubbed &amp; clean before I even got to work &amp; took out all the garbages. 

She talked to the person whose office is next to the bathroom and asked who used the br so she could reprimand him for making a mess in the women’s br &amp; not cleaning it up. He said he didn’t see any guys go in but the person in the office next to his said the only person he saw go in there was an employees girlfriend &amp; jokingly asked if there was a dead baby in the garbage can. When he said that the office manager realized that the garbage had been heavy which was weird because we’re the only two who use it &amp; we only throw away paper towels which are obviously not heavy.

She came &amp; talked to me about it &amp; said that she almost wants to go look through the dumpster now bc she’s concerned that there might be a baby in the garbage. I agreed &amp; we went back &amp; our dumpster is already full of other stuff on top of the bag from the bathroom. She said ‘it’s in gods hands now.’ But I still can’t let it go. 

So now idk what to do. Am I a crazy person for wanting to dig through the dumpster after work? Should I? Or should I just leave it alone? Is this like a crime scene? I feel like I just need closure bc I feel sick to my stomach about this &amp; how can I go pee in that bathroom wondering if something bad happened in there. 
We have no idea if it was like a miscarriage or a botched abortion which i don’t think either of those are technically crimes?? But you can’t just do that in a company’s bathroom right?? But the office manager said it was SO much blood. &amp; now the office manager is saying even though she wants to call the police to dig through the garbage just to make sure, she won’t bc she doesn’t want bad publicity for the company (the owner would not be happy about that). Plus if it was a crime she cleaned up like all the evidence. 

I just feel like I need closure here or it’s going to eat me alive everyday at work. I feel like if I do get police involved it should be soon before the dumpster gets emptied. I can’t tell if I’m just being a crazy conspiracy theorist at this point. 
Please give me advice, I feel so uncomfortable and idk what to do.

TL:DR
There might be a dead baby in the dumpster at work and idk what I should do.",31Jul2020,1

He came extremely skinny and did not make a sound for a few days, flinching at every sound made by me or outside. He was peeing inside my apartment, but in a week he started doing it on the balcony, (he's been doing number 2 on the balcony since the beginning). However, doggie does not wanna go outside. I can only force him to go outside so we can have a walk and I hate doing that, but I know that I must take him out. He is still very very anxious, but I can tell that he likes me the most of all people in our lives. The other day I tried to get him to go outside, but the elevator wasn't working and he had no intention of walking down the stairs or letting me carry him. I left him at home and went to do grocery shopping; when I came back, I found that he pooped on my kitchen floor and peed too. I did yell at him a bit and he knows it was wrong, he hasn't pooped inside again, but he keeps peeing.

700,"hi everyone, a little background on my sister: 

She graduated from a good school (T20 school) and is currently working retail and freelancing on the side. This is not an issue as job-searching is difficult especially during times like these, but she has always had no aspiration to get a well-paying job. Coming from a traditional asian household, my parents expect more from her. She has always been the smart one in the family since she got into a T20 uni out of high school, however she became rebellious when she went to university - to the point where her relationship with my mom is very strained and there is constant tension. She has a really bad temper and is very stubborn with her opinions. 

My other sister has talked to her and she has mentioned she wants to leave the US and go to art school in Europe. She had studied abroad in Europe for a semester and dated a guy there for a while (broken up now) and wants to go back. In my opinion, I think she overly romanticizes Europe because she is always watching European movies and likes European culture. 

She smokes cigarettes and weed (along with other thing I'm not aware of) and with traditional asian parents, something bad would happen if they found out. My parents have already threatened to kick her out before. 

Fastforward to the beginning of COVID, she started on working on 
her portfolio since my other sister was able to convince her to become more motivated. However, this seemed to be a fluke since as time passed, she started going out a lot to meet with a guy and coming home late at night. I think this is a waste since this is the perfect time to learn new skills and set yourself up for the future. 

However, my sister has mentioned to my older sister before that 
    she is not money-driven and is fine with her situation now. (working retail and freelancing) 

My question is: how do I make her realize that she needs to make changes in her life? It is a very frustrating and sad situation to see and it feels like a car crash in slow motion

He guilty recalls thinking once or twice at that 13ish that he wished he had a sister just so he could see someone his own age naked and experiment if she wanted to too, which digusts me and it terrifes me he thought incest was ok at that age or something? He says he has never ever wanted to do anything like that with his brothers or mother, but feels guilty it might have brainwashed him a little to find it less gross than most?

708,"23, first time asking for job advice.

Hey everyone,

This is my first time asking for business advice ever, I would like to hear out your thoughts.

I’m 23, interested in finance and working in the best brokerage company in our country (legit one), I’m also highly interested in finances &amp; economics and currently doing my first year for economics bachelor.

Few months ago when the whole thing around covid started to be felt and panic came, my company sent me to work from home and I was feeling kinda empty because I didn’t have the feeling of being the “business guy”, nice office, nice clothes, intelligent people around... so I was thinking what can I do from my kitchen office to fill the emptiness, and I’ve started and instagram blog.

I’ve never done anything like that and have never showed off the skills &amp; knowledge I’ve got through the years, people got impressed and the page grew non stop.

What I’m doing is basically writing my thoughts and ideas, while simplifying complex economic &amp; stock market topics, I’ve started the page in April and currently it has 5k followers, organic followers.

I’m getting messages on daily basis, from random people telling me how good my page is and that this is the best page they have ever seen on IG.

My company CEO and management started following me on Instagram and were complementing me for my skills (I’ve proven myself in the past and they take me as a serious guy).


Well, things went well so I’ve started thinking what’s next with the blog? With all due respect the 2.5k$ I get paid from the company I’m working for isn’t what I’m aiming for so I’ve started checking opportunities with my new side hustle - Instagram page.

Long story short, I’ve found kinda serious guys in the stock market field, and we partnered.

The business is simple, we will use my Instagram page to:
1. Advertise lessons (we’re going to film finances related lessons)
2. The company I partnered with have hedge fund license, so they can manage people’s money - we will also advertise this business 
3. Premium subscription for certain weekly mail content

Everything is going perfect with this business, but the other one, my 9-5 job isn’t what it used to be.

As the time goes, my company started comparing my success with the blog to my progress at work, saying that if I can bring followers to my blog, then I should bring clients to them and stuff like that.

I won’t say that I was working as I used to, yeah I got my foot off the gas a little bit but still.

Now a little bit about my job:
Basically I’m a manager of a project, project where I sell certain program and I manage everything around it, from customer service to payments etc.

I hate this role in the business but well. I get paid well (2.5k$/m which isn’t bad in our country), I have cool management &amp; I love the people - so I kinda let myself do something that I didn’t like for other benefits.

One day came and we had a conversation, one of the CEOs (we have 2) told me 2 things.
1 was that he thinks that Im getting paid “too much” for the job I’m doing and the second is that the other CEO wants me close to him and invites me to work overseas.

I have to admit that this CEO that was talking to me really surprised me because from one side he is telling me that I get paid too much for the job I’m doing which is kinda negative, and from the second side the other CEO wants me close to him which is positive (?)

We arranged a call with the CEO that wants me close to him and he have told me the job etc, and asked me if I’m in.
I told him that most likely I will decline the invitation as I have too much to give up, he told me to think about it and get back to him.
I’ll add that he didn’t give me an offer yet.

Now between us guys, I declined because I don’t think that the offer he will give me will be enough to kind of “shut me down”, if I move overseas I won’t be able to control many things from there and won’t be able chasing the things I wanted to chase businesswise in my current zone, bottom line I think that the money they will offer worth more that I could make on my own.

A week later we had serious conversation with a management regarding my job, again they mentioned that they pay me too much etc and that they are not satisfied with what I am doing (I do what my boss tells me so it’s not my fault he works slow but I don’t blame him).
Long story short, they came to a position when they’re telling me look buddy, you’ve got your last chance to bring 50 clients by August, can you give your word that it’ll be done?

From now everything went like a movie for me lol, I never thought I’ll get to this position.
Everyone was ready to hear my answer which will obviously be yes (as they thought) and go do some other things, but I said no.
No body in the room and zoom chat spoke for few seconds, and then they didn’t even know what to say and told me they need 10 mins.

10 mins later I come back and they tell me that they want me to feel good in the company and that they love me and etc (i gave my heart and soul to this company) and that they want me to stay with them.

The option they can offer me is that they put me back to CS role until they find better role (I started working there as CS guy) or I can take the offer of the other CEO and go overseas.

I’m very business oriented and I just don’t see myself going back on the ladder of business so hell no I won’t go back to CS role and I don’t believe their words “we’ll find” because you know, when your boss says 3 months it can take 12 months and it’s ok.
And regarding going overseas, nah.
They didn’t expect my no here aswell and told me to go rest at home for 3 days and get back with an answer next week.

Calculations:
Option 1 - CS:
I’m not there for the paycheck, I’ve managed to save up and invest enough money that I could quietly live for a few years without working, I’ve always seen this place as school, if they want to put me back in CS it’s like getter back from 7th grade to 3rd so no.

Option 2 - Overseas:
I have a dog, I have a cat, I have my girlfriend (not married) and I have business opportunities here. This is not 50k$ a month job that could compensate me for the time &amp; opportunities I’ll lose while being there. If you’re looking for numbers let’s say the 2.5k$ I get now will grow to 3k$ max, they don’t pay rent, they don’t pay flight and they don’t pay anything lol. This headache doesn’t worth the money I’ll get.


I’ve never ever asked for business advice and the only person I asked for advice regarding f this is my mom (I’m not a mommy’s boy, I just trust my mom and trust her life experience)

I told this story to my mother and told her that jt looks like I’m going to quit this job because they won’t like my answers so either they throw me out or I quit by myself, my mom freaked out, started calling me a bum and all that kind of things you can hear from your mom when she afraids that her son will do some stupid moves, understandable.

What do you guys think? Should I take the offer or should o take the chance and go my own route, which will require my to start bringing money for myself and not by getting monthly checks.

Thanks for reading",31Jul2020,1

711,"Last year I had surgery which kept me from exercising and basically moving much at all for several months. In that time I gained a few pounds which are quite visible on my stomach and hip area. I always struggled with my body for several reasons but now I feel awful in my body. As soon as I could (around 5 months ago) I started exercising again, I also keep a healthy diet but I can't lose the weight I gained. I started skipping meals every now and then and purposely eat less than I need to (I still feel hungry after eating) but on the other hand I sometimes eat way too much. And then I feel guilty and skip a meal again. I never used to eat breakfast and I still don't but now I also try to skip lunch or eat little dinner. A week ago I made myself throw up after dinner, it definitely wasn't enough to make up for the food I ate but I felt better afterwards. Now I have been sick for two weeks and have been nauseous and throwing up a few times anyway but I haven't /made/ myself throw up before. I don't know if it's because of me having a developed an eating disorder or because I was sick and felt like throwing up would help. Do I need to get professional help? How? What should I do?

Came home and the light was on and on disco mode. Just assumed maybe the dogs were in, or the kids were playing. Left for dinner, the light was off. Came home, and the light was on again.

713,"Just to be clear I love my adult children and I think they are actually acting like children.

My daughter has decided that I am manipulative - mother - and that she ""will reach out to us when she is ready"". I'm stunned really. When I asked her to tell me what she is upset about she says that there have been many times that I have manipulated her and she is done for a while. 

My son agrees with her but only after I called the police on his wife bc she assaulted me. Beforehand he said his sister was being immature about it all. His wife, my daughter in-law jumped out of her chair and dumped two drinks on me while screaming "" you stupid bi$_h, you are going to be the reason we get a divorce"". I have PTSD and was beaten as a child, I thought she was hitting me but my son says she didn't. I don't know now, as I was freaking out at the time and listening to the crunch of the bottle and soda can she was crushing as she dumped liquid on me. My head was hurting and I was sure she hit me. My therapist says that I could have been having a PTSD and a body memory- kind of like a phantom limb for past trauma.

Now both of my kids are not speaking to me. A new grand child has been born and I haven't seen him, nor do I know his name.
What should I do? I am terrified that they will never speak to me again. I am willing to work on anything I am responsible for.",31Jul2020,1

716,"Hi! I’m new to this so don’t really know what I’m doing, just really needing some advice. 

About 1.5 years ago I lent something to a friend (at the time.) It was this beautiful hand made tapestry I bought, and for some stupid reason I lent it to him (I was 16 at the time and obviously not thinking.) When I gave it to him, I expressed how important it was to me and how I would need it back. He said he would would be super careful and that I didn’t need to worry. Well fast forward a few months, him and I had a bit of a falling out. Though he doesn’t believe it, it was through his own fault (he aggressively came onto me knowing I had been dating one of his friends for 2 years!) I obviously decided the friendship was over and very nicely asked for my tapestry back. He kept saying “oh ya sorry I’ll bring it to school tomorrow” over and over again. Eventually I addressed him in person where he said “ya I just keep forgetting I’ll bring it monday.” Relieved, I thought I’d get it back. Until he randomly messaged me that Sunday saying “by the way you’re not getting your tapestry back.” This started a long battle of me trying to get it back and not succeeding. Moral of the story, he has it, it’s super important to me, and he refuses to give it back. What do I do? I feel as though going to the cops seemed ridiculous and I don’t even know how I’d go about it, but I really don’t feel I have any other option? Anything helps please let me know!!",31Jul2020,1
717,"Hi all. This is very petty, to be sure, and feel free to tell me I'm being a moron.

In January my roommate had a medical issue that forced him to take off of work. He's since been off. His medical issue has been resolved since March or so, but shortly after he was ready to return to work and start that process, the pandemic happened and doctor's offices closed and our work began working from home (we work at the same place, I've been working from home since).

I've been feeling kind of resentful about people who don't have to work while I do and while I understand they are mostly outliers, it kind of sucks that I am living with one. He sleeps every day until noon and then sits in his room watching YouTube and smoking weed until he goes back to sleep around midnight. I work 7:30-4 so he only really wakes up halfway through my shift.

He was collecting EI sick leave (we're in Canada) but that ran out because it's a max of 15 weeks, but right now we have the CERB so he's been collecting that instead. In the meantime he submitted forms to work and work made him sign a form saying he agreed to get checked out by his doctor and sent it to the doctor presumably but he hasn't heard anything since. He sometimes complains that he's bored and wants to get back to work and I've suggested numerous times that he calls the doctor to see if he can speed things up but he always says, ""eh, later..."" then never does. Recently he was talking about being bored again so I said ""call the doctor!"" and he said he'll wait until he gets his next CERB payment on the 3rd of August, which kinda pissed me off. I don't have faith that he'll call the doctor's office after that though. He has two more months left of CERB payments. That's a long time.

Guys, I'm frustrated. I know I should feel lucky that I have a job in this time and I make more than unemployment, but he has a job too that in my eyes he doesn't appear to be making much effort to return to. It's not like he's unemployed and stressed he won't be able to find a job. And it's kind of frustrating that I'm sitting here on the other side of the wall while he sits in his room and smokes out the window and gets to basically do whatever he wants while I'm on the clock. I'm a little jealous, okay? I feel like he's not going to start looking into speeding things up until his CERB payments are about to run out, but that's two whole months from now, and I feel like my jealousy and frustration will consume me in that time.

I know logically I have a lot going for me. I'm making more than unemployment/CERB, and I'm driven and ambitious and I know my dedication is gonna take my places. My roommate... just doesn't seem to care about anything. He kind of just lets things happen to him, which I know shouldn't bother me.

How do I deal? Any advice?",31Jul2020,1

720,"I’m sorry but this will be long because I need help making a decision.

Backstory: I am 22 years old and graduated in June of 2019 with a B.S. in Biophysics. I have ADHD to the max and so large classroom settings really do not work well for me. I skipped classes because I could not pay attention, showed up to test day, did well and got myself through everything to get my degree. While I love undergraduate life, I hated undergraduate education. My passion had always been physics but the classroom settings started to chip away at my love for the field. After a few months of no luck with jobs, I signed up to take the LSAT and the GRE. I didn’t study for either because I wanted to see what my natural ability way to help me decided what I wanted. I got a 153 on the LSAT, and a 306 on the GRE. I got some offers from small private law schools but nothing for graduate school. 

After a few months I got into this weird program with my alma mater that put me in grad school classes even though I technically* wasn’t a graduate student. It was for a Biophysics PhD. My first class was in virology(HIV coursework) but went full 180 when Covid happened, everything went online, and the whole course was studying COVID real-time. I actually enjoyed the class but when they asked for full tuition for online classes I withdrew because I didn’t want to throw my money into something I was 100% certain I wanted to do.

Then I received a call from a small, private law school (Trinity Law) saying they would give me a full ride if I maintained a B+ average. This caused a problem because law is something I am also passionate about, which I will get to soon. After talking with some people they told me going to a non-ABA law school was bad in itself, and a scholarship based on a B+ average would set me up to have to pay tuition later.

Current: I have 3 major passions that surpass everything else in my life. The environment, healthcare and the law. 

Environment: I grew up in a small town in a forest. I have always loved and appreciated nature and wanted to help preserve our environment. I performed my own independent research on carbon fixation during undergrad. I wanted to develop a device to help reduce the affects of climate change, and if entering this field I would want to continue this research.

Healthcare: The American healthcare system sucks balls. I want to make an impact on people’s lives and help make their life better. I did undergrad research under a professor in HIV analysis. If entering this field I would want to work in virology to help develop a cure for viruses such as Covid, HIV, etc.

Law: I don’t know where this came from, it has nothing to do with my major, but I have always been interested in politics and law. I keep a copy of the constitution in my car and have read it many times over. I see the injustices that happen everyday within our country(US) and want to make changes in our justice system. If I followed this route I would want to amend the 13th amendment clause that allows for slavery to be legal in the prison system, because this loophole has been overlooked for far too long.

It’s been a year that I’ve been out of college and I feel like I have not made progress on which path I want to take. I have always told myself that the three biggest issues in the US are:
1. Environment: Without saving the environment nothing else matters because the planet will be destroyed.
2. Education: Without proper education of Americans we can not fix the issues of healthcare, law, or really anything else.
3. Healthcare: We should not pay $2500 for an ambulance. The amount of money put into healthcare takes away freedoms and liberties from low income families and hinders educational and economic growth.

I see these issues and want to fix them all, but just taking on one of these issues that so many people are already working on is a massive challenge. I just don’t know where to go because I don’t want to keep wasting time. I want to continue to move forward in life and work towards making an impact but I have so much trouble deciding and my ADHD definitely does not make this any easier. Any and all advice is welcome and extremely appreciated. Please help.",31Jul2020,1

722,"This is so difficult to write because it forces me to face the reality of my situation. I've been pretty unhappy for a while, but I've felt especially empty this past week.

I'm a 26-year-old guy still living at home with my family. I'll be starting a full-time job once the COVID situation dies down in a few months, but it probably won't pay me enough to move out. I live in one of the most expensive housing markets in the U.S. A crappy one-bedroom in a bad neighborhood would cost upwards of $2,000 a month. So I'll be continuing to live at home for the foreseeable future. I'm grateful to have a job and a free place to live, but living at home has really taken its toll on my mental health. My family members, especially my dad, are incredibly disrespectful to me and each other. I just can't take it anymore. If I could move across the country today, I would, and I wouldn't look back.

At the same time, I have no support network whatsoever. I have no one to complain to or who will sympathize with me. I have no friends aside from some old coworkers who I haven't seen in months, and who, in all honesty, I'm not that close with anymore. I haven't been in a relationship in about two years. This is in part because I'm introverted, awkward, and just don't do a good job of meeting people. I don't even know where to begin. And living at home isn't making things any easier. I feel like I'm a slave to my household ""responsibilities,"" which for some reason fall on me and no one else in my house. I'd really like to move to a different region of the U.S., but that won't happen for at least a few years.

I'm going to spend the next two weeks eating healthier and trying to make other positive lifestyle changes, but beyond that, I don't really know what to do. I think my mental health is a product of my crappy living situation and not vice versa. But I can't presently escape my living situation. I don't know how to go out and make friends when I'm basically starting from zero. I don't need a lot of friends. To be honest, I'd rather have one or two close friends than a bunch of acquaintances.

727,"So I created my Instagram a couple of weeks ago, and I decided to connect to contacts so I could follow my mom. That's when I found out her two Instagram accounts.

One of them was her main account with over 100 followers. The other account was where she posted BDSM selfies of herself, I am not kidding. They weren't nudes, but they were definitely sexual. However I have a feeling that it might evolve into nudes. (Just so you know my parents divorced when I was about 5).

Trust me I love my mother. She has always helped me feel better when I was sad and she is always happy to see me. The fact that she is my mother and posts this kind of stuff on her Instagram made me very disgusted.

She also hasn't mentioned on her Instagram account that she has kids, and luckily her BDSM account has less than 100 followers. I need to confront her about this without freaking her out.

Other things I must mention is that I haven't told anybody about this, and my brother (12M) is very close to my mom and he must not know about it. Also my family in not very religious so they would probably be a bit more tolerant about this than the average family.

It was a couple of weeks ago since she posted, so I might wait awhile to see if she has stopped posting on her account.

728,"I'm a female in my early 30s and have never had the desire to have a child naturally but would like to adopt. I am not saying I 100% absolutely will NEVER give birth, but I also cannot guarantee a man that I will change my mind. I'm also a Christian and only date men with shared faith because I've been in relationships before where I was with someone of a different faith and they completely bashed and disrespected by beliefs. All it did was lead to fights. It's important to me to be able to go to church, pray, read the bible, etc with my boyfriend/husband. It is non-negotiable for me. I don't just say I'm a Christian, I actively live my life by God's word.

I understand that most Christians want to procreate and have that engrained in their minds that women must do so. But there is nowhere in the Bible that says wives must bear children. I would much rather give an amazing life to an unwanted child than to bring my own into this world, and I don't think there is anything wrong with that.

However, the child thing has been an issue with dating. I've been using dating apps for a year now, and I have been rejected by several men on this basis. The most recent rejection hurt the most as I was seeing this guy for over two months and he suddenly decided that having bio kids is a deal breaker for him. 

I understand the idea of wanting your own genes passed down and to experience creating new life. But to say ""oh you can't guarantee me 100% that you'll bear my children? We're done"" just seems plain wrong to me. We both want kids, that's common ground. But what if down the line we realized that I'm infertile? This is not entirely possible as I have PCOS which already alters fertility, and by the time I'm married/we try to have kids I'll likely be in my late 30s, further reducing fertility. Then what? You made it a deal breaker in the beginning and set that expectation/demand, and now I can't have them - so my guess is that I would be divorced or cheated on so he could find some other woman to bear his child (this happens quite frequently).

I guess I can't understand someone ending things with a person who they say has everything they're looking for just because they don't say ""I 100% guarantee I'll bear your child"". I feel like all I was to him was a uterus to him, because once he realized that wasn't a guarantee he dipped. I can absolutely understand being rejected if a guy wanted kids and I didn't want any at all. But there are different ways to create a family IMO.

I'm looking for other (respectful) ideas and thoughts about this because maybe I'm viewing it totally wrong. My thought process is that I find someone who compliments me and who I can envision spending the rest of my life with. My desire to have kids does not drive me to just find someone who will have them with me - does that make sense? Right now I feel that he was using this as an excuse to end things because maybe he just wasn't that into me, but if any of you would immediately drop someone in this scenario as well please let me know because I could be looking at this entirely wrong.",31Jul2020,1

My boyfriend and I recently switched to Verizon for our cell phone service.  We made friends with the Verizon Rep at our store who suggested that moving our lines to his business plan would save us quite a bit of money, about 40%.

732,I will be honest and say in high school I got sucked into the juul trend. I have progressively upgraded devices and now I’m on strong devices with 50 salt nic. I’ve been telling myself for years now that I’m going to quit but it’s been 3 years and it’s only gotten worse. As much as I want to I can never get myself to quit. It’s gotten to a point where I waste most of my money on vaping supplies and I feel terrible physically as a result. I have lost a lot of motivation to do things I previously enjoyed. My girlfriend asked me to stop and I couldn’t and went behind her back for a year and kept vaping. I looked up ways to stop on google and none of them have helped. If anyone has gone through a similar situation I would be grateful for their advice. Thank you.,31Jul2020,1
733,"So this is going to be long please bear with me. I have known my(20f) husband (22m) my whole life and we got married very young. We just celebrated our first anniversary and things were going good. We have had a very very rough first year of marriage, he had a porn addiction that he hid from me and lied to me about, going as far as to using my phone when his was dead and not telling me. I have a lot of past sexual trauma that regards porn and sexual abuse and I told him early on in our relationship that I don’t feel comfortable with him watching it. He said he hid it so that I wouldn’t be hurt but ultimately it was because he was addicted and didn’t want to get help. We started working through those issues and seemed like things were good again when I found out again that he had been lying to me again and that he would go and watch it at work instead. This really hurt because I had been really struggling to trust him again and he had been lying and saying that he had been doing well. Then the kicker it was my birthday the other day and our tradition for birthdays and celebrations is to get a bottle of tequila. We get a drinking game together and we’re both about two shots in and he gets up to go to the bathroom and he comes back and says that he’s feeling off. I ask him what’s wrong and he says that he doesn’t know and wants to go for a walk to clear his head. I tell him that it might be a good time to use the advice we have gotten in therapy to try and communicate first what the issue is and try to work it out. He starts getting upset saying that I’m pressuring him and that he doesn’t know what he’s feeling and I took that as our cue to start walking so he can calm down. We’re on our walk and i’m gently trying to get him to open up.(our main thing in therapy is that he does not know how to communicate and he hasn’t tried to learn so i thought it was a good time to attempt it) I was patient and calm letting him sort out his thoughts, when he exploded again saying he doesn’t know and if i could just let it go. I will say I am not usually upset but we have spent a year of our marriage with me begging for him to communicate and ending up feeling stupid for trying to get him to talk I tell him he’s acting childish for not even trying and tell him he can walk the rest of his way home alone to collect his thoughts because one way or another it has to be communicated. He has promised me before he will try to communicate with me. We get home and I ask him if he is ready to talk and he blows up and starts yelling at me to shut the f up and he pins me to the wall covering my mouth and screaming at me. I start crying and he just doesn’t care that he hurt me. I tell him he’s being immature that I have been being polite and I may have been prodding but only because he promised he would try. He picked me up and threw me onto the couch and told me to leave him alone that it doesn’t matter and that it’s not a big deal and i’m making it bigger than it was. I ask him if he thought that he had the right to throw me like that and he gets even more pissed I grab my phone just in case I have to call 911 because I didn’t know if he was going to harm me more and he rips it away from me and tells me that he’s going to break it and I tell him that he needs to calm down or I’m leaving he yells at me that I should go since he’s not good enough and that I wanted him to turn into a monster so that’s what he was doing. He had apologized since then profusely, but I’ve talked with one close friend about it and she’s says he’s manipulating me into staying with him and she doesn’t like him. I see him in all his best moments and I know that that was so out of his character and he is very ashamed of himself for behaving that way. I don’t know what to do but I do know that I love him I don’t feel scared of him, I don’t think he would hurt me again, and I feel like I sound so stupid writing all this out. Any advice or thoughts would be very appreciated. Thank you.",31Jul2020,1

I've always wanted to feel fulfilled in that way, and was willing to accept all the other things that came with joining.

741,"There's a girl I work with which I really enjoy her company. She's got great energy and we have so much fun when we work on projects. We laugh constantly and can be goofy but we're also creative and focused so we bounce off each other. We seem to push each other further when one comes up with an idea and it goes on from there. We can literally talk about anything at any moment. She feels like she could be my best friend outside of work so I wouldn't want it to be any more than that. I know if it was more, it wouldn't be the same (relationships just suck the fun out and make things awkward/complicated).

Anyways, this is all fine but the issue is, when I go home, I feel sad and I miss the energy. I miss being around her and then my mind start to obscure and overthink things and that's when I start to think about the things that we could do, places we can go, movies to watch (because I know that anything I do with her it will be so much more fun). I don't want to cut her out of my life, I want to be able to have a friendship with her without feeling this down period.

I also want to add that when I'm with her, I don't think of her as anymore than a friend. I don't have the 'crushing' thoughts. It's only when I'm not with her. After each project, this feeling has become more intense and sometimes it takes me a week or two to feel back to normal (we don't work together everyday, it's project by project basis. It could be once a month or 2/3 months).

Any idea what's causing the feelings? Should I speak to her about it?",31Jul2020,1

For months and months now I have had a problem where when I ejaculate I don’t feel that pleasure anymore and I don’t know what to do I really need you guys help I am probably going to lose all hope I need professional advice if anyone need more info please ask me",31Jul2020,1
743,"I am a 19-year-old (M). Let me start the whole situation from 2016. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I started feeling sad and soon after, I think I was depressed. The worst part for me is, I don't have any proper reason for it. It happened out of nowhere and had chronically been the same for me, even in 2020. All of this leads up to me, throwing tantrums at my parents.

Since I was a kid, I was in babysitting till I was in fourth or fifth grade (I don't remember the exact year but I was pretty small) and right after that, I started living alone in my house without a baby sitter, my mother would reach home at 7 PM and my father at 10 PM. I would walk alone to my house from school and reach my home around 3. Most of my childhood, I spent my time alone, with no sibling and very little presence of my parents.

Last year around December (2019), one night, it all came to me. The whole feeling of loneliness, neglect, and hatred towards my parents.

There was a time when I was 12 years old, and my father beat me and told me never to talk to him again; I did what he said for the next three years. He would try talking to me, but I told my mother that I cannot speak with him again because I walked all the way to school alone and cried till I reached my class, all humiliated. I felt like I had no one who was listening to me.

After almost three years of me not talking to my father, I tried talking to him again in 2016, that was the time when I started feeling low and pretty much felt I had no one as few of the friends I had left the city. I got my first professional help, a psychiatrist. I was on meds, and most of my time I wouldn't feel anything, I'd sleep more, that's all.

At the end of 2018, I started my therapy, though I stopped now in 2020 because of the pandemic and lost interest of talking to a therapist because I personally didn't feel like it helped me.

Fast forward to September of 2019; I stopped talking to my father again because sometimes he would completely ignore me or wouldn't respond like I didn't exist. All I felt was I had them because I had no sibling. I would be alone all the time.

In December of 2019, I had my first major outburst towards my parents. I started breaking stuff. I broke my parent's TV, my laptop, I broke their small temple in the house. I wanted them to feel the same emotion as I did.

It has been a couple of months since I did that, but I don't feel much remorse about it. Of course, I feel bad sometimes, and I don't know if that's enough. I don't know what to do, and I think I will pretty much give up on my life by not doing anything productive to help myself financially as they provide me with basic stuff.

I think I would be living with my parents forever because I don't have any plans, or ambition, or literally any motivation to do anything.

I will be waiting for a few more months to see if things change for me or if I feel better because it has been the same since 2016. If not, I will stop my education after getting my degree and just live in isolation.

I genuinely want some opinion about this from someone other than me.",31Jul2020,1
744,"So, this has been a learning experience for me. I have been dating my girlfriend for about eight months, and our one year anniversary is in November 2020 (that's when I plan to propose). I foresee myself spending the rest of my life with this woman. However, my GF has explained to me that at times she feels overstimulated. 

She has explained to me that she has sensory issues (sight, touch, scent) and sometimes her surroundings can overstimulate her. I have tried to be very understanding and patient, but sometimes it can seem disheartening, or at times possibly annoying. I wouldn't phrase it that way with my GF, but let me give a few examples and some background.

I grew up in a professional interior designer's home (my mother), and I have been accustomed to stark visual contrast that I find visually stimulating (which aids in creativity as I am a creative individual myself). Growing up we would always have new paint colors on the wall every other year or so. Ornate and chic looking decorations at Christmas time and design projects were a normal in our household. 

Then I went to go visit my GF's home (she lives with her parents, several states away) and it just looks SOOO boring to me. NO personality seemingly at all. Nothing on the walls. All the walls are white. There isn't even hardware on the kitchen cabinets. Admittedly a lot of this is her mother's doing, but my GF seems to like it. We've even had a slight discussion about this, and I had mentioned that what she found calming I found really really boring. And what I found aesthetically pleasing she found too visually stimulating. It doesn't seem like we see eye to eye on this. (However, on pretty much every other important issue we agree, so I guess this is a small thing to be worried about). 

On top of this, I will be purchasing my own home soon, by myself. My GF won't move in with me until she is my wife, and that means I'll have at least 12-16 months by myself in my new home. Effectively it will be ""my house"" because I am paying for it. However, I don't want to play that card and be a jerk about it. 

My GF has never sought professional help for this, so essentially she is ""self-diagnosed"". I don't want to downplay her feelings and experiences, but I feel like she just doesn't have good coping mechanisms or something. Anyways, all of that to say is there a way she can find ""professional help"" without it making it sound that I am suggesting she is ""off her rocker"" for feeling this way. Again, I don't want to make her feel bad, especially when it is something that seems like it could be worked on quite easily.

I realize it sounds like I'm trying to ""fix her"" and make her do what I want, but she struggles with this in all aspects of her life (work, shopping, church, etc). I want her to be able to deal with being ""overstimulated"" and not have to be bogged down by this so much. 

At times I've wondered if she has ADHD, or ADD (I'm an educator so I'm somewhat well-versed on this), especially because I know that these can present differently in women than in men.

745,"  

Reddit I need advice for my friend she gave me permission to post this because she really needs help to figure out what to do sorry for any spelling errors I’m new to Reddit and very emotional about this. If this becomes like a rant sorry in advance 

Cast:

B (my best friend)

J (her mother)

T (her elderly great aunt)

G (her grandfather and T’s older brother)

C &amp; M (her sisters) 

Backstory:

I have known this family for years; I met my best friend in middle school, and we have been friends ever since. They are a second family to me, everyone listed above has lived in this house but G owns it he pays the property tax on it and they give him the rent.  He’s very Wealthy but only likes to spend it on himself. Unlike J who is chronically ill (COPD, Diabetes, A staff infection in her leg, and back problems.)  She can’t work most of the time and all her kids except for C who is in high school, have their own families but help her out with bills when they can. T has lived with them since they moved into that house.  

The problems:

So over the last year T has started to develop Parkinson’s she is declining very fast she has lost a lot of weight (she used to be obese) and now is at 120-130lbs, shaking constantly, and getting to the point that she has to wear briefs and cant change herself anymore, and not eating a lot, and is getting to the point she is losing her balance and already fell once. Because of J having heath issues and C is having to do most of the heavy lifting and B and M have to come over even during this pandemic and help when it’s too much even though they both have young children. It’s been hard for them  to take care of  T and now it has come to the point where T needs to be put in a care home their house is not safe for T to live in at all they don't have any safety rails , have only a standing shower, and cant use any of their own money to buy these things because it all goes towards rent and  G wont help. He doesn’t care about what happens to T and doesn’t want to deal with her even though he’s her legal power of attorney (POA). He will only come over occasionally to give them $200 for her incontinence supplies and won’t even go in the room to see and talk with her sometimes not even inside the house at times even before the pandemic. He must deal with doctors’ visits and things with medication because they won’t talk with J because she is not T’s POA and can’t make decisions for her. They have been trying to talk to G about putting her in a care home and he has enough money and the resources to do it but wont because he thinks that J should do it and go to work at the same time and if they try to refuse G could take the house with J, C, T and  J’s husband having literally nowhere to go and no income. 

Is there anything my friends family can do any advice would be helpful and I can answer any questions. 

TLDR: Friends great aunt has Parkinson’s and her grandfather who is Power of Attorney wont deal with her and laves that up to my friends mom with health issues and her teenage daughter.",31Jul2020,1
746,"Okay so I'm 22. I hadn't got any close friends up to about half a year ago. I made a good, close friend back before Corona happened and became even closer since. After our initial meeting we couldn't see each other anymore because we live half the world apart. We went though a crushing phase for a few months after which we really tried to tone that down because it couldn't happen for several reasons... We used to talk a lot, like hours a day every day. Even after our decision to move on from each other (maybe not the wisest move but eh). 

Then came summer vacation. I've been having a lot more fulfilling things to do around. We had a minor falling out at the beginning of my vacation and I said something hurtful to her but she assured me it was all fine. But we did decide to tone our contact down, once again. This time though, it really feels different. By now I'm well on my way of moving on from her and I believe she is as well. Which is a good thing. 

But here's the thing. She's recently been extremely busy. She's been doing a lot of work between college and an event of a friend she promised to help on. She's been having almost no time for me. I know she's still keeping in touch with others, hanging on insta etc... but I have moved a little bit further to the background. I can understand that she's beyond busy and has got a lot on her plate and maybe even takes this opportunity to move on from me in her own way. But I can't help but feel a little betrayed. I'm left wondering if all she only ever had a crush on me and that the core of our friendship was kinda faked by her. I'm left wondering if she wants this amount of communication to become the new normal...

It's harder for me because I genuinely have no one else to turn to. It's already hard for me that I can't ever see and hang out with my only close friend and I sometimes struggle to figure out what I want to stay friends with her for, but any conversation with her clearly reminds me of the whys and hows and I really still care about her. She's also told me countless times that she'll always be there for me, that her close friends are the most important thing to her and that she won't just leave me hanging. But that's kinda what she's been doing. Granted, I haven't been very prying because I know what's up and I feel like I'd just be acting upon my insecurities. I've just been sending her stuff I come accross online etc... But it takes hours to get her to reply and it feels...wrong to me... If she really wanted to, she could just make some time for me... But at the same time, she's already given me loads and loads of time and I definitely don't deserve it any more than the other important stuff in her life. So I'm trying to not feel bad about it and take her word that she really still cares but just can't put me first right now. But how do I do that..?",31Jul2020,1
747,"this is a long one, but theres a lot of information that you need to know, so please bare with me.

almost a year ago, i (14 f) adopted a 4-5 year old terrier mix named MiMi. (obviously my parents were okay with it and it wasnt an impulse decision or anything). she worked perfectly with our lifestyle. she was laidback, quiet, almost like a ghost, loved cuddles, slept with me, potty trained, and responded to her name and commands very well. just an all around good dog. perfect fit in our family. even my dad (43 m) liked the dog, and he dislikes pets.

anyways, fast forward to last month, and my mom (41 f) says that she wants her own dog. there was one dog she had wanted (Bella), but it had been adopted, so she found another one (Jaz) she liked and adopted that one instead. she said jaz had a personality similar to MiMi, so my father and i were okay with adopting it.

but that isnt really the case. jaz barks ALL day no matter if shes inside or outside. it really scares me because my previous dog almost attacked me and was barking at me like an intruder, and im pretty traumatized from it. she doesnt respond to her name at all. she never comes inside when we call her in. she picks fights with the neighbors dogs through the fence. and the worse part is that my father and i have to take all the responsibility for her. 

i take really good care of MiMi because i want to give her a better life than what she had on the streets. i feed her, give her treats, attention, brush her, bathe her, and i even spend my birthday money on new toys for her. you know, basic things you should do for your dog. i really love MiMi. but my mom expects me to do the EXACT same for Jaz. 

i dont mind letting jaz out but its HER DOG. shes always saying how i need to step up and care for Jaz, even though she says she would take care of her and she wouldnt be a change for me and my father from having MiMi. obviously, i dont neglect the dog, but when she says shes going to take care of it, i would expect her to do it. she expects me to care for my dog, i would expect the same from her.

My father also has to do the things i do, but i feel bad for him because he really doesnt like animals and its my moms dog. he has to pick up her stool, keep her out of trouble, and we cant trust her to be alone in a room because shes torn up many of my possessions. i get pets are a team effort, but my dad and i are the only people doing any work here.

so a few weeks later, my mom says that Bella is back up for adoption because she didnt fit the lifestyle of her original adopters. she wants to adopt Bella now and my father and i said an immediate no. my mom then tries to guilt trip me by saying that shes always advocated for me getting pets. my dad then says how he and i have been taking care of the dog for weeks and that she's taken no responsibility for it, yet wants another one. i then bring up that im going to be starting school soon and that i wont have the time to take care of another dog if things continue like they have been now. she comes up with the excuse that shes been busy and then goes on to say that she will be home alone and have more free time and be alone more during once i go back to school which is a lie. 

she works the same hours i go to school for, then goes to the gym for 2 hours, eats, and then goes to bed. shes always busy. not to mention that now that my band competitions are cancelled due to covid i will be home every weekend. even when she is home, she doesnt her dog out or play with her. 

but its her house, so she can do whatever she wants right? every time she brings it up she guilt trips me. i really have no time for another dog and Jaz is a complete handful. i really dont know what to do at this point if she gets another dog. what do i do?",31Jul2020,1

749,"My gym of about 2 years(taekwondo and kickboxing) has been re-opened for almost 3 months but I delayed going back because I have two at-risk family members living with me, and then I delayed even further because my state and city had become a virus hotspot about a month later.

My instructor called me a few days ago and convinced me to come back by saying I can opt out of sparring/contact for now &amp; go to classes on days with generally less people. I decided to give it a go after my family gave me their blessing to attend. However, while there:

* I was the only one who wore a mask in the building, which includes the instructor and a couple parents and siblings of the younger members sitting there inside the dojang just to watch, despite a statewide mandate for indoor businesses.
* The assistant instructor works full time outside of class as a police officer...she could be an asymptomatic carrier at any time because of her regular interactions with the public.
* The above 2 points would probably not bother me too much if they had the windows/doors open for air ventilation, but that wasn't the case.
* They at least tried to keep everyone 6+ ft apart during patterns practice during the beginning and the class was relatively small(7 people on the floor), but then would come by to physically adjust students' movements , and during breaks, several students would start gathering around next to each other, shooting the shit, while I felt like the only one making a conscious effort to stay socially distant the entire class.

In addition to that, compared to dojangs/gyms in the state that I've competed in tournaments against, my gym:

* Has not offered virtual or outdoor classes at all during the entire pandemic for anyone who wasn't ready to be there in person or indoors.
* Re-opened a full two weeks before the state gov't even allowed gyms/fitness places to open (I found this a bit shady).

So, to put it bluntly, I've been feeling pretty unimpressed with how they've accommodated things this year. It sucks because I've obviously been missing training and have always had a close relationship with instructors and people I train with there, but I'm now feeling like the risk is a bit too high based on everything still going on. I should probably also point out the neighborhood this gym is in is a VERY conservative area. I usually don't care about the politics of the people I train with, but that probably has some influence in their attitude towards this whole thing.

Am I over-reacting, or should I be seriously considering switching out to another place once things settle?

752,"My(18f) parents passed away when I was 13. My brother(22m) was 17 at that time. Our grandparents became our legal guardians after this, and they were very abusive. They would blame us for the death of our parents. My grandfather is an alcoholic and gets abusive after drinking, but my brother would protect me every single time by taking the beating. 

My brother had to sacrifice his life(football) to work so that he could take care of me. He dropped out of his team and rejected his dream college to be with me. My brother and I weren’t close growing up cause I was a girly girl and he was a boy with pride so he wouldn’t hang out with me. But after my parents passed away, we became super close. 

My brother moved us out from our grandparents and became my legal guardian last year. My grandfather is rotting in jail for abusing us, and we have cut contact with our ‘family’. My brother is my only family. 

After their death, my brother made it a routine to drop me off and pick up from school and (now)college. We love spending time with each other, so we also created a tradition to have breakfast and dinner together every day. I even brought my brother to my prom as my date because he had to skip his to work. 

My brother would give me a goodbye kiss every day and calls me his princess, which I find normal. We would also cuddle sometimes while watching movies. I don’t feel uncomfortable around him if anything I feel safe and loved around him. He would also hug me and let me cry whenever I’m sad and wouldn’t hesitate to buy me pad/tampon when I’m on my period. 

My friend recently told me that it’s weird that my 22 years old brother kisses me on the cheek every day. I didn’t have any female siblings growing up, so I didn’t understand her. She told me that he is probably taking advantage of me by kissing/hugging me. My best friend told me not to listen to her because my brother is just taking care of me and he doesn’t have any intention to hurt me. Some of my guy friends also told me that it’s weird that I let my brother hug/kiss me. I’m confused here now. I really love my brother, and I don’t see anything wrong in whatever he’s doing. He is raising me and is the only family I have. 

Should I do something about this? Is this normal?


Edit :I would like to explain that I took him to prom as my date because he had to miss his prom to work and I knew how excited he was for prom. The least I could do as his sister was let him experience prom. As for the eating pattern we live in the same house so it’s easier if we eat together and we would usually discuss stuff that happened in our day. This helps me open up to him because he is not afraid of opening up to me. He calls me princess because I was my dad’s little princess. And my brother noticed that I would feel better when he calls me that after having a mental breakdown or nightmares. He just continued using it, and I’m perfectly alright with it. Kissing/hugging is our way of showing love. We cuddle because that’s how we grew up. I would usually cuddle with my dad while watching movies. Thank you❤️

755,"My brother has always had a drug problem. Recently he started to act wayyyy worse and we suspect he may now may be smoking crack. When be gets on binges he believes people are spying on him as well as other instances of paranoia. Whenever he gets on these binges he stays over at my parents house. The household includes my parents, me, my sister, and her two daughters. Yesterday I got home and my mom told me he had a knife in his hand and was saying if they come get him he was going to defend himself. My niece has a dog which she leaves in a cage at night to sleep and when the dog wouldnt start barking he kicked the cage and told the dog to shut up. These increasing acts of aggression are worrisome and I told my mom that I love my brother but things are escalating and I’m worried he could hurt one of my family members. I don’t want to call the police as we don’t trust them. Regardless of your political affiliation the police are notorious for being violent in my city. What should I do? I want to protect my family but I also want to help my brother. Any suggestions?",31Jul2020,1
756,"Ok so all I know is when I was younger, an uncle of mine did something. I don’t remember it at all, but what I do remember is he was kicked out shortly after and never let back in the house. 

I asked my parents right after what happened — my dad said “he stabbed you” and my mom said “he said he tried to suffocate you”

That’s kinda messed up ... but I know they lied about what happened. 

Since then I’ve been having a weird inner shame and a feeling of powerlessness that I couldn’t overcome. The only time I felt my power back was in sex. It was like a high. Thats a few times tho, most times I had some weird sexual dysunfctjon. 

I always thought I had low Testosterone but there was always an unreasonable aggressive aspect to me — just didn’t seem like I had low T. I was always a bully and I couldn’t remember any reason why except same thing ... feeling like I wasn’t powerless.  


Another reason I kinda feel like something happened is cause my mom sat me down one day and asked if I was gay. I was confused why she asked , but I didn’t question it. I just said no. Thinking back, what other reason ? 

Lastly, a few year ago I started having weird nightmares. It was like sexual assault every single night basically. The worst part about it was the extreme feelings of shame and helplessness I felt when I woke up — and the tears. I never usually cry but that had me feeling something.  

Now at this point I just feel like I need to get a second opinion. What y’all think.",31Jul2020,1
757,"I've come here clutching my very last straw, I really need advice.

***TLDR: My (25F) son (5M)'s behavior this year has destroyed me.***

**Background:** I'm a lone parent although, I have a boyfriend (we don't live together). I work part-time and study full-time in the UK. I am a very open person, I'm trying hard to raise my son to love people of all sorts, to treat animals, others and their belongings with respect. To clean up after ourselves and have manners. I don't allow littering, swearing, he eats/drinks healthily and his education is up to par - I'm doing all the 'good' things a parent has to (I think). I don't smack/hit him, it's not who I am.

**My son:** His bad behavior started early this year and it's far beyond any 'regular' misbehaving for his age. He's always been a strong-willed child with a couple of regular tantrums that were soon over. Something changed and his behavior has become vicious and manipulative. Examples of this are hitting, biting (only me), calling other family members (and myself) hurtful names regarding our appearance, stealing food from the kitchen while I sleep, breaking things on purpose. If I tell him off and send him to his room he says ""why don't you love me?"" and ""you are horrible"".

**His dad:** My son visits his dad at weekends. We have totally opposing parenting views in every single aspect. I have a horrible history and relationship with him but we try to stay civil for my son's sake. I don't trash talk his dad in front of him. His dad is openly homophobic, racist, he has a criminal record and has attempted suicide 4 times, 2 of which he wrote a Facebook status about how it was controlled and that he wanted attention. He has a girlfriend, a step son and has recently had another child. He has treated me badly in the past but has never hit my son. My son has an ok relationship with him. 

A fortnight ago he spat on me and bit my arm when we were on an outing at a local park and strangers witnessed it. I asked him to stay on the inside of the path and stop wandering (social distancing, others walking past). It was the first anything like this has ever happened and he's been on what I call 'Tech ban' ever since which means he's had 

*- no TV  (at all)*

*- no  consoles, No computer games of any sort*

for **14 days.** 

His behavior has gotten 100 x worse. On day 9, I took away most of his toys and stored them until his behavior changes. Today, I deleted his Animal Crossing account as I had threatened for 3 days if he didn't stop.  Nothing is working. He screams at me all day long, hits me, won't do a single thing he's asked, won't eat anything I cook, broken/thrown things from the minute he got up until he sleeps. 

I am so drained. I cry constantly. I can't even take him shopping because he makes such a scene. I don't want to wake up every day and do it all over again on my own. He has nothing left to take away and he's not learning a thing. I genuinely can't do this anymore.

**What now?**",31Jul2020,1

759,"I grew up in a brown family and standards for skinny are like toothpick level. I used to be that way but I gained some weight during university and now I am a healthy 120lbs at 20 years old. My parents still complain that i gained weight and call me fat almost on the daily, along with other relatives. I already eat very little, the only reason I gained weight in uni was because the dorm food was inedible and i was forced to eat out constantly. 

During quarantine I lost about 10 pounds so far. Ive only been eating one meal a day, not because Im starving myself but because I genuinely don't feel hunger often and thats how ive always been. Both my parents are still calling me fat no matter what I do and its really taking a toll on me. I keep telling them to stop it because its rude and they tell me ""then lose the fat."" 

I feel like this is eventually gonna lead to an eating disorder..

760,"I wasn’t sure if I should post this in r/jobs or r/selfdiscipline so I figured I’d ask here.

I struggle with attendance. In high school I was a 4.0 student, regularly got awards, and all my teachers loved me for being self motivated, but I also got called into office and had to talk to the principal a lot because of skipping days. In my senior year I probably missed over 40 days of school.

In my first job at 14 I got diagnosed with depression/anxiety and 2 years later after a suicide attempt I decided to finally quit because it was ruining my life. Up until then I was the top of the sales team but also called out sick regularly and only didnt get fired because they were desperate for workers.

In my 2nd job I loved it, worked full time, and became a manager within a few months. I took a sick day once or twice every month. They gave me two verbal warnings while I was there but kept me because they were low on workers.

My new job has very strict attendance policy, and I really love it and it pays amazing, but I just don’t know if I can keep up going every day. I really don’t wanna get fired and it’s making me wonder if I’ll ever be able to have a stable career with my depression in the way. I never really get sick or have emergencies or take vacations, so I’m rarely out of work except for my monthly mental health days.

TL;DR I’m a hard worker but my attendance sucks and idk if I will ever be able to have a career.",31Jul2020,1

762,"I had a few smaller panic attacks when I was 14, but now at 20 I've been suffering from near constant anxiety for the last 4 months. I'm talking anxiety 85% of the time, irritability, unable to relax or enjoy life. Last week I had my first really bad panic attack, I was freaking over something minor and made it into a huge deal, my heart then skipped a beat and I convinced myself I was having a heart attack/going crazy/going to die and my forehead started sweating  and I got this really tight feeling in my throat. 

Since then, maybe 2 or 3 times a day when I feel extra anxious or when I remember this panic attack, I get that same tight feeling in my throat OR my heart feels funny or skips a beat, though I think I'm imagining that cos I'm focusing so hard on NOT getting another heart palipation.  Normally when I'm freaking out or stressed I just find it harder to breath (anxiety attacks) but these symptoms since that nasty panic attack are new.",31Jul2020,1
763,"A few years ago I unwillingly fell in love with a co-worker. He was assigned as my partner / teammate. When I first met him I could not stand him, he was very animated, full of energy, and talked a lot. Not that any of that is a bad thing, I just wanted to be left alone so that I could concentrate on work. His office was right across the hall from mine yet he was always in my office chatting it up. He was extremely funny and not to brag, but so am I. We would laugh and shit talk for hours, it was a daily occurence and the office / clinic took notice but left it alone because we actually got work done when it was time to be serious. I'm typically a very private about my personal life especially when it comes to my marriage because I know if I was on the outside looking in, I would not like my husband and would pity me. And because I suppose I am prideful I dont wish to be pitied so I keep all my problems to myself,  I dont even share anything with my sister whom I am close with.  Eventually,  I opened up a small amount to my coworker because he would share things about his marriage and I felt like I could share some things as well especially when we had similar issues.   Somedays I felt maybe he had feelings for me because of little things he would do like wait for me at the end of the day to walk with me towards the parking lot, or choose to sit with me during meetings,  I would catch him watching me or even just the fact that he was constantly in my office. I chose to ignore all those things because we were both married and we never said anything to each other that would hint towards romantic feelings. I would even avoid getting too physically close to him because I didnt want to be inappropriate. He eventually volunteered to work out of another clinic within the building when they needed the help and I stayed behind, I instantly felt his absence and felt alone and sad, i was quite shocked at my reaction. He ended up getting into a nursing program  so he quit working to focus on school. Fast forward  a few months and he came in to my work to say goodbye because he was moving away to his wife's home state, and to explain why he dropped out of school for unrelated issues. We chatted for about an hour or longer catching up and divulged a little about how things werent great with our significant others but said our goodbyes. Just as he left the building I did something 100% out of character and told him if we were ever both single / divorced in the future I want him to come and find me, and he said ""of course"". About a year and half later I'm still working in the same place and I get a phone call from my old friend,  he needed some info  and we just started catching up and he let me know he was back in school and i told him i also got back into school myself. We talked for a long while and we ended the phone call. Having talked to him again brought back so many weird feelings in me as well as anxiety and restlessness. It could have been my anxiety but I decided it would be a great idea to type up a letter thanking him for being a wonderful person and friend and listening to me when I needed someone to talk to, in my letter I explained to him that he was like the  part of the Wizard of Oz movie when color is introduced and everything is suddenly beautiful and interesting instead of just boring black and white but since he left it all went back to black amd hmwhite just like the movie. I did not want to outright say I had feelings for him but I tried my best without actually saying the words. He responded to my letter via email and he said my letter made him feel good and he said I am one of his favorite people he knows, he ended his response with "" and in the words of Han Solo, I know"". Yes, I am a huge Star wars fan and so is he but what is the sub context of responding ""I know"" in my situation. Did I just completely embarrass myself by revealing my feelings or is his response mirroring my own feelings? I'm so confused. Anyways I waited a whole year and half to email him again just to find out if he finished his program at the same time as me, and he has. We talked like regular friends and nothing more and I chose to keep my emails to him very limited even though he said if I ever needed to talk he would be there. Can someone shed light on "" I know"", I would like to have some insight, it really sucks having feelings for someone when you shouldn't and you cant see or talk to them. Thanks",31Jul2020,1

768,"I'm afraid this is gonna be a bit of a long one... Anyway I'm 22 and I've been lonely for very long. I have friends I can hang out with, but they're not very close and they aren't really people I want to be around with for too long. Since half a year I even have a close friend, but she lives very far away and we can't really ever hang out. I'm even in therapy for loneliness, or social anxiety, or something at least because I've been feeling pretty bad about life for some four years now. I'm with my current therapist since January but things are moving so slowly and I don't know if it's even heading anywhere...

Anyway it's summer vacation. My only friend is super busy right now and doesn't have much time to chat with me online. At the same time, I'm staying with my parents at their getaway guest house where we receive lots of people. Business is great because borders have just opened and lots of people are looking for a getaway vacation close to home. I'm surrounded by people all the time. But I feel very apart from them too, because that's just the dynamic that I've learned... We are the host, they are the guest. It's even against the philosophy of my parents so I don't know where I picked it up but it's just how it is. I can't really connect to anyone who's here. On top of that my sister has lots of friends over and people she knows and she's hanging out and having fun with them all the time. Even though they aren't really ""her"" friends, she's got much more history with them then I do. In fact, everyone seems to have much more history with each other than I do. People know each other from earlier times and do stuff together, while I'm just alone and apart. I feel left out, to be honest. But he'll, even if they did make a clear effort to include me (which they won't because I've put up some pretty high walls), I'd probably still decline because I don't know them and they're not really my type of people anyway. They're slightly younger too (in behaviour) so I just don't really want to. Same goes for any other person who comes here, I don't really know them and that scares me off, combined with the host-guest dynamic...

Meanwhile, my future looks pretty bleak. In college I've got no one I really want to be friends with anymore and I feel left out there as well... I'm pretty glad with the hobbies that I have so trying out new stuff, even if it means that I get to meet new people, doesn't really seem all that appealing to me. There's stuff I do want to try out, but simply can't in the place where I live because it's geographically pretty hard. I've been talking about this with my therapist and I haven't gotten a clear answer to it, but the gist seems to be that I still need to go out doing stuff that I don't really want to for any other reason than meeting people. Meanwhile I have no long-term plans for my life. I really don't want to commit to anything, it seems.

On top of that I have very low self-esteem and I'll find any reason to not let people in. Currently, I've decided that needing people too much is the worst thing ever and that I shouldn't bother anyone with the pressure that comes with that. Hence I'm not even open to making new friends, even though I badly want to. I also feel like I want things like close friends or a partner too badly that it'll be unfair to those people, so I should get over my issues first. But I can't seem to do that without making some close connections in the first place... And for a relationship this is tenfold, because I'm codependent as fuck and that will only hurt the other person.

In short I'm really not sure what to do. I'm trying to enjoy my own company. I've been going on hikes alone and I enjoyed it, but I can't help but feel the pain of not having anyone to join me. I get sad and feel resentment even if my only friend can't make time for me due to circumstance. I feel so jealous of everyone around me who's having fun with each other and making new friends while I'm stopping myself from joining in. I can't keep doing this for much longer I'm afraid, but I don't know what else I'll do except wither away... How to cope? How to handle?",31Jul2020,1
769,"At a family gathering, the news finally came out from one of my uncles that my maternal grandfather was a convicted pedophile. I knew he spent quite a few years in jail, but I was told by my mother that it was for tax evasion. As a kid, I just took that for what it was and accepted that was why I never really saw him. My dad confirmed my uncle’s statement, but told me to absolutely keep quiet about it because it tore our family up, even to where my parents (which are the strongest couple I know) were close to getting a divorce.

I’m a 20 year old soldier living with my grandparents. I just moved in with them not too long ago. During the week I’m on base, but during the weekend, I want time to relax. 

They cleared a room for me and I built a closet for myself. My grandpa used to use the room as a TV room with a computer where he can play solitaire. I made him a little office with his computer in another room so I can have some more privacy. Finally! I thought I had space to myself after having none whatsoever on base. I come into my room after dinner and my grandpa is watching TV in my room again. Which normally I wouldn’t care too much about, but they have two other TVs in the house. 

TMI I know but my long distance boyfriend and I wanted time *alone* but consistently can’t get it because my grandparents are either in my room, trying to make me eat every half second, or wanting to take me somewhere. It’s really frustrating for me when I have no time to unwind. 

So reddit, I come to you. I know my grandparents love me and just want to be around me and spend time with me, but I CANT deal with not having my own space to unwind after the week.

780,"I live in supported accomodation, so there are support workers on site more or less round the clock. They knock on our doors in the morning check we are ok and ask if we have anything we need to do today. Shopping appointments etc. 

The other morning I heard my door go so got up to answer it. I had a very bad night and was super sleepy and could just about think straight. Glazy eyes, no glasses on, no sense of anything yet. Slept in my underwear which is rare for me, but i was so tired that I literally fell asleep halfway through getting undressed. I normally sleep naked all year round. 

So I get up out of bed, stagger to my door open it as say hello to the girl on staff that day for my floor. Im hardly able to keep my eyes open while she talks to me, her normaly bubbly self. Maybe a little over bubbly like, a bit hyperactive if that makes sense. More giggly than normal. Whatever, maybe shes had extra coffee today or something.

Im not sure if she noticed (TBH it would have been difficult not to notice but) she never said anything to me. So if she DID see then she knows I wasnt concentrating properly and therfore had no idea.

I basically have act submissive to them so they would be pleased, and I’m having second thoughts I’m so unhappy being in this religion I tried to be happy and believe , (I think I’m might be an atheist but if they figure that out I would be in big trouble). In this religion or what they said is I basically can live separately ( after 18) only when married ( parents choose who I marry). I expressed that I don’t want get married but I would like to live alone in the future. They made it clear they won’t let me live on my when I’m older they would “what do want be like those Americans who kick there children out (after 18) can’t you see I’m being nice, what we do is let our children stay with” (keep in mind they don’t speak English this is roughly translated to the best of my ability) she said this kindly too but that’s every response when talk to her. Even with the close “you want to like the Americans, and show your skin to” while I just wanted to wear a t shirt ( I’m very tomboyish) she would stop being like the men when I say why are my brothers allowed to Wear what they want ( even my dad wears a t shirt or some Americans style). Am I the asshole please some tell me I need advice I’m about to go insane. I’ve been thinking about the future and what I possibly wanted to be( probably a atheist).

Some of the dreams had my bf(17m) in them and now I can feel myself being distant and kinda upset towards him over little things because of the dreams.

784,"So some back story; I’m active duty and will be changing duty stations in March which is about 7 months away. While I’m very much looking forward to moving and getting away from the stressful and time consuming life of sea duty, and being able to finally adopt a cat and focus more on school, it’s hard to stay positive about the rest of my time here. I’ve always been a silver lining type but honestly I can’t find anything to be happy about and look forward to outside of my transfer date. I’m constantly thinking about what I’m gonna do when I leave and everything around moving and what comes after, but it’s making me miserable having to wait. It doesn’t help there’s a pandemic and even if I wanted to go out and risk it the military has a ban on any social event and travel outside of essential only. To include going on leave further than 50 miles from base. Any advice on how to stay interested in a life that’s slowly coming to a close instead of being impatient for the change to come? 

TLDR; I’m moving soon and the excitement of it has made me miserable with the rest of my time here and I’m trying to find a way to enjoy it while it lasts.",31Jul2020,1
785,"I'm female ( 21yo )and have a boyfriend (21yo) who has a 1 year old daughter who he says is a mistake and wished she would have been aborted , but since that his flesh and blood he cant help but love her. Although he loves her he cant tolerate her screaming and other bullshit that babies do . Typically he'll find someone to dump her off with like his roommate or his parents so he can come and hang out with me , I've brought up the conversation before telling him that he should find someone else who is willing to accept both him and his kid but he insists that we stay together and try to work it out. A couple months go by after that conversation , and by this point I've tried liking the kid and opening up my heart to her but I just cant! I seriously fucking hate her and wish she had been aborted or he would have worn protection in the first place . I was aware he had a child before the relationship began but at that time the mother was keeping the kid away and he really only brought her up in conversation twice over the course of 4 months. That time was such an amazing time , we went on road trips every other weekend ,and had lots of amazing sex... we were so so happy!! We've been together over a year and never argued but since the court date determined they get 50/50 custody of her, shes the only thing we fight about . So I brought up the conversation again today and I told him most parents will leave their significant other in a heartbeat if that person didnt like their kid and so maybe he should do the same cuz I just don't see myself ever taking a liking to his child ( yah I'm that honest ) so he decided to give up his parental rights, right then and there . He says he did it so it wouldn't cause problems for us anymore and that he really doesn't want to lose me , but I dont want him giving up his rights solely because of me , if he had reasons of his own that's fine so long as its not only because of me . He says he does have reasons of his own such as the responsibility, having to wake up early everyday ( he works 12hour shifts and is always on call so he never gets to sleep in cuz of the kid even on his rare day off ) and also because of financial reasons but I feel like if that were true he would have done it without me saying anything, but now all of a sudden I say something and he does it. He was pretty sour about it for about an hour ( if that ) and right after we were drinking margaritas and going for a ride around town on his motorcycle happy as ever !.

I've tried researching this type of scenario and read a couple articles that say the spouse should always come first before the children , cuz eventually children leave the nest and spouses stay forever, and another article saying that only a REAL REAL man can put his woman first. And I agree with that , I should come first! Just like he will always come first for me despite me not any having kids. 

Obviously I'm someone who hates kids , I always have even when I was a kid. I've always hung out with the older crowd &amp; never got along with kids my own age or younger. I'm sure I'll get all kinds if comments wishing I'd burn in hell or whatever, which is fine by me since I already know I'm a horrible person.

***HELP BRING OUR KIDS HOME!***

I am trying to bring attention to our situation in hopes that it will somehow help by getting the word out. I am going to break down the situation as best as I can. This is the piece of shit sorry ass bastard who is wanted in Arizona for kidnapping and custodial interference. He took my girlfriends kids to New Mexico in July of 2019 he is her ex husband so she was willing to be civil and let the kids visit his family in New Mexico since they had been a part of the kids lives for so long which she felt was the right thing to do for the kids. He was supposed to bring them back before school started but he never came so my girlfriend went to New Mexico to retrieve her children. His family calls the New Mexico police and they would not allow her to take her children because they “didn’t know what the custody agreement was” since they were in the process of getting divorced they had no written custody agreement at that time and it was to be established but instead he comes back to AZ without her knowledge then goes to the courts makes false accusations to get an order of protection against their mother so she was not allowed to be around the kids. He then takes the kids back to New Mexico. The restraining order was dropped because the judge determined the accusations to be false but by that time he had already taken the children back to New Mexico. He then makes calls to AZ CPS and N.M. CYFD and makes false allegations against my girlfriend. New Mexico has told my gf that they have dropped their case after speaking with the children Arizona’s cps has not because they say the can’t conclude the investigation until they speak to the kids but the kids are in New Mexico so that cannot happen. In numerous court hearings a judge has ordered that the children be returned because they are currently wards of the state of Arizona but for whatever reason both states can’t cooperate to retrieve the kids. Arizona has charged him and when he steps foot back in this state he will be arrested along with his sister and mother who have aided him and have kept the kids away from everyone. My girlfriend has not spoken to her children in almost a year! How is this allowed to happen? Please if anyone can help let us know. Please spread this to make people aware. If possible reach out to New Mexico and ask how they can allow someone who is not even the biological father of 2 of the kids keep them away from their mother? Why hasn’t the state of New Mexico sent police or anyone to get the kids? He is doing this completely out of spite and retaliation for her leaving him. He is an abusive, cruel, heartless mother fucker! He has threatened to kill her saying stuff like “they will not find your body” he even told her he was going to do this he said “I am going to get the kids taken from you” and as of right now he’s succeeding and it’s killing us every day. I hope karma comes for him because this is some evil shit! My girlfriend has been so strong throughout this she has missed all their birthdays a whole year that we will never get back as we try to start our new blended family. Sorry for the long post if you read this far I thank you. This has just been on my mind heavy I truly hate this mother fucker and I wish the WORST possible shit upon him. Fuck you David.",31Jul2020,1

Only a couple of those people in the group ‘talk’ to me since then. Now my other friends have a very “cancel culture” mindset.  They don’t easily forgive no matter how extreme or how little the matter is. They also refuse to admit when they’ve done wrong. I know i should probably move on from them, but we’ve all been best friends for years.

794,"My parents want me gone. Like. Gone gone. I just recently turned 19, and it feels like they’re pushing me to do so much more than I can. They forced me to find work in March when the pandemic was horrific in my state (still is), and I had a job by June. Full Time. I still have that job and it’s pissing them off. They’re doubting me left and right saying “she’s a worthless piece of sh** for making us drive her down the road to work” (mind you I live on an EXTREMELY deadly highway, so they can’t just make me walk to work. My step mom already did once, in the pouring rain and I had an extreme asthma attack that could have killed me from pushing myself to go 2.8MI in the pouring rain. She laughed at me about this). They won’t even acknowledge the fact that my 30 year old step brother who still lives with us, flirts with me NONSTOP and has complimented my butt and chest many times. He’s even barged into my room a few times in the middle of the night with the excuse of “oh I thought this was the bathroom”, then proceeding to stare me down for 5 minutes before leaving my room. 

People keep telling me to just save up and move out. Find friends to live with or family. It’s not that easy. I don’t have friends because my parents don’t let me. I only have 2 friends left, whom live across state so I cannot go live with them as I don’t have a car or anything, plus they don’t have room for me. My family who I can live with- are dead. I only have one family member left I could turn to but she is a drug addict, and I don’t want to risk things as she has felons in her house left and right (who are convicted on sex crime charges or drug charges). Apartments here are almost two thousand a month for rent, and easily $1000/mo even with roommates. I suffer from extreme PTSD too, and have an overwhelming fear of new people due to this, so it’d be pretty hard for me to even find roommates unless they were friends. Which really doesn’t help considering the two people I could live with, are out of a job due to covid. 

At this point my parents are making it seem like its MY fault that they “so gratefully rescued me from an abusive household, and with no thank you”. Mind you I’ve told them thank you plenty of times for all they’ve done for me. 

I really just want to save for a car so I can get the hell out of this household. I’ve attempted committing suicide 2x living with them, and I’ve only been here a year. I can’t pick up a second job to save, and I cannot move out until this covid bull crap is over with. There’s no side jobs available. (trust me. I’ve looked many a plenty times). 

I’m at a witts end. I have a month left “to save or gtfo”. My brain machine is broke. I just need answers at this point because none of this feels right to me. I’m so conflicted on what to do. They want me to save TWICE what I make in one month to stay here. What in gods name do I do? ;-;",31Jul2020,1

803,"Hello, I'm writing here frantically because over the past year I have struggled with suicidal thoughts, self harming, uninternalised grief, frequent periods of mania and depression and it has been very difficult to organize my thoughts well enough to learn my university courses and I will fail my exams if I am to sit them in about three weeks time. I feel stupid for not requesting medical leave closer to the start of my uni year but figured by just powering on I would beat my suicidal thoughts depression and mania by getting good grades. This was stupid for many reasons including That the summer before I spent entirely doing mathematics as I was writing an undergraduate research paper largely unassisted although I was supervised by a member of my department (mathematics). Not thinking this would burn me out so did nothing about my obviously dwindling mental state and this turned into a vicious cycle of negatively reinforcing those thoughts and led to me planing my death with items of high lethality and attempting several times this year (not fully going through with it but I came quite close). None of this was disclosed to my university although I made several appointments with their counselling service but cancelled the first few times out of shame and the last appointment was cancelled due to Covid ,recently I have seen a therapist who made me sit a battery of official evaluations and will write me a letter/report I am to send to my head of department to request him to consider allowing me to sit my exams next year rather than this summer due to the aforementioned reasons. 

For some more background my department is aware that I have been previously prescribed antidepressants but only took them for a month as they had negative side effects but are it aware that new illnesses emerged this year (mania) or that the severity of my previous conditions for significantly worse. Prior to this failure of a year I managed to achieve within the top five percent of my cohort and was in the dean's list and am proud of this as I made a huge effort to focus and study in a disciplined fashion throughout that year which was something I felt hopelessly unable to do this year.

 Over next year (by that I mean 2021 and what remains of 2020) if my request is accepted I will be going to therapy and not make the same mistake but I am extremely worried I will not get such a chance and if I do I fear I will feel very much like an imposter compared to people who've ""had it worse"".

805,"I'm 35, still live with my mother, have no girlfriend, nor consistent friends... I feel strongly disappointed in myself and I'm not really sure how to fix my life and feel happy. 

Currently I don't have a job, but I am working on getting a masters degree in computer science and plan on going back to working in about a year. Because of my minimalistic lifestyle and me living at home, I have quite a bit of money, $200K in retirement funds and $600K in cash and financial markets, no debts, and I have a car.

I really want to date, but it's destroying my confidence that I live with my mom, so I'm afraid to build conversations with people. I haven't dated in over 10 years because of this. Frequently I think that I can just move out to fix that, but then I think I'll just find another flaw in myself, and 1) feel even more alone 2) will have an extra expense of $2,000 a month to pay for doing this. Even outside of dating, I don't really have any relatable friends, just a few acquaintances that I go out to visit once every week or two, to not be a complete hermit; but they have their own lives. Having kids and getting married, so they are far beyond my current state of life. I used to get a little extra social interaction at a local gym, but COVID completely destroyed most of my already pathetic social activity. Now I just sit in front a PC, every, damn, day. 

A few years ago, I really wanted to move out, and started looking for a house, but ironically my mom clawed in to me, and was dead set on moving with me, which was totally defeating the purpose of what I was trying to do; so I stopped my search. Since then, I was very close to moving away, and she seemed ok with it, but unfortunately new job offers fell through, so I stayed home. She can easily live on her own, but seems like really doesn't want me to go. It's also very hard for me to leave an easy way of life behind, since I just pay both car insurances, internet, sometimes property taxes, and cook. Everything else is taken cared of for me.

I never could have imagined that I'd be feeling so miserable in my mid 30s. I feel that I screwed up my life, and every time I'm close to a change, I end up not moving in any direction. Because of how long this has been going on, I'm also afraid to get out of this hole, fearing that I will make it even worse.

I offered to help him fix his car even though I’m saving money for school and to fix my own car.

I can sympathize that he’s going through shit but I can’t sympathize with him throwing shit, calling me names and the hostility.

807,"First of all, this was something that happened 5 years ago. The memory keeps coming back to me and makes me incredibly sad, makes me wonder what could be wrong with me.

I went on a trip with three other people. Two of them I didn't know before and one of them I considered a close friend at the time. We went bar hopping one night and I don't drink much but something was off and I could sense I was being the butt of jokes all night. It was maybe I was considered as not so ""adventurous"" by the other guys because I didn't want to get drunk as much. My ""friend"" joined in on the fun and all three of them said some hurtful things which still bother me from time to time.

At one point in the night, we wanted to take a group photo and no one was available to take it. So one of the two guys I didn't know said 'You're not interested in photos right? Why don't you take it?' I can't remember what I thought at the time but I just remember hanging my head and taking the picture with the three of them. 

This memory keeps coming back to me. I just try to analyze it over and over. Was that guy an asshole for saying that? I hate the way I look in photos and avoid them as much as I can. Was that clear on my face? Even if it was, why would someone say that? I don't expect anyone to stand up for me but my ""friend"" said nothing and posed for the picture.

811,"Both of my parents were addicts. I lost my mother to addiction 4 years ago now. After she died I tried to educate myself on what she may have been experiencing. I wanted to know why she did what she did and why I wasn’t enough for her to stay sober.

I never really had a relationship with my father because of his addiction. He was around every few years but at a certain age I gave up on the idea of having a father. I was lucky enough to to have my grandparents step in and raise me.

My dad went to prison for three years because of his addiction and was released about a year ago. He reached out to my after he was released but I wasn’t ready for communication or a relationship with him.

I have been struggling since my mom died for it trying harder or trying to understand and help her more when she was alive. I hold guilt everyday because of this. I feel like I let her down and that is a hard thing to live with. I know deep down I was the child and they should have been there for me and I did what anyone would have naturally done in that situation....

I finally came to a place where I was willing to open up lines of communication with my dad...I have to at least try. I don’t want to live with the guilt of losing another parent and not trying...I sent him a message and said we can take steps and see where this goes. I don’t know where to begin or how to begin...

How do I rebuild a relationship with him? I know nothing about him.... I don’t know what to say or how to say how I am feeling.

Can anyone offer advise or suggest a book or podcast?

814,"I work at a place that pooled all tips among employees that worked in a week and divided it by hours worked by each employee. I didn't like this and wanted to change it to tips being reconciled daily as they usually are eat every other place I've known.
Long story short, I am back after being unemployed. Now that the manager took a pay cut and takes tips, she wants to take cash tips that are hers. I am glad that she realized the unfairness, but credit card tips are still pooled in that way. Being that most payments are cc due to the virus, I feel like I am missing out quite a bit - about $7/hr yesterday in cc tips alone.
I worked all day yesterday alone and was tipped considerably higher than other days based on the history that I can see.
I'm going to ask to split tips daily based on who is working. If this doesn't go over well, I am thinking I should start looking for work elsewhere. Is this a dumb hill to die on? It was something I wanted to change since day one.
tldr; cash tips are divvied out by person, cc tips are pooled. I don't think it's fair. If nothing changes should I find a different job just for this reason?",31Jul2020,1
815,"I live in a studio near a major city in Arizona, USA. In the summer, it normally gets to be around 115 degrees in the day and stays around 100 at night. It's HOT.

My studio is part of a quadplex - there are just four of us here and plentiful parking. There are two spots right next to the studios and the others are on the other side of the property, which is still small but a considerably further distance from the close spots. The close spots are also the only spots with shade. 

There are only three of us here right now as one unit is empty and only two of us have cars. I have an SUV and my neighbor has two full sized trucks and a semi truck that he keeps on property. 

The close spots used to be taken by the neighbors who recently moved out. As such, my neighbor and I have been sharing the close spots. Then, a few weeks ago, he decided to move his two trucks into the spots, even though he uses them maybe once a week. One of the trucks hasn't moved since it was put there. 

This wouldn't normally be an issue - I am more than capable of walking to the further spots and have happily done so up to this point. The issue is my dog. I have a very elderly dog who is disabled and cannot walk without a wheelchair. He comes everywhere with me and I have to carry him to the car whenever I take him places, which is about 3 times a day. If I have to carry him too far, he starts squirming, ends up hurting himself, and pees on me. I've been peed on twice today already and it is only noon. 

I'm considering leaving my neighbor a note explaining the situation with my dog - that carrying him to the far spots is starting to be an issue and since we are the only two people on property with cars, he doesn't use one of the trucks, and it has just been sitting there for weeks, I would really appreciate having access to one of the two close spots. However, I'm terrified of confrontation.

Is it worth it to bring this up to my neighbor? I've been incredibly frustrated because of it and I feel like I'm overreacting.",31Jul2020,1
816,"My son (14) and I (43) are going on vacation to a beach in a couple weeks. I had originally asked my nephews who are very close to my son and around his age if they wanted to go. They both said they didn’t so we moved on. (Another friend is going with my son.) Then just today, one told me he’d changed his mind and wanted to go. My sister, his mom, told him he couldn’t go, even though she’d previously told me they could go if they wanted, it was all up to them. She told my nephew he had to play football and it was too close to school starting (4 days...)

820,"TLDR: I think what I want to see ya'll say is that its okay for me to go through her place while she's not there to try to find them. I'm very angry and can't seem to let this go until it comes to a resolution.



Theres no real substance abuse besides the fact that she was home-ridden for about a decade during her 20's from a stomach issue (she's off her pain meds now) so she misses some big social queues, and for some reason feels entitied to things that aren't hers or at least slightly more than her fair share, just to make sure she's not getting ripped off. These issues are hidden by the fact that she is otherwise very sweet, very fun, hilarious, super welcoming, cute, and can be surprisingly sharing.

She used to have a history of taking stupid things like hair products and stuff. Not because she doesn't want to pay for it (she has the financial means to get what she wants/needs) but because its convenient. The last 8 years or so, she's only really held on to stuff I've left at her house until I realize its gone or kept things that my parents give her to give to me. A huge one was about a year ago when my parents had to sneak into her place while she was at work to find my late uncle's 3 harmonicas that my aunt had given to me- they were quite hidden, and she's the kind of person that would put them on display if they were rightly hers.

This time it's a replacable (though very expensive) product, but she would have blatantly taken it TWICE- once from my place, then once from an air bnb we both stayed at a week or two later. What I imagine would have happened is that she thought the one I replaced the 'lost' one with was probably hers that she had left out (and if theres any chance that it might be hers, she will take it without asking.) Confronting her will achieve nothing except a long argument of her deny deny denying. I already have asked her if she found something like it in her luggage; she said no and that she was fully unpacked. She did go to a not-so-defensive 'do you think i took it?' and I kind of avoided the question and we moved on.. She could have been asking that because she knows it would be fair if i did think that, whether she actually did or not.

My small apartment has been torn apart by me and my husband and the first one is definitely not here. The second one I'd chalk up to just leaving it at the air bnb (even though the owner said she didn't find it and no one else had stayed there and there was nothing left in that place when we left), if the first one hadn't mysteriously gone missing within the few days that my sister had been at my apartment. 

I really want to give her the benefit of the doubt, but I want to go look in her hiding places (I imagine they'd be similar to the ones in her old place that I'd find my stuff in when I would visit her from out of town years ago.)

I love my sister so much in so many ways and I absolutely love spending time with her, and I've succeeded a bit at accept her hard flaws that shes also improved in the past few years but I won't be able to let this one go until I find at least one of the products somewhere- and its been two weeks. I'm just so upset that she might have done something like this to me and this anger is sometimes overwhelming.

If I were to do something about it, what I'd have to do is this: she doesn't work right now, so I'd have to coerce her out of her place to come over, 'still be running errands' when she gets here and my husband would tell me when she gets here and id spend 20 minutes or so looking for it/them. And no, I do not feel proud for having come up with that plan, but that's what my mom had to do to secretly get my harmonicas back. (Which, by the way, was never brought up again by anyone- she knew she was wrongly keeping them from me.)

My husband asked me how I would feel with different outcomes- if she came clean, I'd forgive her and know how hard that'd have to have been for her, and probably still let her in my apartment, though limitedly. If I went into her place when she wasnt there and found it/them and she apologized, I'd need some time but I'd forgive her, and she'd have to forgive me for going through her place. If I found it/them in her place and she didn't fess up, I would need a LOT of time (also shed be 'mad at me for thinking I stole it' not to mention going into her apartment when she's not there) and never let her in my house ever again.",31Jul2020,1

I’m doing okay in university but I’m not as brilliant as I might seem at first or as I’ve been telling my family for the last two years. I don’t like my major and knew it from Week 2 of the course but my parents told me to stick with it. It’s not gonna bring me big bucks either.

My parents drive me insane and I’m hoping to move as far away as I can (for the second time) in 2 years time. My dad is a good-for-nothing narcissistic scumbag. My stepfather is a bigoted, racist and sexist man. My mother doesn’t look after her own health and puts everyone else first, and doesn’t approve of most things I’ve done in life so far. Actually, until recently, I’d been trying so hard just to make her proud and happy, but she always seems to feel miserable. 

My parents are well into their 50s and they still live in an expensive neighborhood in a rented property by choice. I’m guessing my sister and I are gonna have to help them once they retire... I just worry a lot. To make things worse, they dismiss my opinions 99% of the time because I was born ‘privileged' whereas they’ve lived through a war etc.

he divorced my mom when I was 8.

2 months in and mother is having trouble financially and asks me to at least go visit him on the weekends, I do as she says.

he seems to have missed me after he had realized that I'm not under his control anymore, overall he started treating me better.

Long story short, I met this guy when I was in middle school and he was a bit older than me (by like 2 years) and he was always nice to me and we got along as friends (nothing creepy, he made it clear he had a girlfriend at the time). I, being in middle school n all had a huge crush on him, and that lasted until I was in my senior year of highschool because I met my current boyfriend. However me and the guy were close, he was a good friend of mine. He got a girlfriend and she is now his baby momma but he confided in me that she was really invasive: 

-has his passwords 
-checks his phone 
-checks where he’s at 
-(according to one of our mutual friends) she threatened to kill herself if he left 
-she makes him avoid female friends (me)

836,"I'm a cartoonist who makes a fairly popular comic (I mean I'm not Vivziepop but Patreon does pay my rent), my comics are about to go on print soon. I should focus on that, I'd probably have more readers if I was more active promoting the comic on social media.

But I'm also writing a book - or actually, 5-7 books at once, I shift from one to another when I lose interest in one and picking up the other. I've been writing since I was 16, only ever finished two, and while frankly I'm not sure if the one I wrote as a teenager can even BE worked into a publishable form, I've gotten good feedback from readers of the last one. I should be focusing on polishing that one instead of making background research for a new idea. If I could stick to just one, I would have been a published author by now.

I paint also, though my paintings aren't gold. But I know if I had focused only on THAT, I could've been a professional illustrator.

Now I've most recently gotten distracted by the idea of going into animation, start a youtube channel expanding on my comic.

I've got a fairly good hand when it comes to art and storytelling, and I'm pretty confident that if I could just get myself to stick to one thing 100%, I would have been successful years ago. But I can't make myself just pick one and give up on everything else. I know the best option would be to just focus on the comic that’s already successful, but they are also the most low-effort. I started drawing them for my own sake at the worst of my depression, so the style is extremely simple, now that I’ve figured out the best ways to achieve the look, I can draw a comic in 10-20 minutes.

837,"Hi, I currently live in NJ, USA. My brother is going to be a senior in high school this upcoming fall, and he plays football for the school team. Right now the season hasn’t been cancelled yet, but summer workouts have been pushed to September. Now the real issue here is the fact that, no matter how much convincing it’s going to take, he’s not taking a no to opt out this season as it’s his senior year. Why is him opting out important? Well it’s because our father is 64, has Parkinson’s Disease that has progressively deteriorated his movement and speech, and has some conditions related to high cholesterol and I believe high blood pressure. Convincing my brother not to play or not letting him leave the house has led to, well tons and tons of fights and we are tired now, so we let him leave with a mask on (though until recently he has not worn a mask, and on multiple occasions just snuck out). The fact that he won’t take our fathers health as a priority has given me a lot of stress, and well, his high school announced yesterday that they were going to reopen. I, entering junior year of college will be entirely online and home for the semester. I guess all this stress has just built up and I needed an outlet, a way to just let it out. My only hope is if his football season gets cancelled. Obviously if COVID didn’t exist and all, of course yeah I’d want him to enjoy football, but right now isn’t the best time, despite how everything is reopening and NJ is seemingly getting better at handling the virus. I guess my only real thing is to ask for help, how to prepare, how to really quarantine and help my father, any advice would be appreciated. We live in a two story house with a basement and I’ve considered telling my brother to go down there and quarantine, as there’s a bathroom and food we’d probably leave near the stairwell for him to get and disinfect the stairs afterwards. 

I need advice so that I can approach this matter peacefully, and well health advice in regards to disinfecting please.

And I live in constant fear that she will die and I will have no reason to be here anymore and become severely depressed. Of course I don't want this to happen, but I have a lot of issues and I can deal with it alone but my mother is the only person I can truly go to when it gets too much. I have a few close friends but I never feel like I can go to them for a lot of my issues. 

Long story I don't know what to do. I don't want to feel like this. I want to go to therapy but last time I tried this I was put on a waiting list for 6 months and was forced to cope alone, and I'm worried the same would happen if I tried again now.",31Jul2020,1
842,"This is my first time ever exposing myself like this on a subreddit so I’m not sure what to expect.

Last night, my mom and dad were arguing about my mom’s assumption that my father was being unfaithful to her. He’s had a history of being unfaithful to her. He’s had a bit of a violent history with her. I believe he has anger issues and he has put his hands on my mother in the past, when I was only 6. Since then, he’s claimed he’s changed but I’ve always been able to find him being unfaithful through his text messages.

Last night, he stormed out after the argument with my mom and came back a few hours later. I confronted him and told him to stop doing such things, and told him that I was only 6 when he was already being unfaithful and violent. He proceeded to approach me as if to hit me, so I got scared and pulled out my pocket knife. I asked him to back off and left the house for the night. I never meant to use it on him. I was only scared he’d hit me. Did I overreact? He’s never hit me before besides spanking and discipline with a belt but he walked up to me very angrily after I reminded him of his violent past with my mom.",31Jul2020,1
843,"I’m spending time with family that I haven’t seen in person since last year, tomorrow. I have talked to them on the phone, but being in person, I’m worried I won’t be able to avoid questions about my life. I’m the “unachieved” in my family. No driver’s license or car or diploma or job for that matter. I do plan on getting one soon, but I still don’t want to talk about this.

I haven’t brought anything to the table that is interesting about myself. When I talk to them, I’m usually talking about anything besides what I’m doing. I hate talking about what I’m doing since I’m doing nothing and anything I plan on doing, I don’t want to talk about because I fear judgement because I have been judged. Judgement from my family is not something I’d be able to shake off during this horrible time in my life. When I talk to people, I’m talking about other people and other things which is so tiring, but I do it to make sure nothing is directed towards me. What can I talk about that isn’t about social media or myself?",31Jul2020,1
844,"Apologies for the terrible formatting, I'm writing this on my phone.
To clarify, I'm a 13 year old female, but I'm not stupid  and know a dodgy situation when I see one. I was only allowed to get social media on my 13th birthday  and up until that point I had been feeling so bitter because all of my peers had started accounts when they were about 10. 
My mum always follows the age guidelines and it gets really frustrating. Despite being so strict about what I'm exposed to she goes on and on about how mature I am for my age and that just confuses me. She knows full well that I know how sex works and that I'm pretty desensitized to violence and strong language but she never wants me to see anything age restricted. Again, this is frustrating as it makes me feel like I'm being treated like a child compared to all of my peers. 
She makes it clear that under no circumstances am I allowed to post pictures of myself on social media. Obviously I know not to post stuff like nudes but I'm talking about just pictures of me hanging out with friends or having a moment I want to share. I'm really self conscious and have only just started to feel better through looking at photos my friends and I have taken. I know that there are creeps out there but I also know to just block them. Because of that rule I've had to tell my friends to not post a photo/video with me in it online and they always give me a look of annoyance and I honestly don't blame them. Usually when we're hanging out and they pull out their phones to do a video for Instagram or tik tok I end up sitting out because my mum doesn't want me putting myself on social media.
Oh yeah, I also forgot to mention that my mum, despite saying all this, has posted embarrasing photos of me as a kid that I definitely did not consent to her putting on Facebook.
All of these things make me feel really left out and angry because I feel like she treats me as a child but expects me to act like an adult, as cliche as that sounds.
So, is she right and I'm just being an edgy teen or should I try to do something about it?",31Jul2020,1
845,"It’s an apartment building with 6 apartments. We’re the only family with a pet and everyone is aware of our dog. 

I went into the garden at 10pm to just let my dog pee a last time. I noticed she was chewing on something so I tried to get her to spit it out but couldn’t and she ended up swallowing it. As soon as he swallowed she started whimpering and walking away from me, obviously scared. I panicked cause I’m home alone, but I remembered once googling what to do if your dog chokes cuz I was scared it would happen. I basically held my dog upside down and did the whole technic and she ended up spitting out a giant bone. I went to the place she had gotten the bone and there was a whole ass mountain of peas, corns, meat etc. Like someone just dumped their entire dinner plate in the garden.

I’m honestly pretty upset. If I hadn’t been paying attention to her she could’ve just choked and died. It shouldn’t be my responsibility to clean up after my neighbors but I can’t let my dog out in the garden before I do.

So the way our sport works is that you have a permanent partner for a year (Realistically my coach will make it no less than 2 years) that you have to compete with. I was bullied at the team for a while until my coach stepped in and told them they would be kicked off the team if it continued. My old partner can't dance anymore because of the cost associated with it (I am super grateful for my parents)  and it's sad cause we were really good at it. Anyway on to the problem. There are a couple of other people who are my options but I don't like most of them and the one that I do like is lazy. 

Merlin: My current partner. If i stay with her I may not be able to practice with her anymore

Laura: was friends with my old partner but she always hated me to this day I still can't talk to her. and giving this sport requires a lot of communication IDK if it will be good

&amp;#x200B;

Karen: she used to be anorexic and bullied me to get over it but she still relapses into her lack of eating. And if I danced with her I would hate it I have no doubt I would be miserable. (she was the main one to bully me.

&amp;#x200B;

Sarah: I like her but my friend who stopped being her partner and I noticed that she was EXTREMELY lazy. My coach knows it also but what can she do. If I dance with her I would have to give up on my ideas of being the top of my class again. (i kicked all of my competitor's asses)

Chloe: My old old partner (the one before merlin) but she also started bullying me.

I was exposed to what the internet had to offer at a very young age, including certain things I had not fully understood. Not to get too personal, but at the time I had somewhat of a rape fantasy. When I had watched the video, I wasn't interested in the fact that they were minors/being depicted as minors (it was a random video so there isn't really any way for me to know if they were or not), but I was rather 'inserting myself' in their position because it was something that I, for whatever reason, wanted to happen to me. Since then, I have matured a lot and I realize that I do NOT want that to happen to me in any way/shape/form. I am just having a hard time forgiving myself and I keep having panic attacks. The fact that I watched the video and did not find anything wrong with it at the time has me questioning if there is something messed up in my head.

(they were huge and took up around two full size garbage bags.) i was upset for a whole week and cried every day for a month after that. i still had stuffies on my bed because I got new ones while my old ones were in a bag. however I’m still very emotionally attached to my old toys and it hurts me to know that they’re all separated, I’ll never see them again, and I won’t be able to buy any of the same kind because all of them were from small stores. and I also am pretty convinced they were recycled or just thrown out by some kid who got it. and if they are comforting some random kid out there it hurt me that my closest stuffed animals would be spending life with somebody else? i know it’s silly but here’s the thing- my parents have been divorced since I was very young so whenever I felt like crying I always cried to my stuffed animals, I would never cry to my parents about it. my stuffies were like my closest friends and so I’m very sensitive about it. i was even going to pass them down to my future kids which I always said, but now that won’t happen. also with a bracelet, I got a gold bracelet when I was a baby and I’ve had the exact same bracelet for 12 years before I lost it earlier this year. it had been loose before vacation and during, but I didn’t think much of it.

877,"Let me just preface this by saying I know this is extremely stupid of me to do. College has been a difficult thing for me, with very unhelpful/abusive/neglectful parents I've had literally no guidance on all of this. 

 So I tried going to a 4 year college a few years ago, which I could not afford at all, and my parents were adamantly against loans. My parents would say they would pay for it and then used that to try to control/abuse me ""you do \_\_  /piss me off and i wont pay for your school"". They would just repeatedly take away my school funding, sometimes right before the payment due dates. It was a horribly toxic situation in more ways. It was so, so hard to even function living there, let alone get through college. I managed to get mostly A/B's and a couple withdraws. After a particularly horrible semester I couldn't bring myself to sign up for classes again. At first I thought it was just a break, but my home situation never improved in the way that I would feel safe relying on my parents to pay for it again. Eventually the college locked me out of all of my school accounts/email (I think they do this after a certain amount of time not in classes), and I pushed it all to the back of my mind. I thought that them locking me out for not signing up for classes was probably the same thing as dropping out.

I moved in with my bf last year and things are much more stable. I also realized in therapy that the best plan for me to move forward in life is to take out small student loans and get an associates in nursing. I think this is definitely doable for me now that have a better home situation. 

I applied to a cheap undergraduate program and sent in all of my transcripts. It's been 16 days that I've been waiting for a decision and I am wondering if it is taking so long because of the way that I left my old college.

878,"So, I've got a dog who's been sick since she was born. She's had recurring episodes of diarrhea and vomiting, otitis, urinary tract infection. Her hepatic enzymes are anywhere from 10 to 30 times as high as they should be. She's also got skin problems. Skin biopsy showed she has calcifications on her skin, and an ultrasound showed them in her biliary tract. She underwent several studies and her vet always seems confident she's about to find out what it is, but is then struck by results that are completely different to what she expected. 

She doesn't accept the fact that she's been wrong several times, and she keeps on misleading us into giving her different meds, without asking for help from other vets/deriving us to other specialists. She gaslights the whole situation. I asked her if the skin biopsy came back positive for pemphigus or discoid lupus, and she said it didn't. It also didn't come back as cancer. So, I told her to please let me read it since it's my right as my dog's owner, and I'm quite knowledgeable in biochemistry. She still hasn't sent me the results. I asked her what her thoughts were, and where we should go from now, and she deflects the conversation and doesn't provide any answers.

Of course I'm looking for another vet, but I wanted to suggest she made an antinuclear antibody analysis, since I thought maybe systemic lupus could be what she has. She presents a LOT of skin lesions, and also has some signs of polyarthritis. My dog's only three, and I want to be able to give her the treatment she deserves to have the best quality of life she can, even if it's not a long life. 

I also thought there was a slim chance she could have superficial necrolytic dermatitis, since her hepatic enzymes are over the roof, and her skin lesions only somewhat respond to antibiotics. Her blood cells are normochromic and she has 4 times as many platelets as she should. However, I feel like she will just ignore my suggestions. 

Any advice on how to deal with this situation? I know looking for another vet is the obvious answer, but nothing guarantees that the next one won't be like this one. I just wish she wasn't as arrogant and admitted she's lost, and started asking for help from other doctors. She also doesn't EVER try to explain what her reasoning is behind the treatment she gives my dog, and whenever I ask questions, she's like ""don't worry, this will help her"".",31Jul2020,1

I have no confidence in others or trust and I have been suicidal in more than 9 years now. I haven't seen my self esteem science I turned 14. 

The problem is, Thursday I got in a call with my mentor from school and she indirectly called me a social outcast.

I have problems bit I never have a sick day unless I'm pukeing) I really lost every hope I had about achieving anything major.

Fridays comes. I get up and wash my friend tears away with done fresh ones. make him breakfast and leave for work still with tears running. At work it just continues. I never felt so bad before. Back at home my BF packs and leaves. He have never seen me in such bad mood before and I know he didn't want to leave me behind.

Friend A is wonderful and we talk very often and it’s freakish how in sync we are. Friend B is nice enough, however they’re clingy, messaging me practically every day and multiple times wanting to RP AUs constantly, and if I take more than a second to reply they start spamming my un tag. Also I found out they’re way younger than me, with some possible mental health hiccups and a complicated family life that they need help with, which I’m in no position to help with bc I myself just escaped a crazy situation and the pandemic has drained my mental batteries. Bc of this, I’ve now ghosted Friend B for two months as I literally didn’t have the energy to deal with them. Here’s the problem, Friend B also talks with Friend A and has told them this. I have no excuse bc I’ve talked with Friend A very often over this time, so this is looking really bad. I also don’t want to cut ties completely with Friend B bc they’re creative and interesting but at the same time I literally don’t have the energy for them most of the time. How do I reply to Friend B today in a way that apologizes to her for the ghosting yet explains that I may not have energy to reply all the time without sounding like a douche? I have to be really delicate here bc I’m afraid if I’m not Friend B will badmouth me to Friend A and I’m already feeling guilty.",31Jul2020,1

Last time I talked to ex was mid April. bf Knows about this. He constantly throws it in my face if we get into a fight. I've done everything I can to make it up and earn his forgiveness. Things have been great since we found out I was pregnant. It's just funny he was so angry at me for simple TALKING TO SOMEONE. Who I was with and also good friends with for 4 years after breaking his heart. But he fucks around on me. It's just nudes. Several.

I was the one who initiated and decided to become closer. He was very receptive though and it meant a lot to him. He began initiating more. I made a lot of promises to him like that we would hang out a lot  during the summer before he went abroad and that we would stay close, these were all my ideas.

I changed my mind over the summer and we hung out a few times but, nowhere near as much. He tried to take me up on my offer but I didn't want to see him as much anymore .He asked me if I no longer wanted to talk to him and he said that if that was the case he promised would leave me alone. I gave him fake excuses but he caught on so I insisted but he saw through it and blocked me for a few weeks. He unblocked me and we hung out one last time before he went abroad.

When he was abroad we kept in contact and I was supposed to visit him. I was serious about visiting but due to circumstances I cancelled but he was understanding. The last few weeks before he came home I constantly checked up on him and told him he could call me anytime and that we needed to hang out once he was back. I didn't mean it I just was trying to make him feel good.

When he came back he took me up on my offer and tried to call me but I didn't answer even though I was posting on facebook 20 times a day. I told him I was busy with work training and promised I would call him in a few days. I responded to his texts but I was very slow. He finally messaged me asking if I was still down to call him. I didn't respond but he sent me another text 10 hours later telling me to admit that I didn't want to talk to him. I insisted that I did but he called me a liar. So I gave in and called him but I told him I cared about him a lot.

A few weeks later I told him I was moving and he asked to see me before I left. I told him I would love to see him before I moved. I had a miscarriage so I cancelled and told him I would stay at home until I was healed. I was telling the truth about the miscarriage but lied about staying home. He was supportive until he saw my snapchat at my family's campground. He accused me of lying and I explained I didn't mind them seeing the bleeding but I was uncomfortable with him seeing it. He called me a liar again so I told him not to speak to me anymore and told him I couldn't believe what he accused me of. He agreed to leave me alone.

891,"I was working today in the hospital reception entrance checking people's temperatures and I had my phone on charging in the corner of the entrance. For about 5 minutes I left the reception room and went outside for some fresh air taking my phone together but left the charger in the socket. The reception walls are made of glass so I see how many people are in the reception. I come back and I see this Dr at the same corner where my charger is plugged in the socket, but except my charger has disappeared. I got all confused asking if you have seen it, because there's no way I have taken it with myself. I know I'm not getting crazy and I left it there just 5 minutes ago. I was 100% convinced she took it, as she had her big bag near and she literally was the only person in the reception and who also went to that particular corner where my charger was. Nobody ever goes to that corner. It's a relatively expensive Apple power adapter which costs about 30$. 

I said, show me your bag, and this doctor replies to me, you are disgusting and this is a disgusting treatment by this hospital.... I said we will check the cameras then. She didn't say anything and she walked off quickly for her taxi from reception. Can you imagine? I just accused her of stealing and she didn't escalate this and walked out... 

&amp;#x200B;

We did check the cameras, and basically the wheelchair was blocking the precise action of her taking my charger and putting it in the bag, but it's obvious that once she came to the corner where my charger was, when she left for taxi, the charger disappeared. I don't understand these people. They earn like 100k in a year and they steal stuff and I earn like 4 times less. Apparently, I might even get a complaint that I accused her of stealing. Bitch, you just stole my charger, I don't give a fuck who you are and I should have slammed you to the ground if I wanted to get my charger back. 

I'm normally a quiet guy who tries not to get myself into trouble but this really triggered me. I spoke with my manager at the end of my shift and she suggested that I report it first, in case this Dr decides to report me of trying to accuse her of stealing. Luckily it's weekend now free of work, because if I had to work the next day tomorrow and I saw her face, I would act very impulsively and call her out. I just really wanna call her a fucking thief and call her disgusting when she comes to the entrance again. Probably not a good idea. I was given a new charger by one of the guys who checked the camera, saying that patients leave chargers all the time. This makes it seem like a not big deal, but imagine if this Dr possibly stealing other stuff then...

I live with two roommates (one being landlord) who are hardcore nationalist types and intolerant as hell. I didn't know at first (otherwise I would not have moved here) because they were normal the first few months.      
  
Around last week, I found out that the landlord used me as an excuse to reject a possible tenant who described themselves as trans. Explaining to them that they cannot live here because ""my tenants do not want to live with 'other identities'"". I was outraged. Because that didn't reflect **my** beliefs but her own (btw it is illegal here to reject a tenant on the grounds of discrimination). She never asked if I was ok with it and she even ""knows"" that I am part of the LGBT community.      
  
  
I'm worried because I myself am pretty active in LGBT groups. My career is based around working with vulnerable groups, including members of the LGBT community.  
  
I did talk to her and say I am willing to live with ***anyone*** and to never use me like that again. She apologized but now she and the other roommate have been more explicit about their distaste for anyone who is not White/East Asian, straight, cis around me--a southeast Asian queer woman. They've started poking fun at me being accepting of LGBT people and other races.           
  
I'm so fed up with this and the general feeling that I cannot be myself in my own damn home. I myself am queer and when I tried to mention any interest in women they would immediately shut up and give me this look of just plain disgust and anger--a look I have not seen since being disowned by my parents. I really want to move but between COVID and not being able to find a stable job, it's impossible to move out. Being kicked out/treated poorly by my landlord/roommate is another worry. Lastly, I can't trust if my landlord is keeping her word about using me as an excuse to be intolerant towards others.

TL;DR / I need advice on two things:  
  

1) How do I ensure my landlord is not using me as an excuse to discriminate against possible tenants? Or otherwise protect myself from being associated as being some secret anti-LGBT/racist if it does continue to happen.   
  

2) How can I cope? I haven't felt this *small* and unlike myself since I was living with my racist and homophobic parents.

He ended up finding out he was most likely going to be moving away for work and I’m still in school in our home city, so he ended it and said that it’s way too painful to just keep doing long distance when there’s no end in sight. After that we had no communication for a few months and during that time, he liked all of my posts on social media. 

Then a few months later, I reached out and asked him if we could meet up and talk about things because it was so sudden and he didn’t really give me the chance to talk about it, and he agreed. He told me that he knows at another time we would be perfect, we just didn’t work right now and that he still loves me more than anyone else in this world. He then said that he doesn’t think I can be in his life because there’s no chance of either of us moving on if we’re still in contact and that was the end of the convo. After that he stopped liking my posts for about 6 months and then randomly started again around the time of what would have been our anniversary. 

He continuously liked them for months and then randomly messaged me when Covid hit asking about my school and if I’m being sent home. It was a really short convo and he ended it by saying “It was really nice to talk to you again, I hope everything works out with school!” I thought maybe he reached out because he found out he would be moving back home or something and he wanted to try things again. I was hoping he would maybe message me again, but after that conversation he stopped liking all of my posts again and I just found out he just got a new job temporarily in the city he went to school in, so he’s not moving back, at least not right now.

She said some inappropriate stuff about her friends like about how she has sexual thoughts about her friends and she asked me if I ever did, specifically one male friend in particular. I said yes, because, well, everyone's mind wanders sometimes. It escalated from here.

She asked if I was a virgin, how much I masturbate, and if I've ever ""tasted myself"", which is a sick thing to ask somebody. I never answered any of these as they made me uncomfortable.

She came forward saying she wasn't 16, and that she was actually 22. This sickened me. A 22 year old getting really graphic with sex and masturbation with a minor? I confronted her and she said ""I said nothing illegal"". WTF?

Just wanted to know if this actually was illegal or not.",31Jul2020,1

908,"TW!!!! (nsfw)
I’ve heard a lot of people say that it is normal for kids to explore each other’s bodies at a young age out of curiosity (Not sure if this is correct or not). 
My sister and I (also female) are 2 years apart and shared a room for a long time. When I was around 6 or so she was starting to explore herself and commented on how it felt and encouraged me to try as well. This mutual masturbation went on for a couple years where she would pressure me into playing games that involved touching each other and talking about sexual things. I can still remember the games pretty vividly and I feel extremely guilty about them. We never went very far but it definitely felt like it went beyond curiosity. Sometimes when my cousin would visit, she would also get involved with the games (she is my age). Sometimes I wonder if she took advantage of my vulnerability at that age or if I was the one who kept things going. There were times we would agree to stop but always went back. 
None of us have brought this up ever as we are all in our 20s now. 
Should I be concerned about this? I feel like it may have impacted my sex life and sexuality today as I am extremely submissive and am struggling with my sexuality. Would it be worth getting therapy over?",31Jul2020,1
909,"I’ve asked my friends for help and I just still feel like I’m drowning. For reference I’m a 20 year old girl and I guess I just get attached too easily and this whole event happened in over a span of a week. I play (or played, don’t plan to play this game ever again) league and this guy, who’s 21, had added me. We talked and played games and I added him on discord. Thought nothing of it, didn’t talk for a bit, and then we played more games and then I started to really talk to him on discord. Things moved quickly because I felt like we really clicked as friends and I told him a lot of personal things and he told me a lot of things. I don’t know what his intentions were really but we would talk all day everyday and then near the end, same with calling. I even deadass slept on discord with this guy. He said he cared about me and felt like he always had a need to talk to me and that he really liked talking to me. We didn’t know what either person looked like at that moment and this is where it all went down hill. We were on call and he had already sent me a picture of what he looked like. I didn’t want to send him me because I knew he would stop speaking to me when he saw what I looked like because I’m not the prettiest by far. I argued that I didn’t want to show him because I didn’t want him to stop talking to me. He said he would never do that. Anyhow, I sent him what I looked like and his whole attitude changed, okay I’m not his type. Then he suddenly said his internet stopped working but I knew it was a whole lie. I asked him if we were good and still friends and if he still cared about me and wanted to talk to me. He said yes, we are friends, and that he was sleepy and went to sleep. When I woke up though, I saw that he had blocked me and unadded me on everything. I cried, I was so attached to this guy I barely knew for a week and legit argued with him just a few hours prior over me not wanting him caring about me just for him to have lied and and after hours upon hours of speaking always, it was just quiet. I’m a lonely person and don’t have many friends and this guy made me felt cared for and that I actually had someone to talk to whenever I needed to. He always told me he would messaged me when he woke up or after work and told me to do the same thing. It’s made me hate myself and feel disgusted with myself because I know if I had been prettier, he wouldn’t of done this. I haven’t eaten in a while and don’t plan on it any time soon. He made me stop thinking about this other guy who I was involved with a few months ago irl and he made me feel safe and cared for, all for it to be lie. I wanted to know why he would do this so I messaged him on an alt twitter acc and he didn’t respond at all so I don’t think he’s going to to give me an answer as to why he lied or why he did this. I’m hurt and I know this is a whole dumb situation but now I don’t know what to do. The fact he couldn’t clearly give me an answer on why he did this. I really hate myself right now and I don’t know if I can ever get over this self hatred. Now I don’t want to ever play League of Legends anymore which I used to really enjoy. I never want to speak to anyone anymore. I was already very reluctant to speak to people but he started to change that and then just made it worse and made me more scared of people than I already was. I don’t think I can ever get over how much I hate myself. I’ve lost all appetite and don’t even want to eat anymore. I feel so alone now, after spending hours upon hours and my whole day speaking to this guy just for nothing. I don’t understand how someone could do that but maybe it was for the best to realize I have no self worth the way I am. So what should I do to try and move on? I don’t want friends anymore and I feel like I’m going back to a depressive state I haven’t been in in a while because all I want to do is sleep so I can never eat.",31Jul2020,1

915,"Hello there... i am a 15 yo male and i have done (a bit to much)  shamefull things in my past... i did these things when i was 14.

Underage anime
So i made ALOT of sexual jokes of underage anime girl whit a 30 yo guy. and once made a picture of a sexual anime girl in bdm my server icon. I have come across sexual stuff several times but always by accidant. I was more interested into studieng if it was legal.

Some more serious stuff
I have also came across 2 pictures of nude children by accident. I reported it and revisited it a few times to see if it got deleted. I looked up ""cp"" pn goohle whit the knowledge it wouldnt show anything and it didnt. I thought i was a pedophile so i looked ad pictures of prebubescent kids (non pornographic) to see if it was true. It wasnt luckily. I looked up things like centaur porn or weird rule 34 things like steven universe more as a joke.

Sexual chats
I have had several sexual roleplays back when i was 14 whit a 19 yo guy about me being a 4 yo old girl who out of the blue got a body of a 16 year old and abusing the fact poeple still think she is a child. I also accidentally made sexual jokes like randomly sayiny ""Bestiality"" or randomly saying ""penis"" or as a joke saying that a transgender couple have reverse roles in sex whit a 11-12 yo i didnt know she was so young.

Pedos?
I was on a group called amino, i met an 11 yo when i was 13 and had a non sexual relationship whit him for like 11 days. I was also alot on omegle and questioned if i shouls have masturbated there, because one time i came across a 13 yo who claimed to have a (to big for his age) dick and wanted to exchange nude photos. I said no. I also met a 15 yo syrian boy online but it felt weird, he said he lived in a warzone and wanted to see my nudes, he also asked me if i want to see him cut himself. I also met a 12-13 yo who i jokingly told my dad somethimes masturbates while we see him.

Real life
So.. these things have all been online but i also have done some things in RL. I once squeezed my sisses butt back when i was around 8 yo (she once blackmailed me when i was 4 to dance dance infront of my hairdresser). Im part of a scouting group for 11-15 year olds. Once whe where dropped of and 11-13 yo's where talking about whores i said sarcasticly ""i am a whore"". Another time they made jokes about bdsm and sarcasticly told a 12-13 yo ""i thought this was scouting not group rape. And once my 13 yo friends was rubbing her melons out of the blue, i told her not to do it and she did it again as a joke.

I stay in my room mainly since I have a bathroom in there so I rarely leave. I cook upstairs after work and clean up. If I don’t clean that night I do it the next day immediately since I work evening shift and don’t want to keep her up by doing dishes and cleaning at 2 am.
It’s getting bad though. No matter how calmly I talk to her or explain to her things, she yells. She blames me for stuff other people do. Me cleaning my own mess is never good enough. Seems like she expects me to clean and do dishes as soon as I’m done cooking. I can’t even sit to enjoy my meal after working all day.

Today 30 minutes before I leave for work she comes down to yell at me for 1 pot in the sink and 4 spices sitting out that I forgot the night before. I apologized and said give me a moment to finish in the bathroom and I’d come talk to her. She didn’t want to. She continued yelled. I continued to ask to wait since it was hard talking through 2 doors. She leaves.
Moments later she’s back screaming again as I’m trying to change. This time she says I can’t use the kitchen anymore. I tell her we’re both adults and to just talk to me instead of screaming. We can work it out but nope, still screams.
I have a panic attack and have to drive myself to work in terrible shape.
She doesn’t care. No one seems to care about how I feel in all of this.
I help out at home. I work full time. I’m saving to move out. She doesn’t pay for my food or have to cook or clean for me. I do it all. I don’t get what I’m doing wrong.

921,"I’m 25 and my girlfriend is 24, we’ve been together since high school and I truly do believe I’m going to marry her one day, when we’re both ready ofcourse, I love her with everything in me. We’ve been having a reoccurring issue with my neighbor/female friend for a long time now. My gf seems to think my female friend likes me because of how often this female friend calls or wants me at her place. My gf and my friend both hate eachother and want nothing to do with eachother, but I still love and care for both of them and feel like I’m in the middle. My girlfriend even accused me of having sex with this girl and still to this day believes that but I still enjoy hanging out with my friend. I can admit, to hang out with my friend I started doing things like lying to my gf about me going to my female friends house or turning my phone off so my girl can’t call me while I’m at her house. I know it’s shady but I just wanted to keep the peace. I admitted to my girlfriend that I lied the other night about being at my friends house and did in fact go to see her, and that I was sorry for lying. She was legit upset and crying all day, saying she couldn’t believe that I lied to her so easily, and that she doesn’t trust me because I was able to lie to her directly to her face with no remorse. She starts throwing jabs, telling me I’m a bitch, and that she can’t even look at me as a real man because “if you can’t be real and you have to lie to people as a grown man, you’re a bitch.” Hours go by, and she’s still upset and still throwing insults. I finally say fuck you to her and go to sit on the couch, she immediately got up and goes “fuck me? after what YOU did?” and runs over to me and starts punching me in the shoulder, and the chest. I grab her fists and hold her down and she starts crying telling me she hates me. She’s never put her hands on me before and it’s shocking..She says she feels like I put our relationship at risk over this other female by destroying our trust and lying to her face about it. She now thinks something is going on with this other girl even more now that I lied about it... She’s telling me that she’s done being nice and that at this point I need to choose between her and my female friend and that she isn’t staying with me if I can’t stop talking to my female friend..

926,"Note: I posted this a few days ago (not on a throwaway acct) and I would like some more opinions. I added some more details. Thank you to the person who responded to my other post, it was greatly appreciated.

So my family and I (25F) have supported my aunt, uncle, and cousin ever since I can remember (at least if not close to 20 years). We have constantly footed the bill, lent them money, lent them things, bought them groceries, picked them up and dropped them off, etc. And yes I do realize my family (particularly my grandmother) was enabling them.

My uncle is the sole breadwinner but refuses to use his income to support the family (I know, it’s baffling). He forces my cousin to homeschool which means my aunt has to stay home and watch her. My aunt is complacent in all this and just does whatever my uncle wants or goes along with his ideas and decisions. She REALIZES there’s a problem and she can but refuses to leave. She has never taken responsibility for her actions or her decisions and does not try to change their situation. All three of them think that the things we do for them we should be doing/are supposed to be doing. 

As soon as I was old enough, driving them around suddenly became my responsibility. I started in high school and did that for at least 5 years. The thing is they have a car (they actually have 2 but one is broken and her husband has yet to fix it and my aunt doesn’t do anything about it). And yet whenever my aunt’s church needs her or to go somewhere on their behalf, she’s there immediately. I don’t understand why she can’t give us the same courtesy. I typically wouldn’t mind doing that for anyone, but I feel like I’ve been taken advantage of. 

They aren’t responsible with finances and ended up moving in with us for a year and a half (originally it was supposed to be for a couple months). While they did pay ‘rent,’ they weren’t consistent. I.e. for the first couple months they have us the full amount. And then it decreased and then the last few months they ended up not paying anything. It’s not a money issue it’s a responsibility issue. 

Whenever we ask them for help, they make it very clear that they don’t want to help us. 

Recently, after they’ve moved out in 2017, I’ve noticed that my aunt and cousin have begun to make snide, mocking and rude comments, especially towards my parents. It’s hurtful, unnecessary, and makes me quite sad that they would treat family like this, especially since we didn’t do anything to warrant it. So for example, we’ll were having a conversation and my aunt ran over and started calling my mom stupid and dumb out of the blue. We were at a restaurant when  my mom spilled hot tea on her hand and my cousin said, and I quote, ‘yeah, feel the burn.’ It took all my self control not to slap her across the face.

I finally got to the point where I just couldn’t/and didn’t want to do it anymore. I didn’t say anything but my attitude made it clear. But I can’t help feeling guilty for not helping them because I have the resources and I’m capable of helping them. My cousin has said that she feels like a burden and I want to apologize because it wasn’t my intention to make her feel that way, if it was my fault. I don’t want her to carry that with her the rest of her life. I’m not sure how to go about it without her taking things the wrong way (she has a habit of taking things the wrong way and out of context and taking things personally). Any suggestions? 

Thanks for reading. 

TL;DR family has supported ungrateful aunt, uncle and cousin all their lives. All three of them think that the things we do for them we should be doing/are supposed to be doing. I ended up with the responsibility of chauffeuring them around and I got to the point when I just couldn’t do it anymore. Feeling guilty that I don’t want do things for them anymore even though I can/have the resources. Cousin has said she feels like a burden. Would like to apologize if it was my fault, but don’t know how to go about it if without her taking it the wrong way or too personally (she has a habit of doing that). Any suggestions?",31Jul2020,1
929,"I just lost a really good online friend (let's call him A) that I've had for 5 years, we talked and played almost everyday, for a while, he was my only friend, then he stopped talking to me for half a year and tried to reach out to me once 2 months ago. He asked if I wanted to play a game with him, everything went fine, we sent each other a few messages over the coming days following that but he went radio silent again afterwards, then out of the blue unfriended me on all platforms.

931,"My partner and I are in our late twenties and we've been wanting to start our family for awhile now (we've been together for 10 years and it's always been a goal) but have kept putting it off for financial reasons. We grew up in Florida, moved to Seattle and lived there for 4 years, then recently moved back to the east coast into my uncle's old house to renovate it in exchange for free rent. That's allowed us to save up a little bit, and within the next year or so, we want to move somewhere and get pregnant. That's the ideal. Only thing is, we don't know where.

**Here is what we're looking for:**

1. **Affordable**. I'd define this by: finding a decent 3 bedroom house for under $250k is possible.
2. **Mild climate that will be bearable in 100 years**. I mean, I know we don't \*know\* what's going to happen, but it's projected that any place with ""extreme"" anything already is on track to be even more extreme and eventually uninhabitable. I really want to leave property behind for my decedents so that have a spot on earth, whatever happens. This sort of rules out much of the south, and a lot of coastal cities that get hurricanes. Something that sort of fits under the ""mild climate"" thing is a lack of humidity. I think I did my time in Florida, and I'm done. I hate it. I'd also like to retire from dealing with a ton of mosquitos.
3. **Access to hospitals and basic amenities**. I don't mind a small town, but I don't want to live so so rural that I have to travel an hour or so to find medical care or a grocery store.
4. **At least somewhat progressive state laws**. Mainly I'd want a state that allows for insurance to cover home birth's and an area that my gay mom could live openly without getting weirdness from the locals. I mean, I know this can happen anywhere, but you know what I mean. Oh, and not going to prison for smoking weed would be cool as well.

And I won't make this a point because beautiful is subjective, but....I love some beautiful scenery. That was my favorite part of living in PNW.

So far we've found Sequim, WA as an option. It's not super cheap, but certainly cheaper than Seattle, and is the only part of the area that doesn't get a ton of rain (I have an allergy to the mold that grows in the dirt from rainfall). 

Of course, any part of Northern California would be great....if any part of of Northern California was affordable. 

We love Asheville, NC, but it's a red state with some restrictions on home births and some rather extreme weather events, even though the temperatures are mild. Oh, and mosquitos.

Vermont is interesting, but very rural and very cold. We don't have a lot of experience with that much snow, so the idea freaks us out a bit. But it's not ruled out.

And I've looked at a lot of data and have learned as much as I can about places from my laptop, but nothing really replaces first-hand experience.

Btw I haven't been diagnosed, but I did go to a psychologist/social worker to talk about my issues and stuff. I'm 18 and still in highschool of that's relevant.

933,"So I like to occasionally borrow my mom's jewelry, she's got quite a lot and is happy to share, and I've never broken or caused any damage to anything before today. Today was no different, I was really tired and I was wearing her citrine necklace for positive energy, but at some point I crashed on my bed due to lack of sleep (I struggle with nightmares that make me thrash around and wake up a lot). Which is of course why I suddenly fell of my bed into the small space between it and the wall. In my panic to catch myself I didn't realize my ring I always wear was stuck on the necklace and as I reached out I ripped it. I've collected the necklace and what fell off, apologized, and told her what happened. Is there anything else I can do? I feel horrible.",31Jul2020,1
934,"In most cases I'm the one who texts first, I'm the one who reaches out. I don't have much of a life, and I enjoy talking to the people I care about. Lately, I've been thinking that I should just give people space, and let them text me when *they* want to talk, instead of only when I reach out. I know people have lives, and some people just aren't the type to reach out first, but it just gets exhausting thinking that nobody thinks of you outside of a conversation you start. I'm the type of person to think about people, and think to myself, ""Huh, I wish I were talking to them right now."", and so I reach out. It kind of feels as though, even if I know they care (I know they do.), I'm not somebody they think about enough to reach out to and talk more than once a month. 

Part of me knows it's selfish to withhold reaching out and sharing things I'm excited about, just so other people reach out first. I just want to feel appreciated, part of me also wants to know how long it'll take people to reach out to me, that way I know how long it takes before they actually want to talk to me. I'm just exhausted of feeling like a bother every single time I say Hi to somebody.",31Jul2020,2

936,"So, a little backstory of sorts: My boyfriend (almost 21) and I (19) have been dating for over a year and a half, and have known each other for about 2 years. We got to meet up for the first time last year in August, and about a month after I got a new job where it was harder for me to get time off so I couldn't go and see my boyfriend (didn't really occur to me back then that he could have come up and visited while I was still working and I feel really stupid for not thinking about it). Back in April, we had made plans for him to fly up to visit for a week, but with everything going on we had to cancel due to his family not knowing if they'd be able to get him to the airport (he doesn't have a car or license and he lives about 30-45 minutes from his state's capital and where the airport is). Ok, onto my main issue.

My parents have always been overbearing and strict with me, my dad more so than my mom. I lost my job at the beginning of July and have been looking for a job ever since, but even before that, I was planning on driving to see my boyfriend. My cousin (who is the same age as me, we were born a few weeks apart and have grown up together and we're really close and good friends) just left for a road trip across the country with his buddies and I asked for road trip and packing advice. So, I have a gas stop list with addresses, a route picked out, extra stops listed out, a packing list, and I know how much money I'd roughly need for gas and my boyfriend has even offered to pay for the gas for when I make the drive home.

Here's the crappy part. After I lost my job and I was talking to my mom about it and what I should do, I told her that I wanted to visit my boyfriend since I have no commitments and I haven't seen him in a year. My mom was immediately against it and told me that I need to get a job and after I get one I could think about going to see him a few months after I get a job. This doesn't make sense to me because at the time I had the flight credits from the canceled flight back in April (forgot to mention that I paid for it because I live in Washington state and the minimum wage for people over the age of 18 is $13.50 per hour) and I had nothing else going on and I could fill out job applications while I was there. But I'm also terrified of telling my dad. He's very hard on me and I've suffered emotional abuse from him my entire life, but I believe he doesn't even realize it's a thing and is just a crappy dad. About a week or two ago, he and I got into a really bad fight because I ""don't do anything in this house and you just sit in your room all day on your computer"". I was filling out online job applications and talking to my boyfriend, but muted my mic when he came in and he didn't know about it until a bit later. My dad has access to my bank account and has threatened many times to drain my account and has threatened to kick me out. I'm terrified that if I tell my parents too soon and they don't let me go then I'll be homeless and broke. It also doesn't help that my car is under my parents' names (I had to pay for half of it, though, because I had totaled my first car a few months before and since it's the second car they've got for me I had to pay for half of the price which I was ok with). I'm terrified that they'll report my car as stolen or me as a runaway and I don't know what to do or how to confront them about my plans.

I've just been stressed and depressed because I loved the job that I lost, but I've just been feeling so trapped and in need of a change of scenery and some time away from home. I've never been out of my state by myself and I think it'll be fun for me and good for my mental health. Plus I want to meet my boyfriend's family and spend time with him. I just need help figuring out how to tell my parents without them kicking me out. Just thinking about what they'll say gives me really bad anxiety, I just need some help at this point.",31Jul2020,1

The few times I've confronted people about it, it's done little to calm the fear, I dont believe whatever it is they say to try and convince me and I end up back at square 1.

I'm getting pretty low and desperate at this point as I'm noticing myself feel alot more cautious around people so I dont get too attached for when they inevitably tell me they don't like me.

942,"I met a girl around three-ish months ago and she came across quite strong from the beginning. I'd heard of the person before I really met them and knew they had quite a close relationship with a guy and they spent a lot of time together.

They're very flirty with me, spent 90% of their time with me, falling asleep and watching films; that sort of thing. Things also were pretty heated on and off, as they are. It got to the point where they mentioned wanting to meet me and obviously I mentioned back that I wanted to meet them. 

The situation is they're now dating that person that I previously mentioned. It's sort of a reverse situation where everything they did with me, they're now doing with that person. We still talk a hell of a lot and spend a hell of a lot of time together.

The main reason I'm asking what I should do here is because I'm a bit stuck. The last relationship I was in with someone was a long term ex-girlfriend whom I was in love with. I'm now 26, having being in that relationship for about eight years so it's been a while since I've actually felt this way about someone, and it *did* sound like they felt a similar way, to the point where they're still making comments like *if my plans fall through I'd like to meet you* which obviously sounds like I'm being dragged a long.

The issue is they truly are a good person, and irregardless of feelings they are great to be around. I guess getting to the point, do I just confront them and ask what I am and stop talking to them based on their response, or do I wait it out. I'm sort of at that age now where I don't really like ending friendships if I don't have to, but this is honestly super difficult for me and given that my friends are quite aggressive in terms of their opinions, I wanted a more neutral outside opinion.

944,"Throwaway account.

The other night, someone tried to burn my dad's house down. He's only alive because his neighbor personally banged on his door, screaming for him. He's homeless now and most likely will have to stay at a shelter. The city is allowing him to stay in a hotel for about 3 days, but after that, he's on his own. My mother won't allow him to stay with us. He thinks some lady who's been harassing him (showing up at his house, smashing his windows, etc) for the past few months is behind the fire, but there's no way to prove it was her specifically at the moment, but he's pretty certain.  Yes, he's submitted a police report. 

Important things to note about the situation:

* My dad has both demonstrated and outright told me that he's not good with money, so I can't give him money directly.
* He's very poor and was already struggling financially even before the fire. He's been unemployed for a while now but does have skills as a handyman-ish. He doesn't have insurance.
* His other closest relatives are across the country and rarely talk to this side of the family anyway.
* His ""friends"" most likely won't let him stay with them for more than a few days, maximum.
* He lost quite a few things in the fire, but wouldn't tell me the specifics. He still has some clothes and important documents. 
* He technically doesn't own the house due to some family drama nonsense and muddy legal things.
* He's not an addict or drug dealer or anything, but the owner of the house (before he died a few years ago) was. The owner's next of kin technically own the house, but they're across the country and rarely talk to my father anyway. We know they've wanted him out of that house for a while.

I want to help him, but I'm not sure how, as the title says. I'm definitely going to buy him clothes and such, but what other essential things could I get him? Is there anything else I can do besides being emotional support?

I'm in the USA, if that changes anything.",31Jul2020,1

948,"Hi! So I’m 23 and 5 years ago I met someone I can’t get out of my head.. It was not only the biggest crush I’ve ever had but also the person I felt the most genuine love feeling for

He felt the same thing for me but we basically spent more than 2 years flirting like idiots and hoping the other one would make a move. I was too shy and not confident and he almost did but he’s not the cutest and I’m what people consider much prettier than average so all his friends told him to give it up because he’s look like an idiot asking me out (both him and his friends told me this story later on)

We were getting there but one of our friends in common wanted to have me so he lied to the both of us saying the other said shitty things about the others.. So he did get me and turned out to be violent..
I had to leave him after a couple of months because he was getting dangerous and the whole thing ruined me

I fell deeper than I ever thought I could and in the middle of my depression as I was clinging to anyone who could love me and fill the hole my ex had left I texted the first guy and we started dating.. I still remember our first kiss like it was yesterday and it was just magical

But myself being not the person he knew, always talking about my ex, clingy and depressed.. Him being in a shitty place with his family, college and anxiety it was doomed to fail

He told me he was not what I needed at the moment and that I had to stop accepting what was not good me

He didn’t have other relationships since then, I got with a guy for 2 years and have now been single for a while

But I still cannot get this guy out of my head.. I still feel vividly so much for him, more than all my exes even the one I thought I had a house with 

He worked on the roof at my work lately and didn’t come to say hi which made me feel sad.. but I also didn’t go because I was too shy.. They had helmets so I couldn’t recognize him but the boss told me one of them said he was my ex and that it was him but he didn’t come.. Just like I didn’t go out

Should I try one last time should I just let it go even though I can’t seem to do it? Even when I was with my most recent ex I’d think about him all the time and it feels so wrong that we didn’t end up together

But what a feeling it would be to have a full handle on all aspects of your digital life! Part of that is just getting rid of some digital “things” you don’t need I am sure haha

Yesterday I was parking my car in the lot which I rent from them, all the spots were taken because of contracted painters taking up spots except for one. I pulled into the only one and it was a tight fit Because the lot is behind a house

As soon as I turn off my car the painter comes to his car next to me and starts putting shit in his car and says to me, “nice parking job fucking retard”, I looked at him and said “what’s your problem?”, he then tells me there’s another spot down the lot with five feet of room, which afterwords I saw was just not true, I took the last spot

He then opened up his car and slam his door into my car and scratched my door, and then stared at me from his car, and I stared back because at this point I’m livid but trying to show restraint 

He then rolled his window down and said don’t fuck with me I’m fucking crazy I will fuck you up and then sped off.

968,"So I just found out that I am academically dismissed from my university for a whole year. These past couple semesters my gpa has really fallen and my mental health has really declined. I am hoping to appeal to be able to get back into college in the spring instead of next fall. 

I am on zoloft and it was working really well for me, I've been on it for about 3 years now. I was going to therapy but I stopped going and felt like I was in a place where I could function without it. I was actually doing really well except since like march of this year, I've just been super depressed and I've relapsed with self harm. I just don't think the medication is working. I really want to get back into school because I only have like a year left, I'm 24 and still in college so I feel like the longer I'm in school the more depressed about it I get. 

I guess my question is, I am going to talk to my doctor about my depression and changing my meds, but in order to get an appeal I need a note from a doctor or therapist explaining my circumstances. How would I go about doing that? What’s a good way to ask her for a letter? It's not like I talk to my doctor everyday about my depression so is their opinion valid? And also, I know it’s going to be super embarrassing bc I went to high school with her daughter and she is also the doctor that my parents see. Will she talk about this to them? I really don’t want anyone to know.",31Jul2020,1

970,"This is a long one sorry
My dad is 70 years old, high blood pressure, 40lb overweight but losing consistent weight the past couple months. I'm not worried about his baseline health, but he's in denial about aspects of covid, and refuses to go to a hospital (if he gets it) and instead will choose to self cure with Trumps advice. 

I fully believe he will die if he gets it and goes through with this shit. 

With that out of the way, I obviously don't want him to die. My bio mom died when I was 7, and he's practically broken his back caring for my sister and I.  

I don't know what I'll do emotionally and practically if he died. I had a liver transplant at 6mo and have life long medical needs thst need to be managed, plus my only savings is in gold. I'm 19 and only beginning to get used to being independent with appointments and work. I don't work rn but am interning at the airport hangar he works at to be a mechanic. 

If he's gone I won't have money to go to a school or have experience to work a good enough paying job. 

I have little connection to my stepmom and it'll probably all be gone if he dies, since she is with him on his idea of self curing.  My sister and I are close but she's working 5 hours away, and she is even less mentally stable with diagnosed manic depression. 

I have a car payment that I would get paid off in 2 years but that could last 5 or 7 without my dad's support.

973,"19 M here and younger brother to my 24 M brother. It's been already quite some months that my brother clearly shows aggressive signs of envy towards me, especially after that I tell my mum some new scientific and fascinating stuff I come across. In fact at the first flawed sign of my speech or reasoning he proceeds to try and debunk my ""smartass"" personality and states that I think to know too much so I shouldn't even talk. Today, for instance, I asked him politely to stop using the ""mocking laugh"" he does after that he proves me wrong in an argument (because that was shown to be the only thing he waits for) and he then proceeds to       accuse me of always feeling like everything is being done on purpose to harm me and that, once again, I shouldn't even talk.

989,"Please help, anybody have advice on being a loner?

So, I’ve been having my monthly depressed episode where I put myself down because I don’t have friends and I can’t make them to save my life (I’ve only had 2 in my lifetime and that was when I was a child/preteen).

I believe it’s a genuine problem and I wrote about it in more detail in my last post. 

I’m writing this because I’ve been searching for sources that could help me find the courage and motivation to not give up. So far, I’m lost. 

Every time I would encounter a video talking about not having friends or having problems fitting in, it’s more of a ‘you don’t need them’  ‘you’re on whole another level then them’ type of video. First off, I honestly don’t think of myself as being ‘better’ or they’re beneath me type. Second, it’s not a temporary problem in my case, it’s something I’ve struggled with my whole life.

Most of these people giving advice would mention how they recently lost their friends or they refuse to hang out with people to self reflect and improve themselves (which indicates that they can make friends).

I’m with myself EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Some days I’m just accustomed to being alone that it doesn’t bother me as much, but I have days where I wanted nothing more then to have someone make time for me because they wanted to. How am I suppose to improve when I’m by myself all the time? 

Sometimes it makes me not want to better myself. What’s the point when there’s nobody to share your success with. How can I see my self worth when I can’t even befriend anyone. Even if I were to have some sort of success, it will only attract opportunists. People can say they don’t need anyone as much as they want, but they WILL get lonely.

992,"So, for a while now I had noticed a change in his behaviour and his explanation was that he had got comfortable in the relationship and didn't feel the need to ""win me over"" each day, that was why he was spending less time with me. He claimed to be busy and productive and asked me to do the same instead of asking him to give me more time. His being away for longer durations wasn't suspicious but his total disinterest in me was. Yesterday I caught him and his excuse was that because I didn't believe him and thought he was capable of doing something behind my back, he just went ahead and did it to show me what it's like. He claims to be so hurt by my distrust that he went to the extent of doing something out of character.

Now he says if I leave him, I will be blamed for making him break his sobriety. He was an alcoholic for almost a decade and only sobered up this year. He has always maintained that I am the reason he could clean up his act for good.

I expected to be going to my local community College this coming semester and I was hoping to get a social life there. However due to a couple of things, mostly the corona, that has begun to appear impossible. So a couple of days ago I finally decided to sign back up to my online college.

997,"This has been an issue I’ve had my whole life. It arises within my family, but is most prominent with my romantic relationships. 

Currently I am having a real issue with my boyfriend. He has a tendency to say very hurtful things, things he claims he doesn’t mean, when he is angry. I find this very upsetting, naturally. Anyway we got into it last night and this morning I was still so angry. This morning he apologized but it just...wasn’t good enough?? I don’t know what to do. I couldn’t move past what had happened and I just kept rehashing it over and over again until I eventually just had to leave and go to my parents house because I couldn’t let it go. I just don’t know how to move on and go back to normal after an apology. All the awful things he said about me were still running through my head and I just couldn’t move past it even when he told me it was just said in the heat of the moment and he was truly sorry. Please note I am not looking for relationship advice so please don’t comment “break up with him”. If that’s part of more comprehensive advice I’ll hear it of course but this post is more about me than our relationship issues that I am well aware of. 

As I stated earlier this is an issue I have in my family as well. My sister and I are very close in age and shared a room for many years. As thus we tend to bicker as siblings do. But I find I have such a hard time moving past these arguments and when we fight, we often will go several weeks without speaking because I have such a hard time letting go. 

What can I do to fix this? I know holding a grudge is a terrible thing but I find that when I get an apology for something that really hurts me I just have this feeling that it’s...inadequate. I don’t know how to explain it. But I just feel like I’m not satisfied with an apology and I need to keep listing all the things the offending party did wrong and almost “force” them to acknowledge them. Maybe I want to feel like they can actually empathize with me? I know it’s wrong and I need help. Thanks in advance.",31Jul2020,1

1000,"Back in early February, my mother gifted airline tickets to return home (out of the country) in August for myself and small family (I have a 1 year old who hasn’t yet met most of my side of the family).

Due to the pandemic, I’ve been a little bit uneasy about traveling with my family with especially with multiple stops/connecting flights. In addition, my mother has been out of work due to Covid, and has been caring for my grandmother. I felt like the best option would be to try to get a refund so she could get the money back. 

I checked online for a refund, but that wasn’t an option so I decided to call a representative. The rep. I spoke to told me that the tickets were non-refundable, and gave me a few options. I told her that I would think about it and call back. I called back two days after and decided I should just be polite, and explain my situation. 

Three days ago, I talked to a different representative and explained everything. “Can’t do it, your ticket is non-refundable.” I asked if he thought a supervisor might be able to help, and he stated that he was a supervisor. I then said “So that’s it, a refund isn’t possible at all?” To which he said “no, only a travel credit.” I was honestly a bit frustrated so I took a pause and said “...ok, thanks for your help.” He said “no problem,” and I ended the call. 

My new plan was to check the flight status everyday in August in hopes that there was a flight change with either of the departing/connecting flights, which would qualify me for a refund. I tried to check about an hour ago, but it kept returning as not found, so I called back in. 

The agent told me that someone called twice, first stating that they would review the options, and then stating that they wanted to cancel the flight. I told him that I was the one that called, but I didn’t ask for a cancellation (My only guess is that the last rep I spoke to took my “ok, thanks” as a “go ahead and cancel” although I’m  not sure why he would think I would say that and not stick around to see it through, or even confirm that with me). 

Anyway the current rep told me someone did a cancellation, and I tried to explain to him. He said he could try to look for the flights again. He says, “you’re in luck I found them and I can rebook them for you, but if I do you can’t cancel again because that’s not fair to other passengers.” So now faced with the option of being stuck I just asked what my options are if I don’t rebook. He then says “I’m being confusing because I said I didn’t cancel, but now I’m inquiring about the travel credit.” To which I tell him I didn’t cancel because I wasn’t ready, but now I’m not comfortable taking tickets that I’ll be stuck with. I ended up just telling him thanks for helping and not to worry about rebooking. 

I suppose the possibility of a flight change may have been small, but I guess I’m a bit frustrated because I feel like what little option I had was taken away from me due to a mistake on their part, and I was made to feel like it was my wrongdoing. Am I overreacting to this, and what should I do?",31Jul2020,1

1002,"I (20m) got arrested in February and ended up moving back in with my parents after the eviction. I started living on my own to get away from their constant need to know where I was, who I was with, and what I was doing as an adult. They had a tracker in my car and would ask me about the places I went when I got home. I also did this so that I wouldn’t have to go to church anymore. When I was arrested (weed if you must know), I was on the local news; however, I didn’t tell anyone. My parents were angry that I didn’t call them as soon as it happened. They thought I owed that to them. I told them I’d handle the whole situation on my own and as adults, they need to respect that. They went and spent money on a lawyer I didn’t want (court appointed would’ve been fine for my case) and now they hold it over my head to pay them back. I had to go see a pretrial officer, so they made sure they went with me and tried to talk to the guy and sit in on the meeting as if I was under the age of 18. The officer wouldn’t let them sit in. I also had hair that I’d grown out for almost 2 years, and they pressured me into cutting it all off “for the judge.” I regret that the most honestly. If I can’t get justice just because I have long hair, then things are more fucked up than I thought. Next, they pressured me into talking to their pastor and in the weak mental state I was in, I did it and he started calling me to make sure I was reading my Bible, etc. I stopped going back to church realizing that shit wasn’t going to help me out of my depression. They urged me to keep going because everyone was praying for me and it’d be bad if I just stopped showing up. My parents think I got arrested because I moved out and they weren’t able to watch over me. My mom would call multiple times a day for no reason when I moved out, and when I didn’t pick up, she would threaten to come down to my apartment to make sure everything was okay. I say all this to demonstrate some of the reasons I sort of resent my parents, and I still let them tell me moving to a new city or doing things they wouldn’t do are irrational.

(Note these girls were never relationships more dating/talking stage)

I feel this has negatively affected my confidence and seeing this new girl has me worried of “when will she leave for someone else or loose feelings” and just feel like I can never get out of that dating circle.

The dates have been amazing however texting is slow suddenly 

Now we spent a lot of hours together on these dates so I know texting and you don’t want to over do it when it’s a new person AND I KNOW THIS however I cannot stop fearing the “when they going to up and leave” feeling because the texting is slower

How do I fix this, I hate being like this :(",31Jul2020,1

So I mentioned ""Ive never seen you eat before"" and she basically said its ok we can get snacks.
Shortly after that she mentions shes gonna go to the bathroom in the store when we get there. So we get there and she is in the bathroom for a short time, probably only around a minute/minute and a half.
We got snacks and she ate a few things here and there.

1023,"Hi everyone I’ve got a question:

I have one cat, she has nails, and stays in my room most of the time.

My roommate has 2 cats, she has declawed both of them, and they’re bold and roam the house frequently.

My cat only comes out really at night.

This morning, my roommate comes up to my door and asks me when the last time that I cut Kingman (my cats) nails and states that her cat’s eye is bleeding. I say that I haven’t cut them in a couple weeks (since she last scratched me and I noticed they were sharp) but I hadn’t been checking on them regularly since some other things were going on outside of our control. 

I am only assuming that Kingman did it because she said she did - and it seems like it could be the case - but there isn’t any definitive proof of this or if she did who provoked it, seeing as though her cats likely have more of a territorial span of the house (and she is able to defend herself). All in all, she just simply stated her cat had blood in her eye and assumed it was my cats nails. I told her to let me know what happened with the vet and what the bill ends up being. To which it is just about $200. 

I offered to split the bill in half with my roommate as I believe that she knows the risk of living with other animals, this wasn’t an attack from an animal that came over or lives outside of the house, her cats are 100% declawed and don’t have any way to protect themselves, and like I said there was no visual that my cat is responsible or who provoked what - just her assuming it was my cat. 

Do you believe I am responsible for the entirety of the bill? I don’t, but she believes I am. Thoughts? 
My cat will always have nails and her cats never will. I don’t know what else to do except maintain and trim them but do I need to keep my cat in my room only? What do you guys think?? Need help on how to proceed because she’s basically pinning me as the bad guy for not paying the whole thing.",31Jul2020,1

But then last week I was sending her a snap of me playing with my cat on my lap. After I sent it I realized that I was wearing sweatpants and you could pretty clearly see my bulge in the background of the cat playing with my hand. I realized this too late though because it already sent. I didn’t think much of it, But then after she just sent a hahaha and that was the sudden end to the text convo. After that texting her was just pretty one sided and she would end up leaving me on delivered for like over 24 hours before responding. (Shed even open my streaks but leave me on delivered) a few days later she came over to eat as our parents were friends, and she legit seemed like it was a struggle for her to be there, she was super dry, and looked kinda annoyed when she had to talk to me. At one point we were talking and the topic landed on the bible for some reason and she straight up basically said “oh yeah and reading the bible really helps you not be horny” while looking me straight in the eyes expressionless. Before all this happened she was super chill and looked like she enjoyed being around me but it looks like by accidentally sending a snap like that she probably thought I was one of “those guys” that try to entice girls that way. I’m definitely not one of those type of people lmao, and she was a super chill person before all this and I really don’t know what to do at this point.

1025,"I’m scared after decades of struggle, I’m reaching the final breaking point to end things.

I’ll be 40 in two years.

40.

I just got a new job after leaving a toxic one only to realize not only do I have no passion for it, it’s the complete opposite of who I am.

Working remote has also exhausted me and feel like I’m stuck in prison with Stockholm syndrome.

I’m single now after a break up I thought was the one. All I ever wanted since being a kid was a partner to spend life with and kids.

But it never seems to work out.

I pushed myself again to make friends and sort of have some and they got excited for a recent big hangout and all of them ghosted but two. One I may see again and the other most likely not. 

I have wanted a hug for weeks, someone, anyone to hug me, even just once while I can be honest and cry m.

I had a therapist and they turned out to be a fraud.

I don’t own anything because I took a risk in a creative career for so long that I gave up for what I thought was love years ago and thats on me.

My new jobs healthcare sucks so now I am without healthcare for two months scrambling to figure out what to do. 

I have no direction, heartbroken and two decades of various therapists, I don’t see the point anymore. 

And I see page after page of people on Reddit feeling the same and I think I’m reaching a final decision point and it scares me. 

I read about people who had enough, quit jobs, sold their things and go live simple. But worried that’s running away and the same problems and pain will be here as there.

I’m told how creative I am, what a genius I am and yet, for what? I’ve either pissed away my dreams years ago or don’t feel I have any dreams left. 

And don’t blame friends, who wants to be friends or date someone with all that. 

Even getting back up as I’ve done so, so, so many times, only to be beat back down, I’d rather just be gone now.

I feel like a fraud. Like all I do now is fight to convince myself life is worth living but it’s constant heartbreak and the only logical answer is I am the problem. 

It’s a roller coaster I don’t know how to stop anymore and I’m tired of it. 

This is nearly the fourth time I’ve had to start life completely over from scratch...

I don’t even know what I’m asking anymore...just coming up on 40 not that far away and scared.

What does one do when time and time again they lose everything? 

I’m tired of restarting again. 

I’d rather end the game now.",31Jul2020,1

1028,"So a few months ago I was having a conversation with one of my very closest friends. I had noticed that she didn’t eat much anymore and that she had become obsessed over how many calories she consumed, along with always wanting to exercise lots. She said that she tried to eat under 1200 calories a day. I tried to talk to her and convince her that it wasn’t right, but she insisted that there was no problem, and that she had “stopped feeling hungry” because she had gotten so used to it. She told me that when we hang out with all of our friends she wouldn’t eat for the whole day because she knows that we would be eating junk together. 

I had no idea what to do but I didn’t think it was that bad because she still ate breakfast lunch and dinner, and still had lots of energy. After a few weeks I thought the problem was over but kept it in the back of my mind. 

However, recently my friends and I have noticed that we rarely ever see her eat. She has become very thin and the other day we noticed self harm on her wrist. One week ago she went to the hospital because she felt very unwell and like she was going to pass out. The doctors diagnosed her with multiple deficiencies, and said that her heart rate was extremely low, and she was close to cardiac arrest. She has also not had her period in months. At school she eats a few bites of an apple and nothing else, after not eating breakfast and most likely eating just vegetables on their own for dinner. She no longer has any energy and when she goes to the gym with one of our other friends she just sits there the whole time, too tired to do anything. 

Yesterday we all went out to dinner and after not eating the entire day without eating, she ate probably a quarter of a chicken salad bowl, and a small froyo. 

She is aware that we notice things like this but gets upset when we bring them up, and I feel like she only eats so that we will think that she is fine. 

I am so worried about her and have absolutely no clue what to do, because her parents are oblivious and I am worried that if we tell them or a school counsellor that she will become even more depressed and do something bad. 

If anyone has any advice, please, please, please help. I’m happy to answer any questions if that helps.",31Jul2020,1

She got upset at me saying my only downfall is that I don't want to get married this is true, but I don't understand marriage, I really don't believe a ring tells you how much you love someone and I told her I love more than anything in the world.

1030,"I've been depressed. Like suicidal depressed. Mostly b/c my sertraline stopped working (antidepressants) and I've been in the process of tapering off of it and starting a new drug. 

I took my first mirtazapine (?) last night which lead to me sleeping right through to when I was supposed to leave for work today. I felt like shit when I woke up, and hadn't even eaten from the night before b/c I went straight to bed. So I called in sick. 

Which I've done too often recently. My manager messaged me like ""this is unacceptable etc"" so I said ""Due to my health I may need to hand my notice in"" and he said ""do you want to talk about this tomorrow"" and I made some vague ""I dont want to leave on bad terms"" comment which I sent just as his message came through, so I didnt read it before sending. 

I later on messaged back ""on second thoughts I would like to speak tomorrow about it"" and he was like yeah see u then. 

PS: The messages were much more polite and coherent than what I've just written here. 

So my question is what the fuck do I expect tomorrow? 

Do I tell him how depressed I've been and that its effected my work? And if so how do I say that without getting all emotional b/c I always cry when I talk about stuff like that even in professional settings. 

Also, I took 4 days off the week before last due to depression, but I told him it was b/c I was worried I had corona because I didn't think they'd believe me if I said I was depressed. Do I tell him the truth about this or stick to the virus thing? 

I've never mentioned this stuff to my work before, I've always just said ""im sick"" or said something about family. I'm scared they'd react badly if I told them I was depressed like my college tutors did.

1034,"Hello, hoping to find some advice on here about my situation.

I just moved into my new place a week ago and the property manager at my apartment complex just notified me a few days ago that there is a hot water leak. They've jackhammered into two units already unable to find the source. They just did mine today (Friday) and could not find it. They plan on bringing in a different plumbing company to see what they can find in my unit but it won't be until Monday.

Now here are my concerns. The kitchen is walled of with tarp but there's a layer of concrete dust on everything in the living room so idk what that tarp really did. I've managed to wipe a good amount off but it's hard to clean everything as they've moved all my stuff into the living room a lot of it stuffed into boxes. 

How dangerous is concrete dust in my situation?  It's a thin yet visible layer that I'm working on cleaning. They've offered to pay for a hotel and my meals if I'd like but I'd prefer to stay in my unit and go into the office while they continue to work during the day. My concern again is the dust.

Is there anything else I should do in this situation?  Anything concerning my lease and rent payments? They don't have a timeline for this and only said we will see what the other company finds. They'd have to put everything back together (they tore out the cabinets and countertops) which I anticipate will take at least a week.

TLDR: hot water leak somewhere and so jackhammered into my unit unable to find source. Dust is everywhere and I'm concerned about how hazardous it is even if mostly cleaned. Concerned about anything else I might be missing as well. Not eta on when things will be done.

Appreciate any advice you might have! 😁",31Jul2020,1

1036,"Context: I am 13, and live with my younger brother, my 2 older sisters and my mom and dad. We’re very fortunate, as we have a decent amount of money and don’t really have many problems to worry about. 

However, my eldest sister who is 17, is the most selfish person I know. I’ll list a couple of examples to show you how much of a bother she is.

1. She loves onions, but her breath and farts    are  terrible, and she is a very gassy person. She    sleeps with my other sister, who has complained multiple times about how bad their room smells, to the point where she can’t sleep some nights. My sister ignores her, and eats about 3 onions a day. 

2. She always takes other people’s stuff without asking, even if they have told her multiple times to not take it. Recently I made some stir fry to last a week, and put it in some containers. I told her multiple times to not touch my stir fry. You know what she does? Eats 2 of the 5 containers without leaving a trace. 

3. She always plays the victim when we get into fights. She recently took one of my limited edition mint condition figures, which I have made clear is very special to me and to not touch it, and she proceeds to take it out of the box and take pictures for her Snapchat friends. I gave out to her, and when our parents got involved she started crying about how I hit her when I literally didn’t touch her, and my parents decided to take away my friggin PlayStation because of that.

Anyways, enough about my sister. What I’m trying to ask is how do I talk to her about all this stuff? I’ve tried to taking to my parents about her but usually they just give out to her, and she does the stuff again and again. Even when I explained that to them, they took away her phone for 5 hours. To which during those hours she watched tv. So my parents are out of the question. 

Can someone please tell me if there is anyway to help with my situation and get her to stop doing those things? Any advice is appreciated, thanks so much.",31Jul2020,1
