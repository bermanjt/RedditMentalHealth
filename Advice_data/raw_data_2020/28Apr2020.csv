2,"So right now I'm an American and I'm with my girlfriend in Mexico. As you all know due to Covid 19 there's some caveats with life. For one Mexico has suspended issuing visitor visas, my girlfriend's family lives 100s of miles/kilometers south of the border. My visa is good until May 2020 so it's no issue returning to the USA/being in Mexico with her and my car has all the permits/insurance for Mexico and the USA. Chances are Mexico is going to prohibit non essential entry into the Country until August of 2020 at least. I have investment income.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my realistic options are as follows:

Option 1. In May of 2020 I leave Mexico and go back to my northern home state in the USA by driving home. Once at my home state, my family would pay for my trade school and I would gain certification in 4 to 8 weeks. I could then return to Mexico and see my girlfriend again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2. In May 2020, I cancel my visa and permits with Mexico and stay in Mexico's border zone. It's dangerous here but I could keep my head down and just play video games and be with my girlfriend. Once Covid 19 calms down I go to my home state and get certified.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3. is I try to renew my  permit by exiting to the USA then re entering Mexico and convincing Mexico officials I have a valid reason to go to the deep south of Mexico. Pretty much the same as option 2 minus being in the border zone. 

&amp;#x200B;

6,"Hi all!

I'm Mandie and I need some help. Currently, it is my junior year in high school and I'm doing a thing called running start so I'm currently just taking college classes at my local community college. However, I found out there isn't a way for me to receive my AA so I'm thinking of going back into high school. The only issue is that I am/was a cheerleader there. Honestly, the girls in my squad are just completely awful. And I had a really bad injury a majority of this year, so when I worked my butt off for our big final events, it really hurt when no one cared or notices. I have no friends on the team and when I try to talk to the other girls, they don't want to get to know me. Which is funny because this will be my third year on the team. So I've decided I do not want to continue cheering there. And while that doesn't seem big compared to others, I absolutely love cheering. And I've never loved another sport as much as I love cheer so letting go is really hard for me. I'm curious if I should switch high schools entirely, I want my senior year to be good and I know if I stay at the school I'm at, it's not going to be an enjoyable last year. But I don't know if the risk of it being worse is worth it. I could stay in running start. The upside is that I can work more and my job is amazing, I am so fortunate to have my dream job at such a young age, but I miss high school so much, just not the high school been at since 7th grade. I could try to stick it out another year, cheer, school, work, and all, but it just feels like I really need a fresh start and I don't know how else to get one. There's a school I've wanted to go to but their team has already had tryouts, so if I go there, I cant cheer. So I'm torn between a few options and I need advice

I could...

1. stay in running start and ignore high school entirely until graduation. The upside is I get to work more and I'm happiest at work. Plus id gets to go to the gym more which I've been wanting to do. The downside is that I really want to finish high school in high school and there's no sense of a community, or really a chance to meet new people my age.
2. Go to a different running start college. We have a university option available so the upside is that I could get some credits in and meet some new people. The downside is that lots of the girls from cheer go there and I don't really want to have to see any of them plus, it would mean I barely get a senior year, only graduation.
3. Go to an entirely new high school. The upside is that I can still work more hours because cheer isn't an option, I get to have my summer and go visit colleges in California, meet new people, go to the gym more and get the fresh start/change in scenery I've been really wanting. The downside is that I know no one and I'm worried the people will be worse and I don't know if I want to risk an even worse experience. On top of that, there's no possibility of cheering because they've already had tryouts.
4. Stay at my home school and not cheer. Honestly, this would SUCK suck but the thought of being in my safety blanket seems nice
5. Stay at my home school and cheer. The upside is the activity of cheering and some of the teachers there that I like. The downside is that id gets no summer, id still has to deal with the awful people, the same scenery (that's driving me crazy) and I would have to balance cheer, work, and school. I did that this year but honestly I've been really miserable about it all year.

One of the big things I should mention is that I have intentions of moving to California for college, so in about a year ill be 3 states away.

8,"I just turned 18. I can't remember my childhood so I don't know how they treated me back then. But right now my parents aren't bad to me at all. They are actually quite nice. They are pretty hands off with their parenting and we don't talk all that much, but when we do they don't insult me or anything. So why do I feel such resentment towards them (especially my dad). If they call out my name I instantly assume they are going to attack me so I get really defensive right away, but usually they'll be calling me for something really benign; like they'll just be calling me down for dinner or something.

9,"My family is currently living in NY, both hubs and I are working remotely full time and doing online school with the kids. We live in a small apartment that works for us but is cramped and has no yard or outdoor area for the kids. We have been given the opportunity to relocate about 12 hours away where we would pay less than half in rent but would have no job prospects once remote work is over.  We would be able to live approximately 4 months in the new place on savings but given the current job market I’m not sure if now is the best time to leave a job, even though I am ready to leave the company. The decision has to be made by Thursday as our lease is up in June and we must give 30 days notice if we’re not renewing. Unfortunately, our current landlord will not allow month to month rental so it’s either go now or wait another year and potentially lose the housing deal we currently have. Any advice is welcome!",28Apr2020,1
10,"I got my math degree from a pretty decently ranked public school last year. My plan was to go to graduate school right after college, but due to a lack of support from my family (actively discouraged me from pursuing a graduate education), depression (mental health issues in general) and a few not so great professors (one was reprimanded by the department), my grades fell (only in my major courses, so my GPA is lowest in my major), and I just sort of gave that up and decided I'd do something else.

Well, I've had time to think, and I don't really know what to do. I got into an MS program for applied math, but it's really expensive, and I don't know if it will open the doors I really want open (I'm not sure I'll be able to find a job in this field anyway, because PhD candidates will be far more impressive; I'm not competitive enough for a PhD program). I looked for jobs for just a BS candidate (even branching out well past my field), and job searching was a nightmare even before the corona virus for college grads with limited industry experience, but now it's impossible.

I have been contemplating going back to school and getting a computer science degree, but that would be pretty expensive, and I don't want to go further into debt. But at the same time, I know I'm not utilizing my full potential. I could try for an online MS in computer science, but that's also really expensive, and I can't concentrate on that where I'm currently living.

So my question is... what do I do? I'm sort of stuck. If I had the money, it's be an easy choice to just go back to school, but I wouldn't receive the scholarship I had the first time that paid my tuition. My family isn't great to talk to about this stuff, because I was the only one to go to college, and they just make suggestions that aren't practical, don't make sense, and aren't helpful.",28Apr2020,2
11,"Okay, so, this is something I've been thinking about recently and I guess I just wanted some input on whether or not this is a good idea. I realize there's many different routes I could take. I found a 70,000 dollar house, that actually looks pretty decent. Obviously I'd still fix it up, and put money into it. I'm considering buying, and I'm still living with my parents as of right now. It's a 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom house. I know a couple of guys at my work who were very serious about moving into a townhouse or something together and splitting the cost. What I was considering doing is possibly buying the house, staying at home, but renting it out to them for cheap(like maybe 350-400 a piece, and that would pretty much cover mortgage and most utilities I would think. They're doing me a favor as most of the house costs would be covered, and I'm doing them a favor by giving them a place to live for cheap. I would preferably take the extra money that gives me, and put it into fixing up the house. Anyone have any input on that idea?",28Apr2020,1

15,"Hey hi, I'm new to Reddit. I've literally never posted before so I hope I do the things right. Also apologize on how long this is, theirs just a lot of side things to incorporate. 

Okay so description, back in August me &amp; my boyfriend got a job together at a warehouse. The rules for working there I had to take my piercings, plugs, rings &amp; necklaces off. Which was fine, except for my one necklace. I had been wearing it for over a year (at the time) BUT was unable to take it off bc if I did I'd have to cut it off, so obviously for the job, I had too. I was quite sad, but my boyfriend said, ""well if you last a while without it, I'll buy you a new necklace "". Which was very sweet&amp; no one has ever boughten me jewelry of any kind before so I was very happy, excited even. 

Now fast track to the end of February begining of March. I had finally brought it up, he said "" Uh I don't remember ever saying that, but if I did I'll buy you a necklace then"". I was hurt that he forgot but whatever right, because now he knows. 

Now since then I've dropped some hits or made a joke about it? Idk what you would call it. But in one 'statement' I said, "" Hey can I ask one thing, when you do look for one please do not ask me if I like it or have me choose it. I will like it regardless I just really want you to pick it out 100% bc I want something you picked out"" 

*I'd also like to add, I'm a very VERY sentimental person. I literally have every birthday &amp; holiday card in a box since I was in the 3rd grade or so. Stuffed animals from various people &amp; even hand written notes from high school friends. VERY sentimental. (Also Yes he knows this) * 

Now let's fast forward to sometime last week, I had made a joke about it in conversation, no I can't remember how it went. But it led to a legit argument, not really a fight but whatever. Basically him saying, ""well the more you nag &amp; hound me about it the less I want to do it. But also the more I just want to so you stop asking me about it"" Which then I replied something like, ""okay but  I didn't for MONTHS, you then forgot you ever said it, &amp; Ive now reminded you &amp; you have put no effort in looking"" 

** also need to add my boyfriend is VERY into video games &amp; he just dropped money on a game, then about 2 days later had showed me a preview of a NEW game he's going to get next** 

Back to the above conversation, I had pointed out how it really hurt me that you can sit here and search these games up &amp; really look into them &amp; get them but when it comes to something like this no effort is shown. I also pointed out how we've been together for over a year &amp; have not reccived anything (aside from food, and like household items &amp; a book) from him. I get he's done a lot &amp; I appreciate him so much for everything he has done &amp; the dates etc. I also get that materialistic items shouldnt be important but like I've said I'm very sentimental so in some instances they are to me. I'm definitely not one of those ""buy me every expensive thing in the world"" Kind of girls either, obviously. Like I said before above &amp; to him, it could literally be $5 but if you put in the effort &amp; looked around and thought I'd like said one, I'd be happy. I've spent a lot on getting him things, (usually sentimental) like a picture of the stars from the day we started dating. Or a painting I did myself for him. (It wasn't very good looking but he liked it). Or 20+ cute pun cards I drew &amp; painted. along with random things I thought he liked while I was out &amp; some clothes. 

ANYWAYS point being, I'm very upset or hurt or something. I'm really not sure. I get this maybe something really small &amp; not important to some, but Im just not sure how to feel. Is it valid to be upset? Or am I just being over emotional about it? I feel weird even posting this but Im just not sure how to feel about it I guess?",28Apr2020,0

18,"I’m 14F and this boy is 15M but he’s going to be 16 soon. I’ve never met him irl. He basically commented on a post of mine in which he was trying to give me advice on how to move on from my crush. And I asked him to dm me so it would be easier. So yeah he gave me really useful advice on how to move on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn’t crushing on him but he sounded really nice and stuff. So, I told him what I felt about him. And he said that I can have his insta if I want to. And I agreed. So we both followed each other. We tried learning about each other. The next day, idk what happened to me but I blocked him. I kind of have some trust issues with people which is why I blocked him. I unblocked him after 4 hours. I told him why I blocked him and stuff. I think I probably made him really mad. I was actually acting really stupid. I then asked him if he wants to see my crush and he said he doesn’t care. He dmed me after a few hours that he’s going to block me. But, he didn’t.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days passed by and I asked him if he was mad at me. He wasn’t replying to anything I was dming him. I also apologized. I asked him out after only talking for few days. I know that was a really stupid decision. I didn’t have a crush on him. I honestly don’t know why I asked him out. He ofc rejected me since we barely knew each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

He then threatened to report me to the police. He believed I was lying about my age and almost everything. He thought I was an older guy who was trying to get ahold of him. But I honestly didn’t lie about anything. I tried to prove who I was by sending a pic of my online grade book registration. But he thought it was too easy to make. So I asked him if he wants to talk to my friend. And he agreed. My friend dmed him but she was too rude. She was really mad at him. So she kind of texted him some really stupid stuff. After that, he didn’t threaten to report me again. But, he said that he’ll report my friend bc she threatened to kick him in his nuts. Btw she wasn’t serious and also she can’t really do anything to him since we live in two different states.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I got dmed by several creeps on Reddit. So I never knew what to do. As a result, I always ended up dming him since he is a really good adviser. And he mostly ended up dming them and stuff. I dmed him about another creep yesterday who is 23. He said that he’ll dm the 23M and idrk what he dmed him. I sent him ss of the chats and of the post in which the creep found my account from. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, he asked me to stop dming him bc of personal reasons. So I texted him goodbye and I thanked him since he has helped me out several times. But, yesterday his post appeared on my reddit feed. The post was about me. He made up half the stuff on that post. His post was mostly about how I was suicidal and stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

I dmed him about it before I went to bed. He dmed me that he was sorry and he needed advice. He thought that I was going to commit suicide so he needed advice. Btw he thought that I was going to commit suicide bc of the ss of the post that I sent him. That post of mine was basically about how I want to give up. But, I also mentioned in that post that I’m not going to commit suicide since I’m not that courageous. Anyways I told him that he didn’t have to make those posts and he could’ve asked me instead. He said that he’ll kill himself if I commit suicide and that he is worried about me. He also said that I can talk to him whenever I want to. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I honestly don’t understand him. Why is he behaving like this? Does he have a crush on me or something? Or is he just playing with me?

22,"Hi guys! I am heavily addicted to cannabis and would like to stop to gain some control. Unfortunately, since i am at a gram of distillate a day habit, its not going to be easy to quit and the sleep element always becomes main issue for me. I just cant do without and it's the main factor in every relapse.

My question to you folks is has anyone taken sleeping pills for a short period of time specifically to combat cannabis withdrawals to get some sleep and then stopped with no problems ? Any rebound ?

So far i have tried promethazine and also melatonin. They are only mildly effective not very useful for me. My issue is that i have ADHD so already struggle with poor sleep architecture as it is. I cannot sleep through the night without waking up multiple times even with the cannabis and melatonin or antihistamines in my system. Tolerance to cannabis is a big factor too. I do not drink.

I need to be able to sleep reliably 3 times a week to allow me to get up at 6AM for my 12hr shift as a carer, so without sleep I could mess up and maybe make a meds error! The rest of the days i could just deal with i guess.

I am not open to taking benzos or kratom, however I am open to and can source ambien/zopiclone/prescription meds as well as herbal/natural options. 

And i just know it will be suggested, so ill say that ive worked hard at sleep hygeine for over a year now with small but disappointing results.

26,"I M(21) and my girlfriend F(20) have been having a ongoing dispute about our future. We both love each other and aside from this issue our relationship has been great.

It all started when we were discussing our future plans. I expressed my desire to move out of our current city to explore job opportunities and nicer scenery (we live in a boring Midwest state) 

Initially she said she’d go anywhere with me, months later she went back on her word saying she will never leave this state or the city we’re in. 

I’m confused on what to do, part of me loves her and wants a life with her, but I’ve seen firsthand the type of effect spending your whole life in one city can do to a person. 

My family loves her, and she seems like a safe and comfortable bet. However, recently my friends have been telling me while she’s great to me, I’d be doing myself a disservice to spend my life here (they’re aware of my goals to move somewhere more exciting)

I’m at a loss for what to do. I graduate college soon and the choices I make after that will play a huge roll in deciding my path.

32,Just saw a man kill himself. Im very shaken and have no one to talk about it with. What do i do?,28Apr2020,1
33,"A while ago, I (18f) met A (19m) when we both were exchange students in Canada, we became pretty close when he started to date a friend of mine (who I was also close with). Before they started their relationship, his gf and I made out a couple of times, but stopped when I started to have feelings for someone else and we decided to not to tell him bc it was our past and didn't mattered anymore.

When I came back to my home country, A and I started to get closer and closer, we would talk about literally everything, which made my then bf mad and my friendship with his gf weaker. 

Fast forward, my bf broke up with me (long distance relationship is kinda tough) and A was having problems with his gf, so we talked a lot about our feelings. He always asked me to keep what he was saying to myself and absolutely do not talk with his gf about it. However, he once told me that she wanted to open their relationship and how he didn't wanted to do it, but she kept threatening to break up with him and being mean saying he was ""selfish"" for not allowing her to be happy, so he felt forced to agree bc he wanted her to be happy and stay with him. 

I definitely got really mad at it, he was my best friend and she was being beyond toxic with this behavior, also in a couple of months they would be meeting each other (they also had a long distance relationship) and I didn't had the same chance with my ex, so I was kinda jealous of her for having this privilege and then acting like that. I called her out,  but he sayed it was ""none of a my business"", we fought, and I after apologize to him for what I did. I had a good intention, but it wasn't the right thing to do. After that, his gf started to act really strange towards me, I asked her about it and she said I was ""thinking too much"". 

At the end of last year, she went to his country to meet him and then everything changed. At first, he wouldn't text me soo frequently as he used to, what I thought was normal bc they were enjoying each other. After a while he would spent weeks without texting me what really got me worried, but then he appeared and everything seemed okay, until he asked me to not to tell anyone he was texting me and if anyone ""asked for proves"" I should delete our texts and say he didn't talked to me. I asked him why and after telling me a bunch of lies (that I knew was bs) he said I needed to wait a little bit, bc he couldn't tell the truth right away. I agreed and then he disappeared. After a month or so I tried to text him and noticed he had blocked me, then I waited his gf to go back to her country and texted him on ig asking what was going on. After weeks he texted me back saying we couldn't be friends anymore, bc whenever he tried to help me with my problems I would be mean and hurt him with my actions, he was tired of me and just couldn't handle it anymore. 

I felt like crap, it is true that I'm stubborn and would disagree with him sometimes, but I never thought he felt that way bc he never gave any hints he was somehow uncomfortable or hurt with my behavior. I apologized to him, bc I never meant to make him feel bad, he was my best friend and I truly cared and loved him. Since that, he didn't replied me. His gf, however, texted me saying we ""weren't friends anymore"" when I asked her to hang out with me and our group of friends, what also made me feel like crap bc I didn't know what I did to make her feel this way. 

I talked to a friend of mine after that, and she pointed out how A normally tries to hurt and put people away when he's really bad and down, it really made me think and consider to text him again. I don't want to be the stupid, toxic and needy  texting someone who clearly doesn't want me near, but what if? 

I definitely don't know what to do, what do u think reddit? 

ps. sorry for my english, it is not my native language :/",28Apr2020,1
34,"Hello reddit,

I've had an emotional day, the kind I've had plenty of over the past few years. This is going to be long, but if someone makes it to the end, I would love any advice and support or anything.

To start off here's some of my background: I'm Indian American. Growing up, my aunt \[dad's oldest sister\] was a doctor and earned a lot, enough to pull her whole family out of poverty in India, set them nicely, and help her brother and family \[my family\] move to America with her. I grew up here, one foot in America and one foot in India. My dad has always seemed put off by America and even as I grew up he put into my head the idea that I would grow up and go to med school in India.

I was a sheltered only child, no friends ever came over nor was I allowed out to anyones house except when my parents went to parties. Basically socially reserved, and it became my personality to always do what my parents said, even if I didn't particularly like it I usually went along with my parents wanted me to do because I didn't want to disappoint them. Whether this be dance lessons or singing lessons, I went along, but because I wasn't particularly interested in them, I would half ass and not practice. This coupled with teachers who moved on led to me not really getting anywhere in my lessons so they couldn't show me off, and say I never show any commitment to anything, something they still ""tease"" me about. If I liked something, I never tried to pursue it because often my dad would be like 'what's the point of this ridiculousness, this is weird' or something like that. It hurts, because I've never felt good enough, even though I had interests and hobbies at one point, I was never encouraged or felt I had the space to do what I wanted, and now my parents like to watch videos of kids with all sorts of variety talents and go ""wow look at this"" when it feels like I was never raised to believe that other hobbies were ok. We were also not well off, so it didn't feel like I could ask them to send me off for sports or painting or instrument lessons that I knew cost lots of money. But they don't understand when I explained that, because 'they have never said no' but don't understand that knowing I came from a poor family, I never felt it was right to ask. 

So anyway, obviously I grew up, and graduated highschool. I never really bothered to cultivate dreams or anything, I never asked myself what were my skills, what did I want to do, it felt like there was no option but to fulfill dad's dream and go to med school. I was hesitant to follow dad's med school plan- as a US citizen I wanted to go to school in America and get a bachelors and then med school like normal. But my dad talked to me, my parents wore me down essentially with the promise of time saved, money saved, dad's dream, they convinced me to go with the college he'd selected. I did apply to many schools in America and get into them, as an aside, so I had options. I had developed somewhat of a spine though and said I didn't want to go to school in the same state as my aunts and uncles in India because I wanted to get into school on my merits, not who the family knew or how much ""donation"" was given. My dad managed to find a school like that in another state. Here's where I feel like my life went wrong the first time. He'd found a program based out of an admittedly prestigious Indian university geared towards NRI students like myself. A small college in the university with small sizes taught by the university staff that led to an MD degree. A dream. This was ok. I would be doing two years of pre-med, then 2 years med, then moving back to America for the clinical portions. But then accreditation rules changed. And it ended up that the university had bought a Caribbean med school and we were all expected to move to the Caribbean after premed years. All of a sudden I was going to a Caribbean med school, and I didn't even realize what that meant until a while later.

Admittedly, the first two years were pretty awesome. I made great friends who I still lean on to this day and they fill my heart with absolute joy. But as we went thorugh the years, we realized the shit hole we were in. And in my case it felt like no way out.  I'd also started suffering from what I now know to be the beginning of a depression and anxiety disorder, but back then, as usual, it was ""laziness and a wandering mind.""I started drinking. I got through premed by the skin of my teeth. And then at 20 I was on a Caribbean island with no supervision and in Med school. It was all new and I failed out so fucking hard. I failed so badly they wouldn't even consider letting me take the semester over. It sounds bad, but a lot of my friends were in the same boat and it made me feel better. Thinking back now, all our parents need smacks across the head for thinking it was ok sending a bunch of 20 year olds who had never experienced freedom to an island and then expecting them to actually study and not fool around. 

So I failed and I came home, my parents were all 'what next what next' and I said this is it, I'm going to go to a normal school. I went to my community college and picked up a few variety classes, to see what I was into. I did a semester and for the first time in my college career got A's in all my classes, made the damn deans list. And then we went to a religious convention and despite knowing my plans, my mom picked up the brochure for another Caribbean university. At this point my anxiety for caribbean universities was growing and the outburst was what had led to my community school classes \[a few of my friends and meanwhile gone straight into the next Caribbean med school that took them\].  But none of that mattered. You're probably thinking wow, she's fucking spineless, and you're right. I never thought about much more than making my parents proud, and I can only stand up to them for so long, even at the cost of my own mental health. There were fights, a journey to India, and my dad and his other sister convinced me to go to the new med school. I got in, even though I was praying I wouldn't, and landed there. Made it through, failing atleast 1 class a semester, because fucking untreated depression. Nothing was going right in my mind. But atleast my parents were happy. And then the island portion ended after much heartache and headache, and I had one huge board exam to pass. It's been almost 3 years, I still haven't written Step 1. And I need to in order to continue my education. I'm fucked. I've never been so lost. every day I think more and more that I don't want to do this anymore. And I've had many emotional fights with my parents. They don't understand why I couldn't tell them this earlier, my mom wonders why I didn't just say this earlier, except all I can hear is her voice going ""do it for your dad's happiness."" 

I know they want my happiness, but they tied my happiness to their wish fulfillment so closely, I don't feel like a person anymore. All I feel like is a failure. I failed them by wasting years of my life and still not achieving their goals, and failed myself by never asking myself who I was other than their daughter. I hate it. I hate it all. And I just want to run away and re start, but I can't be without my parents. I just love them so much. But it's too much pressure and I feel like I'm about to blow.

In moments of clarity I realized a few things

1\] I still technically, at age 26, only have a highschool degree. I want more than that and whatever shitty Caribbean med school degree awaits me. 

2\] I want more skills and degrees, because I do want to learn, I used to enjoy it before it became such a fucking overwhelming chore.

3\] I have no fucking Idea how college admissions, paying for school etc works. My parents have paid my tuition until now, and I couldn't use FAFSA. 

So, I want to pursue a bachelors online, even if it's one class as a time, I want something that isn't about them or their dream, but about me proving to myself that I'm not an idiot, and that once upon a time I used to be smart and witty and could learn. Could someone help me navigate choosing an online university or online classes from a good school and give advice on paying for it etc.? 

I know this has been long, and if you read it and made it this far, thank you.",28Apr2020,1
35,"So, with the current events, much like all of you, I’m home with my kids and husband. As each day goes by I’m hating my husband more and more and oh so I  wish for a divorce but I don’t want to hurt him. (I know it’s all weird but yeah) I need to get this all out of my system but I have no one to talk to. I was contemplating on picking up journaling again as it helped me when I was younger and earlier in our relationship but I stopped because my husband found my journal and read it. ...so instead of writing things down I just bottle up my feelings and I’m just about to burst with all these emotions. So, my question is should I try to write things out and omit details and feelings or just suffer in silence?",28Apr2020,2
36,"So I have a friend who won't stop copying my every move. It's been going on for years now and i'm getting real fucking tired of it and it's to the point that i don't even talk to her as much anymore. it's really getting on my nerves lately. And even in quarantine she's finding little things, like my profile pic, which is of an anime character, I found her using the same fucking picture after i decided to use it. one time in school i was drawing an anime character and later i found her using the same type of little details that make my drawings original on HER DRAWINGS, and that's when i totally lost it. I begged my friends for help and talked about it to them about it, but my friend thought we were talking bad about her and told the FUCKING PRINCIPAL!!

I know that she may be copying me because she is inspired or whatever, but doing it non-stop for 3+ years isn't okay to me. i've tried talking to her about it but eventually she does the same thing again.  she takes my ideas and claims them as her own. i don't know what to do anymore at this point, any idea on what i can do?",28Apr2020,1
37,"So I have this old friend of mine that I cut off back in January of 2020 because he was getting too toxic for me. If you dont know I graduated from HS last year and have been in college. Anyways this guy and I were best friend but he’s the type to start issues with anyone and everyone and tends to take it too far. Him and another guy came and egged my car in my driveway last night, I know for a fact because they posted a video together around Midnight, they were seen elsewhere blaring their horn by another one of my friends house and the guy my friend was with knows where I live (only 3 people know where I live) my old friend has no idea where I live because we would always spend the night at his growing up, lastly my mom was telling me no other cars or houses were hit when she went out running errands. Im really tempted to get him back for it but I know if I do, he’s going to call the cops and play victim. What do I do? I would like to get him back in a LEGAL way if I do, but Im sick of this, I dont want to play his fucking games, he texts me all sad randomly every month talking about “being friends again, i miss you so much, come back, id give anything to be friends.” Yet I have screenshots of him talking shit behind my back multiple times, literally minutes after he texts me all sad, and now this!? The adult in me says brush it off and if he does it again press charges and the other part of me wants to just beat the shit out of him. 

What do I do? Just brush it off and let him get away with this shit or do I go and do something about it?",28Apr2020,1
38,"I [15m] am going to be going into my junior year of highschool this fall. This past year and freshman year in the spring I have rowed on my schools crew team, and in the winter played hockey not associated with the school in the fall and winter. Up until highschool I played football in the fall, and then I broke my arm and just never came back to doing it. Recently I’ve been having thoughts about going back to football in the fall and only rowing in the spring but I’m torn between crew and football. On one hand I am a varsity rower and have a lot of friends on the crew team and would be in a fairly good position to be a captain for my senior year. But then on the other hand I also have some friends on the football team and I feel like I will be missing out on the experiences but not only am I not sure I would be very good, as I’m not the most solidly built (6’2 175lbs) but my parents are also concerned about the physical toll on my body to be playing hockey and football at the same time. For context at my school crew is seen as a weird kids sport and looked down upon and my father and all his brothers were all record setting football players back in highschool with family in the NFL, so while i don’t think that it has to do with outside pressures maybe it has some effect subconsciously?

Tl;dr I have been a rower for 2 years and have been thinking about trying to play football again but am unsure if I want to give up time rowing

Edit: To clarify this is American Football",28Apr2020,1

Every now and then I would spend time with family but ever since quarantine and tearing a ligament in my wrist , I don't have any motivation to work.

41,"I went all throughout school and college without ever having a friend. I’ve struggled with my mental health my entire life and was selective mute for 5 years.

I met a girl and she was amazing. It was complete luck I ever made such an amazing friend, we were so close for 5 years.

A month ago she stopped talking to me and and deleted me on all social media. I don’t even know what happened and I’m too afraid to even speak to anyone else she knows.

I feel like she was genuinely all I had. I never spoke to her about how down I always felt or mentioned any major problems because I didn’t want to burden her.

Anyway she’s gone. I thought it was going to ease after time and that I would eventually feel better. I feel worse every day and it’s gotten so bad I don’t want to live. It’s been over a month and I still have a break down and can’t control my crying every time I even think of what’s happening or if I even remember her.

It’s gotten so bad I was going to end it, I’m so scared. I genuinely don’t want to die but it hurts so much. I have tried making online friends but I’m such an awkward and anxious person it just doesn’t work.

My mum has found me crying so many times and always just tells me it’s fine I’m going to get over this and I just need to continue taking my medication. I’m too scared to talk to my therapist. I don’t want to worry my mum but I feel so bad.

I really don’t know what to do anymore I’m terrified. I’m 20 years old and I lost my first and only friend and I don’t even know why. It’s making me feel pathetic and disgusted with myself at much it upsets me",28Apr2020,2
42,"Yea I’m introverted, I have a few friends, none from college mostly all from high school

But damn I am loving quarantine. My dream is to literally wake up and stay stuck in my room, not just my house, but MY room the whole day, only leaving to get some food and to use the bathroom. I’m just living like any other day I used to have except walking to classes. I’m just at my laptop the whole day doing work and then watching anime, then playing some animal crossing.

But when I tell my friends that I’m enjoying quarantine, they call me a horrible person and that people are dying. Of course I know people are dying, but I was simply telling them that I’m enjoying this lifestyle of being in my room all day. So after they tell me that I just decide to shut up and listen to them complain that they want quarantine to end so that they can go back to college and party with their college friends. 
And here I am listening to my high school friend tell me she just wants quarantine to end so she can hang with other college friends. But Every single voice call, they keep mentioning that they want this to be over. Yea I get that, I want it to be over too, but they just keep saying ugh I’m so BOred aren’t you too? And tbh I’m not bored at all so I’m just sitting here faking it when I’m rly enjoying it. It makes me feel like a horrible person. Am I a bad person for actually enjoying life right now?",28Apr2020,2
43,"I am 28, from Canada. Moved when i was 11 from South America. All my life, for as long as I can remember, I've been extremely shy. I've been continously made fun of for my social awkardness throughout school and university. I've always tried to fit in but always felt like a social outcast my whole life. Also, I do not have any dating experience, and no sexual experience. Really scared of getting close to girls and them finding out my lack of sexual experience and laughing. In university, one guy used to always ask me ""who did you kill this weekend?"". I am extremely scared of being judged and everything I say, I imagine what the other person may be thinking about me.

I always thought I would get over it but I never did. Some things I tried to get over this were:

1)Being an overnight summer camp counselor for two summers when i was 19-20. This did not work out to well. I was made fun by some other counselors because of my accents, and did not make any group of friends. Also, I was voted the most socially awkward staff member at camp. To this day, I still remember that. Also, there used to be a visitors day where families of staff and campers visit the camp for day. A coworker told me, his mother said she thought I had a mental problem. And she did not even interact with me! That really hurt. Also, I remember a fellow coworker telling another coworker about me ""he scares me""

2) Joining a fraternity in university. I thought I would get out of my social anxiety by doing this but I never did! In fact, I was so nervous of other people finding out I was in a fraternity that I never told anyone. I did not want my engineering classmates finding out as I thought they would laugh at me for being in a fraternity, or that they would judge me or be suprised. I know, really stupid.

3) Joining a music club in university and being the VP.

4) Trying improv. Two years ago I did an improv for anxiety class for 3 months. I really liked it. Again, I was scared of other people finding out I was doing improv so I always hid it from other people. Fear of being judged.

5) Therapy. Started going to therapy three years ago. I am onto my third therapist now. Things improved slightly but now I feel i am back to square one.

6) Sport leagues: soccer, tennis

Below are some the major regrets I have in my life, it's depressing knowing that I cannot change the past.

1) Not going away for university, and staying at home. One of my major regrets in my life. Maybe, things would have been different had I gone out of town for university. I almost did but i did not. Was really anxious i would not fit in so I stayed home.

2) Not going on an exchange program internationally. Again, really sad I did not do this.

3) not taking advantage of opportunities in high schoo/university to get involved.

4) continously lying to fit in. I told people i went to a public school when they asked, instead of a private school for fear of being judged as wealthy. I never told people I used to play tennis tournaments competitively. I never told some people how many siblings I had, and one of them is a phD. I have a constant fear of standing out. I am scared of telling people these kind of stuff now as they may be mad as why didn't I tell them all these things before. Not telling people I am going to europe with family, for fear of being judged as rich.

5) Not telling my parents about what was going on with me. I really regret not telling my parents how much I have struggled to fit in, and how bad a time I was having. Really ashamed that I did not take advantage of them helping me.

Anyhow, not sure what to do anymore. IT really depresses me how I have wasted my last 10 years of my life and will never get back what were supposed to be the ""Best years of my life"". I do not have any close friends, no girls. I really want to get experiences and adventures in life but now there's no time to do those things with a job.",28Apr2020,1
44,"My mom repeats her opinions to me over and over again and acts as if they're true. She even insists it's the truth at some points.

I tell her about situations in my life or my day and she expresses her ""opinions"" but I call them her theories because they're pretty baseless. She gets different conclusions from these stories and tells me about it so much to the point I start to question myself and my thoughts. Even if at the start I thought opposite of her.

An example, when my current SO of 1 year and a few months first expressed his feelings to me. She was so convinced he's ""lying"" and told me about it. I told her that saying that is pretty harsh but she told me ""she knew more"" and insisted it. It got so bad that when I talked to my SO again I had to confirm it multiple times because I was convinced what my mom said is true. She does this a lot.

I'm refusing to tell her things now for my own sake and sanity. What should I do now? Is this an actual form of gaslighting or manipulation?",28Apr2020,1
45,"So, my mom used to be heavily addicted to hard drugs. Particularly opiates. She recently started taking a pill called Suboxone, which helps to treat addiction to narcotics. Her boyfriend found it and broke up with her because he said she “shouldn’t need to take a pill to prevent her addiction”. 

Currently she’s moved in with my grandparents. A few weeks ago they bought a house (though he refused to put her name on it) and had her pay the bills along with him. When this situation happened, he changed the locks and kicked her out.

Inside the house, my mom owns their entire bedroom suit, 2 tv’s, a couple decorations, and a large dining table. I’m sure she’s definitely getting those, but since times are tough right now I want to know if there’s a way she could get that money back that she put into the house (since she’s not living there and her name is nowhere on the house).

To be fair, he’s done other shady shit. She gave his mom $700 to go towards their phone payment, and he instead had his mother put that money toward paying for car parts for HIS CAR. 

She doesn’t really have that much money now since she got laid off from her job (thanks C*vid) and she’s been drawing unemployment. Is there any way that she can get some of that money back? I just don’t think it’s fair that she has to pay for something she has no legal attachment to and isn’t even allowed to live there.",28Apr2020,1

She broke up with me at the start of 8th and I was acceptable to this.( this was my first G.F and tried to treat her like a queen) During Valentines day of 2020 she asked if we could date again and I agreed and we exchanged gifts.(she doesn't like much so I got her 6-8 packs of candy Hearts and she got me a box of chocolates) I showed her more affection than I did the first time. I hugged her almost every time I seen her.(We were not to the kissing stage yet unlike most of my grade who have already lost their V cards) She broke up with me right before we went into lock down, But the thing that angered me is that she talked to my friend through snap and was thinking about breaking up with me. My friend told me cuz you know the BOYS! I talked to her about it and she said she was sorry but she never ever brought up anything to me if I did anything wrong.

She has her Tiktoc on where she has to add you so no one from our school can see what she does so  she doesn't get made fun of because where we got to school people are nice or are harsh.

51,I have been dating my bf for going on 5 years and moved in with him after a year... everything was great at first but for the passed 2 and a half or so years we haven’t been intimate. He always gives excuses to why he doesn’t want to be... I’m tired.. it’s too late... I don’t feel good etc. etc. At first I didn’t think anything of it but even after 2+ years he still makes excuses and we haven’t had sex in that time even though we live together... The last time I tried (a couple months ago) he said no and I was visibly upset and left the room and he laughed it off like he didn’t care it upset me. He says he loves me but he doesn’t really show it.,28Apr2020,2

55,"I’m finishing up my masters degree in music performance at a fairly respectable university, and due to current events, all gigs and auditions are cancelled - it could be years before things return to normal. During the past (like during the summer months) I’d use the extra time to practice and further improve my own abilities, yet this time, despite the abundance of free time, I just can’t find the motivation to practice. It almost feels like I’ve only been going forward because I had deadlines and requirements, and now that I’m no longer under strict deadlines, it’s like I’m realizing that those were the only things making me go forward. It sort of feels like there isn’t a fire of inspiration anymore, and I’m not sure if I’ve got it in me anymore. I’m not sure if I’ve made the right choice in careers. Not sure what I should do in the long term. Anyone know people who got a music degree and ended up doing something else? Not necessarily committing to a career change at this point, but I’m interested in looking at alternatives since it’s unlikely that the industry will recover for a year or two. 

TLDR: Realizing at the end of my masters that I may have chosen the wrong career path and am interested in investigating alternatives.",28Apr2020,2
56,"So I have this family member who has a problem.  I won’t reveal it Incase it can identify me. He harassed me, is physically dangerous to my siblings and I, and other stuff.  

As a kid he was always violent.  He one time put a knife up to my older brother’s throat when he threatened to rattle tell to his aunt.  He punched me in the chest hard because I once asked to borrow a DVD. 

Now to the future, he lives near us. He often leave the apartment his mother (my aunt) pays for.  He’s a few years older than me. She only helps pay the rent, he keeps the home filthy and it just smells gross.  He’ll come over, harrass my younger siblings or me, once he came barging to my room.  He said he had a present for me, obviously I didn’t trust him but I had asked why. He then smeared his hand onto my door and said “his boogers.” He’ll do gross things towards me or my siblings and he’ll make rude comments towards any of us. 

He has bad hygiene where he smells bad and so does his house.  When he comes over to my parents apartment to want to “play” us and he’ll do gross things like picking his nose.  He’s been known to smear feces across the bathroom walls and other rooms even as an adult.  

Once he got access to my father’s account (I think he gave it to him to watch shows) on Amazon. He bought a bunch of porn magazines and tried to blame my 5 year old brother and my 9 year old brother. Obviously none of them did it cause they were at school at the time and don’t have a phone.   

If I’m like chilling or have headphones on, he’ll come and touch me or annoy me on purpose.  He’s been punched for this before in the past by strangers yet never learns. I try to tell my parents but my parents usually try to have my older brother handle it (when parents aren’t around) 

Once I had online class.  He was playing a video game and had his volume on high where the whole apartment had the sound. The room he was was right next to me and I wanted to study what the teacher was saying.  I came over and opened the door and I asked him to turn down the volume please.  He immediately walked over and shoved me and closed the door in my face and refused to turn it down.  

Another incident, this was a year ago, my brother who was 4 at the time was near a lake on a walkway. He was being quiet watching the fishes, then the family member walked over and attempted to grab my four year old brother and push him into the water (who couldn’t swim at that time). Luckily my parents saw it and my older brother intervened and got my brother to safely.  


But like I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried to talk to my parents but they’re really busy. He’s not allowed in the house when my parents are gone but if my siblings said I refuse to let him in, he’ll throw a literal tantrum and force himself in.",28Apr2020,1

Broke up on bad terms

No contact for about a year, moved on

She contacted my ex's and current GF (at that time) to 'warn them about me'.  During this time she had moved on as well

I called her told her to knock it off, she said ""your a horrible person never call me again"", blocked me

Had a friend add her on Insta to get info, she expressed how she hated me, and then blocked him

Fast forward a year

She magically unblocked my friend some random day (no longer with her bf)

About a month later i swipe on her contact on accident and hung up as soon as possible

She calls back instantly, I deny the call

&amp;#x200B;

Am I over-reacting to this? Or would any of this mean she's open to reaching out? It would be 2 cases of unblocking.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: my thoughts, she may have blocked me on old phone, then gotten a call from # she didn't know, called back immediately?  Maybe Insta has an auto unblock after a certain amount of time?

60,"Hey Reddit. I'll admit the post is a little clickbaity, but here's the lowdown:

I'm a high school student in Australia who will soon be finishing up my secondary education. I want to do something in the field of English, as I've always been good at Creative Writing (Screenwriting). However, I know that isn't necessarily financially viable, so my fallback was potentially Journalism. I was also always good at Mathematics/Physics (I'm completing an accelerated learning program around Physics right now).

I also kinda like the idea of becoming a Barrister/Solicitor, and was relying on work experience to find out if I truly wanted to become one, but Covid-19 has put that to an end.

My Dad thinks that I shouldn't have to go to university to become successful (I don't know if he doesn't want me to go straight up or if he just believes it isn't necessary), but my mother wants me to go to university. My Dad works for a business in Australia (national office level) and my mother is currently completing her second degree (Bachelor of Fine Arts) (unemployed).

I don't know what I want to do. I want to find out what my Dad wants (straight up, all I've heard about him not wanting me to go to Uni is through Mum). But I'm at the point where I have to start planning for a career, or the next 5-10 years of it, at least.

My friend wasn’t even going to live at this school but I convinced her so that the two us could live together, but as it got closer to the time to confirm my enrollment I decided to go to a different school. It was kinda a last minute decision on my part and she already filled out her housing form with me as her roommate.

Especially bc my girlfriend meets w customers everyday at a very popular shop that ppl still go to bc they serve drinks for to go. She changed her clothes but obviously didnt shower.. so theres still a chance.. 
A few weeks ago we hugged and i got into so much shit for it that now im in quarantine away from my family and i didnt understand the repercussions then but now i do and i explained that to her before. I told her how i have to wear a mask all day at home and im not allowed to eat w my family just to prevent any possible spread if she was a carrier. I told her how much shit im going through and how serious this situation is. And she just goes to see her friend on her birthday? its not even her friends bday today its just a late celebration.

im just so pissed?? do i have a right to be pissed though? ugh she doesnt know im this tilted about the situation should i talk to her? or no?

66,"So I've been working as a receptionist for about a year now. I work the morning shift and my coworker comes in the afternoon. She has been okay, pretty nice to me at least. We are both in our mid twenties, in college. She's covered for me in the past when I've had to go out of town to visit family. Which I really appreciate.
I have worked a few doubles for her as well. Pretty recent she had to have surgery, it was a pretty serious surgery and she was out for some time. It was very sudden that she needed the surgery because it was an emergency. I felt bad because I wasn't able to cover really her shifts due to me still being in school. This also happened the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. (which is where I live).
Ever since she has gotten back it seems like she is constantly asking me to stay later. I get a text every other day saying ""I'm gunna be running late but I told management, can you cover the phone?"" I always say ""I can't because I have webcam classes to do."" Which is true but also, my mental health has been shit. This virus outbreak has affected everyone in different ways. Since I'm very close around people it flares up my anxiety. My chest is tight for several days sometimes and I wake up feeling sick. 


I just don't want to be at work longer than I have to be since taking time off isn't a choice. I was told I'd be let go if I chose to not come in and self quarantine. 
Anyway, it seems like she is starting to get an attitude with me. I texted her once again today and told her that I can't cover for her because she has exams. She keeps bringing up she has so much to do and belittled my assignments. ""Oh you have one paper? I have 6 assignments due tomorrow."" Like okay? No one made you take that many classes. I actually withdrew from one course because I was failing and just forever an anxious mess. 


I'm not sure what to do at this point? Management is annoyed that I won't cover for her and so is she. I just can't do more than what I'm required to do right now.

69,"Howdy people of the internet. I’m a high schooler for context .I play Lacrosse and have been working my ass off to pay for it (It’s a club sport here, not a school sport so sign up and gear is roughly $800+) Due to COVOID-19 my season got cancelled and we were refunded. My parents told me they were going to hold onto the money to pay for next season, but this weekend my dad suddenly had the money for a pool table. We’re kind of a paycheck to paycheck family and I can’t think of where this money could have come from besides my lacrosse money.

70,"I'm a really emotional person so i might be overreacting. It's not a big problem or anything it's just something that hurts me.

My mum really favors my younger siblings over me. She doesn't really care what I do until its something that inconveniences her. I've never been able to just ask for things and get them, she always had me do chores or work to get what I want. (Which im okay with, i understand that it should be this way.) However, my siblings can just ask for something and get it.

 I got a mini fridge for christmas after begging my mum for one since the rest of my family keeps eating the food i bought for myself. It was the big thing i got for Christmas and i only got like, 2 other things cause it was expensive. I expected that. I did not expect my little brother to want one less than a month later and for my mother to buy it for him without hesitation. 

I saved up for a whole year to buy myself my desktop so I could finaly game on something that can handle it. A year later, my brother wants one. Guess what happens? He gets it. During a time we're running low on money no less. 

Hell, my computer chair snapped in half a week ago. I asked her if I could borrow one of her chairs. (She has 2 office chairs and wont let me use the ones from the dining room.) She said no. Why? Because it's her dogs chair. Yep. Her dogs. Thats why i can't borrow it. I've been laid off from my job so if I buy one I'll pretty much be out.

These are just a few of the more recent events, but it's been going on since they were born and it makes me feel really invalidated. Something I worked hard for they get just because they asked. I don't know I'm probably just being sensitive.

Anyway, how can I talk to my mum about this? Any time i get angry and try to talk to her about something that hurts me she says stuff like ""oh is someone getting her period?"" and it seriously annoys me. I know that I'm lower in her heart than her dog but i wish she would atleast TRY to talk to me without invalidating my feelings.",28Apr2020,0

72,"I am 17, and about 2 years ago I was the happiest I’ve ever been. I went out every weekend intoxicated myself with numerous substances and all round felt like a local hero because at school everyone always referenced stories when i was on drugs which always made everyone laugh, people always asked to meet me on the weekend to ‘get on it’, i felt popular, i felt like a joy to be around, and most importantly girls started to really like me because of the confidence i had. As time went on the girl i liked since i was 8 started messaging me and saying things I’ve only dreamt of her saying. The only problem was a current friend at the time recently split up with her, i talked to him about it and he gave me the all clear (it’s worth mentioning he kind of ran the friendship group i was in as he was feared and respected), when things progressed with said girl she slowly expressed an issue with drugs apart from weed. I was willing to stop and only do them very very little like annually. At parties i would only drink and occasionally i saw my girlfriends ex (leader of my friendship group) trying to flirt with her, i told him to back off and he did. About a week later i got a text, it was from him saying “leave the group chat, everyone wants you to”. This tore me apart, i felt like a huge decline was ahead, the reason i became popular was due to the group i was in. Almost instantly hardly anyone spoke to me and i had one friend. This one friend i had for the sake of confidentiality i will call ‘brad’ now brad slowly went insane from taking downers such as xanax and prograblin, he started touching me every chance he could and eventually led to him coming out as in love with me. I, like any normal heterosexual teenage boy, freaked out and blocked him on everything. 

I now am at a dead end. I think dark thoughts almost daily and although im with the girl of my dreams I can’t help but miss the exciting lifestyle i left behind, she is the only one i trust, and kind of my life, everything i do is revolved  around her and i love her to pieces but there’s a huge empty void in my social life, i feel like I’ve already peaked and been through my happiest point in life. I still communicate with 2 people from my old life and even meet them occasionally for a smoke and to catch up, they don’t feel like close friends and are about the only connection i have to any type of lad friendship. I just feel pointless and although it doesn’t always trouble me there’s always at least one point in the day where i just reminisce and get upset about what i used to have and it drives me to hate myself.  i think about the decisions I’ve made, should i just have left my friends ex alone? Should i be happy I’ve left the dangerous lifestyle behind? I don’t value my life much anyway so at least i was having fun even if it was a catalyst for my body to give up. 
I just want friends again, i skate by myself because no one else skates that i know, i smoke mostly by myself and with my step sister who is kind of my best friend even though I can’t stand talking to her if I’m not stoned, i play loads of playstation and spend most of my time collecting trophies from games. Everything i do makes me feel like a loner i just want friends again

I’m living in Kitchener, ON, was living in London, ON for couple years before and spent like 20 years in Toronto, ON. 

I liked Toronto, but it was just too expensive. I didn’t like London or Kitchener, felt they’re “family towns” and just not for me. 

I’m ok taking a chance going somewhere without a job as I feel my education will land me something good eventually and I’m ok with working a whatever job in the meantime. I’m higher education, so it would have to be a city with colleges or univerities in it.

I don’t have a reputation for being a snitch or anything like that, so it really hurts I didn’t get asked to go.

I’m not super social but not having interactions with anyone is killing me. My hearts always racing and I hate it. I miss seeing people at school, even just the little interactions were nice.

I haven’t had conversations with any of my friends about anything besides schoolwork, and usually it’s just me giving them the physics homework.

I’ve got a really good online friend but something happened and we just fell out so now I’ve lost that too.

The only two things I know I want to do is move back to my old state and be a housewife when I am older. I have friends, but I barely talk to them now because they are all busy with school or their own things, and they also live in my old state.

I realized I have become a clingy girlfriend with no life. I volunteered at a childrens museum a few months ago and realized it wasn't really for me. I have a job at a movie theater, but I realized I cannot stand standing for hours doing nothing and I cannot use a cash register correctly, no matter how many times I practice. I can't even count money correctly.

Drawing is fun, but I don't really like it that much. I just do it for the occasional doodle when I am bored or art-based project in class. I did recently discover that I like to bake and cook, but I'm not allowed to do that while my mum is at work because she is worried that I will get hurt or burn down the house. I also don't know if we can afford to keep that up.

I get good grades in school, I do honors classes and am doing dual enrollment, currently considering AP for 11th grade. I have a 4.03 GPA. It isn't like I'm throwing my life away, I just really am having a hard time thinking for myself. I want to go to college or a trade school, but I have no idea what I want to do. My mom and friends always suggest being a teacher or therapist, but I really don't enjoy talking to strangers that much and I don't want to play with strangers kids.

I know I like theatre and acting, but I am very quiet and started homeschool a few months ago. I like baking and cooking. I want to learn how to sew, so I am saving up to buy stuff. I really like gaming, but I have never been able to afford things to play, so I am  stuck watching youtube or my boyfriend. I have signed up for free online classes, watch videos about people soing certain things, watched those ""millionaire at 16"" people, and watch educational stuff like crash course. Nothing interests me at all.

I really want to do something other than school, watch youtube/netflix, and wait for my boyfriend to have time to call me all day. Are there any tips for discovering hobbies? Lists of hobbies? Really anything will help. I don't want to end up as someone who works a boring job with no life.

I have a friend who has been depressed for about 8 years now and I’ve only knows him for the past 4 at first I had no clue but as we became closer friends he one day opened up to me, it was pretty shocking to find out that he would fake being happy with our friends. He’s always outgoing when in public but when he’s alone it’s very sad to see him, he won’t leave his bes unless he needs to go to work, and when we could talk over the phone he’d sound very sad. I’ve seen him cry a couple of times and he’s told me many times he’s wanted to take his life. What makes me worried is that a week ago he sounded very committed to doing it, he says he’s tired of living, he hates himself, hates the way he looks, that he’s miserable and just wants to be forgotten. He’s not happy about anything, and I’ve seen him talk like this over the years but he’s never been like this.
I’ve talked him out of it for 3 years and each year he gets worse I don’t know if it’s selfish to let him live such a miserable life, I do t want him to do it but I have no idea of what he goes through in his head.
Do you guys think It’s better let him do what he feel would set him at ease, is it even my choice to decide to keep him living a life he doesn’t want to live or should I call an outside source to help him? He never liked therapy and he doesn’t like sharing his depression with others

82,"I have this tendency to sit forever with a good script and when I finally ask my question or profess my feelings, I never know how to reply.

This has happened twice. Once at work when asking for a raise. After being told it was basically a in-the-future thing, I didnt press. Why? When?

The next is when I worked up the courage to text the person who dumped me. They basically said things fell off. I didn’t press harder. I feel like I always want to know more after a week.

85,"My son is 12 years old. I meet my ex husband when I was pregnant with him and my ex signed the birth certificate. We had 2 more children before we divorced and everything was fine, we have a great parental relationship. 

About 3 years ago my ex, meet his current fiance and she caused a lot of problems for us. This lead too our son saying he didn't want to go to his fathers anymore. Son told his father this and his father got mad about it. I did encourage son to go, but eventually I allowed my son to stop going, while his 2 younger brothers still go for visits. At which his father started excluding him and said he wasn't welcomed at his house anymore

Recently, ex has said he wanted to get DNA testing done so he can get his name removed from sons birth certificate and stop paying child support because and I quote him 'I don't want to pay support for a child that I don't see and is not mine'. This is fine, if he wants to pay for the DNA testing to be done, he can go for it.

I have been tossing around the idea of telling my son that biologically he isn't my ex child, and that ex practically adopted him at birth (I spoke too a lawyer, as ex said something about fraud with him signing the birth certificate, knowing he isn't the father, which she said given the time frame court may ignore that part). My ex mentioned he wanted to tell my son, which I feel he only wants to do so to be malicious and not have my sons best interest at heart.

My current partner doesn't think its a good idea as my son may see his brothers as not his full brothers and I guess be more of a d\*ck than he is too them now, typical brother stuff. Son also mentions at time that he feels no one wants him or that he is unwanted. My partner wants to adopt him and give my son his last name, so I feel telling him that he isn't biologically my ex husbands, while break him away from ex husband, and know that he is wanted and loved by my partner.

My department is very stressful, and it's a breath of fresh air to go help her out because we just mesh so well personality-wise. She's sorta like a motherly figure, in her late 40's or so. She has to be like an INFJ or INFP definitely.

Last week I opened up to her for the first time for either of us, and told her how my manager was being stressful and made me cry etc... she began just pouring into me with encouragement and how to handle the situation, and had this encouraging fire about her and it was so appreciated... other people I've told this about didn't have much to offer.

She seems like she sees a lot in me, and it's just nice to feel encouraged and built up a bit, instead of people looking down on me or misunderstanding me.

She’s said before that she loves me “but not in that way”, but I just feel like if she just meant it in a friendly way she wouldn’t be saying it almost everyday. Actually.... she says it everyday.

I’m not weirded out by it, just curious as to why she’d be saying it so often in a friendly manner. Like just late at night when we haven’t been texting much and I’m just there playing Call of Duty, i get a text from her saying “Hey I love you”. I say I love her too then she goes on to saying how much I mean to her. 

Again, she said a while ago that she means it in a friendly way, but if you read one of our convos... it does suspiciously look like what a couple would be saying. Like if you didnt know we were just friends, you would assume we were dating.

He did it in the night and morning, but seriously nothing else happened other than making out like the girl told me and the girl was 100% against him.  I was absolutely fucking broken by this and it made me so depressed like I broke up with him and I stopped eating but eventually after a while I got back with him in December which was definitely a great decision.

While I am in no means a psychologist/therapist, I find myself helping the people in my life work through their emotional and relationship issues. I have no problem doing so and while I've only been studying psychology/family studies for a couple of years, I've learned a lot in my life that has made me able to support others. 

  My life experiences, alongside the many years of therapy because of them, helps me work through my bad days by myself. However, when I do ask for help from the same people that I've stayed up nights with to make sure they didn't hurt themselves or listened when they needed to talk about their ex-boyfriend again, the same sort of care I give is never reciprocated. I don't mean to sound like I'm full of myself or self pitiful, but the advice they give when they actually do offer to help is so surface level. 

  I guess I should just go to my therapist if I want someone to help me work through my problems but it's just like, for the people in my life, there is no effort to care for me. Maybe I am being selfish or full of myself but when those few times when I allow myself to be vulnerable, I am reminded that I'm the only one whose going to help me.",28Apr2020,1

Very grateful for that.

Well she is a real estate agent and with the outbreak she is unable to tour clients through her properties and I can see and hear intimately on her phone calls upstairs (because it is a basement apartment) that she may be struggling to make commission. 

So this morning when I was heading out for a walk she was outside on the porch on the phone and paused to ask me if I knew anyone who had a high quality camera she could rent to take panoramic shots of her selling properties so that potential buyers could view them. I said: yes! I think my sister’s partner has a good camera. I’ll ask her.

Why do I feel like I am doing something wrong here setting this up? What if she doesn’t want to lend her expensive camera and was trying to be nice ? What if she is completely okay with it?! Why can’t I tell? I don’t want to not help out my aunt either.

I got really drunk (imbibed about 5 ounces of rum) and told her pretty much how I felt. about her, about my parents, about her mom and my dad, everything. (I'm a messy as hell drunk) She was extremely comforting, and probably the nicest person I've met since fifth grade. I didn't tell her that I was in love with her, but I told her that she was the best person I knew, from a single conversation. We've texted on and off since, had an hour-long ft call with a friend of mine, and I've completely fallen for her.

I don't know how to feel. I feel like this situation only happens in hentai and porn.

116,"I am a 24f, who recently lost a lot of my close friends. Basically all of them but 2. In particular, one of my closest friends, 22m, and I were becoming very close over the past six months and eventually grew feelings for one another. 
He would always be very open with me and we would talk for hours, we would play video games and exchange our favorite music. He would share how much he liked me and wanted to do more with me, sexually, but then he would avoid hanging out with me in person because he ""couldn't resist doing something"". He is also friends with my ex boyfriend which is why we both agreed we could never be together. However that is why I so much wanted to just be his friend and show him we could have good times being together as friends. We got into an argument over myself ""treating him coldly"" because I didn't initiate our conversations everyday for a week because I was told he was spending time with this other girl (who he admitted to me he wanted to fuck), which extremely hurt my feelings. I explained to him why I was being distant and was not being cold that I was simply treating him how he has always treated me, never interesting conversation, leaving me on read, and using one worded responses. He argued that my reasoning didn't matter and that it ""extremely turned him off about me"". After that I told him once again how I was simply reciprocating his actions therefore how could he be calling my actions cold and not his own, anyways he continued to dismiss this and remain upset. Feeling exhausted and semi-insane I told him I gave up. And that I didn't want to be friends if it was always going to be this difficult for him to understand my feelings and where I was coming from.

117,"i'm not even sure how to say this. i think my sister (who's in junior high) has issues processing her own emotions, and i'm starting to think it's more than just ""turbulent teenage years"" and something deeper and more psychological. when someone even remotely criticizes her (and sometimes it's just a casual comment, not a criticism at all; it's just that she perceives it as a criticism), she throws a fit. and by fit, i mean a full-on temper tantrum that just seems unusual for her age. she'll scream, roll on the ground, stomp her feet around, grunt, groan, the whole thing. one time, my mom was mad at her and called her ""unreasonable"" and for the next hour she was muttering aggressively to herself ""i'm NOT unreasonable, i'm not"" over and over and over. it's come to a point where i try to make as little contact with her as possible because it affects my own mental health and sanity, despite the fact that we share a room. 

&amp;#x200B;

she also seems socially unaware and has bad timing with when she decides to talk about something. for instance, my parents will be engaged in conversation about some serious topic, and she'll want to interject and say something unrelated. obviously, my parents can't pay attention to her right then since they're busy. why can't she see that? or i'll be calling my friends, and she'll overhear something in the conversation (because she's usually in the same room), and she'll try to show me something or comment on something i was telling my friends. and trust me, my parents and i have both tried telling her gently to pay attention to the atmosphere and speak up if it's a good time to talk, as in other people aren't doing other stuff. well, she got mad, since she can't take any criticism.

&amp;#x200B;

she always seems angry about something. sometimes, my mom is just checking in on her (though i can understand my mom sort of hovers a bit and that might get annoying), and my sister just snaps back at her really rudely. then she'll huff and puff and stomp around for reasons that i'm not even sure she knows. she's also very vindictive! earlier, we had an argument, and to ""get back at me"" she decides to purposely belt the frozen soundtrack in the middle of the hallway to disrupt me from doing work, which is something she knows i hate (not because i hate frozen or singing but because she always tries to sing badly on purpose).

&amp;#x200B;

when i first moved back home from berkeley, she would have online morning classes, which she would blast through the speakers while i was sleeping. i even handed her earbuds one time to use, and she just continued to blast it. when i asked her to move outside, she told me to move to a different room to sleep. one day, we finally had an argument about it, partially mediated by my mom but also not really since no one can control my sister. it took days of coaxing and repetition to finally get her to move outside for her classes when i'm sleeping. 

&amp;#x200B;

my parents seem totally puzzled on what to do. they're tried yelling at her, they're tried rationalizing with her, but nothing has worked so far. i don't think they enable her that much, though my grandparents definitely dote on her a lot since she grew up with them. i don't know if that's the cause? or if there is a cause? i'm so drained from sharing a room with her because she's constantly complaining about me or throwing a screaming fit or being an inconsiderate roommate. any ideas on what to do?",28Apr2020,1

I dont see anything improving with my parents. They are constantly gaslighting me, blatantly lying about things to me and each other and then getting mad at me, telling me that things they do/say is all in my head. Either they tell me that Im lying when I tell them about my feelings/experiences or belittling them and treat me like Im the asshole for feeling the way that I do. Ive tried telling them but they dont listen and turn it around on me. There have been times were they have said really hurtful things and when I reference back to it, sometimes a few seconds later, they claim they never said that and I should stop lying.  Im sorry if its all over the place, its just hard for me get my thoughts into words.

I have thought about moving out within the next year. I have already made a list of things that I want to take with me. I have a friend in mind who Im going to ask but hes halfway across the country. Im going to ask him if I can stay with him and his parents for a bit just so I can get up on my feet but with this pandemic Im going to have to wait for a while.

I dont want live with them but I also dont want to move away and “start” life with all of its responsibilities. I dont see the point of living. Im going to be doing the same thing over and over again for the next 50 years all while barely making ends meet and constantly being stressed out and lonely.

Because of my parents and bad friends that Ive had, its impossible for me to form relationships with people. Im constantly looking for signs of betrayal and even the smallest thing makes me start to distrust someone. Whenever I do find someone I like hanging out with I dont feel connected to them. This is hard to explain. You know how we you are with a friend you just feel a connection. Like you cant explain it you just know that theres something between you that you cant quantify. I dont. When I am around my friends I have to constantly remind myself that we are friends by looking at facts. What are they saying, what are they doing etc. Ex. ""She does care about me, she does/says this. If they didnt like me they wouldnt have said yes to hang out""

I dont want to be like this but I cant help it. Its like my brain is wired like this. Because of this Im always the “odd man out”.

Im sick of this. Im sick of it all. The only thing thats keeping a gun out of my mouth is the possibility of failing. If there was a 100% chance of me succeeding I would have done it already.",28Apr2020,1
119,"I have this friend that I’ve had for years. We’re really close and we seem really happy together. But I’ve always been a horrible friend to him, even from the start. I lie a lot, though lately have been getting better. Though he still asks every time if I’m lying. It’s annoying now that I’ve sorta stopped but it’s still MY fault he’s like that. When I came out, lots of people teased and bullied him ‘cause they thought that since I’m Bi that he must too! He’s not. And he got bullied and teased because of me for a couple of years. Yet I never knew. No one bullied me or teased me. We were always near each other so I don’t get how I didn’t know. There’s TOO many times I didn’t know. I have a horrible memory and plus me being dense as a brick it’s annoying. I cause lots of problems for him just by being near him. I kinda follow him everywhere like dog, and people assume things, and they get to him. Lately I’ve just been messing up a lot. Being an ass to him and all. I forget important things and don’t understand things and mess it up for him. Yet... he’s still my friend. He even says I’m a GOOD friend. All my friends do... But I’m not. At least to him. No one else has a problem with me but him. Yet he still doesn’t do anything really. He gets mad sure but... nothing. I’ve tried to stop being friends with him twice before by ghosting him but everyone I knew wondered why I wasn’t talking with him and were relaying his question if I was okay. I just end up slowly going back to him. He once got so mad at me for a joke I made that he tried to stop being friends with me, later he realized what the joke was and felt sorry for misunderstanding. 
I shouldn’t’ve told him what I meant and should’ve let him leave. 
There’s lots of times where I mess up, and there’s times where he messes up. I end up telling him it’s okay and that it wasn’t a problem and he gets confused on why I’m so forgiving with him. It’s because it wouldn’t be fair if I wasn’t! The times I’ve messed up with his so dumb. Yet we still both want to stay friends. But I want to leave for his sake. It’s not a fair or healthy friendship.
TLDR: I mess up too much to where it’s insane and I feel like I’m a horrible friend so I want to it end the friendship.",28Apr2020,1
120,"I purchased N95 masks for an immuno-compromised family member who is traveling across the US next month. I'm trying to test them for authenticity before using, and I'm not sure that these tests went right.

I sprayed an aerosol can into one of the masks, with unclear results. I also poured water into a mask, possibly too much water, and it seems like it leak through. Notably that was after using the aerosol spray. I'm not sure what's supposed to happen when pouring water in but it seems like it should hold a certain amount in. Also, I opened it up and burned the middle layer which seems to have disintegrated the way it is supposed to.

121,"Hello! I think this is my first post about roomates. I'm a woman that lives with two male roomates. This is about COVID-19 and quarentine, but also about small details I noticed, I'm thinking about moving out... I was wondering if maybe I was being too exageratted or if maybe I´m being fair in my decision. I've been gastlighted before, so maybe I'm just being paranoid and it is all in my head, but my gut is telling me differently.

I'm sorry for my broken English, it is not my primary languge, any correction to be more clear is welcome.

I wasn't sure if we were able to talk about the virus, please let me know if I broke any rule, I will edit or erase my post accordingly.

.

.

I will call my roomate that is also a coworker ""Ravenclaw"" because I bet he is one, he is the one whith the landlord contract. And I will call the new roomate ""Slytherin"" because he got that result in the Harry Potter test. (I'm sorry, I'm a fan and didn't come up with better nicknames)

I'm having trouble talking with Slytherin about certain temporary rules in the appartment while all of this quarentinne thing is happening, to ensure we all follow basic hygienne meassures for this coronavirus thing, you know the basics: avoid going out, if you go out try to change your shoes when you come back, sanitize your groceries, and so on. It is important for me because I have a familiar with cancer and I would like to be healthy if he needs to go to surgery... or needs anything. Only one other person and I can do that...

Now, about the Slytherin roomate. When I first talked with him about the rules he answered ""NO"" to the changing clothes rule becuase ""he has a small wardrobe"".  Since then, I'm having trouble talking with him about anything, even small thing like who's turn to take out the trash is, and so on. Now he's reluctant to talk about even small stuff like bathroom rules or common room rules... he answers deffesive to everything, instantly comes up with a complain about something I did and that he just decided in that exact momment to tell me (and not before, maybe around the date it happened). About concerns about COVID-19 he always responds skeptical saying that ""he has friends in Italy that say everything is just fine"", and he had said before that he was planning to go to the beach and buying flight tickets with his friend... in the middle of the current pandemic! I feel this is a defensive and closed posture... and dangerous!, but I'm not sure, I tend to find difficult to read social cues.

I don't have proof, but I hear him coming home at night, I've seen him going out frecquently, I've seen him going out and coming back without a face mask (we recently bought 3 reusables, one for each) and not changing shoes or washing his hand immidietaly after entering the appartment. I don't think he even reads the sanitizing wipes instructions and just ""gives a fast wipe to stuff"" (spoiler: it is not enough, it has to be wet for about 4 to 5 minuts).

Ravenclaw tries to follow the temporary rules and doesn't follow them perfectly, but at least he tries. He goes out because he has ""migrains"" and needs to walk, but changes his shoes when coming in and sanitize his groceries.

I talked about the attitude I felt from Slytherin, with Ravenclaw, and he said that I need to be ready if he won't follow the temporary rules because he (Ravenclaw) can't ""make him"" (Slytherin) do anything because he has the right to do whatever he wants because we all pay rent.

And I said ok, fine, I'll try to clean as much as possible and protect myself from them. I've been trying to clean as much as possible. Sometimes I move things that they leave in the open because it's on the way and I need to clean (btw, they don't clean often).

Today I received a text message in the roomates whatsapp group from Slytherin that it was ""unacceptable"" to move ""his stuff"" and wanted to call for a meeting. I mean... they both blatantly ignored me when I tried to call for a meeting about the COVID-19 temporary rules and now suddenly it is necessary to have a meeting because of some fruit that wasn't on ""it's place"" (which is in the open, not his gabinet, not the place where we all put our fruit and veggies, no, in the open, the equivalent of the middle of the table).

I'm thinking about moving out with my brother, I don't trust being safe here...  On my town the quarentine will be extended for at least two more months, I don't have to money to pay rent for two months if I won't be there. But maybe I'm being too paranoid or misunderstood the whole situation?. Is it too much if I bring up all of this and say I can't stay in a place that I don't feel safe, where I won't be able to talk about rules and trust them being followed by Slytherin, and where Ravenclaw takes a ""neutral"" position, which is as equally bad? What would you do in this sittuation?

.

.

TL;DR:  I can't have assertive communication with one roomate and also can't trust him following the hygienne protocols for coronavirus/Covid-19, I've noticed he is a selfish person in general, and also ""skeptical"" about the COVID-19 subject. And the other roomate is way too ""neutral"" and won't force any rules in any of us. Expressing my concerns they both have made me feel I'm being exagerated. Is it too much if I move out as soon as possible to do quarentine in a safe place? On my town the quarentine will be extended for at least two more months, I don't have to money to pay rent for two months if I won't be there.

So as the title says 246 days ago I was at the end of line in my closed mind at that time, I didn’t see a point in living I didn’t want to commit suicide because I was scared of it failing nor did I want to live anymore.

I made a post on this account asking for advice, help, Any reason to keep going, I received inspirational words from the people that saw my small post and kept on fighting and decided to change my lifestyle. (Post has been deleted since I apologise)

I spoke to close friends and they helped me a lot, I felt better but not ‘better’ for a while it was great but it came back, then I met this girl she was amazing she helped with it a lot. We spoke for hours everyday and finally decided to meet up she distracted me from my problems and gave me new hope for life, we ended up getting together but problems occurred. I don’t regret the relationship at all it was a rocky six months but it was amazing at times. Back to my point about depression I fell deep back into it once we broke up but realised that what was said during the breakup (wasn’t fun very toxic) she broke me down and made me feel like I was worthless but It allowed me to rebuild and better myself from a near blank canvas, I changed a ton about myself, especially my mindset and the way I viewed life, I found happiness within myself and started to love myself for the first time ever.

I’ve changed so much since my first ever post  and I wanted to share it here for some reason, life is beautiful when you find your own happiness it took me a breakup to realise that for myself but now I’m more confident, healthier and a ton more happier in my own life. I wish I still had the accounts that left comments for me so I could tag and thank them because they were the first step to this new me.

For anyone that sees this and is struggling with a tough time or needing someone to talk to/listen feel free to message I love you all and we all deserve the happiness we seek.

128," I have a project that sat idle for months and recently blew up big time. It involves reserving time slots for work to be completed at a significant profit per slot. Overnight, likely due to COVID19, the business took off and all of my reservations for the next three weeks are completely booked. Without going into too much detail, the earning potential is substantial. I am going to try and scale and take advantage of this increase in demand but have a slight dilemma.

I am the head partner in a business (primary source of income) and don't know if I should include my partners in my new business's profits. They are semi-related (both in health care) but not connected. I do use some of the existing business's infrastructure (subscriptions, malpractice insurance, etc) but it doesn't add any existing cost to current business so it doesn't impact my primary partnerships in any way.

Should I include my partners in this? At the risk of sounding greedy - after DOZENS of failed personal projects/companies, retaining equity in a big pie like this is kind of what I've been working for. There is a chance they might feel left out/betrayed, and considering the earning potential, would not be surprised if they felt compelled to litigate. That said, this project is a completely different business (organized solely by me) and unrelated other than the ways mentioned above. I'm not against sharing some of the profits (considering I am using some existing infrastructure - although I can now afford to buy personally) but this type of situation is well outside our current OA.

April 16th

Mom- Hey we've been feeling under the weather over here, I think leo should stay in this weekend. I'm also wondering if this back and forth is practical while the shelter order is in place and with the US being the epicenter of this health crisis now. Seems unnecessarily risky, especially since your exposure is high with your profession. 

Me-I understand your concern but my work and I are taking precautions to prevent infection, we're wearing enhanced PPE during contact with all patients, patients are screened before our arrival to determine if they are possibly infected, and if we do come in contact with a positive COVID-19 patient they tell us and test/quarantine us. Currently there are 265 confirmed cases in city county and my work has only transported 10 positive patients as of today, none of which I have had. With all of that in mind and the fact that we're currently at the  decline of the curve I don't see a high likelihood of becoming infected or the necessity to stay away. Of course I did come in contact with a positive patient I would let you know and stay away from Leo and get tested for it. The chances of me coming in contact with a positive patient are very slim at this time with fresnos over half a million population and only 265 known cases and my constant use of PPE in and outside of patient contact. 

Mom- 265 CONFIRMED cases. There are a lot of people walking around who are asymptomatic or have very minor symptoms. The fact of the matter is testing people is expensive and it isn't done until people have textbook symptoms. This gives the impression of this being smaller than it actually is. Some countries with small populations tested their entire population and found that over half the population had it even though a fraction of those who tested positive had very little to no symptoms. I've been paying attention when I've been going out, people aren't taking proper precautions and even find them annoying. They touch their faces, the insides of their masks, they dont distance from one another, they crowd, the protest when safety protocols are put in place and yet they hoard foods and resources anyways. I have very little faith in our community being responsible because I see them doing
 everything but being responsible. I refuse to inadvertently infect others and create suffering where there doesn't need to be any. Beyond that I have an autoimmune disorder and this puts me at high risk. I'm not going to jeopardize the health of my family or myself. Furthermore we aren't feeling well right now, and I dont think leo should go over this weekend. I do not agree with you, I think the risk is high right now, I think the risk of us getting sick through you is high, and I think us getting you sick and getting the people you transport sick is high regardless of symptoms that are or aren't being shown. Doing anything other than distancing right now would be extremely irresponsible for everyone. 

Me- What have childs symptoms been? I'm alright with him staying with you this weekend but I would like to come back to this. Your opinion of how people are dealing with this doesn't necessarily reflect the current situation going on in city, I agree I don't want to inadvertently infect anyone, I wouldn't go around child if I knew I could possibly give it to him or you or anyone but I'm seeing this from the front line, what's going on in the hospitals, the infection rates, and type of people who are becoming infected in city, not one of my coworkers has been infected and we are being tested if there is any chance we came in contact with someone infected along with constantly wearing PPE and taking all sanitary precautions.

Me- Also I would like to make up for the days I miss with him also. 

Mom- These aren't opinions, these are facts. My opinions pertain to what I said about my faith in humanity. The facts I'm presenting you with come from paying attention to how things are being hit globally, and from health experts who have spoken on the matter. I understand you are a driver for ambulances but you aren't a dr. I'm listening  to drs and health officials. Child doesn't really have symptoms beyond being a bit sluggish, and fussy. I on the other hand have a low fever. We're not going anywhere until I figure out why we dont feel well. 

Me- Those facts from other city's and countrys not what is happening here In city and what the situation is like in city county. I'm not saying I'm a doctor but I'm also getting constant updates from my work, doctor's, and health officials/hospitals on the current state of the virus in city, almost daily updates from the city county department of public health. Right now we are on the down curve of this pandemic, this reaction from you would have been more understandable two weeks ago when We were on the upcurve and infection rates in city were the highest, believe me I have been bombarded every day by facts, news, and doctors pertaining to this virus and the current state of it because I'm an Emergency Medical Technician. Also the normal seasonal cold, flu's, and other dieseases are still going around like two weeks ago when I missed my weekend with child because I had a cold but wanted to make sure it wasn't something more severe. Please believe me when I say I would not make any decision that could be detrimental to childs health or your health. I am more than well educated about this virus. 

Mom- Here's the thing, you dont get to decide what is and isn't an understandable reaction from me. Do not tone police me. Ever. Ive been civil with you and I expect the same. Also just because things seem to be getting better doesn't mean they are better, and it also doesn't mean we aren't at risk. The fact of the matter is that there is risk, that's the whole point of this conversation. There's risk that I'm not willing to take. I'm not going to go off of what your opinions are, I'm going to go off of my gut and what I'm hearing from health officials.  

Me- Wow alright, I feel like that was blown out of proportion a bit and wasn't how I was coming across but ok. Honestly I've been trying to extend an olive branch to you a bit, try and come to terms and build a better relationship for child which is why I have been inviting you to events with him and I. I do my best to be as civil with you as possible and try to have my messages come out that way but as you know it's hard to decipher and properly express emotions through text without it being misconstrued. I digress, I'm ok with you keeping Leo this weekend since you're all not feeling well but come next weekend if you're all feeling better to still keep having child my normal times unless something else comes up. I would like to speak on the phone with him on Saturday though, picking him up and spending time with him is the highlight of my week. 

Mom- An olive branch? Dad do you know the things child tells me when he comes home? Let's talk about that. That you gave him a tactical knife for Christmas and he played with it unsupervised and that its kept in his room, and that he cut himself with it even, that you're always hurting his feelings and he tells me about how you told him he looked bad in his clothes so now hes sobbing to me and saying he needs to lose weight. Hes a small child, they go through awkward growth stages and get squishy before they get taller, it's normal. Do you know how hard it is, as a mother to bite my tongue and smile at him when I send him off with you over the weekend and hes so sad to go? That he dreads it all day leading up to going to see you that hes just not himself? That he's so mentally and emotionally checked out on fridays that it's like he isn't even here. Put yourself in my shoes for a minute,
 and tell me you'd feel fondly about me if you were in my position and he was acting this way to go see me. I would love to have a nice relationship with you and your family but tell me how I'm supposed to have that when constantly seeing leo so upset about how you make him feel when hes with you, and that anytime I've tried to connect with you guys it just ends terribly. At this point I'm settling for civil, we dont need to like each other we just need to communicate about leo. I dont doubt this is the highlight of your week, leo is such an awesome kid. Hes such a smart, sensitive little person, I love his silliness, I love his company. We're required to coparent civilly that's it. 

Me- I never gave him a tactical knife, my mom gave him a multi tool with pliers as a Christmas gift because he asked for one and ya he accidently cut himself once on it but after that he learned not to use it like that. He has never expressed  Any of that to me, and I wish you would have told me these things and sooner so I know how he is feeling and can change it, so I can be a better father for him. When he's with me we have fun, we play laugh and joke together and sometimes he doesn't tell me how a joke really makes him feel. I'm always open to hearing how I can be better for him, what I can say or do to make him happier, you're around him allot more than I am, you understand him more, let's coparent and talk about these things for child

April 17th

Me- I've been thinking about what you said allot, and I don't know what he tells you about when he's over here but it doesn't make much sense. When child is here and we get home him and I have a good time, we play, laugh, talk and lately have been having some great conversations just talking about life. I take him on hikes and walks, try to get him out of the house and move a bit, you're making it sound like he dreads coming here all the time and is miserable when he's here which is the opposite of what I see when he's here and we're spending time together. There have been plenty of times he's told me he doesn't want to leave. Now I'm not saying I'm the best dad but I'm trying my best and always looking for ways to improve myself for him. Like I said before I'm always open to suggestions and I want you to communicate with me with how child feels because he doesn't always express himself to me. But don't try and say that I'm always hurting his feeling and he's miserable to come here because I see differently. You don't see the good times we have, the conversations or the heart felt moments. But I want you to, I want to be able to do events and things with all of us because I feel it will be great for child but that all begins with communication. I'm glad you told me everything you had last night, it's made me self reflect allot. I hope you all feel better, tell child I love him and am thinking about him. 

April 24th

Mom- I got child a phone. I'm sending it with him this weekend. This will make it easier for you or I to contact him. I've set parental controls on it and I've instructed him on how to stay safe on it. His phone is to not be taken from him for any reason. If there is an issue you have regarding his phone you and I can talk about it and leo is to be left out of that conversation so he is never at any point put in the middle. Have a nice weekend.  

Me- Ok, I think that's great. Is he on a plan or is it a pay by the minute phone? I'll help pay for it. 

Mom- I put him on a prepaid plan. They're cheaper and it works for what he needs right now.

Me- Ok I'll pay for half of it. How much is half and how should I get it to you? Let me know when you re up it again and I'll send you more. 

Me- What's the code for the parental control that you put on the switch?

April 25th

Mom- When you give the Nintendo switch to child, there needs to be parental controls on it. Strangers have been trying to talk to him on Fortnite. Fornites ratings are also Inappropriate for an 8 year old. There's actually a lot written about the game on parenting sites. There's been lots of scandal with pedophiles hanging out on it. Some people made mods so that they could sexually assault a young girls character on the game awhile back. Child told me he actually turned off the chat settings so people wouldn't talk to him. The code is 8452 I think. I need to hear you say parental controls will be in use when Leo's on the Nintendo switch.

Me- Don't worry They will be in use when child uses it. The first thing I did when he downloaded Fortnite was turn off voice communications for that reason. no one has ever been able to talk to him on it. 

Mom- child isn't going to be playing fortnite, right? For that reason?

Me- If you don't want him playing fortnite I'll delete it off the switch if it's still on there.

Mom- My question is more geared towards why he was even playing this game if you knew about these issues. 

Me- I turned off voice  communications so no one could speak to him and he couldn't speak to anyone else, the other issues you stated I had never heard of before, I believe the game is fine for him to play as long as there are no voice communications. 

Me- But if you have an issue with him playing it then I will delete the game. 

April 26th

Mom- You and I have a lot of things to talk about later. Child said you told him that you're deleting things and telling him its because I wanted you to. I never said that. As a matter of fact i never responded to you. I thought you and I had an agreement on not putting child in the middle of things. This is me telling you your putting him in the middle and that your right on the borderline of breaching a court agreement about saying things about me to child that diminish his love or respect of the other parent. I'm not interested in arguing with you and I'm not interested in debating if you did or did not in fact do any of these things, they happened, they are going to stop that's the end of it. And you will NOT blow up my phone because you don't like that I'm calling you out. 

Me- I said I deleted Fortnite because you had a problem with it. that's it. I have in no way,  nor have I ever attempted to tell child anything that may diminish his love for you. 

Mom- And you see no issue with that? You dont see how that puts him in the middle or how that may build resentment towards me? 

Me- No I don't because if I had an issue with something and took something away or deleted a game I would tell him that I had an issue with it which I have done before. He's old enough to understand that the decisions we make for him are in his best interest even if he doesn't necessarily like them regardless of which parent makes them. I don't see resentment build up in him towards me when I tell him he can't watch something or play something because he understands I'm thinking of what's best for him. Nor did I tell him I had any problem with deleting the game from his switch. 

Mom- Your actions are your own and my actions are my own. There's a huge difference. DO NOT EVER act on my behalf. How are we even needing to have this conversation about boundaries? Why is this such a difficult concept for you? This IS an issue and I'm telling you it's going to stop. I dont know how you ever expect to have healthy conversations with child or I if you cannot respect basic boundaries or see an issue with you violating them! Why does there always need to be so much drama anytime you get called out? Why can't you just apologize when your wrong or at a minimum try to get on the same page? This is exhausting and creates nothing but dysfunction.

Me- I've been trying to be as calm and cooperative with you as possible when we speak, you ask me questions and I answer and respond in a timely manner and take everything into Consideration. I don't try to ""call you out"" on things pertaining to your parenting or how you speak to me. I don't ignore your messages because that leaves questions unanswered and both of us wondering. I understand your concerns and I'm sorry for any harm I may have caused as it was not my intention. you must see that it takes two people trying In order  for communication to work out and I don't agree with the way you have been talking to me, this can all be said and expressed in a calm manner that is more likely to lead to resolution rather than one side becoming very upset and ""calling out"" the other. saying ""hey I don't appreciate that you said this/that because i feel it can cause this/that."" Is more than enough to get your message across and prevent further aggression and issues rather than extrapolating the issue. I'm sorry. I will listen to your concerns and I won't be saying anything like that to child again. Please in the future consider the way you're speaking and how that may affect our communication towards each other.

Mom- Tone policing is another thing we are going to talk about at some point. I've been as patient and respectful as possible and you know what frankly I'm pissed off. I'm allowed to be pissed. I'm allowed to express that something isn't okay. The fact remains that things have been elevated to this point. You chose to act on my behalf. You chose to violate those boundaries. Why wouldn't I be angry about that? Of course that makes me angry. The only time I've experienced apologies from you is when I feel like you dont think you can make the conversation go your way so you just apologize so you can just drop the conversation altogether. It's a common avoidance tactic used by a lot of people. That isn't a valid apology and that still isn't a valid way to end a conversation. The issue remains unsolved and my anger is still present and I'm still expected to just go about like things likeeverything is fine when I'm speaking to you. I will not go about things like they are fine and I will say something when there's an issue. This is also a dynamic that puts me in a bad position where I have to account for all of that nonsense. Therfore making me the bad guy, yet another avoidance tactic that allows you to take the high road out. See how frustrating it is on my side? How do you expect me to talk to you with all of this nonsense in place? Because this is absolute nonsense. Also calling this nonsense isn't aggressive, its as detached as it can be. I am as detached as I can be from this conversation. 

Me- I expect and want you to say something when you have an issue, that's how things get worked out but the way you express those issues dictates how the conversation is going to go. I'm not trying to tone police you, you have the right to have your feelings I'm only expressing my own feelings and what may help with future issues regarding both of us to lead to a healthy and mutual understanding without the drama. I meant everything I said in the last message especially when I stated I will not say anything like that to child again. I don't see how you can expect a healthy resolution to come out of the initial message you sent me with how it was worded. This issue and others can easily be solved with calm and polite words that don't exagerate or attack an individual but leaves both of us happy and feeling like we are listened to by one another. I'm really trying here, I'm not trying to aggravate you, police you, call you out, make you the bad guy, or belittle you. Only trying to come to a mutual point where we can come to one another with issues in a healthy manner that leads to an easy understanding we are both happy with and feel listened to. 

Me- I'm not trying to use any ""tactics"" you have stated, I've never even heard of those before you. I have child's best interest at heart and part of that is for him to have a happy relationship with you so I would never try to jeopardize that. I'm trying my best to coparent with you, be a good father for child, and do everything else I need to do in order to keep a good home for child and myself. Ask yourself how you would feel and respond if I had sent you all the messages you sent me. I only want the absolute best for child that I can possibly give him and being able to communicate with you In a healthy manner is part of that. I feel as though you only think the worst of me but I assure you my true intentions are the complete opposite. I'm not the same person I was a year ago and I'm constantly looking for ways to improve myself as a person but mostly as a father so chld can have the father I never did.

Mom- You know, just saying that you're not doing something regardless of how conscious that action may or may not be doesn't mean you aren't doing it. The fact remains that the dynamics I mentioned are in place weather you agree with that or not. Please read the attached definition of tone policing, then reread the messages you've sent me today before responing. You will find that the definition applies to those messages and several others that we've exchanged in the last few weeks.

Me- You can think that all you want but that is in no way what i was trying to do. I've taken everything you have said into deep consideration and responded to it accordingly. It doesn't make it ok for you to talk to me and say everything you have to me In the way you have because it doesn't solve anything it only makes everyone more aggrevated and worsens the situation while diminishing our thoughts and respect for one another. I don't believe you can go back through our messages and say you have been respectful towards me the whole time. I'll be more than happy to talk to you about any issue you bring up I'm just asking you to bring it up in a calm, respectful manner as I have tried my best to do with you this entire time because it is healthier for you and I and therefore will be healthier for child. Issues will be solved allot quicker and both of us will be happier for it. That is co-parenting. Nothing would get better if I were to respond to you with the same anger and aggression as you have been responding to me. Wether we like it or not we're both going to be In child's life forever and therefore have to communicate with each other so let's make the best of it we can for childs sake. 

Mom- Alright dad I tried with you, and you aren't hearing me. The definition of tone policing I sent you applies to the message you just sent me and all the others to a T. This isn't getting anywhere and it's not going to and you've made it very clear to me that future communication is more than likely going to be exactly like this. You dont get to throw a fit and have things go your way, that just doesn't work in adult relationships. You're not going to tone police me and gaslight me and then make demands, that's just not going to be a thing. So here's what we're going to do, communication is going to continue to be as minimal as possible to maintain function, I'm not going to waste time trying to reach you. I'm done responding to you on this and all future matters beyond what's absolutely nessary. I dont have the time or energy for this nonsense. As for the other nonsense from last week I'll send you my response when I have the energy. That's it, that's all I have the energy to say to you.

Me- I'm sorry I said that to child yesterday, I promise it won't happen again. I just want what's best for child and to have healthy communication with you. Enjoy your week.",28Apr2020,1
138,"My roommate sleeps in the room below me. I know he has sleep apnea and some times he wakes himself up from snoring so hard he can’t breathe (I’ve heard my mom do it before so I recognize it). However, lately I’ve noticed that he is yelling, talking, grunting, and making really strange noises in his sleep. I’m not worried about the sound, I have headphones and earplugs, I can easily tune it out. But the noises he is making are scary. I know I have to talk to him about it because I don’t know if he knows he is doing it or not and he must be exhausted sleeping like that all night. I’m just wondering if anyone has heard of this or has any suggestions about how to approach the topic or if I should just mind my business. We have lived together for 3 years and this seems new. 

My roommate has mental illness and a drug habit (cocaine and alcohol mostly I think) and he is very overweight. I only state that in case any of it relates to what is going on. He has always been kind to me and never offensive in any way. I have felt relatively safe here for 3 years but I have a key lock on my bedroom door and a security camera. I am planning to move out in September. Any ideas what is going on here and how I should handle it?",28Apr2020,1

140,"So I (24) dated a girl (21) in 2018, she had a lot of personal issues and I ended up breaking up with her mid last year or so, a few months after that we mutually decided to try our hand at a friendship. She deals with depression and really severe anxiety and has for a long time. I myself go through a fair share of mental health problems and have for years, but am at a point in my life where I'm relatively stable. Our friendship has always been rocky - despite us not being in a relationship, she can still be really manipulative and controlling. I spend a lot of time essentially being an on-call therapist and staying up late talking her down from mental breakdowns, to a point where at any given moment I'm afraid I'll have to drop everything because I'll get a call from her about an anxiety attack or issue with her roommate. I've neglected a lot of my personal friendships and hobbies giving her my time and trying to take care of her. I try to set healthy boundaries, but it's hard to find the right balance because over the course of the last year her mental health has gotten increasingly worse, she has been struggling with self harm, constantly feeling like she's not good enough, and like she has no future. Between me, her family, and her circle of friends, there's been a few scares of her packing a few bags and skipping town in no specific direction, but her mental health hasn't been quite bad enough for it to actually happen. This evening she sent me a few texts that she was just letting me know in case her mom texted me that she was leaving and she was sorry. I haven't responded because I'm not sure there's anything I can do/I'm not sure what to do. I figure I should probably let her parents know what's going on, and probably get some of her friends in the loop, but I have no idea where she is and I'm scared to try to contact her because she has a really short fuse and I don't to be responsible if she does anything really dangerous. Any advice is welcome.

TL;DR: An unhealthy ex of mine that I'm still friends with texted me to let me know she was running away and I'm at a loss what to do.",28Apr2020,1

142,"So I’ve been having this issue much more prominently lately with my friends and people I know. 

A little about me; I’m not a super smart person but I am adamant about gaining the knowledge on how to do things and finding out what is possible about things and what isn’t. I’m a logical thinker kind of person and have the highest level of common sense thinking you could possibly achieve 😂 (jk but seriously) (like for example I can figure my way around any computer but I’m not super smart with computers but everyone always asks me for computer help but like I don’t know code language or C++ or whatever) So like if there’s a problem and there’s something I need to do then I WILL find a way to do it. 

So lately several of the friends in my life have been saying or doing things that drive me insane. For example, one friend.. let’s call her Jane. Jane needs to translate some Korean text on a piece of paper. People tell her “just use a translate app” she says “I have an iPhone it doesn’t do picture translate like the good phones do lol” meanwhile me, sitting here in Korea, using my IPHONE constantly to translate things... the google translate app has the camera setting that will translate any words you hover the camera over.... 

I just get so irritated by these dumb kinds of things. Like did Jane just not even look to see if something like that was available for iPhone? Why did she just assume that it wasn’t? Is it laziness? Idiocy? 

It’s not all of my friends that do this... only a few. And also some friends of my friends that I wish I didn’t have to talk to. It’s like some synapses in their brains just aren’t connecting... or firing... whatever. Or it’s just laziness and people don’t want to put forth the effort to think and solve and learn. I just feel like I have too much sense sometimes and it’s almost painful watching people putter around without the sense. 

My question for you, is how can I tone down this annoying superiority complex??? I don’t want to get irritated and constantly call these people out for the dumbness. The tone that happens is sort of like “...... uh.......??” And it’s just such an assholeish tone. I don’t want to lose my friendships but I don’t want to harbor annoyance either. I don’t like being condescending to my friends. Most of the time I just don’t answer their questions to solve their issues because I just KNOW I can’t do it without making them feel like an idiot... so I let someone else. I also don’t want to feel sorry for them. Like “oh dear they’re too dumb to understand so let me just tell them in a nice way to make their life easier.” 

I don’t know what to dooooo this is happening every day now and I just want to beat my own ass for having these thoughts.. please help 😭",28Apr2020,1

So I am currently a high school senior and I was planning to move out after I finish school and start being a adult. However, because of the pandemic I can't find a job and I can't stand staying with my toxic family. I get into arguments every single day and I can't stand it.

Also I was planning on going to trade school and becoming an electrician but now there is no way me or my parents can afford it anymore. I'm stuck between being unable to find a job, being in a toxic environment, and scared about the future.

147,"I’ve done a lot of shit in my life I regret, and recently I’ve been realizing I’ve had a lot of mental trouble. I seem “normal” around my friends, my family thinks I’m psychotic, I left them so they don’t have to deal with my bullshit and lies anymore. I went to a therapist for a few months but I’ve never been able to fully open up, I have a casual conversation, talk about my depression and anxiety, I’m not sure but I feel like he doesn’t believe I have that either. My parents believe I’m on hard drugs, I’m only on nicotine and occasionally weed. I RARELY drink. I guess I’ve come here to confess but also looking for advice. 

For years I have tried to answer questions about reality that nobody can answer. People often say I’m very very smart. I believe it’s my personality because I’m dumb as hell. I’ve nearly failed out of grade school, I lied to myself thinking I could do college and now I’m in debt without benefits of education. I struggle to learn because when I’d have episodes of depression I’d bang my head on the wall until I’m unconscious, which now I regret because I have to write everything I need to remember on my phone because I can’t remember for shit, much less comprehend advanced mathematics. 

I grew up with helicopter parents that wanted the best for me and did everything in their power to do help, I’m a bad apple apparently. I helped bring my parents into their mid life crisis with me admitting I had issues with depression, and now they worry I’m going to kill myself. They found a small knife in my room and thought I was attacking people with it. No blood on the knife, I use it for boxes and myself. I do not have the balls to be aggressive towards someone, much less attack them. 

I don’t really know where I went wrong but I just need some sort of acceptance. I’m on prozac and that’s helped a lot with depression issues, I keep falling into sad areas but I’ve been mostly positive, and I do my best to not bring others around me down. Literally nobody around me knows what is going on inside my fucked up head besides me and I want to ask for help from a professional than reddit, but money and the fact I’ll probably be locked up for being “at risk”. 

I thought about what I want my future to be today, I really don’t know. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life besides trying to pass the time, and wait to die, I’m hesitant to shoot myself because of brain activity after I’m deceased has a chance to continue, and I’ll be in hell for three days, which seems like years since the perception of time is gone.

150,"So my (21f) dad (56m) is ignoring me. I have been at home for a month now because of covid and he has been home since last year because hes on medical leave due to his cancer. Last year around this time he was ignoring me also, it had been going for about half a year before we started talking again. I didn’t mind it so much at that time because I would go to school and then right to work afterwards, I was gone most of the time and had tons of other stuff to worry about. But now that we are both at home all day it has made the home environment very tense. What initiated this ignoring was that I was working on a paper in my room that was due that night, and he had come into my room to ask me if I was going to pick up my mom from work the next day. I was really stressed about my paper and replied “You just go her” and he started yelling at me. He said that I disrespected him, that he had just asked a question, and proceeded to yell in general right outside my room to my mom. I had to put on headphones and work on the paper because he was being so loud. Now it has been 2 weeks and he is ignoring me, like he was last time. He does not acknowledge my presence, he does not speak to me, and he goes to pick up my mom from work which I previously used to do. Ive been telling my mom how much it bothers me, how I feel like a ghost in my own house, and how difficult it is to be in the same space with him, even if we are in separate rooms, for the day while I finish up my papers for the rest of the term. She doesn’t suggest anything and she doesn’t communicate how I’m feeling to him. She is numb to him and takes the brunt of most of his actions. My brother is off in his own world and barely speaks to the rest of us. 

I do understand that he’s on heavy medication and with the chemo treatments, he is not feeling well and is obviously experiencing side effects. 

But I also don’t think this is an excuse to be emotionally abusive to his entire family. He constantly says how if he did the things I was doing when he was a kid he would get kicked out, he would sleep in the barn, how different life was for him (my parents are both Russian and grew up very differently than I did, I grew up in Canada in the city). When we are on speaking terms he constantly tells me how rude I am, how I’m an awful person, how I’m arrogant, how ashamed I should feel of myself. He takes one thing I say or do personally and the cycle of ignoring will start again. He has been doing this my entire life, but now that he is sick it is amplified. Things are very tense in the house and I feel like I’m suffocating here. 

I simply don’t know what to do at this point. Talking with him is difficult because there’s a language barrier and he erupts and starts to yell. I badly want to move out but don’t have much disposable from being laid off. Any suggestions or advice?",28Apr2020,1

He started questioning me so hard then would ask the same questions in a round about way trying to catch me in a lie, it made me so uncomfortable. After that he emailed me twice, again attempting to catch me out. 

He then told me how much I’ve put everyone out, that he has to now pay $3k in cleaning fees to clean the store I work, and he has no other staff to cover the shifts so he won’t be able to open the shop... which is completely his fault as only 2 people work there and one has been conveniently on holiday for the last month.

In the past five years, I have been in 2 relationships. The first one lasted about 3.5 years and he decided that he doesn’t want a relationship. That broke my heart. I couldn’t really understand where I went wrong. I pretty much started obsessing on the fact that I failed and no one will date me. It took me almost a year to finally accept it and move on. 

A few months ago, I went to visit my dad’s birth country. People there are very old fashioned and if you are not married with kids, you have failed at life. Somehow, my extended family ended up convincing me and set me up with someone. 

The guy was nice at first but after a week of talking he began to ask when I am going to marry him and have his kids. It was very weird. He did stop talking about that but eventually started mentioning how he wants a woman that can care for him. Come to find out, he was talking to me just because he felt like I can provide him with a good life. I am a US citizen so he basically wanted to marry me for visa reasons. He also told me that he is seeing 5+ girls and he is telling them that he is going to marry them. 

After learning this, I texted him immediately and told him that I can’t do this. He never responded so I started worrying that I hurt his feelings. Because of my anxiety, I tend to blame myself for everything. My head says I did the right thing but my heart says I was too quick to reach a conclusion. I felt so guilty and overwhelmed so I sent him another text apologizing. As expected, he was irritated and told me that he is tired of my drama and the fact that I always want to discuss things with him. 

I am now feeling very anxious and having random panic attacks. I feel like I will never find someone else since I am getting old. I am obsessing over every little things we talked about. I am exhausted and the anxiety is killing me. I would have loved to talk to a professional about it but their offices are closed. I know my anxiety makes me needy.

I was not feeling the idea of watching my hairline slowly fade away so I took the plunge and shaved off all my hair.

It's always been my dream to go into the police service, I've never seen my self in anything else. Like most young and naive people I applied right out of school but was told I was too young so while waiting to apply again I got lost in my current job where I started off as a beginner. I worked my ass of for 4 years to reach where I am today.

Its my passion, I still yearn to join however in reality Its like starting over, I have bills to pay now, I have a loan, I have a child. Things aren't as easy as just going one day to apply.

People who've had to chose between your passion and what was more of a calculated decision. How do you feel now? Does it still bother you? Do you regret it?

163,"My mother didn't graduate high school. Actually, I think she only completed 8th grade. Lately she's been posting a lot on facebook almost a year after a really tough divorce and she's been getting a lot of positive attention; Until the other day when she called me ranting about 2 people on her facebook who like to make fun of ""how she spells."" As an example, she messaged me last night ""amajined"" instead of imagined. I love her to death and I want to ease her into being a little more literate, but I'm not sure how to approach it. 

I do worry about the men giving her positive attention/ignoring her crazy spelling, thinking she's a dumb whatever because of how they may portray her posts.

Another example: I said, ""closeNt"" instead of closet until I was approximately 10 years old because that's how she pronounced it and probably spells it. My step dad would belittle her and call her names about things like that instead of helping her, which is how I realized I was pronouncing it incorrectly. That's also why I don't want to jump her shit, but I'd really like to help her maybe want to spell better? She thinks she's dumb and has this ""everyone can fuck off attitude"" but the potential to do better is there.

She's also 100% disabled so there's really no drive from a work place for her spelling.

Any suggestions?

TLDR: my mom is terrible at spelling and thinks she has no reason to learn how to spell common words like imagined (amajined) 
She was also mentally abused for years and I'm not sure how to address it and help her out.",28Apr2020,1

169,"My best friend and I (both 21) have been best friends for close to 7 years, and have lived together for over 2 years. 

This is our first apartment where it’s just the two of us. 

I’ve noticed overtime, especially lately, a lot of things where he has problems and needs to “set a boundary” or talk to me about fixing something. 
Like he talked to me about how keeping the living room and kitchen fairly pristine is important for him to feel comfortable in the common spaces. 
I never left things super messy or dirty, but I took his request to heart as an opportunity to learn to be tidier. So I got into the habit of every night before bed, tidying up the kitchen and living room. Only thing is, that’s made me realize that he actually leaves things out a lot. Trash, food he forgot to put away, etc. I never cared before, but now that I feel like there’s an expectation of me not to leave things around, it’s feel weird that he’s actually not very “pristine” in his own dealings around the house. 

In other aspects, he does things like acts very touchy feely sometimes, which is fine, and I never make him feel weird about it. But then when I try to initiate any physical contact he acts kind of repulsed and weirded out that I’m touching him, even if it’s just a pat on the back. 

Same with possessions, I always share whatever he needs and don’t really care about him asking to use some of my butter or milk or whatever. But then when I did the same thing he needed to set a boundary. 

There a similar dynamic with making jokes. If he’s in a silly mood and wants to be hyper and make silly jokes, I always let him do his thing. But sometimes when I do the same thing he acts kind of annoyed and distant like I’m being strange or off putting, just because he’s not in the same mood at that moment. Even though we’ve been friends for 7 years and bullshitting around has always been a big part of our dynamic.

I tried taking to him about it recently and he basically said that if he needs those kinds of boundaries and I don’t it’s just because we’re different people and that should be okay. 

I don’t really know how to argue against that, but it still feels really unequal that I always show him openness and understanding with whatever he does but I don’t receive the same thing in return.

186,"So like many I am back with my parents right now because I could not afford rent without work. Want to say this first I don't dislike this parent and we talk about all kinds of different things. Problem is, in most topics that I bring up they will almost immediately take a contrary stance to whatever I was saying or leading up to.

 Earlier I had tried to make a simple joke about Trump's comment on disinfectant, because I thought it was funny (I don't care one way or another about the politics of the matter) and they kind of blew up and went into full attack mode. This case was a little different than others because they had already been riled up by reading all the different headlines about the situation and were already upset. Before I could finish the joke they made the same stubborn face they always make whenever they are going to be hard headed about something and blew up at me about how the headlines are wrong, that he was just asking a question, or that the headlines are going to make people drink Clorox.

I tried to explain that I really don't care about the headlines or what Trump haters had to say and that I just thought it was funny that the guy mentioned injecting disinfectant. They continued to go off on me like I had just told the whole world to drink bleach because I was misrepresenting what the guy had said and I pushed back trying to explain again that I don't care about the politics I thought it was a funny mistake that I could make a joke about. This went on for a while before I tried for the nth time to explain how hardheaded and contrarian they are, but they just wanted to continue saying how I must be reading all kinds of biased and trump hating sources (They know I read and watch things from every political perspective, ranging from Steven crowder to secular talk)

So to prove a point I said they would disagree if I said Lance Armstrong isn't considered a great athlete because of doping, and their immediate response was to say that everyone was cheating so he  probably is. When I tried to point out what they had just done they did everything they could afterwords to shut down the conversation, and eventually just said ""OK you're right"" sarcastically and ignored me.

Does anyone have any advice with how to explain how it feels to be shut down and fought about every little opinion or thing that I mention? I have tried explaining how bad it feels to basically be ignored and then told that I am wrong, half the time about things that they admit to knowing absolutely nothing about. The problem is they make a face whenever anyone is able to prove them wrong or when they are going to be hard headed about something, and whenever I try to explain what they are doing they make said face and ignore or misrepresent anything I am saying.",28Apr2020,1

188,"For some backstory, coming at of high school I was recruited as a d1 athlete and ended up at a school that was not right for me. Even thought I did well in high school, I had a hard time adjusting to college and got terrible grades my first semester. Im not blaming this on the school, I didn't take it seriously enough and ultimately lost focus throughout the semester. Second semester I worked a lot harder in school and started figuring everything out and did much better. Halfway through the fall of my sophomore year I realized that I hated being at that school and was struggling with some personal stuff, so my family and I decided that I would be best to leave the school. I came home and began taking classes at my local community college this spring, and I have been hating it even more than I hated my first school.

I am almost done with this semester and was hoping Id be able to transfer to a new four year this fall but the counselor at the cc said it was impossible because of my lack of credits and low grades from my other school. She also said that the cc cannot accept my credits from my first college and basically that I wont be able to use them to transfer at all, which doesn't make much sense to me and ultimately this meeting left me with more questions than answers. It usually takes 2 full years of cc to be able to transfer and I cant imagine spending another year and a half here. 

Along with that, I have still been training on my own for my sport and would like to continue competing at a collegiate level (cc doesn't have a team), but since I began college in fall of 2018 I only have 5 years of eligibility from then, meaning I only have 3 left. If i spend another 1.5-2 years at cc I will only be able to compete for one year once I transfer. Some people have told me that it might be time to give it up which I am not ready to do, I have been invited to and attended national team development camps and plan to continue post college.

Basically what I am asking here is anyone knows what I can do in this situation to be able to transfer earlier or really any other solution you may know. I realize that it is my fault for getting myself into this problem and that I should've thought more deeply about my decisions and had a better plan, but any advice is greatly appreciated.",28Apr2020,1

I tested positive a few days back. 

I have agoraphobia and my doctor knows this, so when I told my doctor I haven’t been in contact with anyone anyway over the 14 days he didn’t press me further. 

I called the boss (who I haven’t met in the 2 years I worked there) and when I said the doctor didn’t ask me to write down who I’ve contacted because I haven’t seen anyone, the boss’ tune changed and he kept asking that same question but in different ways to try and catch me out. I understand I probably looked shady but I have never met this man, I’m not comfortable discussing my mental health with him. 

He then said he’s now out of pocket due to me, that he has to spend $3k on a cleaner to clean the store now and he now has no one to work for him. (There’s only another staff member and a manager that work there, and the manager conveniently has been on holiday for a month) 

He’s emailed three times since, again asking the same question and when I reply he says “well that’s not what I’ve been told”. 

I didn’t even know what to say. I already felt like garbage taking time off and now I’m being made out to be a liar and like I’ve put this whole mans business in jeopardy because I’m sick.

I know it’s kind of early to be thinking about it, but I can’t stop thinking about it. I’m also super awkward and bad at explaining my thoughts so sorry if this is long and I ramble

My main interest has always been creating stories so naturally I want to go into something like that as my career (I.e. English/creative writing) . Idk if this is normal, but there’s not one specific thing I’d want to do as a job if I graduated. I’m considering looking at narrative design for video games, but I’m not really sure where to start. It’s different from traditional story writing and I don’t know how I could practice to get better at it. (If I did go down this path, I’d want to work on games that branch off and have impactful choices like Detroit Become Human). But a lot of the game companies that I’d consider wanting to try out for aren’t located in the US. I honestly don’t think I’d be able to work abroad. I know I shouldn’t limit myself, but those are the companies that I really gravitate to. 

Another job that I was considering was freelance writing. I’d want to make it a full and successful career, however this isn’t realistic which is why I was thinking of only doing it as a hobby or mainly side job. 
Something that I’d thought about, but would likely never happen was being some sort of writer for Pixar Studios or Disney or something like that. (The chances of this happening are considerably low)

I’m just really scared of the future because I don’t want to settle for a job but at the same time I don’t want to make my expectations too high. But I don’t want my expectations to be so low that it reflects in my work so that employers don’t think that I’m confident in it. Sorry if I rambled.

I told her that I would finish up quickly and go to bed, and she said 5 mins. Me and my cousin start rushing the mission, and we don’t get it. 

Five mins later, she tells me to ‘get off or I’m turning off the WiFi.’

I thought we could finish before she did it, but we couldn’t. Just 2ish minutes before completion, I lost connection to the party and servers.

194,"So to start off I’m 22 years old and live in Ontario, Canada. I’ve already dropped out of college and am 8 grand in debt. Now thanks to my dad I am working at the best factory in my area and have been for almost 2 years. I make 32$ and hour to operate a machine. 

The money is great, like it’s hard to find a job like that around here. However I hate thinking about doing this for the rest of my life. When I think about what I want my life to be, I have so many things I want to do. This is not on that list.

Recently I’ve been dreaming of quitting my job and feeling free again. The thing about working at this factory is that I feel as though I’m stuck here for life. It’s gonna be hard to find something that can convince me to leave 32$ an hour, especially when I only have a highschool education. All I want to do and all I’ve ever wanted to do with my life is travel, see what the world has to offer, experience different cultures, different ways of living, ect. And well to be honest recently I’ve fallen in love with cooking.

It would be a dream come true to be able to travel and cook for people. I love cooking because I feel amazing sharing the food that I create with the people I love. I really enjoy the reaction I get and I enjoy the hobby it gives me. I’ve found it is a great anxiety reliever and a great way to keep myself in a good mood!

As much as I want to quit my job, pack up and head to Mexico to find a restaurant to work at, I can’t. I have an apartment, I have a job(with an amazing retirement pension I will add) and most importantly I have pets and a girlfriend. Now the pets, no big deal they are happy to come with me anywhere. Though with my girlfriend, I can’t just tell her to pack up cause we’re leaving, that would be wrong. She has a job she loves here and I couldn’t take her life from her. I also couldn’t leave her because this is my soulmate.

My girlfriend says she shares my dreams of travel and stuff, however I think we have way different views on life and what we need to accomplish in it. She’s more for settling down and I just want to experience everything I can. Honestly sometimes I think my life was meant to be spent alone. I feel like people hold me back a lot. Though I’m also one of those people I suppose... even if I was alone I don’t know I’d have the strength to even give up my job.

I know money does not equal happiness. Though I find in a sense it equals comfort in life. You can’t live comfortably with no money. Not to mention I can’t travel without money.

I’m so confused at wtf is happening with her and wtf my role is. Why does she keep reaching out just to like keep fucking me over?

I'd like to sponsor a child but dont know which organization to choose. It would be nice if I could be in contact few times a year with sponsored kid(not through letters he didnt wrote).

To get there, we will be taking two planes each way. I seem to be the only one in my family really opposed against this. Everybody keeps telling me “you can’t live in fear” but I think this is just seeking danger out. 


Going on 4 different planes scares me deeply + there will be many many people on the beach. I don’t think I can get out of it and I basically have to come. My Dad is in regular contact with his Dad who is ~85 which is the part that scares me the most. They say “we go to the grocery store and come into contact with people” but that’s people from our city and it’s necessary for survival.

201,"When I graduated college, I wanted to make a do right for my community. I got a job on a campaign and thought it was everything I wanted. Now I'm almost a year out of school and over half a year into this job and I've lost all sense of direction. 

Currently living in supporter housing (for those who don't know, supporter housing is when you live in someone else's home while you're on the campaign) and the people are really nice, but it's driving me crazy not being able to have a place of my own. Hours were long before this whole epidemic started and now that we're in the thick of it, there's no line between my personal life (what little I had of it anyway) and my work life. 

I work over 90 hours a week for a little over $3k a month, it wasn't the pay that was keeping me going. The hours are so long that I think my personality is just a mask with nothing underneath. Most of the words I say now are just ""yes"", ""okay"", and ""sounds good"", I'm not even human right now, I'm just a drone.

I've seen so many people around me come and go on this campaign, people have left after feeling burnt out and others have been fired. We got a new boss at the start of last month and he is so curt and brief, it feels like he hates me. Honestly, I feel like the whole world hates me right now.

I'm not sure what my values are anymore and part of me feels uncertain as to who I am. I thought the people that ran campaigns were moral and admirable people, but everything just feels like talk now. Every time I do what I know is right, the higher ups make me feel like I've done wrong.

Dealing with people working on and around the campaign is exhausting and I'm getting more and more anxious all the time. Every time something frustrating or stupid happens now in the political world, I don't gain motivation, I just get more tired of it all. 

I really don't know what to do anymore.

In short, I'm depersonalized, demoralized, and disappointed.

So when one doesn't get the same as the other, people are like ""Ooo, you got lower than your sister? You can do better than that"", that kind of stuff. They usually do it in a jokey way but it makes you feel sad if you're the twin who got lower, honestly.
We have similar personalities, but we're humans, we adapted our personalities to the other one. Anyways, if we had the same personalities, conversations would be quite boring if both we're trying to be the funnier one. 
Irl, I'm kind of more of the serious one, but a thing I noticed that we switch back and forth on how we act, like one might be more chatty and funny, and the other one is more quiet, just depends. We also act like EXACTLY the same too, when around other people.
But lately, (in quarantine with the family) I noticed that she has such a fun personality, and always cracking jokes and stuff with our siblings and parents, acting so funny. But I, I just can't, I'm not in the mood or something to join along and act silly with her.
 A few days ago, I was helping my mom sew something and it was so awkward, I had nothing to say, and I wanted to act like my sister, be funny, but I don't know how, don't know what to say. But then when my sister came, we all were smiling and they were chatting while I just said stuff like ""omg, Haha, cool"". And when she left, it was awkward again. My sweet ol' mum, she tried making conversation but I was just thinking exactly all this, and I just had short answers. Then I just made up some excuse to leave, since I was getting so sad, tearing up a bit.

Note: I love my sister very much, and we have a good relationship, though we argue sometimes, that's just what happens when you share EVERYTHING.

209,"A while ago, I bought headphones from a pawn shop for $30. They worked amazingly for a long time and fit well on my head (which is small, other headphones sit uncomfortably even when I put them on the ""shortest setting"").

I have the wire, of course, but the problem is that I don't know if my wire or my headphone speaker is the problem, and I don't know how to check.

The product on eBay says ""30 day returns-free returns"". Does that mean that if I don't like it and send it back, I'll get my money back? Or does eBay charge you to ship back products?

215,"So I met this girl at college who I quickly became friends with. From August to October that year, we were fast friends...then she dropped out of school. At the time, she said it was due to stress.
 
Then, she told me that she had a mass in her stomach that was cancer. Because her mom had passed from cancer years before, she didn’t want to worry her dad so she went for testing in secret and cut her hair short...and I totally believed her- why wouldn’t I? That July, she even came to my house and talked about how the chemo pills she’d been on for months were making her sick.  

Flash forward to that December. She revealed to me that she’d only been on chemo pills for a week and had known the mass wasn’t cancer. She told me that she had an alternate personality that wanted attention and had made the story up. Even then, I tried to support her knowing that I was one of her only friends after she’d revealed this information to others. 

That January, she was supposed to come to my court case to support me since she knew the boy who had assaulted me at school. The very night before, she bailed. During my case at school, she had also been a witness. Long before she had confessed to me about the “cancer”, she had told me that her memory was awful from the pills and that she didn’t remember details of what happened in my case...but in the report for my case, she invented her own story and actually harmed my case. 

Flash forward again to this past October. I moved out of my dorm. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and went for surgery. I hadn’t spoken to this “friend” in months and she finally reached out again. Even though my mom will be ok, I have a harder time now with my friend’s story. As a prospective counselor, I want to believe that maybe she really does have a serious mental disorder and be sympathetic. 

However, I’m tired of giving her excuses about how I’m not responding to her because I need time to heal. I don’t know whether to tell her the truth about how I’m feeling. She also is the sort of person who lashes out at people who turn against her...but at what point is enough enough?

I’m gonna have to pay another months rent on the place which is about 1300.

There are some considerations to the cost...

My couch, ottoman, entertainment center, dining set and bed all add up to about 900 bucks new when I bought them.

It would cost more than that to replace them, but it depends on what I replace them with.

Another consideration is that I think I have a mold problem at my old place and don’t want to bring it to the new place. Specifically, with the couch and bed if they have spores in them.

We considered this when we noticed every time we’re at the old place, I get a bad post nasal drip and congestion for a day or two.

Considering we’re kinda building our home together, the risk of mold, the fact it’ll cost about a thousand bucks to move the stuff at least anyway... should I just bite the bullet and buy new stuff?

I am not physically able to get the stuff out of the apartment, so I was considering giving it away on Craigslist or something, but also don’t want to have some but show up. Maybe a charity or someone might pick it up? Or is there someone I can pay to get rid of it?",28Apr2020,1
217,"I've tried posting this a couple places, not sure if this one's the right one.

Title about sums it up. We trained at the same dojo for much of our teen years, and we grew very close during that time together, and stayed close. She was the first close friend I ever really had, and one of the few friends I've ever felt truly loved me fully for who I am. I was never really one for platonic affection before I got to know her, and her friendship really helped me to heal from some old wounds.

But about a year or two ago, communication started dropping off. We'd still hang out, of course, when she scheduled it. And in person everything seemed perfectly normal, we seemed as close as ever. But she’d sometimes stop texting, first for days, and then weeks at a time. And then when she asked that we switch to email for our conversation because of some unspecified phone problem, I thought the problem would be solved, but then the emails dropped off similarly. When she did respond, it would be cheerful and friendly, but always very brief—and often only responding to some part of the most recent email, and never to any questions about planning to meet.

I last saw her in July of 2019. We went to this concert by an artist we had bonded over loving, a concert we'd gotten tickets to ages previous. I hadn't heard from her for weeks leading up to the concert, so I had been a little worried she wouldn't show, but she did, and it was just like old times again for the whole night. We seemed as close as ever. It was wonderful. But after the concert, I just stopped hearing from her.

I got one last email from her in late August—again, not responding to any of the questions or scheduling I'd tried to do, merely a quick sentence sharing a bit of information about an event that an artist we both like was doing. After that, it's been complete radio silence. I've reached out several times, first just casually and then finally just coming out and asking her what's going on, and saying I missed her and was worried about her. I don't want to inundate her with messages in case she had to cut me off for some emotional reason, but I sent another email, wishing her a happy new year and asking her just to let me know she’s doing ok.

The other day was her birthday, and I sent her one more note. I don't expect to get anything back from it. And at this point, I'm not sure what response I would even want. I can't really imagine a response that would satisfactorily make up for the worry and confusion.

I just wish I could figure out what could have happened. If I unknowingly did something to damage our friendship, I can totally understand that she would need her space, I would just want to know what it had been. She was never flaky in the slightest before, and, in fact, one of the core foundations in our friendship from the beginning was both of us finding open platonic affection and longterm friendship very important. We've never fought, nor to my memory even significantly disagreed. Neither of us are attracted to people of the other’s gender, so there's no chance of any kind of romantic drama playing into the situation. Near as I can tell, none of this was ever foreshadowed in any way. Could I have missed something? Is there some externally obvious explanation I just can't see? Or is this just the dreaded One Of Those Things? What, if anything, does one do in such situations?

TL;DR Best friend since early teens slowly phased out communication with me over the last year until she had ghosted me entirely, all without ever giving the slightest sign that anything was wrong between us, and I just don’t know what’s going on, or what to do about it.",28Apr2020,1
218,"I’m almost 20, long story short I met a night shift manager at my job one night and he was pretty playful and flirtatious, like really obvious and over the top. He was funny and kept trying to make me laugh so I played along, and at one point, feeling ballsy, I straight up asked if he was going to ask me out on a date. I thought it was kind of joking but they took it seriously and asked me out, so we traded numbers. 
We tried to hang out and get to know each other but for various reasons (quarantine, a family member of his passed, I got really sick for 2 weeks), didn’t happen. Now that I’m back at work I see him a lot and he’s been really respectful since I told him I’m inexperienced and wanted to take things really slow. He still jokes around and plays a lot, but a lot less forward and listens when I’m upset. 
Thing is, I have horrible, crippling social anxiety and every time he’s around, or I think about him, I feel a horrible stab of anxiety and panic and I feel like I’m going to throw up. I flush so easily from embarrassment but I’m standoffish and sassy, so I can’t help feel like I give mixed signals. Hell I don’t even know how I really feel yet since I still barely know the guy. For a while, we didn’t text at all after a few days of texting back and forth multiple times a day, and I almost felt good - like, if he forgets I ever existed, then I won’t feel horrible anymore, and that’s good.

219,"This all started around August 2019. So I live 45 minutes away from my school. This may seem like it isn’t a big problem at first, but then you have to take into account that I get picked up at about 8pm every day. Once school is over, my grandma picks me up (she’s usually about an hour late) and brings me to her house. I get there at about 4:15 on the daily. Once I get to her house, it’s hard to do any kind of homework. She (my grandmother) is always yelling and being negative about everything. Her house is extremely dirty and cluttered, and so is she. She rarely washes her hands, she talks bad about my dad (her son in law) and I can never get a break. Due to this, I can’t even try to do homework at her house. All of the noise, plus everywhere being either dirty, sticky, smelly, or something worse. This should all be gone once my mom picks me up, but it just gets replaced by other problems.

My mother gets off of work from anywhere between 7:30-9:00. Her schedule changes every week, so it’s different every day. The earliest I get home is 8:15, and thats if there’s no traffic at all. The latest is 9:45, again, no traffic. Once I get home, i have lots of things to do. Eat dinner, pack my lunch for tomorrow, do chores, take a shower, etc. this all takes around 30 minutes. So thats basically adding 30 minutes to the time i get home. Obviously, when I get home, I’m tired. Being tired makes my quality of work just go way down, and its hard to complete assignments from 6 classes while extremely sleepy, on top of that, i have to wake up at 6 o’clock in the morning just for a 45 minute car ride to school. Obviously this makes my grades go down.

All my life I’ve been a straight A, 4.0 student since last year. Last year, i was almost in the same predicament im in now, except i got home earlier, and i had less work. So last year, which I’ll just refer to as 6th grade, i had a D and a C in the middle of the year. By the end though, I got them back to A’s. This year, however, has just been the worst. I have 2 A’s, 3 C’s, and an F. That is the worst I’ve ever been in. And since we have quarantine to make up all of the assignments, I should be good, right? Nope. Not at all. Since quarantine happened, my mom deleted all of my social media apps. Everything from snapchat to discord.

I don’t want to sound like a spoiled teen, but those apps really helped me. I vented to friends on those apps, i talked to people, laughed at stuff, whatever. And i’ve had all of these apps in 6th grade, and while i have been using them more, i dont think they’re the reason my grades have been getting worse. Since quarantine started for me (March 13th), I’ve been stuck in the house with only my mother and little brother. My dad is out of state and we barely get to see him. This kind of made me grow to dislike him a bit. 2 weeks ago, he came to visit for a week. It reminded me of when I was a kid, and i was mad at myself for starting to dislike him. He was going through rough times with things also, and I put him in a bad situation. His son, me, has been almost perfect in his eyes (4.0, athletic, etc) and when he comes back to visit, he’s fallen apart. (2.4 GPA, chunkier, bleh). This led to him talking to me about acting weird and not doing homework. The acting weird is me just talking less and blanking out and being reluctant to communicate. He pretty much said that he was disappointed in me, which lead to me crying later that day. But the rest of the week with him was actually pretty good. I miss him. 

Anyways, besides my grades, im in a deep pit with my mom. She’s always worried about me, even though she caused some of the problems i have. She always jokes about things that matter to me, like my appearance and other personal stuff. She also nags me and tells me that i can talk to her about everything and anything, which i knew wouldnt work out. One day, i just broke. I decided to tell her how i felt. She joked about it, and pushed it aside as nothing serious. Since that talk (which happened about March this year) she’s been acting really weird. Like shes being extra cautious with me. This usually should be taken as a good thing, but I can tell she doesnt want to do it, and that it just isnt natural for her.

I honestly dont have much else to say. My friendships are plummeting. So are my grades. And my girlfriend broke up with me last week. I just need some guidance. Some advice or word to get me out of this hole. Thanks, reddit.",28Apr2020,1

222,"My rent is cheap but unless I get extra hours at my job, I can barely afford it. I have like zero extra money every month.

I gave my 60 day notice to move out last month and my lease ends on May 31. I have been looking for rooms to rent. I currently live by myself in a one bedroom apt. Every body I have contacted about a room to rent wants someone to move in immediately and I can’t move until the end of May. 

Another problem is what to do with my stuff. I only have a few pieces of furniture and I don’t have anyone to help me move so I would have to sell all my furniture to be able to move.

Renting a room would save me at least a couple hundred bucks a month. My apt complex is likely to raise my rent if I was to re-sign but they require a 60 day notice to move out and they didn’t tell me whether they would raise my rent or not within that 60 day time frame so I had to give my notice to move out.

Should I start getting rid of some of my stuff now or wait until I find a room? Should I just be a little bit more patient and hope I can find a room at the last minute since most people want someone to move in almost right away?

227,"I received a Bachelor's Degree in Marketing and have been working in the SEO Industry for the past 3 years. Since I started in this field, I've always wound up working at startups. No matter how many other types of companies I've applied to (I'd prefer to work at a more established company) I always end up getting hired at startup companies instead. This would be fine, only the last startup I worked at for 2 years recently laid me off (and half the company) for making bad financial decisions. Then, I was hired at another startup where I was furloughed a few months later due to a company crisis. I've tried to learn other skills in Digital Marketing but cannot seem to get my foot in the door for anything aside from SEO. Every time I lose my job from a startup, it takes me months upon months to land another job. Working in the industry has wreaked havoc on my health and quality of life.

I don't enjoy this type of work anymore and I want to learn new skills and work in an entirely different industry. I would love to go back to college for accounting but I cannot afford to take on any more student loans and debt. Every job needs prior experience and I'm at loss as to what I can do.

230,"Hello, please bare in mind I’m still teenager who needs to get their emotions in check, so I apologize if this post reads as whiny.
Lately I’ve been feeling stupid and lonely. My whole life I’ve been homeschooled, so I don’t have the best social skills. Most of my friends I either am related to or grew up with. My best friend moved away because of abuse going on in her home, and slowly my other friends stopped contacting me because of familial issues. Before long I was alone, and I was okay with that when I was younger. My parents have always been firm believers that socializing and friendships are things you form after school, as an adult. Im pretty shy so I was actually relieved when they told me this. But recently, I started thinking. I’ve never related to other teenagers my age before- I’ve never been put in a social setting where I had too. I don’t know how other girls my age act, other than what I see in television to be honest. Will I be able to function in a job setting, or a college setting?

My parents have always wanted the best for me, and I understand that. They say that when I’m an adult I’ll be prepared for talking to people or making friends. They’ve always been incredibly protective over me because of what happened in their childhoods. Still, I get a little depressed that growing up I never could ride my bike around my neighborhood, let alone take a walk. 

I go to an online school, and I get to “chat” to my classmates. It’s a controlled environment where the teacher watches what you say. It just bothers me sometimes that even though we get to say good morning to each other that I’ve never seen the faces of my class mates or interacted with them in real life. Even in school clubs we can’t really chat freely with each other.
My parents have no intention either of involving me in any extracurricular outside. They can’t and won’t. We don’t have enough money, or time. (Especially now)
Ultimately, I just feel starved of human relationships outside of my family I guess. I know I should be focusing on school, but sometimes I can’t help but feel a little sad.

Though In a sense, I am grateful, because I’ve been homeschooled all my life I don’t need to adjust to self-quarantining myself, I do that already haha. 
If you have any advice on how to cope/stop feeling like this know that I really do appreciate it.

I've (f16) grew up in a super small school district that had less than 5 black people district wide at one point. When I was younger, my sisters asked me why I wasn't white like them. When I went to school, I heard a lot of ignorant ""Why are you brown?"" and ""I've never met a black person"". I also grew up hearing a lot of racist shit that I won't say here. Anyways, as I got older, I heard more of ""You're pretty for a black girl"" ""No one wants to date a black girl."" ""Black girls aren't really pretty."" and I've literally heard these exact words from a close ""friend""... ""It's not like he'd want to fuck a black girl anyways."" Growing up hearing this with a completely white family, I've grown to resent my blackness so much. My boyfriend's type is skinny, blonde, white girls and it always had been before me. I broke down telling him how much it hurt that I'm no one's type at our school, and he reassured me telling me I made him think black girls were pretty. Today, he told me that he only thinks 2 other girls are pretty besides me, and they're both white and blonde. Since I was old enough to picture myself, I always pictured myself being a white blonde girl. And then when I was a preteen, it hit me that the way I envisioned my future self will literally never happen. I used to be upset about it a lot, but eventually I came to terms and realized black is beautiful. When it's other people. I see other black females, and I think they are absolute gorgeous queens, and they're perfect the way they are. But I just can't apply the same logic to myself. I look in the mirror and I hate the reflection that stares back at me. I wish so badly that I was white, and then maybe people would find me attractive. Obviously this isn't a plausible course of action, but I need advice on how to love myself. I am completely lost at this point and I have no clue what to do.",28Apr2020,1

I have a therapist, a crisis plan, and plenty of virtual support. I’m not in any danger right now. I’m posting here rather than in a mental health subreddit because I’m only seeking ethical advice.]

Hi! I’m in a bit of a dilemma. I’m severely touch-starved and my mental health has been getting progressively more unstable since the pandemic started. The state I live in has no apparent plan for when to allow friends to visit each other again, nor any public timeline for instituting contact tracing, viral testing, or other practices that could eventually allow for a relaxation of isolation. There’s no end in sight.

I have a history of suicidal ideation and attempted suicide, and although I’m stable and safe at the moment, I’m very worried that I won’t be so safe weeks or months from now. I don’t think I’m *likely* to kill myself — that is, I think it’s less than 15% likely. But that’s still an enormous risk.

I also know that if I could visit just two of my closest friends with some regularity (about once a week each), it would reduce that risk to almost zero. So I’m trying to weigh the risk of my dying in my home against the risk that I would pose to others if I were to expand my circle of contact a little bit.

I live with six other people, and we’ve been as isolated and cautious as we can be. The people I’d like to visit live with one and two other people respectively and each of their households has been isolating too. Do y’all think it’s worth it?

I’m a utilitarian if that matters. But I have a learning disability and it’s very hard for me to gather and collate enough info about risks to feel confident in making a decision here. I’d appreciate any thoughts anyone has! Thanks.",28Apr2020,1

But, after a series of me being a total prick, I left the chat and we haven't talked since.

Now, since it happened, I've managed to mostly get over it. I'm very well capable of going through days without being bothered by it. But every now and then, I find myself feeling depressed while I think about the happy memories I had and how I could have been a better friend. This already kinda sucks, but what's worse is sometimes this same feeling when I see something from a series that I associate with her, either because she's the reason I got into it in the first place, like with Kingdom Hearts, or simply because she really enjoyed it and talked about it a lot, like My Hero Academia.

Okay this is dark and will most likely be taken down, but I was hanging out with my sister and my friend. We went back to her house and she offered to show us her bird. She came back yelling that he was dead and was heartbroken. We went in to console her and her brother was doing the dishes. He seemed natural and like nothing was going on. He treated it like she was crying over a stray she had fed once. This was the first thing that set me off. The second was he was the only one home and birds are noisy. The bird had been alive when she left and she got no text of its death, but he seemed like he knew it was there. The other point is that, again birds are noisy, and they have two of them. I think he would have noticed that one bird was quiet or one bird was going nuts (which the living one was). The third thing that set me off was that it was bleeding from the mouth and it was on the bottom of the cage and it’s feathers were ruffled on the corpse like it was frightened. My theory is that he strangled it, he worked third shift and slept most the day, because it was being loud and keeping him up so he made it quiet. 
I told my sister that I thought he did this and she got mad, which she kind of had the right to, and said he was a nice person. I was in the same grade as this guy and he was decently nice to me, but I hadn’t spoken to him in two years in person.

256,"How can I get this girl I dated last year to leave me alone in a nice way?


Ok so I’m 19. This girl Jeana and I worked together last year at my job. She is the same age as my sister (21). They went to school together. My sister said that girl caused so much trouble and was always getting called into the principals for something and used to be in a group of mean girls that bullied people including my sister. She then turned into a social outcast. My sister said she never had a boyfriend. The guys were scared to talk to her. 

Anyways, we both worked as servers at my last job. Last year from January-April. It was really weird honestly because it seemed like she hated me the first few weeks. Dirty looks, cold shoulder, rude etc. for no reason. then her coworker friend got fired and then she started to flirt with me. (I wasn’t dating the coworker friend so idk what that was about). I’m nice and talkative to everyone. 

We dated for maybe a month (February) and had sex a few times. (She initiated). But honestly she wasn’t all that, yeah she was hot but personally wise not the type of girlfriend I was looking for. I was still civil towards her just not flirty. I called it off. She was also very clingy and double texted like crazy. 

In March - Some days she would flirt really awkwardly and some days she would avoid like the plague. On our lunch breaks she would try and talk to me and stare at me a lot. I was polite and talked back but wasn’t flirting at all. I became bothered by her where I started going for walks on our lunch break. Guess who else decided to go on walks? She did. Like 5-10 minutes after I would leave, she would clock out and leave as well.

In April - She  bought herself an easter basket and said it was from me and said I left it outside her car...and told everyone...Eventually, people at work thought we were secretly dating (we were in February not April)...and it became bothersome. I started avoiding her. And purposely changing the days I worked to the days she didn’t. Another thing that bothered me - She thought it was funny to make fun of customers which I didn’t find particularly funny. She got fired mid- April, thank god. Due to customers reporting her. 

After she got fired - She started using prank dial.com with all these random numbers and started prank calling me. 

She even texted me off a burner number pretending to be someone else, I blocked it. 

Last summer, She found pictures of me and photoshopped herself into them and posted it on her Instagram as if we were still dating. Luckily the page got taken down. 

In the fall while I was out of state at college the prank calls started again. 

And yesterday she sent me a friend request on Facebook and her Instagram has two new pictures of her and I from when we dated for a month last year. I have not spoken to her since last April.


TL;DR - this girl is two years older than me. Went to school with my sister and had the reputation of being a bully. I worked with her as a sever from Jan-April. I dated her in February but her personality wasn’t what I was looking for. I was still nice to her but she wouldn’t leave me alone. She became very obsessive and even bought herself an Easter basket and told everyone it was from me. She put my phone number on prankdial.com and prank called me for months after she got fired in April. She posted photoshopped pics of her and I on Instagram that eventually got deleted. Now she wants to be friends on Facebook even though I haven’t talked to her since last year and I’m not really interested in her",28Apr2020,1
257,"So, this is a continuation of what I posted on here yesterday. (Feel free to go on my page to go read it. This post may make more sense if you do.)

Okay, so the guy that was dming me who I thought really liked me and I’m semi- positive he was flirting with me just started randomly talking about this girl he likes today which is a total bummer. Like, we haven’t gotten even that close so I guess that’s good or this would probably hurt even more. But now it’s got me thinking if he was even flirting with me to begin with or maybe he was just flirting with me until he could talk with his crush? 

He just was really sweet to me and because he was being so caring and checking up on me everyday I thought there was like the slightest chance he liked me too. Anyway, he’s really talkative and I doubt he’s gonna stop talking about this girl he’s into. How can I still be supportive even though I’m really annoyed over this? Like I feel whatever I’m saying is so forced and fake. Honestly I could care less but I still want to talk/be his friend. I don’t want to stop talking to him just because he doesn’t like me. What do I do?",28Apr2020,1
258,"So in 2017 I moved an hour away from home to live with my S/O (26M). I started to struggle a lot with being far from friends and family about 2 years into our relationship. No one ever comes to visit me, I’m always the one to visit them. After 3+ years of driving an hour back and forth, it gets pretty old. I began to resent my S/O for not wanting to move closer due to his well paying job and so our relationship basically ended because I became so unhappy with the living arrangement. He typically works in the middle of the day until early morning, 5+ days a week and I started to feel isolated from everyone. 

Now I’m back living at my moms with a houseful of kids where I’m equally unhappy because I still desperately want to make things work with him. I’m hoping to get my own apartment once this pandemic is over and I just realized that I have no clue where to live. Everyone is so spread out that there is absolutely no perfect spot in the middle of anything. I’m starting to come to terms with the fact that I’ll never be able to have my cake and eat it too. I love my friends and family so much, but I also love my ex and I so desperately want to make things work because before this feeling crept in things were amazing. I have truly never been happier and I know he is my future. I just don’t know how to cope with the fact that I can’t see anyone whenever I want or make it out to all the fun nights going out whenever things get back to normal. 

I don’t know why my brain is just constantly torturing me. I don’t feel content anywhere. I’ve been struggling with this feeling for almost 2 years and I just can’t shake it. Reddit, I am desperately asking you for any advice on how to cope with this. I can’t just not visit the people I care about and I can’t bare the thought of a life without my ex. How do I make this work?",28Apr2020,1

260,"It’s been a long time since I’ve lived with my parents. I moved out since I started college, and was pretty much forced to learn a lot on my own as my parents couldn’t even afford to help me pay for rent or get a car. Fast forward, I am now a year after graduating college (I’m 24). However, I’m pre med and applying this yr. I moved back with my parents a little over a year ago and I’ve been doing well money-wise, considering I don’t pay rent anymore. I haven’t saved a lot honestly but enough for applications, maybe about 2k. But that’s really it. I have a credit card but I try not to use it.

The last time I was suicidal I was about 17. I attempted. Scariest time of my life but I was in a bad place and vowed never to do that again. I had my moments in college but then again I was a stem major and I’m pre med so it’s tough. ever since I moved back home, my mental health has been worsening significantly and it has gotten to a point where I’m experiencing suicidal ideation again. I told my sister but I don’t think she realizes how serious I’m being and she doesn’t know how bad it can get. I’m constantly short tempered with my parents ever since I moved in but I thought a lot of it was just resentment because they never really supported me through out college even when I begged. it was hard while being pre med and working 2 jobs. but I was the healthiest mentally when I had my own place. I’m worried my depression is getting worse as lately the suicidal ideation has been worsening. It’s harder now that we’re quarantined and home 24/7 and around them. I feel like a lot of this is linked to my resentment with my parents and being around them a lot. I get angry at them easily then regret it later. I try to remind myself they’re only getting older but even that doesn’t keep me from getting mad at them all the time. The house is full and always loud so I can barely concentrate studying. I know it may not be the financially best decision but do you guys think moving out is the best decision? I tried to avoid it to continue saving, but every time I get like this it feels like moving out is the only answer. I’ll be on a tight budget or sure but it’s doable. I don’t think I can do this anymore. I’m literally losing my mind at this point and I’m scared I’ll end up doing something regrettable.

263,"I heard my parents having sex and it made me feel uncomfortable, gross and disgusted. I confronted my mom about it the next day and I said I hear you guys like once a month. And she went on to say that her and my dad do in fact do it more than once a month. In her exact words she said “if we did it once a month, your dad would go insane.” That grossed me out so much. Her tone of telling me this sounded like she doesn’t like to have sex as often as they do. But she feels obligated to or he will be mad at her. I can’t stop thinking about all of this. I know I need to not think about it but I can’t. I can’t focus on my school work or work in general.

264,"I don't know what to do or if I should be scared.
So the calls started the last week of January, always past 12:40 am. The first calls I didn't notice because I had my phone set to turn off all notifications after 11pm. I got one call every 2 days. So after the third call I noticed it was the same number. Next call I answer but didn't say anything and neither did the caller. Next 3 calls I missed. Next call was at a more appropriate time (10:30 pm) so I pick up and say ""hello?"", The caller, a man, answers ""hello?"" Really fast and in a quiet voice. I didn't say anything else and neither did he and hung up after 20 seconds. After this, I didn't get any calls in a month. I answered the following 3 calls without saying anything again and the caller didn't either so next call I blocked the number. He called me 3 more times. My phone tells me whenever a blocked number attempted to call me but I don't really know if the caller hears the waiting tone or it just seems like it's out of service.


So on Sunday at 3:20 am I get a call from a different number. I just turned it down, added the number to check for a WhatsApp profile (of course I did this with the other number as well), nothing, deleted the number and went back to sleep a little unsettled.
Yesterday the same thing happened at the same hour, this time I answer without saying anything and after some seconds they say ""hello?"". I'm not sure but I think it was the same person from the previous calls.


Ever since this started happening I told my boyfriend about it and this time he told me I should just ask them what do they want because, well, I do want to know what is going on, if it's someone playing a bad joke or something more serious. But whenever I pick up I get really scared and worried that the person wants to or can hurt me. Also I don't want to speak too loud and wake up my parents, and I thought of blocking the number, but what if they go on calling me from a different number?


I'm really worried they will call me again tonight...  What's the best thing I could do?


(Please don't tell me to report it to the police, that's not how things work in here, there's nothing they will do unless I get physically injured)

266,"Hey all,

So I've recently put the idea of finding my dream career on the back burner and decided to pursue a career in retail. I've been there a little over a week now. I absolutely love the job, the work isn't bad, the people are great, and on top of that it pays excellent. I'm a temp/part timer, but as the title says I recently screwed up with about a 30 min tardy. My last job was 3rd shift so I'm still adjusting to sleeping like a normal human again. My 5th day I forgot to set my alarm, for whatever reason, and ended waking up 3 min before my shift started. I was in shock, as I'm normally so punctual with my timing and alarms, so I called work and told a manager I'd be a little late, and rushed to get ready. I got to work and have been stressing about it since. The day I was late I skipped both my break, came back from lunch early, and worked 2 hours extra because I felt so bad. I have extreme anxiety and I've been beating the hell out of myself over it. I like this job and I'd love to keep it. But now I'm worried since I'm a temp/pt they're going to end up laying me off. If I'm recalling correctly, I think my manager even mentioned during the interview that attendance was very important, like any other job. I told my mentor the other day about how worried I was and he's assured me several times that I have nothing to worry about, but of course that's easier said than done when you have anxiety as bad as mine. My wife have suggested talking to.the manager over it, but I'm just worried. I hate confrontation so I'd rather make that the last option.",28Apr2020,1
267,"&gt; I’m looking for advice regarding the next step in my life. Maybe this is the Covid Stir-Crazy setting in, but I’m definitely looking for genuine advice, stories and experience, and tips on how I should move forward. Sorry in advance for length, just trying to be detailed and explain my thought process thoroughly!!
[TLDR at the end]

**Background:** I (23F) majored in a BA in Communications and Media studies in Illinois (not too impressive, I know). I graduated in December 2019. My GPA ended around 2.5 (even less impressive). Lectures and schooling, paired with an absolutely stubborn and rigid department head, was very very hard for me. My mental state at school had a direct impact on my studies, and with OCD/Anxiety I struggled a ton. However, I have had some awesome experiences - I’ve interned as a video editor, made mobile ads with these companies, freelanced as a storyboard artist and helped set-up/manage social media pages in Chicago. Did the Disney College Program for shits-and-giggles. My real-world experience is nothing to sneeze at. I know I have what it takes to work the industry (specifically social media management and creative direction/design, even video production if I’m lucky).

**The Issue:** So obviously the first thing I do after New Years is look for a job in my field! I know it will not be easy, and I know the market is competitive - I’m *not* disillusioned. I’ve had a great summary of interviews. Before Covid, I was waiting to hear from some truly interested positions about offers in event planning, A/V Tech companies, and social media coordinators. However, I noticed a lot of jobs in this field are lumped with Graphic Design/Animation majors...what the heck?? I abandoned getting a FA Degree because I thought the chances to find work with one would be lower than a BA. I’m so confused, because now all my summers spent working for experience (and part-time serving work on top of that) feels useless with out ‘a relevant portfolio of media design, digital artwork, and typography’ as well as a ‘reel of past work’. The video reel I fully understand, and can provide, but the art leaves me feeling like I am under prepared.

**Advice I Need:** Should I consider taking what work I have done as an intern (editing photos for CMYK print, email graphics, etc.) and my hobby art, scrounge an application portfolio, and attempt to take a 30 credit MA in Art/Design? Just to bolster my credentials? I absolutely *hate* school and want to start working so bad, but now that I’ve seen the job market I feel so...defeated. Even worthless at times (say hi to my anxiety). Covid obviously isn’t helping me feel secure in my skills at all, but I could have potentially found work and be working during this quarantine if I had a portfolio. Every day as I scroll, it’s just so many jobs for Graphic Design paired with Videography, Social Media Producer, Marketing, and all these other positions I once felt strongly prepared for.

&gt; **TLDR;** Went to Uni, got a Media Undergrad, got a lot of real-world experience over summers. Now that I’ve graduated, feels like I’m missing a lot of experience in Graphic Design for many relevant jobs. Do I go back for an MA (30 credits) to refine my skills and be properly prepared?",28Apr2020,1
269,"I've asked people close to me with varying advice and I thought I'd try here since I don't really know what to do nor have anyone else to ask. 

So here's what's going on, Ive been working at this pizza place for about 8-9 months and it's my first job. Not to go into abunch of detail about my personal life but it's been pretty difficult, lots of moving and trouble within family stuff. So I've never stayed in one place long and I always found it hard to connect with people and fit in. And that would go into a whole other thing about school and stuff like that.

And having this job has been really helpful in connecting with more people and having a better sense of work. But this is where it gets difficult for me , there is this girl at work that I like and I never felt this way about a person and its hard for me to clue into things most the time. She is a nice friendly person so it's sometimes hard to tell if she's just trying to be friendly to me or if it's something more. But some of the time it feels that way and I for one don't want to say something and make it awkward. But I definitely feel something at least more than just coworkers and I don't know how to got about it.

It's safe to say I'm not confident in how I look , I'm awkward and overweight but I've been working on it. I've been eating healthy and working out for the past 2 weeks and I've tried to be more conversational with everyone. I have no idea what to do, I had a loose plan to exercise and eat healthy and lose weight until I feel comfortable with myself. Then while doing the build my relationship with her and try to be friends first while learning and becoming more comfortable with myself.

Since she's 20 and a manager and I'm 17 and just a cook it's a weird dynamic but I feel a real connection to her like I've never felt with someone before. I just can hope she feels that same but I'm too awkward to ask and I don't feel like I should till I'm comfortable with myself and how I look / feel.

Trust me I know it's weird to ask this stuff on the internet I really don't have anyone else to ask so I'm turning here for any type of help on the matter. Thanks for reading.",28Apr2020,1

I decided to go back to school.  Was going to open my open business.  But with the way thing are I dont think the business will be viable for a few years.  Because of the pandemic.  

One course though I took was law.  It was business law.  And omg I kicked ass.  I got 100% on all the discussions and 100% on most of the applications  of law.  I hurt a bit on any multiple choice question.  I found it dense.  But once I knew the law I was great at using it.  

I hate researching.  But I love debating.  My husband jokes that he knows when I have gotten into a good debate cause I kinda type different and get all excited. My parents say the same. 

I am debating maybe perusing law school.  But I have never been the sit in a classroom type.  And I am a bit emotional if I get flustered.

274,"I've been doing homeschool since August, since my school district is run by morons. I wake up, do lessons, which is just already made lessons, then I do quizzes and writing assignments. My mom says I have to wake up at this specific time, but I actually don't. I tried to explain to her that if I haven't done schoolwork on a day that I have to do schoolwork I get anxious because I feel like I failed. She just says I'm making excuses (like with everything I say). She says her reasoning that I have to wake up at a certain time and start school at a certain time was because if she lets me do a later time, then I'll just ask if I can do it at a later time, and then I'll keep asking to push it to a later time. And she gets super angry whenever I try to ask why I have to wake up at this time. I keep trying to explain to her that I don't do that and that for the past 8 months I've been waking myself up and getting school done. I get the work done, there's proof of that. So she won't listen to me. I've resorted to ignoring her because she's being a literal child. I don't want to do school work late at night, I wanna be done by at most 2 PM. 

Another issue that's occasionally brought up is whenever I get a 70% on a test. That's a passing grade. Not only is that a passing grade, 70% is most of 100%. Showing that I know most of whatever was on the test. My mom won't even give me a reason for why that's not okay. She just goes ""NO YOU NEED TO GET AN 80% OR HIGHER"". 

Basically it's either her way or the highway. I don't listen to her though, I don't wanna go in on full detail about her because that'd be like 124 paragraphs long. How do I even begin to explain to her that having decent reasons for things and being open to counter arguments isn't the end of the world.

286,"Hello, 

So how do I explain this? My friend I'm gonna call her M so its easier. We were friends for over a year, and were very close, travelled the country together. We met because we were both obsessed with this band and we wanted to follow them on tour. So we did just that. During one point in the tour, M's grandmother passed away, and she called me upset, and I told her that it was okay if she skipped out on certain tour dates to be with her family. She decided to go to the concerts, and I also told her that was okay too, whatever she needed to to to be happy and feel better. So that happened summer last year.  we were very close always had each other's backs, went to tons of events together, called each other to talk about our feeling or problems, just regular best friend shit. 

Side note, this girl is OBSSESSED with this band like I'm obsessed but she has like this ego bc she was a fan since their first album like 6 years ago, and I only became a fan about 3 ish years ago.  

Fast Forward to the beginning of this year, the band came in town again and the spiraling of our friendship began. So back in January, we went to a concert together, all was fine. The next day the Band was having like a meet and greet event, however, to get in you you need to camp. Now M is like super against camping ( i do it all the time so it doesn't bother me and I was willing to do it but I had shit to do that day so I opted out). So the next day comes and I get an email and I was accepted to a Justin Bieber VIP event ( literally in no relation to the other event, I just got my credentials because there were open spots), so I was super excited and went to that event (I am a huge fan). So I get out of the JB event and she calls me ( mind you I had just Met Bieber himself and I was freaking out), and she asks me if I will go camp so we can see the other band the next morning at an interview.  so I'm in the clouds from just seeing JB so I agree and head to the location. Long story short, we don't get into the event bc u needed a specific pass. She was PISSED bc everyone that went to the Meet and greet event got in just by showing up and she didn't go. I didn't really give a shit about going to the meet and greet event bc I was seeing JB and that was more exciting for me, and I didn't mention camping to her bc I knew she would be against it. She was pissed off at me though bc I didn't tell her to go camp (bc I kinda knew that they would let everyone in) or I didn't suggest that we all camp out for the meet and greet event. And the entire time after camping and not getting into the interview she was pissed and kept saying shit like "" I learned I can't trust anyone"" or "" I need to listen to myself"". I didn't really give a shit about anything tho lmao I was high as a kite after meeting JB. Also key point, it was us and my other friend S camping for the interview. 

So I called her the next day to see if she was okay and got over her little tantrum. She was fine and she told me she was upset that she didn't get in and mad at me but was over it and that she was also mad at our friend S. Now S was going through a super hard time, her sister just had a stillborn child, she literally got ran over at a concert and broke her foot, and she also lost her job. So I was kinda like cut her some slack like she has been going through it. But we ended the conversation. A few days later I told her I felt uncomfortable how she was treating S and that I thought she needed to reevaluate her anger, and she got lowkey mad at me, I said I respected her opinion but from an outsiders point of view, I thought she was being stupid and losing S, a great friend.   So a few weeks after that, the band annoucned they would be going on tour. I told all my friends that I would only be purchasing tickets for a few shows. right, announced when that was happening my grandma fell very ill. I was going through a time of depression as I has to watch my grandmother pass away, and it was difficult during that time bc she was so severely ill that I had to take a lot of time off school and work to help out my family. It was a lot of sleepless nights and late-night runs to the emergency room.  I didn't really talk to anyone at that time bc I was always just so worn out.  So M was kinda pissed off at me before bc I couldn't tell her which concert dates I was going to. and she texted me ONCE to ask how I was doing ( in the span of over a month) and I told her everything that was going on in my life, and her advice just wasn't helping and I told her I didn't want to talk about it bc it made me sadder. and she just didn't talk to me after that. She then texted me a few weeks later to ask if we could buy concert tickets together so we could sit next to each other and I told her no bc I didn't think I was going to the concert, and that the band was the least of my worries( this was a few days before my grandma's passing when I knew it was going to happen). she also said to me which also made me a little upset, was that I tend to blow things out of proportion when it comes to anger or being sad. ( I feel like she didn't need to say that when I was losing a close relative whom I had lived with my entire life.) Anyways I texted her a few weeks ago to ask if she was okay in quarantine and that if she needed anything to let me know, and she just had a bland response, and that was the end I haven't spoken since. 

Did I do anything wrong? I felt like maybe I said something wrong that ticked her off.  Idk its just weird that I was there for her when her grandmother passed and she was MIA when mine did and caused me more stress. What do you think, do you think it's worth rekindling our friendship?",28Apr2020,1

I kinda began a fight with one of my friends I got mad at him for saying a rape victim is as bad as their rapist if they got pregnant and choose to abort it. I got really mad as well nobody should ever compare a rape victim to their rapist. We kinda fought for awhile and another member agreed with me. But the other one didn't.

 So it was pretty much a fight between two members of the group and the other two. It kinda ended in the other two just quitting the group and leaving.

295,"Okay, so this is a weird and complex situation - and I’m also on my phone, so bear with me and excuse any weird typos.

I’ll try to cover everything but if I miss a detail please rest assured I am doing what I can.

I am British. My sister and I sold a house last year and I went travelling with my money. 

When the pandemic ground the world to a halt it became quite clear I needed to go home for a while, plus my allowed time in Hungary (without applying for a residency card) was up. All other borders were inaccessible to me.

After dealing with flight cancellations I finally got a flight on 2nd May which, all being well, will get me back to the UK. 

With one big problem.

I have absolutely nowhere to live. 

Now, under normal circumstances I’d grab a hotel for a couple weeks while I look around for a flat.

A friend offered me a room without me even asking, revelled in the back pats and compliments, and then changed his mind the next day, saying he thinks it’s a really bad idea now he thinks about it.

My family aren’t even willing to offer me a couch for one single night so I can sort something. None of my other friends have offered.

I get it. I don’t want to endanger anyone. But... come on, you know? I’ve been isolating for weeks here, barely leaving my apartment. 

But no hotel is available as they’re all shut down or reserved specifically for key-workers by law. I’ve emailed and phoned every chain and hotel I can think of in my city and no luck. They just send me copy/paste “try your luck and see” type messages, without any real info about whether they can accommodate me.

I can’t do that. Too much financial risk. Nobody will answer me if I ask whether I could be turned away at the door for not being in one of the pre-selected groups for booking deemed by the govt. if anyone knows an actual answer to this I’d be grateful.

Rent here for those unaware is often 6 month min contract, so grabbing “literally anything available” just isn’t possible because anyone who’s ever lived in bad conditions for that long knows how mentally damaging it is. I survived a suicide attempt last year due to living conditions I was forced into, and I’ve no interest in putting myself back in that place.

I understand some of you will expect me to live in any old hovel that gets thrown at me and be grateful I even have that, but it just isn’t that simple. My mental health is important and I can’t do that to myself long term.

Sleeping on a floor will be shit but it likely won’t be for six months, you know?

I have the money to rent my own place for six months, finances aren’t the issue here, thankfully.

Anyway, even when I do find a property they refuse to take me because I’m not currently working and can’t apply for benefits until I’m back at home. (these take up to 8 weeks to come through anyway). Other times they just say “that property is unavailable right now” without explanation.

I’m just so stumped. I’ve even message the CAB, a homeless charity and emailed the local council but have had no reply they’re likely swamped.

297," I am hoplessly in love with this girl who doesn't feel the same for me but says she may consider me in future. I most certainly don't believe it and I know I am making a fool of myself. To add to it, she purposefully describes to me about her sexual expeirences with her ex knowing it that it ruins my day and takes away my mental peace, just to tease me. This triggers my ocd about intrusive thoughts and those mental images of them keep replaying in my head all the time. I have lost my sleep over this. I feel miserable all the time. It doesn't help that I have to see her ex practically every day, who inturn likes to belittle me about how I am not going to get anything and waste my time.

I know it is probably best to cut contacts with her, but it is not an option as I have to see her everyday and top of it she is going through some difficult times where she needs my help. I know I am being a big loser but I had thought of being virtuous and helping her out without expecting anything in return. So I cannot cut contact with her right now and leave her alone in a bad place, that is not an option. But this is slowly killing me.

I have dealt with many things in life from child abuse by my mom to being sexually abused by my dad (whom I still stay with, I plan to move out next year when I am done with my college), and as a result of it have suffered from HOCD but have largely recovered from it. But I suspect its my OCD kicking in when I have those mental thoughts of the girl and her ex playing in my head all the day. It also doesn't help that I am 21 and never been in any romantic relationship. I desperately need things to be in prespective.

Please help me, I don't think I will survive this mental anguish, I finally wanted to be happy in life but I am trapped. I had seriously thought of killing myself today have but come here as a last resort. Help me bring things in prespective.

298,"Apologies for any formatting issues, etc. This is my first Reddit post and I’m on mobile. 

For background (there’s a lot, sorry), I’m a teenager about to leave high school and go off to college. I was raised by two conservative parents whom I dearly love, but who were born and raised in different circumstances and developed traits that leave them unable to help me with this aspect of my life. One parent grew up middle class and spent decades working with the military, and the other grew up in poverty and immigrated to the US. 

I was homeschooled until high school and pretty sheltered, and never really learned how to be socially “normal”. Having lived the majority of my life as a “good boy”, I lost out on a lot of normal exploratory/rebellious childhood experiences in favor of an excellent schooling education, and basically nothing else. So I’m generally not the most interesting person to talk to. 

The results of this have been extremely hurtful — depression, extreme social anxiety, antisocial behavior, etc. which I’ve mostly been able to overcome. And in the “real world”, after many painful failures and embarrassing attempts, I’m getting better at making friends and establishing meaningful relationships. 

But I don’t know how to do that online, at all. My conservative parents hate social media (not exaggerating), so until recently I only had Snapchat for texting friends. I want to establish an online presence now that I have time during “quarantine”, but the newly-found confidence that I have in the “real world” doesn’t translate to the digital one. I end up making the wrong impressions, all the time. So in order to avoid drawing attention to myself, I just don’t post on social media, which results in exactly no online conversations, friends, etc. 

I’m about to go to college, where I know I will grow more. But growth starts within, so I want to start now. Then again, I don’t have any safety net and very little time with which to do so, because everyone around me grew up with social media and uses it far more than I do, so making the wrong impressions is far too easy and far too costly. I want to have a healthier online life, but I’m anxious and extremely cautious about doing so, and I don’t know where to start other than here. Though I have some friends and family, I don’t really want to talk to them about it. 

So, how can I become social on social media, and put my best foot forward, as someone who’s pretty out of touch with the rest of the world?

Due to covid-19 we have been doing all of our class work through online material. This means that all the end of year exams are online as well. 

I know it was stupid to meet up with other students to work on the exam, not even considering social distancing (which is dumb as well, i know) but I did it anyways. 

Even if i get a zero (0) on this exam I would still pass the course with a C. I'm not sure if because i met up with other students, he would fail me for the course.

The professor could see we were all on the same the same IP address and sent us an email asking to  explain ourselves. He has given us an opportunity to talk with him directly instead of going to the dean.

306,"For a guy in his late twenties I feel like I'm always just way too slow mentally, and its affecting my life negatively.

I've let people talk shit to me without being able to say anything back as I can't think making me look like a complete idiot, really fucked with me growing up as I constantly found myself in that situation. Hell once, I literally spoke gibberish when some ass was talking shit to me, had everybody cracking up on me.

I can't get a girlfriend as I have trouble seizing those super rare moments when I find myself in a situation to even talk to a girl who could like me. And if I do talk to her I often can't think on my feet fast enough to leave a good impression. And then if I make it all the way to getting an actual date I fuck it up as I get lost and can't think of things to say so she loses all interest. Sucks since once the opportunity passes its gone, only thing I can do is wait for the next opportunity which could take a year.

I have trouble finding jobs as well as I tend to do poorly in interviews especially if they throw me a curveball that's outside my ""script"" so I look like an idiot. I'm employed now but my pay is below market and I'm trying to find a better job.

I even find myself being slow in video games so I tend to get bodied in competitive games and this is with countless countless hours of play, and I've never been good at sports.

Even today I did a pathetic job protecting my dog, when suddenly someone's pit bull rushed toward me and grabbed my dog by the throat, and instead of doing something smart like digging his eyes out with my fingers or choking him unconscious I just yelled and punched and it took forever to get  him off that way and my dog ended up injured. Fortunately I did have the good sense to put a nice thick collar on my dog so it could of been worse, but man I could of did better. 

Since I thankfully haven't had a street fight in awhile, that episode with the dog has reminded me I could get murdered quick if I'm up against another dude and I can't think on my feet.

313,"I'm almost 23 and I'm still living at my parents' house.  If they were to pass away right now, I would be homeless and clueless as to how  I'd live my life.  I don't know how to manage a household, I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to do anything someone half my age should be able to do easily and naturally.  Government programs were supposed to start helping me with these things a long time ago, but who knows what happened with that.

With all that being said, I'm barely employed at all.  I work at my job training program getting 144 dollars a month maximum, and that's when I can actually go.  With COVID-19, I've been completely unemployed, and my family is flat broke.  I actually have to give my parents a chunk of this money, so I never get to see all of that 144 dollars.  This makes it really hard to save up money, but I needed to save up money to buy something that would allow me to hang out with my friends even more - a VR headset.

I heard that although they were more pricey, the HTC Vive was the way to go.  However, they cost over 1,000 dollars, and there's no way I'd ever be able to save up that kind of money.  I ended up finding one on ebay for 500 dollars plus shipping - it was the perfect listing.

""Fully tested and guaranteed to work"".  ""Comes with everything from the original box"".  ""Excellent shape, only a few light scratches"".  The seller even had a 100% satisfaction rating on ebay from the 2,000+ sales he'd done.  Perfect!  So I save up 500 dollars and purchase it.  When it arrives, it seems exactly as described.  The only problem is that I couldn't test it yet because it didn't come with the wall mounts for its Base Station sensors.

This is important because I had no idea it came with wall mounts.  By the time I did my research and saved up more money for wall mounts, the return period had ended a long time ago.  Additionally, PayPal's protection against this kind of thing is apparently not valid for this purchase.

When I finally got around to testing it, I found out that it was dead on arrival.  The motion trackers worked, the front camera worked, but everything else was broken.  The screens inside the headset actually had major damage.  It was packed very well and there's no possible way it was damaged during shipping unless someone at UPS physically unpacked it, broke it, and repacked it.

Me and my dad contacted the seller and asked for a refund, however it looks like he's ignoring us completely.  I got ripped off and I have no options to get that 500 dollars back.  500 dollars is a fortune to me, and there's things that came up recently that I actually need to buy, so getting that 500 dollars back is a necessity.  Impossible, but a necessity.

Small claims court is not an option for me, so that's completely out of the picture.  What should I do?  I refuse to believe there's no way to get the money back.",28Apr2020,1

He did use them when he was 18 when he was single. We are 20/21 now

around two years ago, age 13, i started high school. i fell into a very bad depression as i missed my old friends and old school and wasn't used to this extremely strict, very competitive private school. i started talking to a guy online who lived in america (im australian), we were similar ages and talked for around 6 months, all day, at least 4-5 hours a day. we both had seen eachothers faces and instagram, called ect so i knew i wasnt being pulled into anything. we were both kind of awkward but he was the only person ive had THAT close of a connection with in my life. we used to talk about how when we were older we could see eachother if he came to where i lived/ if i came to where he lived.

during the winter holidays that year my family and i went to the beach for a vacation. i was still pretty depressed at the time and stayed couped up in my room. he sent me a long text saying how much he appreciated me and loved me but he was sorry he couldnt do it (sorry about this, some of the details are a bit blurry). i was confused and thought he was mad at me or something. he had killed himself. he admitted what he had taken and how he felt sick and everything was shaking and i absolutely panicked. i called his sister (i cant even remember her name) and begged her to go home and check on him, i believe if i wasnt sobbing and screaming that loudly she would have thought i was crazy. i told her that she needed to make him throw up all of the pills he had digested and she told me she was almost there and would help him and hung up.

thats the last i ever heard of them, and they ever heard of me. it absolutely destroyed me, i havent told anyone in my life. my parents still to this day dont know why i was vomitting and panicking. his death single handedly ruined me - i fell into a much deeper depression and basically gave up on my life, not to mention my best friends were all fake and i was completely alone. i am doing better but still cant think about him without crying, writing this has been especially hard. i dont believe im physically capable of loving someone as much as i loved him - i have a boyfriend who i adore but my brain always has in the back of my mind ""what if he killed himself? what if he left you too?"". i dont know what to do, can i get help without anyone (family, friends, school) finding out?",28Apr2020,1

My anxiety levels have shot through the roof causing me to binge more since I do that when I binge eat. I saw a psychiatrist when I was younger for PTSD who diagnosed me with PTSD and anxiety. I am also extremely depressed all the time and I can't remember the last time that I was happy and not in pain. I always feel like a burden and because my mom complains more about her chronic illnesses (me and my mom both have physical chronic illnesses) I'm not ever paid attention to when I'm too worn out to do anything and still have to do the heavy lifting (both physically and mentally) which causes me to pass out and be in pain. My mom was abusive when I was younger and has gotten better, but is still manipulative and can be mean because she says things like ""you eat too much""(even though I constantly restrict she only sees the binge part) and ""we won't survive if you eat all our food"" ( I usually eat about 800-1200 calories a day). My dad is the only person I talk to but whenever I mention anything about my mental or physical health he gets disappointed and I feel like I failed him, so I keep everything to myself. I can't talk to my friends about it because they noticed my eating habits and I had to lie and say it was my medical condition acting up again and I feel like they already hate me enough. My one friend that I would talk to about this also has trouble with an eating disorder and I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable. I don't know who to talk to about this and I'm really sorry this was so long. My family can't afford a therapist or anything like that anymore especially now due to coronavirus, I just don't know how much longer I can do this. Any advice is appreciated. thanks",28Apr2020,1
318,"So a friend of mine, she is a great person and very genuine, but she has been a member of young living for a while. She has not forced people into buying and becoming members but she endorsed it and believes she is part of a wonderful community, and that YL is making her and the people she recruits “financially independent.” We are kinda close but not enough for me to say that what she is doing is not morally right. I don’t know what to say to her, and I feel now that I read a lot about YL and I personally feel that MLMs are designed to deceit people at some level, what do I say to her. She is in college right now and probably wants to live her life doing this for sure, I don’t know exactly what more she wants but I feel that she is pretty happy with something like YL and the sad thing is that she really believes in the essentials oils and how one can mix and make better concoctions and live naturally! 
I personally do not understand if a company’s product is soo good then why don’t they just bring it in he shelves and sell it through retails stores on site or online!! 
I don’t know what to do in this situation.

319,"Sorry but it's a bit of a rant because this has been on my mind for a while now.

  


Around November I was laid off and didn't end up finding a job until January ish. Even then the job was a cook position and not in my actual field but I needed the money. Now COVID has taken the world and no one is hiring so I can't find a new job. I can't apply for the Canadian relief benefit because I wasn't laid off and am still working. The place I work for is small and I'm one of 5-6 staff, two of which are my managers who happen to be dating each other. At first, the work was easy and management laid back but now it's become the biggest stress source in my current life. The managers are constantly calling me in to cover because they can't make a decent schedule and the one manager is always tired and sick so the other manager lets her leave early. On top of the managers always do sloppy work and leave without getting all the prep done for their shift, only to come in the next day and scold me for not doing it all when I come in. I've brought my issues up twice to the managers and each time they toss me a small raise and ignore my concerns, the one manager even setup a meeting at 8:30 am before my shift to talk it over but didn't even show up. When I talked to the owner about my issues he told me "" they are good people and I want everyone to get along"". The other employees always tell me they feel the same about the issues but nothing ever changes. I feel trapped in a box because I can't get another job due to COVID and I can't afford to have any income so I'm forced to smile and pretend nothing is wrong. Honestly, it's becoming too much and id appreciate any advice you guys have to offer.",28Apr2020,1
320,"Hello, recently I (18F) have been feeling like my friends especially one of my good friends in particular (18F) seem really cold(?) I'm not sure if that's the correct word for it. She was usually a very supportive friend and she gives a lot of good advice but recently it feels like she disagrees with me a lot and even when I say something in a joking manner (I joke a lot and pretty laidback and I guess she knows that since we are very close) she treats it very seriously and makes it a point to disagree with whatever I said?

I'm not sure if my sense of humour changed but I realised a lot of my friends are starting to treat my jokes more seriously as if I actually mean them and it disturbs me quite a bit...

Another problem is that I seem to hate it when people disagree with me especially in this case when it's not even something I mean. I'm starting to get really frustrated and I feel that the problem lies with me and how I take many things personally.

329,"TL;DR: I want to move away from my ever-worsening Mom and Grandma. BF offered to help me move out, but doesn't want to until I talk to her and give her a chance to do better in case I regret it. Is it even worth talking to her? Should I just leave?

Please tell me I'm not crazy. About a year ago I (23F) began to suspect my mom was not a great person to me. I was confused for a long time, but I knew she made me miserable. A lot of the usual signs like never listening to me, being petty, keeping me from becoming independent in a lot of ways, but anyways lately she has become worse than ever before. We fight all the time, she gaslights, she blames everyone else, she overreacts to everything, and is generally awful to be around. Yesterday we got in the worst fight of our relationship quite possibly. I jokingly brought up that maybe next time my bf came over she could eat a little less salad because he didn't get a chance to get any and wow was that the wrongest possible thing to say apparently.

She blew up and screamed that I was selfish and awful because I only cooked dinner for him and myself, even though I told her three times before she left in a huff to get a rotisserie chicken that I was going to make her and Grandma wontons, which took a lot less time than steak which I was making so they weren't being made right away. The screaming escalated about me being useless, and ungrateful, and wasting her money, eating her food, sleeping in her house, and taking up her energy for 20 years (sorry you had to parent?), and why didn't she see any of my salary. Grandma ofc chimed in waggling her finger and telling me not to talk to my mother like that, calling me shameless, and generally making it worse after being told an edited version by my mother. Interestingly enough, mom refused to take rent from me saying she wanted me to do work for her instead. I also ""rest"" all the time even though I work extensively from home for low pay.

I ran upstairs crying to the bathroom, and my lovely mom followed, yelling through the door, and for the first time ever called me a bitch (3x), and continued on her rant talking circles, and banning my boyfriend and saying she would confiscate stuff from me. Before the fight got started, I had offered to go with her to the small rental home she owned to help set up some security cams as a favor before meeting with my boyfriend, and then facetiming a friend. Then magically the woman forgot that part where I offered a favor, and that I had plans on my one day off which I told her twice at breakfast, and then said I owed her, and that if the house didn't get rented it would be my fault, and then glared at me until I went with her. By the end of the day she hugged me and thanked me. I didn't know what to do, and it's weird af and I'm disgusted with myself and her.

In any case the fights seem keep going and going and going, and while she recently lost her brother in a very difficult and ongoing situation, she is undoubtedly a monster to me even for someone in grief, and even mean to Grandma who while probably a narcissist is in declining health and has memory problems. In any case I am sick of them both, I resent them, and I'm not in a place where I'm ready to open up a discussion with them. My bf offered to help me get a place since I don't make enough to rent a place anywhere nearby, but he wants me to talk to Mom as a final warning.

He doesn't get it really having pretty average parents who are both alive, but seems to balk at moving forward with getting an apartment, and says I seem so disinterested in everything. Yeah I'm depressed and chronically ill dumbass, and fighting to stay even vaguely normal in this hellhouse really sucks the passion out of life. In any case, I'm disappointed in him, but perhaps I'm wrong. Is it even worth it to have a goodbye/ final chance conversation with mom? I strain to tolerate them because I have nowhere else to go, and resent my situation. Two job offers that could have given me a shot at independence were suspended because of covid and my boyfriend seems like the one way out, but now I'm not even sure of that.

332,"So I have been friends with my bff for a year now. Most of the time she messages me she says, ‘Let’s play. I found this really nice game.’ But the thing is, I don’t like playing the game. I keep ignoring/avoiding her because of it. Today I finally talked to her about it.                                                      
Me: I have something to tell you                                                
Her: What?                                                                                  
Me: I don’t like playing *insert game*

Me: You don’t have to play the game if you’re scared

Me: Well I don’t want to play something I don’t even like
An hour later she proceeded to send me picture of her arm which was scratched ( not severely ); She then told me that she wants to disappear and die because of her family then she asked me if I could help her and of course I said sure. The conversation ended with her wanting to play the game with me but I said no. I told her to make other friends so she’ll be happier and she said ‘I only need one friend and that’s you’. After a few minutes she sent me a picture of her playing and the caption was ‘playing *insert game* alone’ then she proceeded to ask me if I was free and if I wanted to play but I still said no. Is she manipulative or am I just an inconsiderate friend?",28Apr2020,1
333,"Some things to say upfront, yes I created an alt to post this because I'm panicking about this being linked back to me in any possible way. And yes, I've looked through multiple subreddits trying to come to a final conclusion but in the end just felt more confused and panicked.

TL;DR: Used Chegg on the final question of my engineering final exam and discovered after taking the test that it has a step that is wrong, we never went over in class, and could potentially show I cheated. I used Chegg because I only had 30 minutes to submit and began panicking. Seriously considering emailing the professor and admitting I cheated. Can't work up the guts to tell any of my friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking exams during this coronavirus pandemic has become extremely stressful and tempting to cheat on them all, considering no proctor or way to ensure we aren't looking up the answers. As a countermeasure of course, all of my exams have been open note to reduce cheating, but in the moment I felt like it was the only way.

The exam was due at 5pm and I woke up at noon, a little later than I had wanted. I took an hour to eat, relax with my family, and watch TV for a bit before I started. I then spent 4 hours progressively becoming more and more stressed as the time went down. The problems were ones we had gone over in class, but my brain couldn't focus and the pressure on me to make sure I get an A in the class was insane. Multiple times I felt petrified and stunned and I began breathing heavily and scratching myself nervously. My mother is exceptionally stern on getting A's in classes and having her constantly around since I was vacated from campus had made stress go up. And, I knew I could get an A on this exam, I just didn't have the foresight to have started early enough. At the one hour mark I really began pulling on my hair and truly going into panic mode.

As I got to question 5, I was too deep in the panic to realize it was a problem we had done on our very last homework assignment, just with a distributed load to make it slightly more complex. I was too wrapped up in pressure to look at the procedure I had used in my homework and apply it to this problem. I was so caught up in the moment that out of desperation I looked the answer up. Someone else in my class had posted the question to Chegg, and I wrote the procedure down. The person who had completed the problem made some errors which I fixed in my derivation, and with only 10 minutes left I rushed to my copier, exported as PDF, and submitted.

For days I have been getting more and more anxious at the thought of getting caught. I kept thinking back to the last problem and how the steps I took might be traced back to the Chegg. Just an hour ago I was thinking about it, and decided to really look into the steps and see if they could be followed. Everything looked fine except for one single line. One calculation that seemed to make sense in the moment, but looking back at it now, we never went over a step like that. It's a useless calculation that stands out in the middle of derivation that changes my answer and is out of the blue. Now, I don't know what to do.

I love this school. I love the people and friends I've made. I love the house I plan on living in next semester with said friends. I'm looking forward to next semester's classes. This is the dream college I've always wanted to go to since I was a kid and I've made my parents so proud. But to lose it all to one question on a take home exam during coronavirus would devastate me. I have interviews with companies lined up that I've wanted to work for my entire life and this school provides so much, but I now am in a circumstance where I could be reported for cheating and lose it all. And it's heart wrenching. I don't want to lose it all because of this. Because of the panic I had and the moment of weakness where I just needed the answer and needed to finish. If I had woken up earlier or not spent as much time watching TV, I might have been able to avoid making this mistake, but now I'm constantly afraid when I hear a new email in my inbox, worrying it's the one that says ""You cheated, we need to talk"".

A poll was recently taken from my school, in which 1/3 of students admitted they have cheated. Users on Reddit are publicly saying they are cheating because it is open note and during a time like this it's disadvantageous not to, and that professors won't care as much. But the honor in going to this college and for me to risk everything on one problem has made me terrified. I'll admit that I am a goodie two shoes, and I've cheated on things like Spanish quizzes or English papers, but never a college final exam.

Now I'm terrified to talk to my friends and reveal that I did this. I know that they wouldn't judge me by it and try to help me feel better, but I'm ashamed of myself and don't want them to even know that I did this. Posting this helps me feel like I'm confessing. But now I have a choice I need to make.

Do I write an email to my professor, admitting I cheated and explaining how embarrassed I am and hope he only deducts points?

Or do I keep quiet and wait for final grades to be released two weeks from now?

I genuinely don't know and am too afraid to approach anyone in my life about it.",28Apr2020,1

We both share an interest in art and we have become so close over the years. She’s called me for everything, from finding a kitten under her porch to a pregnancy scare. We talked every day about everything. She was my best friend, and she told me i was hers.

A few months ago, before the pandemic, she finally got a job at Subway after not being full-time employed for about 3 years. She used to nanny for a family here in Texas, but she moved to North Carolina with her husband when she got married (2017) and was struggling with unemployment. She was super excited to get the job and i remember her calling me after her first day to tell me about it. She lives in a small rural town and hasn’t had any friends since moving there, and i don’t have any friends here either. We both related to each other in that sense, and found comfort in the fact that we were at least there for each other. 
Over the course of the following month, she proceeded to text me and call me less. We still talked some, and she talked about how busy she was and how it was hard to get used to the new routine. She enjoyed it, but the learning curve took the energy out of her. 
That was in January. 
It is now the end of April. 
I haven’t spoken to her since February. She won’t respond to my texts or calls, or even my snapchat messages. 
I’ve reached out many times to see if maybe i did something or said something, but the last time we talked it was about art. 
I had asked my bf about her to see if maybe his younger sister had spoken to her. I was told that his younger sister had in fact spoken to his older sister (my friend) and that she was doing fine and that her hours at the store were actually cut to part time for now. 
Hearing that sent me all kinds of signals. 
If she’s not that busy anymore why won’t she answer me? How come she won’t even open my messages? How come she won’t return my calls? How come she won’t talk to me?
Now i understand still keeping in close contact with family, especially during a pandemic, but i’ve been worried sick about her. It was really frustrating to hear that someone i considered family, and someone i thought felt the same about me, refuses to contact me or even just relay a message to me. 
I have been left hanging many-a-time by people i love and care about. It’s not unusual for me to be used for what they need me for and then just dropped as if i didn’t matter. 
I just thought she was different. I want to think it’s not that she realized i’m actually no use to her, but i don’t know what to think if she won’t talk to me. 
What do I do? What do i say? 
Please help me. My heart is hurting.",28Apr2020,1
348,So I am a virgin... I’m going to college and I’m 19 years old living with my best friend in the whole world. She is absolutely fucking gorgeous and I’m not bad looking myself either if I do say so. She is in love with me and wants desperately to have sex. One issue though... I get really anxious when I get close to being intimate with her. I could never have sex with my last girlfriend for whatever reason. I know it’s not ED because I took a viagra and it really didn’t seem like it was gonna fix the issue. Whenever I get anxious I just immediately lose my boner. I also watch porn but I’m trying to stop immediately because I worry that it could also be a contributing factor. I absolutely cannot disappoint this girl. I’m going to get my hormones checked this week because I have a suspicion my testosterone could be coming into play. Honestly I have no idea what my issue is but all I know is that I lose my boner in every situation I really expect to have one. PLEASE DROP ANY ADVICE!🙏🏼 I WOULD LITERALLY GIVE ANYTHING TO HAVE SEX WITH THIS GIRL,28Apr2020,1
349,"[TL;DR : I want to learn Japanese but I think Chinese is more important in regards to the professional opportunities it offers.]

Hi. I've been accepted into an international business school, and my course starts in September, if the world hasn't ended by then. 
My question is, for business, which language should I learn ?

I care very little about the difficulty, that isn't a problem. 

I would love to learn Japanese, as I really like their feudal history, and some of their shows, ""anime"" and films, such as Spirited Away, were an important part of my childhood. So, for FUN, essentially, I want to learn Japanese.

But Chinese, for business, seems like a much better investment. But is it such a better investment that I should spend endless hours studying the language of a country I'm not overly fond of, rather than one I'm actually enthusiastic to learn ? Learning both seems like a suicidal move. 
""Fluent in Mandarin Chinese"" looks amazing on a Curriculum Vitae, or a Résumé, and says a lot about you. China is soon to become the world's largest economy by every standard, even though it already is really, so obviously that will open up opportunities. But the brainy Chinese people I'd be eventually meeting for business will no doubt speak English, so is it really so important? 
""Fluent in Japanese"" looks good too, and also says a lot about you. 

I'm so torn.

350,"I started dating my girlfriend while I was away for college and it has been a very strong relationships, despite the distance. She’s about a 5 hour drive from me, which if we weren’t quarantined, would be no big deal. We planned on visiting each other 1 or 2 times a month, trading off each time we go. However, since I’ve come home from school my mom has been highly controlling. She expects me to consistently spend time with my family when I’m a college student who rarely gets a minute off. She is blatantly disrespectful when I’m in class. When my brother is in class, you can hear a pin drop in my house, but when I’m in class, it’s a warzone. I’ve asked her multiple times when I’ll be able to visit gf, and she always gives me a similar response like “I don’t know. When the governor lifts the order,” or “when non-essential travel is legal.” which are both totally acceptable responses, if she wasn’t such a hypocrite. She frequently invites over my cousins and makes routine stops to my uncle’s house who is older and would be at very high risk if he were to get the virus. When I ask her, she says “well, they’ve been inside the whole time and have been very careful.” But that argument seems invalid to me because i can count on one hand how many times I’ve gone outside in the last month, and my gf hasn’t left her house at ALL. I’m 18 years old and think I’m old enough to make an intelligent decision, especially when I’ve been very diligent about not putting myself or my family in harms way in regard to this damn virus.

351,"
I’m a female, mid-thirties, married, young mother, working health professional. This is a new job following my 18-month maternity leave. I have been there about six months. My boss is male, twenty years my senior. 

Up until recently, I really loved my boss. He can make some inappropriate jokes at work (more on that in a minute), but he is generally quite good to me. He has done a number of kind things for me personally. 

However, recently he has started jokingly insulting me, such as by making digs about my knowledge levels and whether or not my coworkers like me. He has openly admitted to trying to push my buttons at times, as he seems fascinated by how calm and collected I always am, even amidst the stress of our workplace. I don’t mind friendly teasing, but his comments are actually starting to really bother me and make me feel shitty about myself and my role in this workplace. It feels like he is trying to “bring me down a peg,” which is strange to me because I am always quick to ask questions and ask for help. I don’t have a complex about being right all the time or making mistakes, so I’m not sure where all this is coming from, or, perhaps he is playing some sort of game with my reactions... I really don’t know.

For what it’s worth, he has previously commented on my intelligence in a positive way many, many times. And it’s clear my coworkers and I get along. So again, I don’t know where the insults are stemming from, but there is part of me that can’t help but think there is always a hint of truth behind every joke.

Insulting my knowledge levels is a particular sore spot for me, given my recent return from maternity leave. There is certainly a feeling of having “missed out” professionally the past 18 months, so for someone to insult my professional knowledge after that time away feels like quite a blow.

Further, he makes a lot of sexualized comments to me. He is always commenting on my looks (in a positive way, but obviously sexualized). He works sex into the conversation on a regular basis. For example, he has made comments to me like “I bet you like to take charge in bed.” I mostly give him odd looks and laugh it off and try to busy myself with a patient or something else. I haven’t made a big deal about any of his comments, but even writing this, I feel like perhaps I am letting him get away with too much.

I realize this is long and rambly and I’m not even sure what kind of advice I’m looking for. I suppose I just want opinions about what is going on here and how I should react or handle it. 

I don’t want to quit my job. I’m also not the type of woman to just endlessly take someone’s crap, either. Am I overthinking things? Should I be even more upset than I am? Are these all just mind games he’s playing with me? What is really happening here?",28Apr2020,1

353,"We have a good life, a comfortable one. In many ways, we live beyond our means.

When I've asked ""what do you want to do?"" there is never a thoughtful answer. I understand, in my thirties with a growing family and a full house, there are many reasons why we should be encouraged to hustle yet finding the right fit seems all too elusive. I implore that she takes advantage of all the privileges we have. Particularly that of having a choice.

I try to be practical about most things. We have basic necessities that are constantly met by a mix of help, trickery, and ingenuity. However, the lifestyle we want can't be achieved this way. Throughout our marriage, there has always been some kind of life event that stops us from bettering ourselves. I feel grief and have gone through all the stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Sometimes I feel like I'm giving up on her but I can't stand it and get slingshot back into action, any action.

I’ve had a few ppl tell me to get the new SE iPhone. They say it’s the size of an iPhone 8 with the inside stuff of an iPhone 11.

355,"I live in a secured apartment building. Earlier this year, the leasing office decided to stop accepting packages. They directed mail carriers to leave packages at the resident’s doorstep. Most of the time drivers won’t care and will just leave the package in the mailroom, even though there are signs posted everywhere to leave it in front of each unit’s doorstep. I’m not too upset when they don’t leave it at my doorstep, because why should they have to go to three separate buildings, just because the leasing office is being lazy? 

At first, I had my order from Victoria’s Secret stolen. It was pretty frustrating, and I never found the package. My roommate suspected that the driver just delivered it to the wrong address. The other day, my package from Amazon was delivered. I don’t want to go out too frequently (the mailroom is in a separate building), and I had another package that was going to be delivered in 2 days. When I went to retrieve both packages, only one of them was there. Someone stole the bigger package that sat there for two days thinking that they won the lottery, when in reality it was just giant tubes of bubble wrap from Amazon. 

I’m a product tester, so I get free products all the time to test. I ordered my bubble wrap the same time I ordered two products to test. I pay for the product upfront, and then the company reimburses me once the item ships. Since my bubble wrap got stolen, I wanted to report it to Amazon that I never received my package. However, if I get a refund/exchange issued then the free product company will be notified that I got a refund and ban me. They’ll think that I returned the product to get double the money, when in reality I just never received it. There’s no way to contact the company at all. 

I want to file a police report because my credit card that I used to purchase the items comes with purchase protection, so they will reimburse me. I noticed that another package got delivered yesterday, and it was nowhere to be found. I have the standardized locked mailboxes that are common when you live in an apartment. It says that the package was left in the mailbox, but nothing was inside besides my order from Best Buy. 

After that happened, I don’t know if someone is actually stealing my packages, or if something else is going on here. I’m sure that my Victoria’s Secret and Amazon packages were stolen because they were left idling in the mailroom, but my Nordstrom order said that it was left in the mailbox and nothing was inside. 

I don’t want to call up these companies saying that I didn’t receive my packages, because I know they keep track of  how many times someone calls in about a “stolen package”, and I don’t want to get banned from shopping with them just because someone keeps stealing my stupid packages. Should I just file a police report, or just contact the company and risk getting banned?

TL;DR packages keep getting stolen at secure apartment complex. I don’t want to contact the retailer because this has been such a common occurrence, and I don’t want to get banned from shopping with them because they think I’m scamming them. Should I file a police report, or just let it go?",28Apr2020,1

357,"So I’ve been living alone in an apartment with two rooms. The other room’s meant for my sister who’s out of the country and is supposed to come back around August this year. So a month before the pandemic, my friend whom I’ve known since highschool (I wouldn’t consider her as my BEST friend but she’s close to my heart we’ve always been together in highschool but then went to different colleges and kept in touch from time to time), asked if she could stay at my place temporarily because she’s having family problems. So ofc I’d let her stay over. But ngl I liked being alone and with her around I just can’t be my weird normal self walking around naked, having loud concerts in the shower etc.. 

And then the pandemic happened she was finally going back home but then there’s older people in her family and she might be an asymptomatic carrier so she stayed a little longer. But then I’m having an issue about her large usage of electricity. It’s not that I’m being cheap, well yeah I guess I am but that’s cos my family’s not financially stable. I don’t use heaters AT ALL even during winter. I don’t use hair dryers and I unplug every appliance not in use. It’s a small way to help my parents with finances (they’re in a third world country while I’m in Canada, I send money to my family every now and then) So yeah my friend’s been using the heater in her room a lot and blow dries her hair and I noticed my electricity bill went UP. Not only that, she goes to her boyfriend’s apartment a lot and note that he’s got roommates. I don’t think they’ve been 100% isolating cos I see it on their insta stories that they’d go out sometimes. Apart from the electricity bill, I have an issue about whether or not she may be unknowingly infected. 

She’s already cool with her family they even had supper and all that. She can go home I don’t understand why she’s still here?? But I don’t wanna come across as rude to tell her to move out.",28Apr2020,1

Everyday I wake up, go into the office, have to lock the door and sit in the same spot for 8 hours. The work itself is non existent due to all the restrictions, meaning that I am answering about 2-3 emails all day without actually inspecting units (apartments) and doing anything productive. To make matters worse, I recently have gotten out of a relationship with a specific person, who I met through work itself. Its for the better, but absolutely every single thing reminds me of her. I see her car and it drives me insane. I sit and overthink and stair at the clock until I can finally get in my car and drive home. I feel like the longer I stay there, the more detrimental to my healing in regards to moving on from this relationship.

363,"So I (14M) have 1 brother and 1 sister in my family along with parents. I am youngest and I know they have more authority over me but they are relentless. I hate my mom, sister, and father. My brother is the only kind person, he is oldest child. He actually treats me as an equal and if I am being honest, while my father wasn't around for me and him, he was sort of like a dad to me. Hell he is the only father figure I have ever known. He is the only one I care about and actually love. My mom and sister on the other hand, I can do without them. They are so careless and relentless on me. An example of this would be the K-pop they listen to. I don't mind that they like K-pop, you like the music you like whatever. (we're Arab Americans btw, and Muslim) My mom is religious while me and both my siblings are not religious. Anyways, they always play the same 2 songs 67 times a day (I counted) on average, and they look at the group Monsta X as some sort of God's. They fucking WORSHIP THEM. They also look at South Korea as some sort of Utopia, saying things like ""were gonna meet our soulmates there"" even tho my mom is fucking MARRIED. My sister is way out of hand, it's gone from us not talking, to we can't ve un the same room together without any problems. I ask them calmly to turn the kpop off once in a while, so there's regular TV. They just tell me to shut the fuck up and deal with it. They are also doing this thing with ""losing weight and exercising"" and they may sure they eat but if they are out on walks or they already have food they just want to let me and my brother and dad starve. It's always catering to them, and they complain when we do the same. They are always controlling the TV too, it's always Kpop or exercise videos. And all of my life both my parents emotionally neglected me and my brother. While my sister got all attention and love. And what's really unfair is how they are now getting sexual, saying stuff like how they'd basically marry and fuck the kpop members. And how they only want Koreans. But yet, if I talk about something like that and if a hot actress comes on TV I can't say they're hot while they always call the members of kpop ""hot"". That's my mom and sister. My dad is a different situation, although my mom just emotionally neglected me and I want to fight my sister and actually hurt her. My dad beat me as a kid. I don't like the a word, so let's just say he always beat me anytime for no reason. I'm not allowed to leave the house besides for school, I can't see friends, and yet if I'm on my computer to avoid family I'm yelled at. My dad is also heavy on religion even though he does non religious stuff, even marrying my mom in her religions way before she converted, he did not do anything the right way. So he's a Hippocrate and is heavy on religion. Me and him don't go well together, same with my mom and sister. I don't even have my own room, I share it with my sister cause mu dad refuses to move or spend money on us. I have so much anger and I just honestly, want to die. I know so many people have worse, but imagine being me. I don't even sleep in a bed. 'My"" room I share with my sister is hers. I sleep on the couch every night, and I don't have any real belongings. I can't even have any privacy, because as soon as I want it they won't leave me alone. And it's always her way or no way, my parents even side with her all the time, and God forbid I have something nice and she doesn't. Let me put this in an example. With me and my brother, we had to cook our own food, while with my sister, my mom will cook a full on fucking buffet. I own, one Xbox 360, that is all. And my sister wants to destroy it, my brother bought it too for me I didn't buy it. I love the thing, and they don't want me having anything nice. Another thing is they are so fucking sexist. If my sister watches a fucking softcore porno and says she'd fuck someone, she's fine, my mother even agrees sometimes. But if I play game with a little bit of cleavage shown, not even nipples, the kind you'd see in public from a blouse, I'm grounded.

I'm pretty sure he has depression but he doesn't want to get help because he thinks they will just try to medicate him and he doesn't want to be an ""emotionless zombie"". 

      I made plans with my friend connor to go to prom with him in January before me and my bf started going out. Now he really wants to go but all of our friends have dates and he doesn't want me to dump my friend because he doesnt want to come between me and connor, but he really wants to go. 

        He literally cried over facetime with me today because he feels so bad that ""he's so selfish"" and that nobody really cares a out him. He says that everybody would be just as content at prom if he wasn't there, and that at parties he's just a like garnish to the already fun activities and that he isn't needed. He says that people don't like him as a person and they only like his ""jester persona"" he puts on around others. Nothing I say comforts him and I don't know what to do.

365,"Hi, so to make this short, here's my dilema:

I've worked hard to build a strong relationship with my older brothers, as we grew up very distant and aggressive. As a pre-teen I had finally achieved it and we have been close throughout our teen years. 

Now my older brothers are in their very early 20's and I'm barely behind. Recently I've been getting frustrated with their downright nasty and unprovoked behavior towards my younger brother, but I've never been able to say anything, as our relationship has always been so shallow. I've come to realize my older brothers are extremely selfish and the strong relationship I thought we had was just surface level. Sure we'll laugh together and get in trouble together and have a grand time, but we aren't close close. 

I have been growing discontent with their selfish behavior and treatment of others but I ignored it and lived happily because I didn't wanna start anything, but this past weekend my mother wanted to go on a hike, as we have been stuck inside for over a month due to corona and our household is very, very large. My little brother ended up throwing an absolute fit and my two older brothers ditched us and went on another hike because they don't like him. Those were their words. But of course they had a pocket full of excuses later. 

I felt betrayed as I had cared enough about my mother to go on the hike with her and my awful little brother but they hadn't cared enough to do the same for me. 

I didn't wanna prolong my upset-ness so I communicated with them why and how I felt ditched and they did not care. The boys told me they were gonna do what they were gonna do.

 Skip forward about 2 days our quarantine gets extended and one of the boys sends it to our group chat and I expressed my sadness and so did one of the boys, and I had made a comment on how at least he has a car and leaves almost daily (I've been home all this time). 

Now he's mad at me and wont speak to me, claiming I hate him because he has a car and I don't which is simply dumb. The issue is whenever I try to communicate, they don't care or flip it around and say I'm mad of something stupid (like being jealous he has a car and I don't) when really I explained crystal clear I felt ditched and that sucked and all they had to say was they were gonna do whatever they wanted. 

I want to fix this but I haven't done anything wrong and I've tried communicating but they aren't receptive. It really hurts to have your closest people gang up on you and just dislike you when they are the ones who ""started"" it. I feel upset because they're in their 20's and they can't see from my perspective. I haven't yelled or accused or been angry at all. I'm just sad and I feel guilt and blamed and I want to fix this. I'm stuck in quarantine after all, I don't want each day to suck. Sorry this is long.",28Apr2020,1

The first the she does after work is scream and complain about how terrible we are and how the house isn’t 100% perfect because my little brother won’t do a thing around the house. However why is this? If my little brother gets told to do something he throws a tantrum (he’s 14) he throws stuff and punches things if he doesn’t get what he wants such as cigarettes from my mom or weed to being told to do the dishes, But when this happen my mom normally gives him what he wants and tells me it’s my fault he’s acting this way because I start it ( half the time I’m not even in the room when he starts getting like that) I don’t like to be near my brother because he makes me uncomfortable, he talks about masturbation and the kind of porn he watches constantly as well as he is CONSTANTLY eating, thus leaving us with barely anything some nights for dinner

There is so much more but I just can’t put it all into words with how just frustrated I am with this whole situation

Hi guys. Sorry if this isn’t the right place nor format, I’m just sort of in a panic right now and don’t know how to approach this. My friend (He really does seem like a genuine friend) logged into my canvas account(He somehow was able to get the password to my google account which is the same for my canvas. I changed my google password but not my canvas one.), download my oral speaking project, and submit it as his own. I got a 0/30 because we had the same recording. I asked him about it, and he told me that he took it but he would straighten it out with our teacher. I get another worksheet of mine graded today, and she leaves a comment telling us to write each other’s name on our papers if we work together because we have the same answers. At this point I’m ready to go to my parents, but I decide to have him explain it. He first sort of denies it, saying that it doesn’t make sense because the conjugations would be the same for everyone. He then relents when I ask him if he had the same answers for the personal sentences. What should I do moving forward? I don’t want him to get in trouble, but he could really mess with my grade. I have screenshots of him admitting to it on Snapchat. This is in High School.",28Apr2020,1

372,"Hi guys, warning this is probably going to be long but I would really love to hear from someone who has experienced a similar situation or anyone that has any advice! 

I have been working/studying from home for about a month now due to corona &amp; I’ve been going for a walk everyday to make sure I still get my 10,000 steps in. On about day 3 I noticed a young guy probably about 20 walking with his dog behind me. I didn’t really think much of it but after about 20 minutes I decided to not just lower the volume of my podcast but completely turn it off &amp; remove my earphones. I didn’t speed up because my father had told me when I was younger that the person might then think I’m scared &amp; they might take that as a sign I wouldn’t fight back. I did change my route though &amp; I made sure I was on main roads. Eventually I lost him &amp; I thought that was the end of it &amp; I was probably just overreacting.
The next day I went out for my walk again &amp; went a similar route because I had honestly completely forgotten. About half an hour in i noticed he was behind me again, so I did what I had done the day before &amp; changed my route, same thing happened I eventually lost him &amp; went home. 
The next day I decided I was going to go at a different time &amp; a completely different way just in case. Well he ended up behind me again, I did what I had been doing for the past 2 days &amp; decided to have a few days off from walking. About a week later I went out again at a completely different time &amp; a new way, but he still ended up behind me, this time without his dog.
After talking with some friends they convinced me I was overreacting &amp; I just lived in a small area, it was probably a coincidence. 
So today after a horrible morning of essay writing I decided to go for a walk &amp; get some rest before coming home &amp; studying again. Everything was going fine for a while, the only people I ran into were nice old ladies &amp; people with cute dogs. But then I saw him again, I started panicking &amp; made sure I had my keys out, mentally preparing myself for having to fight off a guy twice my size. I ended up walking for 2 hours before losing him &amp; going home. I’m now really starting to feel like something is off, just little things like him not bringing his dog anymore are sort of frightening. 

I’m not even sure if he is following me, but if he is I don’t understand how. Everytime I’ve made sure that I have lost him before going home. I’ve gone at different times &amp; different places. I know I don’t know him &amp; I know he doesn’t live in my street, so I’m a bit freaked out. Is he even following me or am I losing it? If he is do I report it? Should I get stronger home security in case he does know where I live? Any advice would be appreciated!",28Apr2020,1
373,"Okay so theres alot to this story.  It starts with my mom and one of my brothers getting into a car accident and dying while brothers (me) 1, 2 and 3 were little. I was an infant, brother 2 was 6. And brother 3 was 8 years old.  2 and 3 do not have the same dad and their dads left when they were babies. 

Well my own father decided to take on responsibility to raise all three.  But he was far from being this gentle giant he sounds like. He knew my mom for 1 year before she died and my brothers even less time. Well he was trying but he was also abusive and controlling. His controlling nature, down to the way we dress got us all picked on in school.  We barely had food to eat and he physically punished 2 and 3 with belts and smacking and choking throughout their time at the house.  As I got older I got thrown to the side in light of my dads new relationship. We also never really were taught anything growing up and were all kicked out by 18, but later the other 2 run away before that. 

Well fast foreward to when i was 6. One time when 2 and 3 (2 was 12 at this time) was babysitting me and 3 was downstairs, 2 came up and asked if I wanted to ""play""    there was touching and basically ""showing""    but after a couple of minutes 2 got up and apologized said not to tell and left. After that  It never happened again. 

That same,summer, we had neighbors we were really close with around the same age. 3 was reported for doing something similar with one of the kids next door. The mom came,over and talked to 3. Said that its not okay to do that, that those types of things come later and some other stuff.  But my father was incredibly embarrassed and I'm not sure if it was ever talked about to 3. 

Fast foreward after 3 leaves when he turns 18 in his senior year and 2 gets into it bad with my dad leaves and goes to military. 

I came out with all of this in a therapy session, at that time my father didnt really know what to say and his new wife who was about as evil as an evil woman gets, decide to tell everyone they possibly could, all our siblings and all our extended family. Everyone splits sides. At this time 2 is on a deployment in the middle east and can barely communicate but he denies it and shuts off all communication with everyone. 

5 years pass by and through social media I find both  of my brothers. I add them both on Facebook, 3 is in another state and 2 says if its okay he wanted to meet up. I agreed and went to see him. He gave me a hug and we went to chill outside over some cigarettes. Talking about school and military.  But then 2 got serious and looked me in the eyes and said ""I'm sorry,""  He explained that hes thought about it tremendously and felt like taking his life for it all the time.  That he knew at the time that it felt wrong but he didnt know the psychological toll it would cause later.   That it had happened between him and 3 and him and a neighborhood kid and him and one of our sisters we lost years ago. He explained that no part of him was attracted to children and that if he could take it back he would. I felt sort of relief that he finally acknowledged it. Yet he doesnt want to openly admit something like that happened because he doesnt want to be seen as some sort of pedophile.  But at the same time I'm not sure if my other siblings believe me or him. Hes been around their kids before but I dont think hes done this with then, years later our nieces and nephews, now,older still talk to him pretty regularly. 

A few years go by and 2 has a kid with his girlfriend. Which made me uncomfortable at first. I didnt meet my nephew until years later, but because mainly id moved, but when I came back for a funeral of one of our half brothers who died in a wreck, I finally met him and his son ran up to him happy he was home.  I couldn't remember ever being that happy to see even my own dad, who I domt really speak to to this day. 2 seems like a good dad. Seems like hes got his life in order despite some forms of depression. We talk pretty considerably about anything and he seems to care if I'm doing alright. 

i feel like I'm ready to move on, maybe get to know my nephew more. And put the past behind me. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?  Been through something similiar?",28Apr2020,1

I keep trying to think about how it’s only a couple hours on the plan and statistically speaking it is highly unlikely for a crash or some medical anomaly during the flight to strike me.

379,"Hi, I’ll try and get right to the point of this but it really started a little over a year ago when I found the 50/50 sub, I was instantly hooked. I started looking it up specifically online before I even had reddit, I wasn’t even on it for the thrill of wondering what the outcome was, I just wanted to see as much gore as possible. I don’t know why, but I’ve recently stumbled across a lot of other subs dedicated to gore and although I wouldn’t say it gets in the way of my day to day life like you might expect from an addiction, I find myself looking on reddit for hours and hours at night. I’m subbed to multiple crime dedicated YouTube channels, It’s just gotten worse and worse and every time I want more. I don’t like human suffering, I don’t like putting people through pain and I try to be as good to people through my daily life as I possibly can be, Just, something about seeing the most disgusting crime scenes, the autopsy photos, the suicide attempts, even the poorly filmed, sadistic executions by gangs and terrorist organizations, it’s addicting. I can’t stand hurting people or animals, I’ve never done so in my life and I can’t imagine I ever will, I don’t even like seeing it, it makes me physically ill and I get a horrible feeling in my stomach whenever I see all of the blood, yet I can’t put it down. It’s like a car crash (sometimes it IS a car crash) where I can’t look away. Id never act on these feelings and I’d never hurt another person but Im scared I’m turning into someone without humanity or feelings, like I’m unlocking some dark evil side of myself that I don’t want to see. I’m not desperate but I don’t know how much of an effect this can have on a persons mind, if one day I’ll just snap and no longer have that restraint of judgement, if I’ll no longer fear the outcomes of my actions, both legal and moral.

382,"asking this on behalf of my friend!
my friend's parents have a tendency to get angry easily and lash out, i've heard a couple of them while i call her. they tell her to never come out of her room if she isn't willing to help them do something. just today her mom started shouting at her for not helping her call a stranger and speak to them as my friend can speak english better than her. my friend has always been scared to speak people if they aren't her close friends, her parents know that too but make it a point to force her to speak to people she barely knows regularly, which has been making her anxious about social situations too. 
there have been times when they keep trying to get her to do something even though she has said no multiple times, and of course she gets annoyed. but when her tone changes to be a little more cold they'll ask her why she is mad and ask her to speak nicely since they were speaking nicely to her. we found out that by reminding them that they were the ones who didn't take no as no, they would go quiet and not touch the topic, but it does get annoying if it keep happening. they also keep telling her to smile after these kinds of arguments, saying that she shouldn't be seen frowning which makes her more annoyed than before.
there's a lot of things which they refuse to admit to do, like asking her to go out to friends' houses (before covid it was at least once a week on the weekends), saying they only bring her every few weeks, so she can afford to go for the (actually weekly) outings ""this time"", or even getting mad. today her dad got mad at her for using her phone at the dining table again, which he doesn't comment on regularly, just on certain days. she put her phone down and asked why he got mad over it and he said he didn't get mad. she stated how he was lying and said he got mad but he insisted he didn't.
it's getting super frustrating for her and the shoutings, which happen seemingly almost every day now, are really taking a toll on her. i am kinda hoping someone can provide a solution to this because i feel like just comforting her over these isn't enough. before the pandemic she visited the school therapist but it didn't quite help. can anyone give any suggestions?",28Apr2020,1

386,"Relatively long post incoming, sit back and enjoy i guess, any advice is appreciated.

Context: I(17M) am in my senior year of high school, and if everything goes well I’ll be moving out in August to start college. My dad(56M) and mom(44F) haven’t talked to each other in months, and I’m wondering what I can do to help them before I leave. I also have one younger sister(15F).

My parents aren’t perfect. They fight relatively often and weren’t the best parents to my sister and I either. When I was growing up, they were extremely strict, often beating and demoralizing me for getting bad grades. They would compare me to others, saying “why can’t you be like X’s son” or “Y’s daughter is so much better than you”. For me, this caused me to fear them, motivating me to get good grades and study harder. Eventually i overcame my fear of them and managed to earn their respect. Looking back at it now, i'm glad they had high standards for me and pushed me to work hard, even if their methods weren’t great. For my sister though, it's a different story. She has a very different personality from me, and my parents were more lenient with her when she was younger. However, now that she is in high school too, they placed the same expectations they placed on me onto her. My dad yells at her for being incompetent, and all I can do is stop him and try to help her through whatever she's having trouble with. 

Now, in present time, it has been about 3 months since my parents have talked with each other. I believe that the core issue lies with my dad. He has been mostly unemployed for 10 years now. While he works as a tour guide in the summer and occasionally day trades, most of the time he's at home doing nothing but playing computer games. He actually has a PhD in chemistry, and he used to be a professor. My mom on the other hand, only has an associates degree, and she works full time for $12 /hr to pay the bills. Though, she has recently quit her job due to fears of corona virus. They both have many issues as parents but I know that they both genuinely love me and my sister. While their methods aren't great, I know they always want us to just be successful in life.

3 months ago, my mom was talking to my dad about maybe getting a job at a fast food place or anything, just to save up some money in case of something happening. He then said that since he was dying soon, he didn't care. As far as I know, he's about as healthy as any other 56 y/o man, and he doesn't have any life threatening diseases. Well ever since, my dad has been essentially living on the couch. I have tried to talk to him about it, but he just brushes me off and says that I wouldn't understand. My sister just recently came to me and opened up about how scared she was that I was leaving, and how worried she was about our parents. She also hasn't talked to my dad at all in awhile, mainly because she's still scared of him yelling at her.

Personally, I don't know what I should do. My sister had happened to ask my mom if she could go back and tell her teenage self one thing, what would it be. She started crying and said that if she had the choice, she would've never married my dad. She's not perfect either, often verbally abusing my dad. They both have their problems. I personally am terrified to leave them and go off to start college. However, a part of me wants to just leave them behind and start the next chapter of my life. A lot of unfortunate events have happened to me ever since the start of the new year, on top of all the bullshit from 2020. I am feeling very lost and don't know how to move on.

389,"When I think of racism, homophobia, sexism, and such things - I think mostly of 2 points:

1. Acts of violence and vandalism against the minorities
2. Associating one trait with another even if they are unrelated (ex. dark skin with lack of education)

Now - point #2 is the core principle of Human Resources. When there is only one workplace and 1000 candidates - the recruiter won't contact the referees of all 1000, or interview all the 1000. He has to use some shortcuts. And nobody uses lotto machines on resumes. All recruiters use prejudices. Exclude everyone with noname company, because it's most likely their mom's business. Exclude everyone with no photo, because if they're hiding their face, they're hiding someone else. Exclude everyone with untamed beard, because if they don't care about their appearance, they also won't care about the work. Exclude people with shaved heads, because they are nazi's. Exclude people with black skin, because they're violent...

Big cities just need prejudices to survive. There is no other option. There are far too many people to judge everyone separately.

Now about point #1 - such acts also occur against people not associated with political correctness, such as people with shaved heads, or prostitutes. Does it mean that we should include prostitutes in the group of vulnerable people? Or that we should include people with shaved heads? You see, not every skinhead is a hater. Some just look better without hair, some shave because of male pattern baldness, some have had a trimming oopsie and had to shave. We shouldn't judge people by their appearance, right?

So, why there is so much focus on races, sexualities and genders, but not on jobs or hairstyles? And - why begin to fight prejudices in societies that require prejudices to function?",28Apr2020,1

391,"My grandmother and grandfather have always said they after they pass, I'd inherit their house.

If I did, it would cut on a lot of costs and keeps the house safe and in the family.

However, I've always looked to move to a bigger city to further my career. There simply aren't that many opportunities where I live.

If I did that, I'd have to give to house to my cousin, who Frankly, I don't totally trust with it.

Now, the problem arises. Do I move into my grandparents house and live without paying rent, inside a two story home that I've known my whole life but risk never going anywhere with my career, or do I move away, leaving the house in the hard of someone else, and have to face living broke most of the time?

Another thing to consider is my parents. Currently, they only live a ten minute walk away from my grandparents, so anytime they wanted to pop in on me, they could. That's both good and bad. Good because if there we're ever an emergency, they'd be close by, but bad in that they could essentially monitor me if they wanted.

Another thing is, my grandparents are very devoted Christian's, with pictures of Jesus, candles, and crosses everywhere. I, however, aren't as religious as they are, and would have to decide wether to keep up decorations I don't like for the memory of them, or take them down, and potentially cause a major fight about their memory.

Plus, I'd probably bring in a roommate or two seeing as it's big enough for them, and it'd help with the bills. However, the rest of the family night see it as disrespectful to bring in people outside of the family into their home.

I have already finished my transfer papers from my previous work, informed the HR department that I would be leaving and told them goodbye. I hated that job so much I took an unpaid leave right before my departure date. 

Technically I did not resign I just moved to a different work in a different company with a different workplace. The plan was for me to move to Canada, finish 3-4 years of a program then come back here to work in a different position. I was offered this and I immediately took it. I took that opportunity because I thought I can get away from this department as a grunt employee here and come back with more experience and get placed into a better department rather than suffer the shit treatment I was getting where I was. I also did not want to move to Canada indefinitely.

I was put on a ""study leave"" for 3 years in my original work place pending I move to Canada, finish my program, and then come back. The trick is that I have to come back after I finish the 3-4 year program. 

So people who moved before the closing of the border got lucky. I, however, did not as the border closure came like 2 days before my travel date. My previous workplace doesnt know this.

I have been getting phonecalls from them so that they ""determine"" if I have moved yet or not. If I tell them I got stuck, I'll be asked to return to work here. If I tell them I've moved they'd tell me okay good luck (or they may tell me come back I'm not sure). Just phonecalls, no official emails telling me I'm required to come back to work here. 

Now I hated this job so much as I was getting treated like shit. I really rather not getting paid than working for my last department, specially now. Now they are calling me to determine if im here and I do not want to lie so I did not respond. If they sent me an official email I'll tell them the truth but having worked with those people, a phonecall from them will be abusive and just tell me to get back to work. 

I feel bad to responding to them, but I also do not want to be abused by them. They can cut my salary I really don't care. I am supposed to be working for someone else now but this thing happened and here we are. If they ask me why I haven't been responding ill tell them I changed my number (I really did).

Am I be disingenuous here? Will my action of not responding have consequences? Please help me.",28Apr2020,1

Home prices here are really low. I am extremely impatient. I need a house now. Not 8 months from now. Now. I am working with a real estate agent to sell the land. I applied for two apartments. One denied me and the other set up a payment app for me but they haven't contacted me since last Thursday. I want to get a higher paying job but then I'd loose corporate housing. I net 350 a week.

399,"I work with a company that is sectioned of across our county. 50 ish people in all, but my building specifically has 4 people working at it, including me. Two officers, (A and B here) and two associates (C and Me)
For a while now there have been instances that make me uncomfortable, but I'm going to focus on this one thing that has me awake at 4 in the morning.

So we're here during Covid-19 and I feel like I'm being ignored in part whenever I manage to be contradictory to someone. What i mean is this: C, my coworker, was angry about being in pain last week and was ignoring me or snapping at me any time I tried to ask them something. I addressed this, saying I felt like they were angry, and was told that I had been hateful the day before and that they didn't want to hear about it. I had no recollection of acting hateful towards them, though. A customer had brought in something fairly disgusting I needed to handle, and I had complained about that because it took me an hour and a half just to clean everything before I could really deal with it. Outside of just complaining about that customer's product, though, I was perfectly fine with my coworker--and I wasnt complaining about them or being hateful with them.

This has created a tension in my mind. Now C seems to pick and choose when they respond to me and it's frustrating.

Also, B and A were also ignoring me on occasion yesterday where it felt like i went unheard or unnoticed. I was literally standing there with nothing to work on and instead of handing me something, B handed it to C who already had something they were working on. I had annoyed B earlier with a question on some customer information--stuff that they felt I was not entitled to gather even though it was required on our form and by our protocol. B had raised their voice with me and said there was ""no damn way"" we needed that information and if someone had a problem with it they could take it up with them. I'm not trying to be confrontational about this stuff, though, imjust trying to fill out our forms!

I came home in tears after experiencing a day like this. I've grown more and more to just hate my job and the people I work with. I don't feel i deserve to be ignored at my job or to be the one someone gets upset with over policy. I know we're probably all stressed with covid stuff, but I dont think that excuses this behavior. I've been anxious since I left work yesterdsy though and i dont know if it's really something I'm seeing or if I'm imagining it. I also dont know if i should bring it up to HR because I dont feel comfortable discussing it with A, my boss, when I feel like they'll just side with B and C because those personal relationships are stronger than the one ai have with A. I also worry that if I do say anything I may be fired for it because B makes so much money for the company and walks over a lot of people already. But i feel miserable, anxious, depressed... and Im waking up at 4AM with these feelings and dreading going to work over it. What should I do?",28Apr2020,1

This is the first time I’ve found her smoking in the middle of the night. (We also don’t live together anymore but I came back when the pandemic started.) When I asked her how many she smoked a day, she told me it wasn’t my business. She said she has it under control. I obviously don’t believe her and I’m so worried. I knew she had a problem but I didn’t realize it was this bad. She’s been super stressed with work and has been sounding out of breath a lot lately...

I should probably also point out that I will try to be objective in describing these, but there will obviously be bias since it's written out of my point of view**. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little background. I (f27) met my now husband (M30) when I was 16. We met on valentines day in a bar and it was nothing short but amazing. I went home dreaming about him and felt like the luckiest girl alive when I noticed I had caught his eye just as much. In the mean time we've had 3 children and have gotten married. In theory, our life is good. However, we had our fair amount of setbacks of every variety and even though we managed to pull trough together, as a team, we both have a lot of resentment built up towards each other. I'm truly at a loss on how to move forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Shortly after moving in together he took me to a breeder and told me to pick a puppy, as a suprise. It was and probably still is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me and I will miss that dog for the rest of my life. After a while our landlord at the time decided that we should either get rid of the dog or we'd be evicted. Being 19yrs old and thinking I knew how the world worked I told my husband the dog was staying and that was final. It ended up in us losing that battle and getting evicted, pushing us off the financial deep end (which we are still recovering from, roughly 8 years later). That combined with me having a lot of trouble finding employment has left him feeling ''anger'' (for the lack of a better word), he blames me for our financial struggles. If only I had gotten rid of the dog, If only I had found a job sooner, what not. He never shies away from making sure I know how he feels about this. How it's my fault that we haven't accomplished what we want to accomplish by now. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) When we first started trying for a baby i miscarried. We both had a very different way of grieving and that drove a giant wedge between us. Where I just wanted to be held and not talk about it, he wanted to talk about it. This resulted in him hiding in his games. He would literally sit there and play games, while I laid on the sofa not even 2 meters away crying in both physical and emotional pain. This is about 9 years ago, but sometimes it still pops in to my head and I still get angry over it. 

3) When I was pregnant with our middle child I fell down a ladder while painting the hallway and ended up having some contractions. He made me call my dad to take me to the hospital because he was playing games. This, I struggle with massively, even to this day. 

4) About six months after our middle child was born I lost it. I didn't see a way forward anymore (he hid in games and weed constantly. He woke up, played games until work, came home, played games until bedtime. Rinse, repeat). Despite me telling him a million times over that it wasn't working for me, that I felt miserable and that it would either be me or the computer, he never changed. Let me tell you, nothing will destroy your ego as fast and as hard as having a piece of electronics placed above you. 

This resulted in me ''ending'' the relationship in a sense. I went on to spend weekends at a friens house (This friend was male, nothing ever happened but I can see how that would be hard to believe) and that's something he (understandibly) struggles to forgive me with. It still gets brought up in almost every argument we have. I do regret handling how I handled things back then, massively. 

Now, there's another layer to this. Recently, when pregnant with the youngest, we had a massive fight because I didn't want to have sex. It escalated to the point where he would say things like ''Opening your legs is all you're good for and you won't even do that anymore''. It escalated to the point that he hit me, I went upstairs to bed and he stayed in the living room. After about an hour or so I decide to try and talk things trough, only to find that he had moved the sofa in front of the door so I couldn't get in. I asked him if he was talking to someone, to which he said no and got annoyed at me. I went back upstairs and that was that.. 

The next day I woke up, turned on the computer and saw a conversation between him and a female ''friend'', describing me as this hormonal monster, the sole reason of every negative feeling he has ever experienced, what not. He went on to describe how bad he wanted to be with her in stead of with me, and I lost it. I called my parents to come pick me up and spent me day over there. 

By nighttime i had calmed down and was ready to talk about things, where I contacted him. He, however, refused to pick us up. Had it not been for the fact that he'd been begging me to come home all day I would have understood. So I asked him if he had someone at the house. He said no. 

My dad drove me home and I walk in to my husband, his brother and his best friend (who I considered a close friend of mine as well, but clearly not) in my living room, going trough my texts. They're telling him he did nothing wrong in saying those things to that woman, and told me that I should ''stop acting like he beat me to death''. I felt incredibly ambushed in my own home. 

That's when I learned that all those years ago, when I spent the weekends at my friend, where we decided to try and work it out between the two of us,he told EVERYONE I was ''in love'' with this guy, that he did nothing wrong and he was the victim for being left alone with the kids. 

Now, I didn't know this. Everyone I love and care about lied to me for well over 5 years. No one felt the need to reach out to me and see how I was doing when my marriage was falling apart. No one cared about me. No one was honest with me. Learning that had hurt me so deeply, all I can see when I look at my husband now is the man that took everything from me. 

5) From the very start of the relationship my husband has been incredibly jealous. I have, up until this point of the relationship always kept this in to account and never made friends for myself, dropping the ones I had because he had ''issues'' with them. 

Recently, i've decided to not be that person anymore. I've been trying to make friends to game with, joined some servers for people to hang out and draw together. I can tell he still struggles wiith this massively, fearing I will meet or have met someone else. 

I clearly have no intention of doing that. I want our marriage to work. Despite all of the above (and it's nowhere near everything that happened, just the main events) I love this man to bits and we both want our family to work. I just don't know how to not get frustrated with his insecurities. Everytime I talk to someone or even glimpse at my phone he melts down. 

I want him to trust me, I want to trust him. I don't want to feel frustration every time he seeks reassurance. 

All by all, he is good to me. He always makes sure I have drinks in the fridge because I never remember to do so. He cooks so I can nap, he does a bunch of small, cute things that show me that he loves me. And I love him. 

I'm just at a loss. He never seems to understand me, I never seem to understand him. It doesn't help that when I do find the courage to have a conversation, he does all these things that frustrate the shit out of me. Physically blocking me from moving, touching me when I don't want it, insulting me, (i do insult him as well, taking my phone off of me... It's hard, but we both want to make it work.

I was also mad at another girl whose mom works in the office and the daughter couldn’t play with me because she had homework, so when no one was around the other mothers office cubical, I ruined her desk with whiteout and blamed it on the daughter..

I just worry that every time im not talking to her someone else is and i just cant seem to get over it.

413,"So...

417,"Hi, so this might be the wrong subreddit but I(M24) don't know any particular subreddit for personality issues.

So basically what the title says... I have an issue with initiating calls/chats to people even whom I know. It makes me feel awkward to do so. This is seriously affecting my work now more than ever. Like I have to ask someone something which might make my task complete faster, but I try to do it myself instead because I don't want to call them and it takes me longer than expected. But the main reason Iposted this is not because of the professional reason, but personal reasons, I can't initiate talks with people who I want to know/have a chat to pass the time.

This issue being on the level that I have problem starting conversations online with known person also means that I will probably never start conversations with random people online (you don't need to, but I kind of feel envy from people who can just go ahead with it), it's a skill I wish I had.

Now the issue is that if I talk person to person, I have no issues and actually enjoy it a lot and have no worries in initiating the conversations too. Maybe the reason is that I react (like almost everyone else) to the facial expressions and respond accordingly.

The problem with me is not just with chats/calls but I don't even like my photos taken or posted anywhere. Now with the data insecurity, it seems valid but the problem is not with data insecurity, it is a reason I tell myself. I just told about this too, because you might relate it to something.

Theissue is so engraved that this is a throwaway account I created for this post only. I use my main account for commenting only, never posted shit with it.

Can you tell me what I can do to change it even if by a bit? If there are some other subs you can point me for discussion the personality development issues like these, please guide me towards them and TIA.

424,"For about 6 years now, I've had dreams (bad emotional ones) about an ex of mine.

I was 17 going on 18 and he was 27. We met online and everything was great, met up in person, started dating and seeing eachother regularly despite the distance and I didnt drive and his car broke down. I would go to my college classes, part time work then bus to his city (2 hours each way) and stay with him for the weekend.

We had great sex, dinner and boba dates, he got me into MDMA etc which made me super attached to him. I had never had a previous boyfriend introduce me to anything new before (I was a wild child due to strict parenting).

He had a dream. To be a famous social media influencer. Which means no public pictures of us, no hanging out in groups etc he had to look single and attainable for those followers. I had only met his coworker and he did introduce me as his girlfriend which was a plus.

And he did it, years later. He a super famous mukbanger on instagram and youtube. Even i wanted to get back in touch, it would be impossible considering his massive following.

But it wasnt enough for me, I wanted commitment and I hated the hiding. 

Everytime I brought up going public we would get in fights and go on breaks. I was getting so many mixed signals. One day he would bring up meeting my parents or moving in together then another he would be distant, and we fight again over going public.

Maybe I was too pushy. A naive girl who had an older boyfriend and wanted to show off to the world.

We broke up once over a fight, I cant remember what we fought about but we got back together after 6 months when he came to see me on my birthday. We were still distant after but I got really drunk at a party few weeks later and called him to pick me up. We had make up sex and whatnot like usual. 

Things were kind of back to normal after. 

Then he finds out an ex fling of mine had been in recent contact with me. He was only in contact with me to get contact info of another underaged ex acquaintance of mine.

I tried to explain but he wasn't having any of it. Another break.

Maybe a week later, I'm over at his apartment like clock work. He nonchalantly tells me he recently had an ex over during our break. 

I didnt understand, I still dont unerstand why he thought it was okay to bring this up after fighting with me for my ex contacting me. And also, why not meet at a local cafe? Why inside his apartment why put that image in my head?

I sucked it up, I didnt complain. I didnt accuse him of cheating. We just got back together, I didnt want to ruin it.

Another fight, about commitment and still not being able to post anything about us on my instagram or facebook page.

This is when things really fucked me up. I went upstairs to the roof to smoke and wait for my friend to pick me up so I can go home and straighten out my thoughts. He followed me up and we talked.

We tried to talk things out and I specifically remember my ex saying we should work things out and stay together while in the elevator down so I could go.

He said stay together.

I went home that night got some sleep and got fucking ghosted by the first love of my life at 19 years old.

I kept messaging him for a few weeks with no replies but saw his post on instagram. It was harsh.

I eventually gave up and tried to move on.

I don't know why it's still happening after 6 years but I want it to stop.

A part of me is a little disgusted now as I'm older, that I let an older man do this to me. I am very aware that the relationship was unorthodox and quite possibly a predator/groomer situation and I'm glad to be out of it.

428,"CONTEXT:
So new class, new classmates. We only got to meet two days as a class before the school closed.  This past month, we've been using ms teams for school. We have a project. There were 5 people including me in the team. 2 people from the same previous class. The other 3 (including me) from another same previous class. We've all done our part. We've finished everything. Nothing seem to be wrong. No one said anything the whole month. We just did our part.



SITUATION:
Fast forward to today. We decided to practice together for presentation. Before we start, she decided to confront (bad timing). She said we didn't help (?????). Telling us if we have anything to say, voice it out. I waited for 5mins because i honestly didn't know how to react. So i pretended i wasn't listening and said 'did i miss anything?"" More confrontation. I waited again and said ""i have nothing to say because i think we're doing good."" And she replied ""if you think we're doing ok, then that's enough"". 



MY THOUGHTS: 
We don't know each other and it was already awkward enough as it is. And she made it extra awkward today. Now i feel i didn't do enough when i know i did. I did the part i told them i was gonna do and i put my heart and soul into it. Now it feels like it was all for nothing. I guess it's because i don't talk much? I have social anxiety, no friends.This home school thing is just making me more anxious than if i'm in school. I don't like talking over the mic. So i just don't talk. Do i text instead. I'm not familiar with normal social etiquettes. I don't like drama. I don't want anyone to have any misunderstanding. I don't want it to affect how things will be when school opens.


So how do i deal with this professionally?",28Apr2020,1

They dropped the cat off for a trial period of a a few days and then went quiet, we messaged after 2 weeks saying that we would be happy to have the cat. They have not accepted the offer to visit the cat (before lockdown), sent over any money, a food bowl or even responded to any of our Facebook messages. 

We’re saving up for a wedding and already have a dog (they get on) so we don’t have money to support an additional pet and we’ve already had to move the cat to dry food to save money.

We’ve heard from others (after getting the cat) that apparently they had 16+ dogs previously and we’re starting to wonder if it is even their cat and whether we should have the chip checked as it’s all very fishy now but it’s not an essential trip and it costs.

This is all very bizarre, they don’t seem to care about the cat at all, we send pictures and updates but they haven’t even looked at them. I just know that if I let someone look after my dog I would want to know how they’re getting on.

My mom told him he’d run this through my dad to see what he says - but I have a hunch my dad will say no.

I (F19) met this amazing guy (M21) on tinder, we met couple of times and have been talking for like 2 months. He's very sweet and caring person, and I did told him about my mental issues. 
But shortly after me met I don't know whether it was on our first date or some weeks after he told me that his roommate is his ex.
At first it didn't bother me, but what did bother me after a few week was when we called with each other he told me that his ex (who cheated on him, from what I heard from him) avoids him and stuff. He tells me these things and it sounds like he is bothered by this. He still tries to be nice toward her, l do partly understand because you live under the same roof

They broke up last year but when she asked him to move in a student apartment with him because his current room wasn't that amazing he agreed. At first they did eat and watched things together. 
I would never understand why if she cheated on you and it was recent you would still move in a student apartment with her and acting all like friends and all. 
He said their relation was good before I came in, that's when she started to get jealous I guess? Because she doesn't like me being present in their apartment and she started to avoid him for this reason. Maybe she still has feelings for him otherwise i dont understand why she is being so bothered by me. He was the one who always asked me to voice call and sometimes was streaming himself and stuff at first but when she came back after weeks being absent from the apartment at that day he responded after hours and we didn't call for the first time and after that day we do have our day that we don't call everyday like we used to do and him not asking to voice call, now it's me who ask first but I have anxiety and I often don't have the confident to ask him since I feel like I will burden him. Since that day I became bothered that he lives with his ex. 

She boss him kind of around and he listen to her, for example I couldn't visit him because of the covid-19 while she bought her ex (which she was cheating on with my current BF) in their apartment. I feel like she wants to please her, so they won't have trouble with each other but still I dont understand this because it's also your house
He keeps giving me the feeling that this bother him and I struggle with anxiety and overthinking so I feel like I am a burden between their ""friendship"". I don't like to feel this way, I never had been in a relation before and it does kinda hurt me to think about all of this, this also doesn't make my mentall health any better. I never felt good enough, I don't know whether it's better for me to leave him since I do think why would he risk his ""friendship"" with her because of me.

When you open a drawer and it’s full of crap and  it’s mildly infuriating, I want to kick something. I don’t, and I know my frustration is unreasonable, but what do I do about that, do I hide it? I dealt with the drawer by tidying it and sorting it there and then. But it’s the initial little frustrations.

When my wife says she’s going to do something, so I commit 20 minutes to a game, she then changes her mind, it’s frustrating but just not important, so I close the game and change my plans, but I do get annoyed, I take the appropriate action that seems fair but I get annoyed about it.

When my son asks me a billion times the same thing over and over and over again. I get frustrated, but I act reasonable and I listen to him and try to meet his needs to the best of my understanding.

I feel like I’m making the right calls, but it doesn’t stop that frustration, and I then feel guilty for that frustration. And sometimes my wife can pick up on the frustration and it can annoy her.

441,"This has been going on for awhile so I have begun to feel like I can't step back and see things clearly to understand what I should do or if I'm overreacting.

I'm 26f in a large group of friends, a mix of couples and friends, both women and men. I came into the group because my boyfriend was living with a handful of the friendship group members around five years ago. Since then we've both become part of the group. I live with two of the women, who are my housemates.

Generally I enjoy being part of this friendship group, and I get along with each individual member, but what I've been struggling with is that all of the women in the group seem to be close with each other aside from me. 

At first I let this go as they do have a history with each other, but I've noticed a pattern as other women join the wider group, they also seem to become part of this smaller group quickly that all the women are involved in. This has been making me wonder why I continue to be excluded or why I feel so excluded.

The women do things together, are part of group chats around shared interests, and sometimes segregate themselves at parties with the wider group. I try to not let it bother me but it continues to niggle. 

One of my female housemates seems to often be the instigator of events and activities within this smaller group of women, and often will invite this group of women over to the house without inviting me to join in.

I can't tell if they're purposely excluding me, if they don't realise what they're doing, or if there's something I'm doing. My partner has suggested to me that perhaps I'm not giving off the vibe that I am eager to be included. At this stage I can imagine I'm not as now I'm trying to protect myself from feeling excluded, but I know in the past I have suggested I am interested in participating. I don't know what to do. Am I overreacting by feeling so excluded? On the other hand, if I bring it up, I worry I will seem needy or childish, obviously I understand that some people 'click' with each other more easily than others but at the same time I feel like I would notice if I was so obviously leaving someone out? 

TLDR; 
Feeling excluded from a smaller exclusive group of girls within a wider friendship group. New female members join the group and are accepted into the smaller group but I continue to not be included.

443,"Hello to all, it's my first post here, I really need an advice.

I'm struggling with major depression and ADHD, but in this last period I really worked as I've never done in my entire life to improve my condition and change for the better. However, while for the first time things were really starting to change, I faced another unexpected issue: emotional dependence from people, and in particular from my girlfriend.

In the last years I self isolated from literally everyone but my girlfriend due to depression. She tries to be very supportive, but she's depressed too, and now that we are apart due to quarantine we argue and fight every day because of trivial misunderstandings. So, here's the issue: I'm completely emotionally dependent from her. If she acts in some way that should only slightly hurt a normal person, instead this gives me a down that last from a couple of days to weeks. I can't study for my exams in this condition, actually I'm not able to do nothing at all when I'm in down. This is the major obstacle I found on my path to get out from depression. I tried everything but I really have no idea on how to cope with it (I tried to be positive, to react by distracting me in positive ways, to meditate and do physical activity to keep my mind as calm and balanced as possible, and to not talk with her for some days and find my balance, but nothing has worked). Also it doesn't help at all to have no one but her in my life, and this gives me emotional dependence from everyone whom write me in this period.

So, how do you cope with emotional dependence from people whom are relevant in your life? How can I be happy with me in order to have a normal relationship with my girlfriend? Consider in your replay that I have no friend or any other people but her in my life. (I know it's not ok, I was working on this before the pandemia).

448,"To get straight to the point, I (18F) am half Mexican and half white. I have relatives in Mexico whom I would visit with my family up until I was 3 years old, but due to financial reasons we had to hold off on our visits to Mexico. My siblings and I used to speak Spanish when we were younger, but since none of us were very interested in communicating in Spanish, eventually our parents only spoke to us in English. Because of that, none of us speak fluent Spanish. After some time, my family became a little more financially stable and we visited Mexico again, but of course by this time I was 14. After 11 years of barely speaking Spanish to suddenly being immersed in the culture and language, it was very overwhelming, and embarrassing. I felt ashamed and insecure of the fact that I didn't know much Spanish. 

Over the years, I've taken Spanish classes and my family has tried to visit Mexico every year (although finances sometimes prevent this). I'm able to follow conversations well enough. I don't quite know every word but I can usually get the gist.

Although I've definitely had progress in learning the language, I still feel ashamed of my identity. My mom wanted me to have a quinceañera in Mexico so I went along with it, but that too was embarrassing since at that point I barely understood Spanish (and it was ALL in Spanish). Although it was a lovely day with family, I can't happily look back on my quinceañera because of the shame I feel. I remember I posted the pictures of my special day on social media, and I received a lot of lovely compliments, but one classmate commented, ""Do you even speak Spanish?"" and I ended up deleting the post. It just reminded me of the fact that she's right. I felt like I didn't even deserve a quinceañera, although logically I know my identity should also depend on my connections with my family members in Mexico as well.

I feel like I'm also insecure about this because I attend high school in a Hispanic neighborhood. It was where I met my boyfriend and both his parents are Mexican. I feel bad about this, but sometimes I feel a bit uncomfortable being at his house because his mom speaks mainly in Spanish, but of course she understands English as well. However my boyfriend told me before that his mom sometimes referred to me as ""guera"" (I don't know if she still does). He didn't think much of it, he thought it was a bit funny, but personally it just seemed to emphasize the issue. She also tends to cook mainly Mexican dishes, which I of course don't mind. One time I was over when she cooked pozole, and she asked me if I had ever had pozole before. I know she wasn't in any way being rude or mean, she was just asking, but I felt a little irritated and offended because I've had pozole a lot in the past, and I've definitely had a lot of Mexican dishes. She also speaks Spanish to my boyfriend and it feels like she assumes that I won't understand it. She sometimes translates in English, and my boyfriend has once told her afterwards, ""hey, she knows Spanish."" His mom is a quiet, calm person except when she's laughing or smiling (or yelling lol) and her kids' crazy antics, so it's a bit hard to read her. It's difficult for me to approach her, especially since my own Spanish is mediocre (but when I'm nervous I can't speak it very well, and she makes me nervous a lot sometimes). I feel a bit awkward speaking to her in general because it's hard to tell if she likes me or not.

I also tend to compare myself to other Mexican women frequently. My boyfriend's mom is very pretty and looks very Hispanic. His ex girlfriend was also fully Mexican and could speak fluently in Spanish. She also looks Hispanic and is very beautiful. However, I look young for my age and I can look like a child if I don't wear makeup and just wear a  sweatshirt. I do get compliments every so often about my appearance so I know I can look pretty to others, but his ex was so pretty it was obvious. I think I look Mexican, especially if I smile, but again, I feel that it's not obvious (but maybe I'm biased). When I watch TV, I tend to notice the attractive Hispanic women first and feel jealous of their features. I'm not even super pale, but I have a light complexion. (I know this shouldn't even be a problem because I know my tía has super pale skin, definitely paler than mine, and she's still 100% Mexican, but perhaps I think looking darker would make up for my missing 50%). My boyfriend even refers to me as white and I feel like he doesn't really think of me as Mexican either, which really sucks. Maybe it wouldn't feel as invalidating if he were white and didn't think of me as Mexican, but since he's actually Mexican I feel it hurts more. 

I'd like to call myself a Latina but I don't even know if I'm allowed to. I fear being called out again like I was on my social media post. I've been feeling too white to be Mexican, and I think my jealousy is making my insecurity even worse.

TLDR: I'm half Mexican and half white. I feel insecure that I'm not Mexican enough because I don't speak Spanish well, I hadn't been to Mexico in 11 years, and don't look Mexican enough. My boyfriend's mom only seems to think of me as white, and I feel jealous of my boyfriend's ex's appearance, fluency in Spanish, and the fact that she'd probably get along better with his family because of this.",28Apr2020,1

After what happened, I tried to leave him but he kept fighting for our relationship, deleted that girl, wanted to go to couples therapy, etc. He says he was confused because we didn't spend enough time together (I was working and studying) and he thought I didn't love him. Now we are fine, but there is something I don't understand. He says he doesn't love her, he doesn't think about her, it was just sexual and he just cared about her. 

But he wrote her many beautiful things like: 
I want to hear your voice. I cannot stop thinking about you. My heart beats for You. You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love you I miss you.. etc.
Those things he no longer writes to me. He just says I love you or I miss you as usual (we have almost 2 years together)

It bothers me to know that he is with me and thinking about her. Because after chatting so much and finally having sex with her it's a very powerful feeling of desire. I once had an internet romance and spent years thinking about that man. But then what am I to him? Is it possible that he is confused and loves her more than me?

Parks are crowded, and in the small businesses that are open there is little attempt at social distancing.  And my dad, in keeping with his usual stance that he knows everything, is completely ignoring warnings, going to the grocery store every other day even though our fridge is well-enough-stocked.

If my dad is going to keep ignoring social distancing and potentially bringing infections home, might it not be a good idea to go back, wearing a mask on the plane and taking plenty of sanitizer?  If not, then what should I look out for to decide when to return?",28Apr2020,1
453,"Hello, 
sorry.. this might be a little lengthy.
I feel like im drowning in my life.  Im 31 and I never thought id feel like this at this age. I feel like ive already lived my life and im tired of life already. Nothing excites me.
Ive suffered with Depression, Anxiety, Suicidal thoughts .. all my life. Right now Im ok, not actively suicidal but I feel like im drowning. I came out of therapy 6 months ago. We were together for 3 years and I feel like it retraumatised me. She wanted to relive my past and childhood over and over and over and OVER.. used to spend the day after therapy feeling drained and headachey and just crying. She said I needed to FEEL and release these emotions so I threw myself in. Now looking back, I feel like I haven't made any progress and we just spent 3 years feeling and talking about my childhood over and over. She felt like I pushed myself too hard- im a go -getter type person and I don't like just sitting around doing nothing.

I had Bulimia growing up- now I still binge 2-3 nights a week- mainly on nuts and bagels yoghurt.. honey..and semi-healthy food- I never order a huge takeaway or buy loads of junk. I just overeat what is in my house which is frustrating as theyre foods I eat daily anyway.. During therapy, she said I should allow myself to binge- that it will ease off once its no longer a ""taboo"" behaviour. I went with it and now I haven't stopped. She wasn't an ED specialist btw, just someone I clicked with.

Fast forward to now- I feel like I still need help- but maybe not therapy. I need accountability. I don't have many friends and im not in a relationship. I am lonely and im slipping into depression again- I connect with people but I don't keep them in my life as friends. I like a small circle.

Im now 190 plus pounds, ive gained close to 40 pounds in the last 3 years. I feel like a monster. Right now I feel stuck. Im depressed- not crying or moping around just detatched.  I don't know If the weight gain is causing the depression or im just depressed anyway. I need help..

I need to lose weight- I need to stop the nightly binge
Im considering doing a masters in something or to increase my earnings. Im looking into financial planning or wealth management, but I come from a construction background-- its a bit of a leap.
Im also thinking of starting Forex trading.

I need help- I don't feel good and I hate the way I look and its really holding me back in life. I just cant find motivation to exercise outside my occasional yoga.
I snooze my alarm every morning. I want to wake up 5am and I never do. I don't know what I have to live for- but my task list isn't exciting or  important enough. Im in limbo
I feel like I need daily accountability and someone to check in with. I do better that way. 
What subreddits will be a good match for me? What do I need to do? Every comment/advice will help.. 
thanks x",28Apr2020,1

My sibling no longer lives with me, but the pictures are still up and that kind of bothers me. I understand that this is their child but like, is if a big deal to ask to not want to see my abuser’s pictures around the house? They have also mentioned the sibling in casual conversation around me, which also upsets me but I just sit and sulk, scared to say anything. What should I do?",28Apr2020,1
456,"So recently I got quite sick with sepsis, pneumonia and burst appendix. I got very close to being past the point of no return and it was pretty scary. 

Randomly though people/extended family that I have little to no relationship with freaked out. 

E.g.

Cousin 1-first talked to her/met her in 2010. Only talked to her about 3 times before. She yelled at me at my mums birthday because I was shy and didn’t want to talk. My family heard and we’ve never talked since. She has been ostracised from my immediate family. After my health scare she bought me flowers, a card and food saying that she cried when she found out and ra ra ra. I can’t help but feel like it’s not genuine and it made me feel really uncomfortable.

Grandparents-haven’t talked to them in at least 10 years and would say I have very little to no relationship with them. Mostly due to them being abusive to my father and myself. When they found out I was sick they we’re flooding my phone with calls and messages and calling my extended family say that they love me like any of their other grandchildren ra ra ra. 

Aunty-Again had a falling out because she abused me when I was 10. Haven’t talked to her since. When we’ve seen each other since then she flat out ignores me and talks negatively about me to my own immediate and extended family while I’m in earshot. She’s well known as a shit stirrer in my family. When she found out I’m sick she was blowing up my families phones asking how I am, giving advice in scarring, the whole lot.

It just feels weird. Why are people doing this? They didn’t care for such a long time and it makes me feel so weird. 

Any ideas?",28Apr2020,1

Frankly tbh my plan is to take my future slowly, working to save money, enjoy my youth, not pushing myself and to not rush it as i suffer from depression and anxiety since i was 14

And long story short i enrolled in uni when i was 18 and instanly regretting it but continue to do so half-heartedly

And i'm not flexing but idk how tf i got on dean list last sem and this sem i begin to rethink to withdraw from my studies because i'm doing very worst, miss lot of assignment and depression and anxiety hit me hard in my ass since it's f\*cking covid19 and being lockdown (thanks to lgbt and china, god wrath came upon us and yeah **/s**) and i begin to selfharming myself a lot, on the verge of mental breakdown and contemplating on sucide very seriously.

And so i'm now 19 and thinking either to postpone my studies or to just dropped out from my Uni. What's your guys opinion/advices.

Well my problem is that I never realy got in political things for my intere life, today I'm 21 and I still don't get 100% how our government works, I life in Germany.

Sure I have a wage idea how the things work because I'm not a total idiot who lived behind the moon but I think you got the idea.

At no point of my life I was forced to handle those things. My school pretty much never valued political knowledge high enough and my parents... yeah... They have less knowledge then I because they're 100% not interested and even refuse to vote. 

To make it a bit more clear with another example. 
Let's take the OK Boomer meme. 
It's funny, 
laught a lot, 
can relate to it, 
btw why is this a thing? 

Then I startet to search a bit without know what to search in the first place for and my stand is now 
""they broke economic"" 
How did they do it and are there even more reasons?

It's hard to search correctly when you don't know the basics in the first place to relate to the stuff... Like what is economie in the first place and how is it build? 

So how can I build up my political knowledge from like 15 years missing time? Are there classes for? Like you can visit to improve a language? Or is it more like yeah unlucky just asspull the things you think you need.

461,"hey everyone, I'm turning to you for advice, since reddit is my favorite pastime and I can't seem to find help anywhere. my boyfriend and I have been together for a very long time, we even have a baby boy on the way, due within the next month. he is definitely someone that is just like me, and we get along very well. we have a lot of fun together. we've gone through many trials and tribulations together, but it has only made us stronger. 
recently, things have seemed to be a little bit more tough for us. I'm finding he does not do anything to intentionally hurt me, but he also does seem to hide things sometimes, not tell me the full truth, and sort of tells me what he thinks I want to hear. the more I try and talk to him about it, the more i push him away because he does not see anything wrong in his actions. hes seemed more and more down lately and I want him and I to be happy again. another thing, he got an offer to be a bartender and run the bar at a private club in Harsens Island. Harsens is an hour and a half from where we live, and it's ferry ride after that. he would have to live on the island four out of seven days a week, and be away from me and our new baby. I was offered a job there as well, but I have not told him because I don't want him to think I'm trying to follow him.

463,"I need advice.

 Be warned this is kinda hard for me to explain and might be long but I’ll try to keep it shorter. Feel free to skip to the end if you want to.

I'm 27 and I like to think I am a good and compassionate person despite the environment I was raised in which is why this is causing me alot of mental stress. 

My paternal grandmother (PG) is about 60-something and crazy. Very religious but in a bad way. She prays for everyone but a lot of the time “praying” is more of a euphemism for “since you didn’t do what I wanted you to do im gonna pray for you.” She guilt trips a lot and lies a lot but always uses that super sweet and soft grandmother loves you sooo much voice. We (me and my brothers) were sent to her for summers when we were small but I haven’t had too much interaction with her ever since I started highschool. other than occasional visits and phones calls about 2 times a month it was just hey, how are you or what’s up. I'd never really thought about anything since I grew up with it.

Until my older brother got diagnosed with Schizophrenia about 6 or so years ago. The drama and stress has slowly built up over the years. My brother despite being older is the baby of the family. (yes, I used to resent him for that until I realized our parents were garbage.)  So PG, having burnt a lot of bridges with almost everyone on both sides of the family, decided he was her baby. And proceeded to EFF with his mind and his assistance money. Every time I talked to her from then on it was all about how my brother was doing this or that and how he was mean to her and how she deals with it bc she loves him. This made me mad, she was using him to prove her own self-worth and for his money. She was also not letting him decide anything for himself so he couldn't learn to deal with his own condition. Sadly, at that time I had to let the situation go as my own health was going into decline and I had to figure that out before I could attempt to help him myself. All I could do was talk to him and tell him how to help himself but he wasn’t having it, being so used to being cared for and not having to make his own decisions.

Eventually my brother was sent to a hospital for a few months and he decided to live on his own. It took some doing but he is much better now, consistently on his meds and has even told me that I was the only one who actually cared about his well-being and he should have listened to me sooner.  This part might have been extra info but I wanted people to understand my grandmas personality and mine a bit.

During all that I was going in and out of the hospital weekly with varying symptoms. Getting multiple MRIs, Spinal Taps and blood work done. Basically being miserable but trying to figure out what the heck is going on with my body. I didn’t have any good support through all this either. One time, I called PG for support (right before another MRI) all she would say is that my brother has it worse and I have to help her help him bc I’m doing so well and I have my stuff together. I did not. I was terrified that I had cancer (i didn't) bc of all the testing I was going through with no answers and, you know, the internet. It really hurt that all she could talk about was my brother. I guess bc I could take care of myself and do what needed to be done she thought I didn’t need any help or support. Idk.

Last August. I had just gotten home from a study abroad and immediately started having vision problems. Over the past 2 years or so I had gotten a specialist who had an idea but couldn’t prove it yet. But she had me call her whenever I had vision trouble as this was a sign to look out for. So more MRIs and bloodwork. This is important bc at the time I had to go to a specific hospital that was a few blocks away from PGs house. So I asked if she could take me to my appts and if I could stay with her bc my doc wanted me nearby. She was happy to do so and I was happy for the help but looking back now I do regret asking. 

She drove me to my MRI at 7pm later that night and waited for me to get out 2 hours later. She woke me up and drove me to my appts the next day and when my doc told me that I had to get emergency steroid infusions for 3 consecutive days to lessen the damage to my eyes and brain she prayed with me. It was very emotional. And after years of going through all the appts and testing basically alone with very little support I was happy to finally have a family member with me. But later in the infusion center, she berated my nurse, asking her all kinds of questions that basically said that she didn’t believe the nurse was capable. Acting like a crazy person again. I mean we just met this poor nurse and instantly PG starts being mean and using the strict mom voice on her and complaining about the IV and every little thing. I was tired and feeling horrible with a migraine so I just gave an apology look to the nurse who was visibly trying to keep her cool and tried to get PG to sit down and be quiet. The next two days I just traveled back and forth from home and sat alone in the infusion center.

After that is when I got the MS diagnosis. It was very freeing. Finally. FINALLY. I knew what I had and now it could be treated and managed. (with trial and error) This gave me a new lease on life. I decided to do more, travelling more, visiting online friends and doing things I was too scared to do before. One of those things is to really try to connect with my family more (I also have ASD so it was hard for me to connect). So I started calling various family members about once a week. Me and PG started talking more too. I would visit her more too. At first it was awesome we could really talk but then that super sweet soft voice started up again with the guilt tripping and martyrdom and straight up badmouthing my cousins and other family members, truly saying horrible things that a religious person or any person shouldn’t ever say. 

One thing that I was genuinely concerned about (before she got bad again) was the Last Straw Bed. She had been complaining for months about needing a new mattress. I had said I would help her look but I had gotten busy. But then she mentioned how she had bruises on her back bc it was a spring mattress and the coils would bruise her skin. Despite everything before I still loved PG so one day I decided to just match what she could for a new mattress. She was thanking me in tears when I told her. She kept saying how she doesn’t have a lot of money to help pay for it and I said whatever you can get together is fine and I’ll get the rest. She said 20$...Like the idiot I am I said that’s fine I’ll cover the rest. So just buying the mattress was a nightmare. Finding it was no problem except she kept asking for different things. It has to be soft but not too soft, at least 10 inches thick, etc. So of course the price kept going up. Luckily for me I like to find bargains. So I found a mattress about 240$ with everything she needed. And no coils or springs, foam only. It should last her forever too. Then she started complaining about how I was gonna get it to her. She kept calling me to ask the SAME questions over and over. I had to explain how fedex/ups worked and that the mattress would be rolled up in plastic multiple times. I even roped my dad into being there when the mattress arrived at her house so he could set it up for her, even though he didn’t want to deal with her. Literally all you have to do is unwrap it and put it on a frame and wait for it to inflate. That’s it. After explaining that 3 times I just stopped answering the phone. She called me 3 more times. It was so stressful. I said screw I’ll do it myself. Ordered the mattress got it over to her place and had to deal with her micromanaging me setting up the bed. That was stressful bc it’s not hard to do and there are literally 2 steps but she turned it into about 15. I even made the bed too. Then she gave me the 20 and I left as fast as I could.

Over the next week I am getting calls from my dad and my younger brother about how she is complaining about me charging her 20 dollars for a gift and how I shouldn’t have done that. That made me so mad I developed a migraine. After a day or two I calmed down and was about to let it go. Then I get a call from my older brother and we chat. Then I tell him about PG and he said that’s weird bc she has been buying him clothes and cigarettes and food all week and hasn’t said a word to him about the mattress or the money. I was livid. Not only did she complain and badmouth me after I had spent over 200$ on her and then go on to spend money on my brother like money wasn’t an issue but she also didn’t even acknowledge to anyone else what I had done for her.

I hit my breaking point with her. I just ghosted her. No contact for over a month. Then 2 weeks ago she calls me from the hospital. I didn’t know it was her. I thought it was for me since I’m still going through treatment. Again, in that saccharine sweet voice she is repeatedly asking me why I haven’t called or answered the phone or anything and if she did anything wrong and how she’s been praying for me. I wasn’t ready for this conversation. The quarantine has been stressing me out big time and im on very little to no sleep along with side effects from treatment. I told her as much, she said ok…then continued to re-ask the same questions while sprinkling in that she had two surgeries for cancer. While I heard that part I kept telling her that I wasn’t ready to talk and she kept saying ok and kept talking so eventually I just hung up.

Here’s my problem. I do not want to deal with her. At all, ever. I’ve already had one relapse since the mattress incident and while she isn’t the reason for it I feel that the stress over that was definitely part of the cause. For the past month, despite the quarantine, it’s been nice not to have to deal with her and her complaints and badmouthing of the rest of the family. But my mom asked me that if she really does have cancer would I be ok with not talking to her when she dies. (She is a known liar and no lie is too far for her, she once tried to convince me that, during a schizophrenic episode, my older bro asked her for…help with “It” as he didn’t have a gf at the time. I, of course didn't believe it, he is usually lucid enough to tell you what he is seeing/hearing, and has always been terrified, never talking or asking about that kind of thing.) 

Honestly, I don’t know if I’ll be ok with it. I want to say ‘yes, absolutely, ill be fine’ but who knows until it actually happens? Plus that sounds really heartless. But it could be a ploy. But she could be telling the truth this time. She was actually in the hospital and during this pandemic that’s usually for a serious reason but shes had surgeries before and usually she tells everyone right away anytime she needs to get admitted to the hospital. And for some reason she waited until after the supposed surgeries to say anything. I asked my dad and he didn’t know anything about it either so on that I don’t think I believe her but…\~unsure shrug\~

The rest of my family and friends say just to let her go and don’t worry about it. Even my maternal grandmother said that I don’t need to stress myself out over it and just let her go. But that one thought is stuck in my head. Would I be ok? What do you think Reddit? Should I let her go so I have one less stressor in my life or try to talk to her again in case she isn’t lying about having cancer?",28Apr2020,1

465,"I’m scared. I just graduated high school and I’m scared. I have hopes and dreams. I have aspirations in life and I don’t know if I’m good enough to meet these goals. I’m scared of the future. That I will not be good enough. Am I strong enough? Can I do the work? Am I smart enough? Do I have the self control? Will I be mentally strong enough not to kill myself in the next 5 years? Will anyone ever except me for me? Is there anyone out there who feels like I do? I feel alone. Everyone around me is stronger then I am. They don’t know how weak I feel. They see me as just another strong family member but I know I’m different then them. 
I’m different. I’m not charming (only to old people), I’m not funny, I’m not sensitive, I’m not that good looking, i have blonde Asian hair that sticks out, I’m skinny, I’m smart but my memory sucks so it means nothing, I’m lazy, I have mental health problems (mostly during winter months, genetic depression), I’m an extremely independent thinker, I’m logical to a fault, I’m not personable, I have never truly opened up to anyone, I’m a very relaxed person but I’m not a cool guy. I’m 120lbs and 5’8”. I only have a couple good friends but I find it hard to trust them completely sometimes. The only people i completely trust are my immediate family members and they are not honest with me. They only see the good in me. I don’t know who i am. 

I’m nothing special and I’ve never had a girlfriend. Not many girls find the skinny kid attractive. I look like I’m 4 years younger then i am. I live in a smaller town and I’ve maybe met a handful of girls that I would consider having a relationship with. None of these have worked out because I don’t understand how to be in a relationship. I suck at texting and I hate it. It feels like that’s how all relationships start now a days. I have had sex with hot girls but I get annoyed easily and it’s hard to find girls that I enjoy spending time with. If I do enjoy their company, I’m normally not attracted to them. When I do find a girl I see a future with, they are never attracted to me.
My dad’s father left his household when he was in high school. I think this is why my dad has never had the birds and the bees talk with me. He never had it himself. I have never had anyone to give me girl advice. I’m scared I will never find love, and if I do, I won’t know what to do.  

In the last couple years i have been trying to decide if I’m different or if my anxiety is just holding me back. I have always felt like I’m a different person when I’m alone. I’m a cool person, I think of funny shit, I’m a more like able person. When I’m around people, it all goes to shit. I get nervous, insecure and the thought of being different won’t go away. 

My whole life I was surrounded by people I wanted to be like, mostly popular, older male cousins that are bad decision makers. These cousins are able to make it through life making bad decisions because they are good looking. They are likeable and people give them the benefit of the doubt. I have never had that luxury and my share of bad decisions has hurt me way more then any of them. 

A combination of these things has shaped my life and turned me into the anxious, depressed, unlikeable person that I am. I’m trying to change but it’s hard. At the same time I don’t know if I should change? Will my different be accepted as an adult? Can I succeed as the person I am? Do I need to change? 

There are good things about me. I’m a problem solver, I’m an extremely outside the box thinker, the power of my will is out of this world and when I put my mind to something I can normally excel at it. With that being said, putting my mind to something is extremely hard with anxiety and self doubt. I feel like my life is broken beyond repair and I don’t know what to do anymore. These are the thoughts that go through my head, in the past some of them have made me contemplate suicide. In the last few months I have committed to doing my best, only worrying about things I can control. In the back of my head, the things I can’t control are gonna be the end of me. I hate my life. I’m lost",28Apr2020,1
466,"Hi! I’m an au pair currently in Switzerland. I’ve been here since September and my contract is supposed to end at the end of August. I’m finding everything really tough atm due to the coronavirus. I feel very isolated and alone. My host family have always been very fair and kind to me. However I really want to leave ASAP. I already chatted with them a few weeks ago about leaving mid July (it’s give them enough time to find a new au pair etc). However, my mind has changed and I want to leave right now. 

They’re currently staying in a chalet in the mountains and I’m alone in my separate accommodation. At first I was looking forward to holidays but I’ve literally nothing to do and I only meet up with my friend once a week. I feel depressed and isolated. I don’t know if it’s unfair of me to ask to leave sooner? Atm mentally I really can’t cope with staying any longer. I miss my family and my bf. I have no reason to stay here except for the fact me leaving would affect the children (but either way they’ll be upset when I eventually leave?). I don’t earn much money and I just end up spending it out of stress (buying useless crap).

Do you think it’s fair of me to ask to leave asap even though I’ll be abandoning them (they both work from home atm)? Even though I signed a contract to stay for a year, I really feel like I didn’t sign up to risk my life during a global pandemic (going outside with the children every day), be trapped in Switzerland and be isolated.

467,"So I have this friend, he’s the purest most genuine guy and always means the best. I’m talking about a friend who probably has never sworn in his life because he thinks he will go to hell for it. Our beliefs are vastly different, as I’m an atheist and he is probably the purest Christian that I know. Not once in our friendship has he ever tried to push his religion onto me, not one single time. He doesn’t judge anyone, he’s like what most Christians should aspire to be. (That’s not a fact it’s just an opinion. I don’t want this post to get flagged) I feel like a fucking asshole for even making this subreddit but I’ve ignored and dodged his calls and texts more than once the past several years and he still texts me no matter what. To make this a little more clear, I’m a female and he’s a male. He doesn’t have a crush on me, but like it SEEMS like he has a crush on me. We have known each for a VERY long time. I’m talking like 10 plus years, and even after he’s noticed me dodging texts, he’s explained to me he does not have a crush on me or anything and just wants to talk. But the sad, shitty ASSHOLE part of it is, I don’t. I’m 27 so I know outgrowing friendships is a natural thing, but he is always there. But like I feel so UniNvested in that friendship anymore and he’s CONSTANTLY texting me, even when I don’t answer. It’s not like I’m even trying to ghost him (I can hear my inner voice right now and I sound like the biggest fucking Regina George on the planet.) and it’s not like I don’t see his texts, I see them. And they’re very enthusiastic and when I see them I actually cringe anymore. I don’t want ridiculed for this, I just wanna know if anyone else has ever felt this way? I have a conscious about, because like I said, I feel like a fucking bitch for even writing all of this but I just don’t understand why I feel like that. He’s literally someone who would give the clothes off of his back for anyone and I’m basically ignoring him 24/7. I just don’t know what to do, I’m so confused. Not in a sense that I like him, or anything like that because we are VASTLY different (not that there is anything wrong with that) but our lifestyles do not match up whatsoever but I know he’s a good person, and I cannot understand why the fuck I’m acting like this. I’m just irritated. Any time I see a text from him I roll my eyes and scoff. I DONT want to be like that towards him. I’m also high as shit, and I know Reddit is a great and opening community so I’m so so sorry if I sound like a complete fucking asshole.

These people helped unearthtge truth of where these interdimensional beings are coming from and even helped me get in contact with people to get me to the Paris catacombs and bypass thetravel  lockdown 

Today I believe they became possessed and even though I have all the information I need I know it isn't right to leave them possessed.

I know they're possessed because when I told them I hired the men that can get me to the catacombs and that I'd be leaving with them to shutdown the Paris catacombs hell portal they suddenly became opposed to the entire operation even though we all planned it together. I am still in contact with the only member of the discord who wasn't bpossessed but even he is at a loss for how I can help the others.

469,"I’m 20, my friend is 24. He used to be my next door neighbour, and I have kept contact with him as I’ve grown older. He was foster cared as a child and was made homeless as he left child care. In all honesty I do genuinely sympathise for his situation but I’ve just come to realise he doesn’t try hard enough either. To cut a long story short, he’s in a  hard place because he needs permanent full-time employment to survive - but he does not have the liberty of being able to work his way up slowly through part time work, or to receive a low wage whilst he trains and gains experience since all of his benefits will be frozen and he truly will be made homeless then - which kind of makes keeping a job difficult. 

However this guy has become very toxic for me. We do genuinely share the same interests and as bad as his attitude is, I’m able to have fairly intellectual conversations with him - but his attitude really stinks. He’s an armchair expert on how the world should work, despite not being very skilled or useful for anything. Basically a special snowflake that believes he is better than other people and blames everyone and anything for his failures.

I’ve tried to keep my distance, and just help when he NEEDS help, but this guy needs help with everything. I gave him a place to sleep for 6months +, he owes me over £500, he messages/calls everyday expecting me to meet him to cure his boredome, and calls me anytime he has the simplest of struggles (on his first day of work he couldn’t open a gate during his lunch break so he called me and I heard this guy viciously shaking the gate and shouting on the premises all because he didn’t want to waste his lunch time). 

I see this guy everyday (he lives very local to me - and always searches for housing closest to me when he has to relocate) and I did used to consider him a friend but now he really has become a burden. 

I just don’t know how to break it to this guy. It will literally shatter his worldview if the one and only guy that has supported him for the past year or two decides that he’s suddenly not worth the effort anymore. I’m prepared to lose the £500 debt, as long as he no longer drains my energy and mental health, but I feel like it could get really ugly. I just know he won’t take any of the criticisms well and I’m not sure if it will even encourage him to reflect and change for the better. I just want to stop spending so much time with him, however I’m stuck in a vicious cycle of trying to help him so that he can get back on his own two feet, and then watching him do nothing and need help all over again. I’m not even sure if this guy can survive without me, and I genuinely don’t want anyone to be marginalised in society, but I help him more than he helps himself and I don’t think there’s anything I can do to truly help him. He’s just got a lot of bad habits, not a lot of good habits, and afraid to admit he needs to fix himself up.",28Apr2020,1
470,"Hello reddit,

I dont't know if this is the right subreddit for this, but I have to tell this story to someone. Also I'writing this story on mobile and english isn't my main language, so expect bad grammar.

I (16m) have an older brother (19m). When he was 15 he got bullied in school and he gradually distanced himself from our family, which we didn't notice at first. He always was open and had lots of friends, but the bullying broke him and he started to use drugs. After one and a half year he quit school and got a job and everything seemed to get better. 

But then he got a girlfriend. She has many mental health issues and my brother was sort of caring for her. He didn't come home very often and then suddenly, he quit his job and didn't respond to our messages. My mother was devastated and tried to help him to get out of his current situation. But the only thing he cared for is his girlfriend. After a few months it started to look better. He went to school again, to finish hos apprenticeship, but the only thing we heard of him was about his girlfriend. My mother started thinking about what she did wrong, raising him and that really hurt her. You have know, that she is really emotional and want's to make everything right for everyone. When she went to bed I heard her cry many times and my father gave her emotional support.

The next incident was last christmas. Everyone was happy and then his girlfriend called. Her mother, who has also mental health issues, got drunk and they started to scream at each other. My father had to drive him to her, becauses he had to help her. These things went on and on.

Then this year we went on vacation on peru. It was the first time since a year, that my brother didn't see his girlfriend over a week. Everything wenn't alright and some of his old personality showed again, until his girlfriend called him. She had a mental breakdown and it was the first time, my brother couldn't do anything. He was furious. He screamed, shouted and thew stuff around the room. The vacation was ruined for everyone.

And now finally yesterdays incident. At the weekend he called my mother, that he want's to go to a psychiatrist with her. She thought, that he finally want's to talk about what happened to him, when he was bullied, to overcome his mental health issues, but we were wrong. But he said, that he want's to go because of my mother. They often get in arguments and now she thinks again, the she is the cause of the problem. 

Only time sees, what happens next. I myself hope, that he leaves his girlfriend, because i think that she is the root problem of this all. 

Thanks for reading, I just have to tell this story to someone, because I can't stand it to keep it to myself for any longer.

471,"So this is gonna make me look like a homophobe but trust me I'm not.
My brother is 12 and he recently started watching Batwoman. I've seen a 6-7 episode and eventually stopped watching. It's not a great show. In fact it's shit. Anyway he started watching it and the main character, Kate, is a lesbian. There arr flashbacks in which show her with her girlfriend making out and stuff. Now keep in mind that we live in Iran and homosexuality is really not something that people are okay with around here. And I don't want to explain homosexuality to him and confuse him or put ideas in his head you know. He's a kid living in a homophobic country. I've tried talking him out of it and telling him that the shouldn't waste his time watching this and that there are better shows out there. What should I do?",28Apr2020,1
472,"A bit of context, first: I have a childhood friend, who I've known since I was 2.  She is 23 now.  From early on in her teenage years, it became pretty clear that my friend has depression which, although milder, has continued to plague her into adulthood.  She is currently living with her boyfriend of 6 years.  I don't see her in person as often since she moved out of the area we grew up in together (maybe once a season if that?) but we still communicate fairly frequently online.  Every now and then, conversations with her take very steep turns towards the negative and no matter what I say or do, I feel like nothing is helping.

She has confided in me that she feels she has no friends where she lives (citing myself as her only close friend) and doesn't know how to make more.  She doesn't feel emotionally supported by her boyfriend (he is not a bad or abusive person, but he has his own set of personal issues that make it hard for him to open up, I think) and won't talk to him if something that happens between them upsets her as she does not want to upset him.  Honestly, I sometimes worry that the two of them have a codependent relationship, but that's a whole other can of worms I have no idea how to  go about opening, or if I even should.  She's also mentioned that she feels like her feelings aren't valid and she would rather be the one hurting than risk hurting other people, even if that hurt is a short term consequence with long term benefits.  She refuses to go to therapy or try to do her own research about aiding mental wellbeing; she also shoots down any suggestions I give about such matters.  (I also have a history of depression and other mental difficulties but unlike her, got therapy and for the most part am much healthier, so I have tried teaching her techniques from my own experiences.)  She has also expressed that I'm the only person she feels she can talk to, but this is putting a massive emotional burden on me as her only support pillar, because I'm already using a lot of my mental energy staying on top of my own previously mentioned issues. 

It just seems like these conversations always inevitably follow this format:
1) She asks for help/to talk/mentions something that has upset her.
2) I either try to give her advice, let her rant to get her emotions out, or offer distraction.
3) Inevitably, none of these things seem to make a difference, as she just shoots down everything I say, no matter what it is.
4) I become frustrated. 

She just has this attitude where it seems like she believes that everything that could be done has failed before she even thinks to try.  I constantly feel like I have to walk on eggshells around her to avoid saying something that pushes her too far or makes her feel invalidated or turns myself into someone she feels she can't talk to.  How can I support my friend when I feel like nothing gets through?  Should I just stop addressing these topics with her and provide as many positive experiences as possible or will that make her feel like I got fed up of her expressing her feelings?  I want to remain her friend and be there for her, but I'm reaching my wit's end.  Thank you for your advice.

TL;DR  Defeatist friend has a negative response to everything.  How can I help her create a positive mental attitude?",28Apr2020,1

So there's this girl I've been talking to and we've known each other for awhile now. We text regularly but ever since she started watching Game of Thrones, we texted non stop. But now she's finished and she's said how much she misses it already.

She's told me before how much she likes books and wishes to read one. So I was thinking of posting her the first ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" book, (they're the books that the show is based on), with a little message inside. I think she might find it sweet during the lockdown, but I don't know. Is that too much?

Any advice would be appreciated :)",28Apr2020,1
474,"So one of my best friends over the weekend was ignoring my messages (taking ages to open, and then just leaving on read) we usually talk fairly regularly, most days. It took me messaging one of her friends saying hey what's going on here, for her to message me saying the she didn't want to talk to me, that me messaging was frustrating, and that her doing what she did should've been an obvious clue that she didn't want to talk. I apologised for frustrating her, and said that it's fine that you don't want to talk, but I'd just prefer you tell me rather than ignoring me.  


We didn't speak for a couple of days (which is fine), and she's messaged me tonight as if everything is fine, but i'm quite annoyed that she hasn't apologised for ignoring me. In my book, ignoring someone rather than telling them you don't want to talk is just plain rude and makes a friendship unproductive; after all, communication is the key to any friendship/relationship being maintained I feel.

So my question is, is it unreasonable to want an apology and ask for it? If so, what would be the most tactful way of bringing it up? Thanks in advance guys",28Apr2020,1

Then I started getting a crap ton of pop ups everywhere, on every site. I have not downloaded ANY new apps, clicked on or agreed to ANY pop ups, etc. But I read that the pop ups mean I have malware. After spending the past 3 hours trying to stop them (I installed loose 6 adblockers), the ads are finally gone.

482,"Hello everyone.. since I was a child my mom was the most loving and caring woman in the world but her over-protective state has caused more issues for me than good. To cut the story short, lately she has been agonizing me for my choice about not getting a citizenship in the country we immigrated to, and I keep telling her that I made the choice of not losing my citizenship of the country I was born in and I don't really benefit from getting citizenship of the country we immigrated to 15 years ago. (also where we currently reside).

Long story short, she keeps crying over my choice and its been like this every time we talk and she thinks I am ""joking"". Sometimes I snap and get angry and say rude things to her only to feel bad afterwards because she cries and acts like a puppy or kitten that got hurt. It breaks my heart to see the person I love most and I only have left in this world. 

Additional things she has done before is crying and acting hurt so I don't quit school due to anxiety and depression she don't know about and because of that I had to go back to school and suffer. Basically many of the lifes greatest choices, she has acted upon it and made me do it. I know she did it to help my life, but its too much. 

Few days ago I had a job interview at 6 pm and she acted as usual telling me that I am lying and no jobs would call someone to an interview at 6 pm and that I am lying about it.

Today  she asked me how my application for citizenship is going and I straight told her, ""mom please, I told you already, I have cancelled the application and I dont want their citizenship"". - she began to cry and shouting that I am dumb, that I am killing her from the inside and stuff.

I told her to calm down please, its not the end of the world and I will do good in life. I told her its better to have a good and happy relationship with eachother rather than destroying it day after day, but she does not understand and I went back to my room to write this post.

Anyone got any advice? I am 27 years old and before you ask why I live with her, its because I havent had luck with finding my own place for several reasons including I havent found a job yet and apartments are hard to find where I am living.

Thank you for everyone who has done reading all of this and if you have any advice, it would be more than welcome.

i'll get this straight, i will, LIKE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY IN HELL, i WILL get everyone back

there's no way

i will compensate everything

there's literally no other way, no way

i dont forget shit

but, also im not stupid enough to do that shit impulsively like that

like, just grab a machete and chop everyone up

mentally speaking, i am definitely capable of that, meaning that i have so much anger (i know it sounds corny, edgy, but thats how it really is rn) that i could do it

but again, i dont want to fuck my life up.

im being patient

tho, at the same time, im at home punching walls, going crazy

i really can't let go of the way people have treated me 

there was no bullying and shit, but sometimes the simple act of someone underestimating me could drive me nuts, and yes its also pretty painful to me if i dont get all the attention and etc, but its not even relevant to how i've been treated.

yes, i do think that im above others, tho i have never said it to anyone, and it 2x angers me

like, i dont want yall to think that im a narcissistic prick in real life, i really never express the way i feel about myself.

but, again,

it definitely makes it difficult to let that shit go

and i wont

like i've had people just fuck with me for being quiet. and no, im not generally quiet, and that's exactly the reason why some people got triggered. they thought that i was playing cool, and yes i was, i have already mentioned how i think of myself, but at the same time, i did it just to avoid talking to them. cuz i dont like to be around certain people, i think that they're cringey, stupid, corny, i didn't do that shit in a rude way too, btw. i put on a fucking persona. yes i could confronted them, i would win, there's no way in hell, but i just smiled back. and that fucks me up even more. i wanted to cut them throats with a piece of glass, but i didn't and yes to some degree im thankful. god, remembering how heavy i felt, how much angriness i had, it could have definitely happen. but instead they (particular people) remembered as this calm dude, that only smiles and doesn't talk back. and yes, again, im trying to be positive, i am kinda thankful, and think that it was better, but again, i cant forget how i didn't respond, and held back. I LITERALLY ""ACTED"" SCARED. yes i know, it might sound stupid, and it might actually sound like i was actually scared, but i wasn't, i was literally getting pleasure out of them getting a false image of myself, i know, it sounds weird, and i didn't even know why i did it. i even had a girl record my and put me up on her story coz of that, without my permission, quietly. that's also something i haven't and won't let go. why should i? who does that? but basically she tried to put emphasis on how quiet i was. like, again who does that, am i wrong for being angry? she even put on a filter to make me look funnier. the thing is that i already hated that bitch, and now it added up, and yes, again , i wont forget. i still acted cool, i still acted like i didn't see it. yes to yall, it might be just a story, with just a guy, but HEY. that's the problem to me, IM NOT JUST A FUCKING GUY, It might sound like nothing for you, but fuck your viewpoint, its my world, my face was put up on that shit, and that bitch will pay. patiently waiting. shit's gon be deadly

to cut it short, similar shit has being happening to me, like its not bullying, but also its disrespectful.

my main motivation is not and will never be revenge, i want to be famous, i want each and every girl on my dick, i want to be succesful, but also, there's no way in hell, as i said, i will get all of them back, and i will kill them all, obviously, in a way that i won't be accused of shit. i was, am and will be patient, those people fucked up once, and its totally enough.",28Apr2020,1

If you ask him to do something (something meant for fun) he sighs and rolls his eyes and complains he doesn't want to. Trying to plan a day together, he hates the pool, hates the beach, hates being in the sun. If I ask what he wants to do he says nothing. The only thing he likes is fishing. I've offered to go with him but he says he only likes fishing from a charter boat which is expensive and lasts 4 hours. 

He also can't stand my dog and will say mean things like ""I hate you dog"" or ""you're the most annoying thing ever"". The dog doesn't understand and doesn't seem effected but it really affects me and he knows this.

People have family /friends / cousins /lover to rely on I have no one. Except my sister who's life is just as same. 
I don't date cause ik how I am and I don't want to ruin someone else's life too. 
I feel so unmotivated to do anything.
I don't want to live but can't die either.
So, idk what to do with my life.

495,"I was catching up with my mom on the phone the other night. We live in different (neighboring) states, and outside of corona times we see each other about once a month. She’s someone I respect very much, and love very much, but when she started talking about how she wouldn’t get a vaccine if/when one comes to market, and how she believes there’s a high possibility of it being microchipped, and that the government is doing this to control populations.... I was just floored. It’s bothered me for the past two days that she’s engaged in these theories and is influencing my youngest 9 year old sister. She told me that my sister “wanted to protest” and made a sign (“on her own”) that said “America was free until Covid-19”. Thankfully they did not go and protest, but I’m disturbed nonetheless. Damn, are they lost forever? How do you overcome this level of ignorance and distrust?",28Apr2020,1
496,"my great friend (17m) has been in a relationship with a girl (f16) for about 4 or 5 months now. the girl, to put it frankly, is extremely manipulative and has to be the center of attention for everything. The last boyfriend she had (also a friend of mine) was falsely accused of rape by her after he tried to break up. she fakes having mental illnesses and blames it all on the alleged rape. she does it all for attention.

however my friend, has been slowly getting more depressed and recently started to pick up some bad, self harm esque habits. everyone who knows my friend knows how out of character it is for him. he is normally the most cheerful, most full of life and most enthusiastic kid i know. now he is completely different. eveyone knows him that his girlfriend is manipulating him to make him feel like shit. she flips all the bad stuff she does on him, and makes him think he is always in the wrong. she invades his privacy, logging in to his social medias to make sure he isn't taking to any other girls.

I have tried to explain to him what she is doing to him and explain that she is the reason for his declining mental health. but because he believes he is the bad guy in the relationship and he is blinded by his feelings for her, he becomes pissed off and doesn't listen.

I'm afraid if the relationship doesn't end soon something will happen to my friend (he has mentioned suicidal feelings only after dating this psycho chick). is there anyway i can nake him see how toxic this relationship is and how badly it needs to end.

should i tell his parents? get some sort of help for my friend or call authorities or the police? i feel kind of helpless and it breaks my heart to see his happiness and enthusiasm drain away from him infront of my eyes.

Please I'm desperate for advice",28Apr2020,1

If you don't look like a movie star or male model, women will never be physically attracted to you.

Women dream about finding their ""Prince Charming"" but they choose to date one douchebag after another. They get pumped and dumped, trapped in toxic, abusive relationships... or worse. Then they bitch that there's no good men out there. Sure there are. They're just too blind to see them. They'd rather date the exciting, superficially charming men and risk being abused, raped or cheated on, then be ""bored"" to death by a genuinely nice, modest guy.",28Apr2020,1

I have my own mental health problems myself which I struggle to work with so I feel like I’m not doing the best job

500,"Note: This isn't the generic ""I hate my parents"" post. All I'm saying isn't because I hate my parents, but because I am really worried.

16yo M

My Father is most of the time not in the hose because of work. He is usually in another country 3/4 of the time. He stays 3-4 weeks away and 1-2 here. Due to quarantine he is staying here and has been staying here for the past 2 months.

My father is extremely annoying. So annoying In fact, a part of ones soul dies when you interact with him. The worst part: it's intentional. He can be nice when he wants to, sometimes he is. He sees it as a kind of discipline or that he's rasing us.

My mom is also getting annoyed by him because he does stuff to her to (he isn't abusive to the extent of my knowledge). My mom is getting very annoyed, especially when she's not used to being with him for extended periods of time. Also, she has the opinion that quarantine is useless and it should end by now.

My Mom has 3 sisters with her being the youngest and the eldest being 17-18 years older. She got married at a young age 17-18 so her and her husband were basically my mom's parents. 

Recently, however, My mom and her sisters had a fight. It wasn't my mom's fight, but she sided with the second eldest sister as the others were being irrational and petty (in her opinion).

Today, it was nearing the end of my last online session. My room has a window looking into the only balcony of the house. When I looked out, I saw my mom standing on a chair and looking down. Then, she looked at me and joked about jumping. She kept looking down then came off the chair. For the rest of the session I was thinking ""why would she be standing on the chair?""

Then, it hit me ""Is she suicidal?"" I denied it, and continued the session.

After the session ended my mom came into my room (through the balcony), and sat on my bed. 

""I had a fight with your dad""

""why?""

""It was because he said ""DatRoomate only cares about food."""" 

This is something he says all the time. I hate to admit it, but it gets on my nerves. 

I basically told my mom to shake it off. She said no.

""Mom, why were you standing on the chair outside? ""

I wanted to know if she was doing a chore or something.

""DatRoomate, do you need something from me?""

""Noo?""

""Ok, now go to sleep."" ( I had to nap, because I had little sleep last night)

""Ok""

Now, I am writing this. Not knowing what to do. Though my mom may not be suicidal, but I sense a big fight coming between my parents. They even fought while I was writing this.

506,"a little backstory to all of this: during my first year in uni, i (19F) went on a date with this guy, M (19M) and i got sexually harassed. i only told a few close friends about what happened and i just wanted to forget everything before the next academic year started. i told E, (22F) who was a really close friend of mine back then because i trusted her.  E shows strong characteristics of a narcissist, and since im no psychologist i cant say for sure she has NPD, but her actions and mannerisms show prove that to be the case. 

fast forward to this year, me and E have a falling out over stupid reasons and our friend group is broken, whatever. i move on, cut her off completely and am trying to live my life. i notice M and E become really close over a short span of time which was kind of suspicious. within the next few weeks people come up to me asking if M had actually sexually harassed me. this was wild to me because i knew my close friends other than E wouldn't speak on anything like this ever. i ask these people how they know of this and i find out E has been going around telling everyone that I lied about being sexually harassed by M. but it kind of backfired upon E because sexual harassment isn't something anyone brings up in normal conversation and plus since I'm the girl in the story people started sympathizing with me, making E's friend, M, look bad. 

i was so angry, but i decided to play it calm. i muster up the courage to go talk to M about this and ask him why his friend E has the confidence to go around talking to people about something like this because regardless of what happened that night, people talking about it isn't going to benefit the either of us. he says he doesn't know why E is doing that. 

honestly at this  point I'm so angry, that if it wasnt for the lockdown I'd go to E's place and slap her across the face. like I get it, you dont like me. bitch about me, I dont give a fuck. but you do not bring up sexual harassment to make me look like a liar and use it in your personal agenda against me which in turn makes your friend look bad too. 

please advice me on what is the best course of action to take with someone like E. i've blocked her from my entire life but she still finds ways to get to me like this",28Apr2020,1

I've been living with a family member (who isn't my parents) for just over a year now and they're great except their mood changes extremely quickly. So they can be happy, or neutral but one thing can piss them off and they go completely sour and moody.
I'm generally a pretty bubbly person and I can brush off things fairly easily but when their mood turns I can't help but feel anxious and unsettled and like I'm walking on eggshells. I get angry much faster if they're angry (even if its not at me).

508,"Since September I've been losing weight. I've went from obese to overweight and finally healthy but I still want to loose a couple more stone, this will not put me in the underweight range. I am not obsessive I just like to know what I'm putting in my body so I track my macros and calories.

When I went bridesmaids dress shopping with my sil sister and cousin, I was trying a dress that was too small (my current size varies from 8-12 uk size I'm a 10 in most but depending on the shop) and as my sister was trying to zip me up she made a joak about me having a fat arse (not the issue I joak like this with my sister all the time) so I looked shocked cause i was expecting it to fit. Then my cousin pipes up and says something along the lines of ""you have body issues you cant even try a dress on in your size""  two things botherd me with this statement. 1. My cousin is large as in over a size 30 uk large (not shaming just telling the truth) and this particular shop only went to a size 22 uk and she tryed on a size 22 sooo... 2. I tried on a dress that fits in my range of sizes and was just shocked because I dont go to bridesmaids dresses shops on the regular and try on sizes.

Another time I was telling my brother (35+ m) that I'm starting to buy weights so he asked why and I said I still want to get lean. So he went on a rant about I'm getting too skinny and it will look sickly and all that shit. I showed him every bmi calculator body fat persentage calculator and every other thing I could think of, he counted this by pulling up the national avarage for my age range, now the issue with this is firstly it dosnt take into account that I'm taller than national avarage, secondly my country is facing an obesity crisis so national avarage does not mean what's healthy (I want to make it explicitly clear he did not search healthiest weight for a 17 yo or a 5'10"" woman or anything like that he searched for the national avarage of 17 yo girls.

My nan has said that if I get too low of a weight I'll end up having an ed and that she will force me to eat fat (I'm actually quite close to my nan she just made this off hand comment)

These are the moments that stand out to me the most but there has been more and they are just starting to make me feel like I have an ed and I dont. I eat healthily and track my calories that's all I'm not obsessive and still eat shitty food sometimes if I want to.",28Apr2020,1
509,"My friend’s ex knew that my friend was a bit sad due to the breakup, and wanted to cheer her up while also giving her space from him, so he ordered a coat she really liked while it was on sale and asked me to take credit for it so she wouldn’t know he was involved.

It arrived yesterday and I feel absolutely awful. She’s thanking me over and over again and even made a Facebook post about what a good friend I am. I feel so awkward taking the praise for this when I did nothing, and I also feel guilty for deceiving her in this way. 

I tried to get her ex to accept some money from me so I could cover SOME of the expenses that I’m being praised for, but he refused and said as long as she’s happy then he doesn’t care about the cost.

I feel so guilty for lying to her about something that made her this happy, but if I told her that the ex was behind this she’d never forgive me (she mentioned after it was already ordered that she was sick of her ex being involved in every aspect of her life).

From about 8 years ago until about 4 years ago, I molested my younger sister multiple times while she was sleeping and tried to force myself on her while she was awake two times. I was 14 when it started and she was 8. There were a few times that she had woken up and I lied to her and said I was in her room for something else. After the last time, I started to really work on making things right and telling her, but I was scared that telling her would make things harder for her if she was already unaware so I tried to focus on being a better sibling in other ways instead and acted like nothing happened to avoid bringing things back. Now that we're older, she's talked with me and my sister about being paranoid of people being in her room at night like seeing people outside her window that aren't there or waking up and thinking someone's in her room.

Why you ask? Because the basement I live in was only meant for one person. But me and my dad ended up here out of accommodation from the landlord(old dude’s daughter in law that doesn’t really have much say in the situation because he’s the owner of the house. She tells me she apologizes and she lives quite far from us and I don’t blame her as she had no idea there’d be 2 people living here.
This didn’t have to happen. But my dad wanted to save money on renting to pay off debts. So he submitted a notice to our previous apartment. After the notice, he only then found out basements only accept one tenant. Then he tried to reverse the notice to leave the apartment but it was too late and we had to leave. Leaving isn’t an issue, I told my dad that I’ll send him money and we’ll both pay for the the rent to move.
The plan got derailed to shit. Without telling me, he rented a basement and met with the landlord telling her it’s only him that will live there. I was still dependent on him so when he told me what he did I was furious, why didn’t you ask me for rent? Well, apparently that one time in 2014 I refused to give him money when he asked. Apparently all the other times he asked me for 200 and 500 amounts after 2014 weren’t in his memory.
I can’t stand on my feet, I would’ve used my savings to help us get an apartment but he didn’t trust me. We end up in this basement and fast forward a bit and we’re in a pandemic with the old man upstairs only annoying me and tapping his feet on me as I wasn’t part of the initial agreement or something. I tell my dad and he tells me he just cares about paying debts so he says either I go back to our third world country or suck it up. The old man upstairs does not give a fuck and keeps coughing, making noise above me and doesn’t want me to exist there.
Funny thing is even though my dad wanted to save, we still spent on transferring our stuff to 2 storage units to store our stuff and the storage unit prices. In winter he was forcing me to help him with his next master plan: moving our stuff from storage unit to storage unit to take advantage of the first free month and he wanted to keep doing it.

I appreciate that she thinks of me but it’s getting out of hand. I go to therapy and am working on myself, I don’t need her to send me all this stuff multiple times a week. Sometimes it doesn’t even feel genuine, it’s almost like she’s doing it to prove she’s a good friend or something. 

I know she’s coming from a good place but I really don’t want her to continue blowing up my phone with this content. I’m afraid of how she’ll react, I worry she’ll get defensive and say she’s just trying to help me grow as a person, and I’m insensitive for not being receptive to it.

TL;DR - I’m a dropout failure carrying guilt of dropping out and not telling parents. Help.  



I feel guilt as I carry around the fact I am a dropout (TAFE which is like college) I had a few months to graduate and it all became overbearing and realised it was not the life I wanted to life (that being directing and film) I have a massive passion for it but the course itself was awful. Two of the three teachers didn’t know how to teach and we always clashed. I know that happens a lot outside of study but it felt personal. My most recent teacher blamed people for having regular schedules (work and family) as to us failing group assignments and told us family and work can change when we’re at the course. I carry all this around silently in stress as I feel my mother and sister will think of me as a failure. I haven’t had a job because of mixed opinions; those being “working in high school is a lot of stress” and then “don’t look for work fo study more” so I’ve been told to find a job then not find one because it’s too much. Right now I am unemployed and a dropout. The definition of a failure in many eyes. However I do have big dreams and pray and so far some doors have opened. I just am tired of carrying this guilt.

He was in serious trouble with his school and the police every few weeks - a month from 13-16 and not for normal shit either. he was in trouble manipulating and blackmailing girls the year below him to send him nudes. he Accidentally stabbed a kid with scissors and he needed stitches. he would steal money and games off his friends. he finally got kicked out for sending pictures of his own dick to the careers lady at his school.          

Since getting kicked out of school at 16 he has never had a job. He was adamant he wanted to be a professional COD player and if my parents didn’t support him then they were the shitty parents who didn’t believe in him. So they let him. My parents would buy him new monitors and controllers if/when he broke his old ones out of rage and for birthdays and Christmas they would pay for him to fly out to under 18s COD events. His team seemed to do well and he was kept happy but still refused to get a part time job so that he could fund this himself. Honestly if he’d just stayed a leaching gamer it would all have been easier.             

7 or so months ago aged 18 he passed his driving test. My grandparents had left me their car for when i turned 17 and could learn to drive so he convinced my parents to buy him one or it Wouldn’t Be Fair - whatever - they got him a car, and he has recently become far worse.                

Since passing his test he’s being going out more, because he can, i was the same when i passed mines. He’s stopped playing COD almost completely and now just goes out and does drugs with his friends (not something i really have any sort of issue with on its own) but he has also started stealing.  my parents run a business together and employed him to do basic shit like clean up in the mornings and help out when it was busy - But it was on his terms. It was if and when he could be bothered. And then he stole over £500 in the last few months in cash directly from the business safe - caught on camera. The first time he denied it. despite being caught on CCTV my parents didn’t punish him in any way. The Second time, he also denied it. they told him he wouldn’t be doing anymore work for them. That he wouldn’t get paid anymore, and that they were taking his car (that they pay for) away for a month. he then stole again, on CCTV, 3 weeks later. he got his car back after the original month.   No matter what that boy does he gets away with it for two reasons. 1.  he’s charming as shit. 2. he literally does not care.         

he has also been railing lines of ket and smoking in the kitchen with 6+ of his friends while my mum sleeps in the room next door. he’s been caught multiple times and my mum just kicks his friends out, says “how dare you!!!!!!!” and then everything is fine in the morning and we’re not allowed to talk about it. 

Bit of backstory on me - as the eldest i very much had the Oldest Sibling shit. I would be grounded, have my shit taken off me, have my parents go through my shit for next to no reason. eg. one time i didn’t do my homework (when i was in my penultimate year of high school) and my phone was taken off me for a month and i wasn’t allowed to contact or see anyone outside of school. I moved out at 18 and then moved back with my parents aged 20 after a suicide attempt and an inpatient stay. My parents then kicked me out 2 months later because - direct quote - “(my) mental health is putting a strain on” my parents relationship. I was sofa surfing, while very mentally unwell, for 3 months before i moved in with an old friend. stayed for 6 months and then once again, moved back in with my parents while my mental health continued to deteriorate. My mum felt absolutely awful and guilty and tried to make it up to me. i’ve lived with her again for over a year and we tend to get along very well now. our only quarrels are over my brother’s behaviour and her lack of disciplining him. She has told me she doesn’t come down too hard on him because she doesn’t want what happened to me to happen to him.       

We’ve now been in lockdown for over a month. My mum seems to be taking her anger that my brother has caused, out on me. Last week my mum went through all of my shit. went into every drawer in my room, went through all of my letters, my notebooks, everything. I wasn’t happy. The next day she accused me of stealing her credit card. There was malice and spite in her words. She was horrible and accusatory. I have never stolen a thing off my parents. Never. Never ever ever. but who has? my brother!!!! So i suggest phoning the police and gathering CCTV for where she can see her card was used (petrol station and supermarket), find out who did it ( my brother ). she refuses. he denies it. but somehow has petrol in his car despite having no income and loads of food in his room. How Strange. He has also been throwing slurs at me and we’ve ended up having a physical fight which has never happened before. 

Today, i told my mum that i hate him. That I think he’s the biggest piece of shit i’ve ever met and it’s not even because of what he’s done, it’s the complete lack of respect or care for any other living person outside of himself. I cannot stand him. He is manipulative, leeching, aggressive, the biggest liar i have ever known, and has a completely lack of empathy. I am being completely honest when i say my brother terrifies me.  And now i’m the bad guy. My mum told me i’m terrible and disgusting and that because i’ve given up on him it’s only going to make him worse. She told me that it’s obvious he isn’t going to change so I have to change to be okay with his behaviour. I told her that’s not how things work. That just because he is my brother, it does not mean that i have to like him and that i never will and i think he’s awful.   She has asked me to leave. During lockdown. I don’t have a car. I’ve gone out on a walk in the hopes that if i come home in a few hours she will have calmed down and will let me stay for now but i really really don’t know what to do.        

I truly truly do not know what to do. 
any advice at all, is welcomed. 

tldr; 
i told my mum that i hate my sociopathic brother, and that i’m sick of her taking out the anger he’s caused her on me. she has asked me to leave (again) during a global pandemic.",28Apr2020,1
531,I’m 21 years old. I currently live with my parents while so I go to community college this is my last semester before I transfer and move out. I have been working two jobs during quarantine to save   money and move out. My mom knows I am always at work however she is controlling and paranoid and doesn’t believe I am actually at work especially during quarantine.She claims she has called the police to locate me and gave them my phone number and I believe my license plate number. Would the police try and track me down with this information or is she bluffing?,28Apr2020,1
532,"Recently, I’ve been online on Instagram more frequently due to quarantine and I found this really cute and pretty girl, so I started following her. She has around 30k followers. I know this is weird but yeah, after seeing her stories and posts for a few days, I started having a crush on her. I’ve had fantasy thoughts about her but after reminding myself that she’ll never know that I exist, I feel very depressed. Besides this, quarantine is driving me nuts because there is literally nothing to do and I keep fantasising about her. Any advice :(",28Apr2020,0
534,"Before all the lockdowns and stay at home orders I had been living temporarily with my girlfriend, her 89 year old grandmother and her 70 year old uncle. Both of them were taking care of Meme (her grandmother) equally for a couple of months at that point, and after I moved in things were going well with it. Wasn't really my first choice to live there, but we could help her and she could help us save money for a while. One day though, her uncle messed up his back and gradually got to the point where he was laying in bed most of the day other than making breakfast or lunch occasionally. However, Meme will very often make passive aggressive comments about not liking the food, not liking how things are done, not getting enough attention etc. So her uncle was getting more and more fed up at this point and one day he completely lost his cool because his tv went out and he smashed a table outside and left. He said living with meme and in constant pain was hell for him. That was when covid first started, and since then it has been just me and my gf. I am unemployed due to covid, so I am at the house all day while my gf goes to her job as an essential employee. Well Meme has dementia, and while she can remember most things it is slowly getting harder to have conversations with her. She has been more rude, more vulgar, more depressing, and will ramble a bunch. I have been incredibly patient thus far. I have been helping with her garden and keeping the house clean, keeping her fed. But lately she hasn't been wanting to eat anything I make her. I made an omelette this morning and she looked at it, fluffed her brow and said she was sick to her stomach. She has been doing this a lot recently, but I was told that she has to eat regardless because she needs to gain weight. She also has been very easy to guilt trip me. If I spend more than an hour alone she will say something like ""have you been hiding from me"" or ""i've been alone all day"". And I'm sorry, but I cannot spend every waking moment with her, and I even told her before than I like my space and alone time and it's not personal. I try to talk to her throughout the day or put on a movie with her but I really cannot listen to rambling or her sideways complaining for long intervals. Yesterday I finally got out of the house to meet my gf for lunch. I was gone all of 45 minutes and within that time Meme had set off her home alarm and the ambulance showed up, and she nearly let our two dogs out of the gate while doing so, lucky the emt got them. She has been fine to leave alone for a few hours up until I heard what happened yesterday. My girlfriend is also getting extremely frustrated with it too because she will work all day and come home and Meme will make her feel bad if she doesn't spend the whole night by her side. Oh yeah and the house is constantly at 80 degrees. She complains about being cold. And I understand that elderly are always cold and she can't really help it. We get frustrated with it though because we live in Texas, its higher than 80 outside. And Meme will wake up in the morning with just her silk night gown and go turn her oven on in the kitchen with the door open to 350! Right before I go in to make breakfast which makes it miserably hot in there. We literally put a space heater in her room that she refuses to use, she refuses to use her electric blanket or get dressed in her warmer clothes. She only wants the entire house to feel like the pit of hell. She is adamant that everything stays exactly how she likes it. Meaning clutter everywhere, which for example in the kitchen it is extremely hard to work in because of this and she can't cook anymore anyways. Her family has told her that she needs to let go, and let other people feel comfortable in the house too, and if she can't cooperate then they might have to have a professional take care of her or put her in a nursing home. So anyways. I'm here because I almost had a melt down this morning and was in tears because of my frustration. I never show Meme but man she can make you feel like crap and she doesn't even know it. I really never saw myself in this situation and I don't know the best way to handle some of these isssues. Does anyone have experience dealing with this? How do I just stick it out without getting to the point that I have a meltdown?

Tldr: my gf's grandmother is not easy to care for and I don't want to loose my cool.",28Apr2020,1
535,"Last week I matched with this guy I went to high school with on tinder. He’s 23/M and I’m 23/F and we started talking again and decided we wanted to be friends with benefits during this time. We both live by ourselves and are working remote so we decided we would start this week. So yesterday, Monday, was the first time we had hooked up. I’ve only had sex with one person, and it had been over 7 months since I last had sex. So I got all excited, shaved, and got ready to have sex with this guy from high school. So he comes over and it’s kinda awkward because we hadn’t seen each other in 5 years. So we begin to have sex and in 90 seconds he came. I was a little surprised it was that quick. He said “wow this has never happened to me before, I don’t want you thinking this will happen every time”. I guess I just don’t know if this happens a lot, I mean the guy I had sex with my first time would only last like no more than 10 minutes. Could it just be he hasn’t had sex in a long time?

537,"Throwaway account!

Okay so I turned 18 a couple weeks ago, and my friend and I were chatting about just life in general and then we somehow got onto a debate of me being an incel, as one of my other friends mentioned it’s possible.

Whenever I go out to parties, I don’t really go with the goal of getting a girl I kind of just go to have a good time and make some new friends, but it’s been a bit over a year since I’ve even kissed a girl. My ex girlfriend being my last kiss. I don’t intentionally avoid getting with girls but I have used substances at parties that make me not realise when a girl is showing interest in me.

Truth be told I’m very scared to go kiss someone again because A) it’s gonna be shit since it’s been so long and B) I’ve literally taken so long that I’m too nervous to try and go in for a kiss, I feel like a creep

Am I an incel? Any advice?",28Apr2020,1
538,"I used to have a really close friend. But since he used to be a playboy, he told his friends “he was with me for my hot girlfriends.” And I started having grudge towards him because he bad mouthed me of course. But a month after that I heard he went to jail. And he sent me a request on Instagram after getting bail (6 months later) but I didn’t accept it fearing my boyfriend. We have kissed once, soy boyfriend knows that and I was scared of judgement and trouble. But I really wanna ask him how he’s doing w his life because I’m sure he must be terrible with everybody belittling him now. His parents had abandoned him too from the time i known him. Is it bad of me to text him how’s he doing? Or should I not? Also, should I let my boyfriend know of every damn move I make?

541,"I (16F) have been riding this pony for over 1.5 years now, I loan her maybe 6 times a week and we've gotten better as a team and I've trained her a lot of new stuff. The fact is that I really love this horse and really, really don’t want to give her up. The problem is that shes a small pony (around 135cm or 13.1hh) I won't grow any hight anymore and am perfectly fit to ride her. 

Even with this great sotustion I often fantasize about riding an actual horse sized horse (ideally 165-180cm 16-17hh) and feel really stuck, especially in jumping, since it would be unfair to ask the pony to jump anything over 90 cm. She's great at dressage and that's what keeps me sane at the moment, because I feel thats the only thing we're at the same level with the other riders in our stable team. But to sum it up, I would really like to ride a big horse that has more potental for  both dressage and jumping.

The thing is that even if I don’t own the pony and the owner could find a new rider, she wont. The pony is a total asshole and is manely a one-person horse, if I quit riding her she will be sold and I'm scared she will be sold to a bad home that abuses her or that she'll never find a good home again. Also due to her small size, I'm scared she'll go to a clueless child and all my hard work will be for nothing.

I will ride her untill the end of this year for sure because i'm still in my ""pony years"" but I don't know what I'm doing after that. I've talked with my parents, but they just tell me to go with the flow and nake decisions when it's relevant. I feel like I need to get a peace of mind, because this is one of the biggest causes of stress for me  at the moment. 

So, what should I do? Do I continiue on the pony or think about looking for a new horse to loan in the future. 

TLDR: the pony I loan or ""rent"" is really nice but really small and I would really like to ride a bigger horse. I'm just scared to quit on the pony in case she'll never find a good home again and if that happened I'd blame myself until I died.",28Apr2020,1
542,"So my ex and I broke up a month ago. We had alot of arguments during our break up.

She always kept things from me and always talked to boys behind my back. She was always doing shit with guys and was lying saying that it was lie so she wouldn't have to deal with the aftermath.

But she now always made fun of me for not being s relationships, made fun of my weight. And just turned conversations into arguments. She told me she was playing with me and never really loved me.

I used to miss her but I don't anymore. The way how she has been acting made me not want her anymore. And plus, she says she always had boyfriends, like every week. So why should I even chase her?

So, now told me she wants to be with me. Even tho she never said it, it's pretty obvious that she misses me and I guess regrets breaking up with me.

I really don't know. I don't want to deal with her mess but I also want to give her another chance. I really don't know.",28Apr2020,2
543,"I (F19) have been crashing with my partners (F21, M22//we’re polyamorous) for a week or so, for reasons not related to this. Before, when I would just visit, I would notice some tension between them but never enough to sour the visit, but enough for me to go “something doesn’t feel right”, you know? Now that I’ve been in the same house with them for the past week, I’ve been catching on more and more just how... “not-okay” things are between them. 

I don’t want to divulge too much information on their situation beyond that, because its not for me to tell. In short, the way my girlfriend treats my boyfriend isn’t okay. My boyfriend, that night with me in the room for emotional support, decided to bring the treatment up and stand up for himself. He brought this up to her calmly and she got extremely defensive. After a while of talking, and things getting really tense, he finally told her that he wasn’t sure if he can be with someone who keeps treating him the way she does.

After he said that, she hurt herself and cried to him that she would rather die than live without him.

My boyfriend and I were terrified. 

Things spiraled from there and I had to take her to the ER to get stitches for the injury. She told the nurse that she didn’t want a psychiatric evaluation, and I made the mistake of not stepping up and voicing that she needed one. (I severely fucked up there, I know). 

I gave her my support to her throughout the ER trip, and for the rest of the night. When we got back, my boyfriend had a breakdown and said he didn’t think he could have handled the situation had I not been there. 
I’m still trying my hardest to support both of them right now.

Two days have passed and they seem to be doing great, but I’m still extremely shell shocked. I’m angry that she did that, I’m furious that she treats my boyfriend the way that she does, I’m heartbroken that my boyfriend had to go through that. I’m scared that it will happen again, and I don’t know when it will.

I know I had no place in that situation, their relationship is between them, but I keep going back to that night and I keep getting really anxious whenever I see either of them. I want to leave and go back home to try and take care of myself, but I’m terrified she’ll do something like this again or even hurt him. I’m scared for my boyfriend as well, what if this happens again and I’m not there to be there for Him? For the both of them? 

I feel like leaving at this time would be reckless, but I desperately need to take care of myself after that.

546,"I’m the first child and oldest sibling of three. I grew up with my half brother and sister on my moms side and my other half brother lives with my dad who I’d see 3-5 times a year, now closer to once a year. 

Unfortunately, my mom raised me very differently than my siblings. I had a rough home life so I moved out at 17, left my hometown, and spent as little time visiting as possible because I resented my mom. My siblings were still pretty young so I didn’t get to develop a strong foundation while they went through high school because I left. 

I’m 26 now. My oldest brother is now 20 and just got his EMT license. My sister is now 18 and is in  college for nursing. They still live in my hometown which is 3 hours away from where I currently live. My youngest brother is 16 and still in high school. He lives 2 hours away with my dad. 

Because of responsibilities, I can’t exactly make daily or weekly visits. I visit once a month, but have so many people to visit that I usually only spend a few hours with them. Plus, my family doesn’t see me often so they all ask about my life which takes so much time away from me spending the quality time to learn about my siblings lives. 

I’ve never been good at being super close to family. I barely know my extended family, I grew up in a divorced home, it never bothered me that I only see my family every now and then, I’m certainly not the type to call my mom and chat every day like many people I know. This is because of any negative feelings, it just simply never bothered me. I know they love me and that’s always been good enough to me. 

My siblings think I hung the moon. They love me so much even though I’ve always been a distant figure in their lives. And trust me, I love them just as much. It makes me tear up typing this. I badly want to develop a closer relationship with each of them, I just don’t know how. I want to do things with them, or be the person they feel they can confide anything to, but I don’t even know where to begin. 

I was living across the country and really loved it, but I moved back to be closer to them before everyone gets older and goes their separate ways. I don’t want to miss out on this precious time. Does anyone have some advice to help me out on this? Books, podcast, personal anecdotes...anything is appreciated.

I’m not sure when the switch happened but I find myself waiting for his replies and getting excited when I see that he’s typing. Maybe it’s because I’m lonely and stuck in quarantine? I hope it’s not, he deserves better than that. 

The biggest problem that I run into is that I have a really hard time picking up signals through text. Maybe he also likes me? Do I tell him my feelings? I’m afraid of making it weird with him, or just turning him away. I’d love to just remain friends with him but I can’t deny my feelings for wanting a little bit more.

Another issue is that we live in different states. This seems really difficult to manage in my mind because I know that I won’t be able to move.
I’ve written out a draft for a text that I think I could send, but like I said before, I’m scared. Should I go through with it, and is there anything else I should say?

552,"Yes, I know that title sounds like the most stupid question ever. Here's the thing. 

I (14F) bought Animal Crossing so I could play with friends and make cool islands like what I saw on the internet. When we got the game, I was playing first and I set up the island and everything, but I forgot to save. Because my brother (7M) started crying to play on the game ""because it's his switch"" (1st thing in this situation that he cried for.) Since he took the game at the point in the very beginning before K.K. Slider shows up and the game saves with the checkpoint, everything in my island disappeared and he started his own island. 

When I got it back, I realized that everything had been reset and I yelled at him (not knowing that the reason was because I didn't save) and I reset it myself so it was my island again. Then my brother figured out and started crying AGAIN. But this time it went on for hours, and my mom has migraine problems that get triggered by loud noises (which most times end up being my brother) and so she told me to give the island back to him. And so I reculantly did, and now *he's* the Island Representative (2nd thing here he cried about). By that, it means that the entire island's progress depends on *him* doing the damn tasks and upgrading the island. But he's seven, and he doesn't want to do any of that. 

I really want our island to get somewhere, but if I go on his account and do things he gets mad at me and sells everything in my house. And when I tell my parents about it, nothing happens, and when he tells my parents about something menial I did (like getting rid of the campfire in front of his house) I get yelled at. This is pretty normal to happen, I know, but the thing is that when he cried to be the Representative, he *also* cried to get another game of his own (Smash Bros, 3rd thing) and he doesn't even play that. 

I rarely ask for expensive things, or rather these days I don't ask for things at all, and this is the first time in a long time that I actually got something I wanted but it went straight to my brother. I'm sick of this. I know that this is going harsh on my brother since he's 7 but I want an island I can be proud of and show my friends. And I want my game back. And I want to do it without my brother crying to my parents and me getting yelled at. So here's where the advice column comes in, and where I found that this shouldn't go in the ACNH subreddit. How should I reset the game without him taking advantage of the fact that my parents give in after 2 tears from the eye? Or is it even worth it at all, and I'm just being a stereotypical older sibling? Sorry this got kinda long, but I hope to see your answers soon!",28Apr2020,1

Well, I'd better explain or summarize the situation. When 2020 began and for the first time in my life I downloaded a dating app, OKC, so I didn't expected too much but when I read her profile, and without looking first at her pics (only a couple and nothing ""hot"" or sexy) I texted her, we matched and talked A LOT, I mean we talk every day since then. Having a lot in common too (same movies and books taste, also music and politics, etc)

We were able to hang out about five times (She's not a very social person) , nothing fancy or big plans. We both are quite and pretty calm people, enjoy ice creams, a cup of coffee, concerts and museums. She's also a very reserved person who takes her precautions when meeting ""strangers"", for example she told me that she never go to the house of a man she barely know, same as enter a car, she needs to know the person for what I understand so in those 2 months I had an absolutely crush on her. When she finally invited me to her place to help her with a few houseworks the quarantine strikes (and in my country is a strict one).

During the quarantine we keep talking everyday ( she messages me too if I send nothing to her) , we shared movies, series, online concerts and all that stuff. Even a videocall but for god sake I can't flirt with her, and I dont know why, but I think is because I really like her but I dont know if she likes me...Yeah, I know, I look like a teenager it's incredible, but it's like I have a kind of fear of screw this up because she's a really incredible and awesome person.

I basically don't understand if she really likes me.  She didn't respond directly to the times I was able to ""flirt"" or said something nice to her (but she didn't ""cut"" me either, so I understand she didn't mind ). If anybody could give me and advice I'd appreciate.

PS: Other aspects of her: I realized that despite the fact that she is an independent and strong woman with a great character (she traveled to many parts of the world alone) she's also very embarrassing and blushes easily at certain face-to-face encounters or talking to certain topics. Anyway I've alredy told to her that I like her in a couple of ocation she took it nice but she didn't reply to the compliment (the only time that I dated someone older than me happened the same, didnt reply the compliment but we ended up together). She's also dealing with a congenital disease, what irritates her most is that she won't allow her to travel when she has a relapse.",28Apr2020,2

But what I didn’t know, is that his profile picture and cover photo was him from five or six years ago. So he was clearly trying to appear younger than what he is. The only reason I added him back was because I saw he used to go to my school. But I didn’t realize that he had graduated in 2012. He then started asking about how “innocent” I am, and weird stuff like that. I told him I was only 17 and he said it didn’t matter cause I “seem pretty mature anyway.” I started getting weirded out cause he kept saying I was beautiful and innocent, but he would take it slow cause he “didn’t want to scar me” I just stopped responding to him and he hasn’t tried to contact me again.

562,"I'm very definitely not proud of any of this and I want to change but I just don't know how. I live in a shared apartment but my mother pays my rent and supports me.

It's a bit more difficult because due to a disability I have to work from home and, long story short, it needs to be at something like contract or freelance work (for actual medical reasons). There are no words for how much I wish I could just GET A JOB or do SOMETHING that isn't sitting at a desk trying to motivate myself to do something boring without a deadline or even a client yet, but that isn't an option for me. Or if there is a deadline I deal with it badly, procrastinating until it's almost too late and then being almost paralyzed by anxiety. I'm training for a profession that should work but the training is self-paced and, well, see above. This course should have taken 6 months tops. Instead it's taken 2 years. I do a few odd jobs on the side but nowhere NEAR what I need to. I'm ashamed to say it but I watch Netflix and do crafts projects all day when I should be trying to make a living. And if I don't think about the time and resources I'm wasting, I'm happy doing that and not depressed or anything (not proud of that fact).

And I've tried going all psychological on myself, reading books about what's going on in my head. I've looked for books on failure to launch, but there's only stuff for parents, not for kids who are trying and failing so far. I've also tried (and continue to try) to just stop thinking and DO things, but not much progress there either. I know I should stop indulging myself and that I have self-control and should use it to study and get clients already, but somehow...

I need some actual concrete advice on what to do. I'm posting this on my throwaway because I wouldn't be surprised if people came down pretty hard on me, but I'm kind of in desperate need of some concrete steps and I thought I would ask.

564,"So I’m a guy (17) but one of my best friends since I was about 14 is a girl. It’s completely platonic between us, I genuinely think of us as siblings and we spent a ton of time together - stay over at each others’ houses, hang out all summer and constantly in school etc. We just get along really well and I sort of thought we’d be friends all our lives because of that. 

I moved schools in September to go to a new sixth form, because I hated our school and so did she. Me and a couple friends moved. She hates it so I tried to convince her to go through the process of moving, but she’s an extremely anxious person and didn’t want to go through the process of interviewing and starting over etc so I let it be. when I moved (and one of our close mutual friends moved with me) everything seemed fine for a while - we still met every weekend pretty much and talked on social media regularly. I got her a job at my new work, but she wasn’t able to start because it then closed due to the quarantine situation. Even with the job, I was kind of excited to be working together because it’s fun, right??? I thought it would certainly improve my shifts to joke around with my friend now and then, and be able to travel to and from together, but (while she was grateful to me for telling them about her, helping her to make a CV) she didn’t seem too pumped about it. I thought, it makes sense she wouldn’t be excited to work and didn’t think much of it. 

But during this whole quarantine situation it’s been pretty much radio silence from her. She talked to me once about a problem she had with her boyfriend, and occasionally sends me something she finds funny, but I’ve been in constant contact with other friends and barely speak to her. I have no idea what’s going on in her life. I know she was not having the best time and that she hated school even more now, and was having problems at home, but I don’t know what’s up right now. 

Any other time I might send a message asking why we don’t talk as much but if I’m honest, it’s so out of character that it feels like she’s doing it on purpose and it’s pissing me off actually - why do I want to keep messaging her if she doesn’t reply? She posts on her story all the time conversations she’s having with other people, so I know for sure it’s me. What annoyed me today was her posting on her story about moving to a sixth form with a girl she’s friends with, when we used to talk all the time about moving to the one I go to and she never properly took any steps towards it. 

I don’t want to be sensitive, but it definitely hurt my feelings to feel like she’s avoiding me when I have no idea what I could have done. We used to be very close and shared a lot with each other, but it seems she has no interest in being friends with me anymore. We’ve never had an argument before and I feel like, probably because I’m a guy and she’s a girl, this whole thing is worse because maybe I’ve done something and it’s gone over my head. There’s nothing I hate more than feeling like I’m chasing someone for a friendship and it shouldn’t be on me to carry the whole thing. But maybe I’ve done something wrong?",28Apr2020,1
565,My nephew turns 21 thia weekend. We we're spose to go to Vegas. Now what?,28Apr2020,1
566,"I matched with this guy I met off of tinder a month ago. We initially hit it off really well through text but then noticed he started to fade. Once I noticed he started to fade, I asked if he was interested anymore and if so why he just didn't have the guts to say he wasn't. He said he was interested but continued the same behavior. Even with this knowledge, I would eagerly hit him up and start conversation and finally asked him what he wanted with me because he kept showing me mixed signals. He told me that he'd like sex, a relationship, marriage, etc. This was obviously BS but I wanted to believe we had a connection. I ultimately told him that I'd like to have sex just to be able to finally meet him.
​


Something I noticed while initially talking to him is that he was super vague about EVERYTHING. We had a lot in common when it came to interests but when it came to his personal life - nothing. I've had a history of men who were secretly in relationships or hiding something so this really bothered me. We connected on social media and the snapchat he gave me had his full name and then found his fb and cybertalked him. However, once I noticed he started pulling away again the cyberstalking went to the extreme.
​


My intense need to find out what he was hiding fueled my obsessive searches. So what did I find out ?That his father went to prison for sexually abusing his sister and ironically for stalking his wife. So its clear that he hid some of his background because he didn't want the possibility of going into that topic, and I was relieved to find out he wasn't hiding anything else. By the way, ALL of this I figured out by reverse searching his phone number and found his address and relatives. I did like FBI level research on this guy, all fueled by my obsession to see what he was hiding and I found it. I've gotten obsessive over guys before but never have taken it this far. I've never acted on anything with his info such as going to his house or anything, but this is very alarming behavior for me.
​



Additionally, even after finding out that info, I still longed to wonder why I wasn't good enough. So I made a fake tinder account to see how he'd treat this fake girl, to see if I was any different. He always told real me that we'd meet up and didn't, so I believe he was just playing me all along, however with the fake acct he asked to meet her this upcoming weekend. I then deleted my account because I wouldn't trick him into meeting her but the fact that I did all this.. Is not healthy at all.
​


Anyway, I find this very concerning and besides therapy am wondering what other methods I can use to avoid this behavior in the future? This is the first time this ever happened but I'm really worried to see what this would look like if it really got out of hand.
​


TLDR; met a guy off of tinder about a month ago, due to suspicion about his personal life I became way too obsessive that I ended up finding all of his personal info online and family history, and also made a fake tinder account to see how he would treat someone else differently. PS I fully realize I went to crazy town for a guy I didn't even meet.",28Apr2020,0

We’re both lgbt males.

I’m a bit reluctant because I liked him for a while and he said things would stay the same as friends, but when I’d try to maintain the friendship, he’d stop initiating conversation and made excuses when I offered to hang out. He would respond to my messages though. He eventually said it felt weird to hang out and was only comfortable with texting. Sent the occasional text after.

I abruptly stopped talking to him for a couple of months and now he’s starting to initiate conversation with me and he asked me to hang out. I don’t get it, I feel like I wasted my time trying to keep a friendship that he seemed to not have cared less about, and now it’s like he doesn’t realize how much he had hurt me when I tried to keep things going. What’s the reasoning behind this? I don’t expect to date him as he said I’m not his type, but still, shit hurts.",28Apr2020,1

To cut a long story short I have been talking to them for months now, I am crushing. Its been sexual. Like everyone in their mid 20s in this day and age we shared explicate material. We talk all day every day.  Today we added each other on facebook where I found out they are in a relationship, but does not list the partner. For me, even though it hasn't been physical contact they have been cheating with me. So it brings up the question, should I pursue? 

I asked them if they are in a relationship for confirmation and i am waiting on a reply while thinking about my next steps.

A) If its mutual is it okay? People are not property right?

B) Are they trust worthy? Well obviously not but maybe they are not happy in their current position?

C) You could seriously hurt the other person in their relationship. But shouldn't you think of number one?

I am torn here. Personally I lived my life being honest and genuine. Or at least to the best i can be honest and genuine. I am crushing here and want to take what I want.

These have been caused by a medication I used to take for my IBS (literally says the side effects of the meds) and I’ve tried everything to fix it. Doctors keep saying it’s anxiety. I’m not denying I have anxiety - all this is definitely causing anxiety and IBS is triggered by it sometimes so I have taken medication for it in the past (which is unfortunately in my records and now doctors only look at that and dismiss possible serious problems). Every doctors I’ve been to and every ER visit I’ve made for chest pains have been dismissed because of anxiety. Tests don’t show anything alarming and the amount of times I’ve heard a doctor say “oh you’re young, you have nothing to worry about” is very concerning to me now.

574,"Okay, Here's a little context behind this:

My friends and I play a game called ""Ponytown."" For those of you who don't know what Ponytown is, here's a brief explanation of it.

*""Ponytown is an online game for bronies about ponies building a town. It is, of course by its name, a My Little Pony based game despite having almost no MLP features despite being about ponies.""*

If that wasn't good enough, look it up yourself. You'll see what I mean. Anyway, onto the actual story.

So I'm in a region in Ponytown, which is basically the Ponytown version of armies. I have a friend who is at a higher level than me in the region. She's had a person copying her skin for a while and soon that person began to send threats to her, such as ""You deserve this"" and ""All of TSG (name of our region) will suffer."" Keep in mind, we have NO idea who this person is and my friend is a very nice person and hasn't hurt anyone before. Originally, we were confused about who this person was and why they were doing such a thing to a nice person. Then one day, this person had the balls to say ""Well, I'll leave you alone if you send me some 'nice pics',"" Which can obviously be considered as nudes. My friend is a MINOR, which makes this way worse.

Then, earlier today this person somehow found my friends discord and contacted them. My friend sent screenshots of what he said. He said things like 'You didn't think I would find you, you little slut?"" and ""You better send me those nudes."" ""If not, you better go kill yourself"". Only that she immediately blocked them after. We know with the whole coronavirus thing going on, people won't be able to travel. However, we suspect that if he's able to find out her real name (yes, her on god real name,) and her DISCORD, he'll be able to find out her address and find a way to her. That's where we get worried. I also neglected to mention that we attacked them after the whole picture thing, so we suspect he may go after US once he's done bothering my friend. If anyone needs screenshots so you know we're not faking this, I'll be glad to send them to you.

Please, someone, help us. I'll give updates on what happens next, but we're scared and afraid of what'll happen to us and our friend.",28Apr2020,3

I (F) am in this friend group with roughly 5 other people (all M). I've been with them for years and we're considered the nerds of the school and it's been great. We made jokes with each other, we were all nice and everything was good, but last year this guy joined our group since he liked the same game as the other guys. He was kind of popular and well-known by others but we didn't care.

He seemed nice and genuine, but all through last year and this year, the new guy has constantly been picking on me, physically and verbally as well as sometimes my best friend in the group, but the other guys saw it as a joke and were just watching.

I even had bruises on my arm that I showed my best friend and one other guy and told them how he was saying awful things that really hurt. They said they would talk to him and they did and he said he would top.

But he didn't. He didn't hit as much but he would still treat me awfully and now exclude me outside of the group and make plans without me.

This year we have discord and everything was ok. Here and there that guy would say stuff directly towards me, but I wouldn't respond or just say something like  ""ok?"" but recently I've noticed the others haven't really cared for me or answered my messages on the group chat lately, and the mean guy would just send some stupid GIF or video to hide my messages.

My bestie and I asked the guy who also confronted the mean one if he had heard anything from the mean guy or had he said anything to them because it seemed like it but he told us to stop being paranoid and nothing was going on. My other friends have also started calling me 'useless' or 'helpless' or 'annoying' and it's really frustrating.

Every time I would get good news, only my best friend would be happy for me, all the others would either ignore or say something like 'good job?' or 'um ok?'.

My best friend and I decided to test and see if it's all in my head or if they treat me differently so I posted on the chat that I got a new guitar and no one responded but they had all seen it. My friend posted that he had got a new keyboard, and sure enough, a whole spiral of questions just emerged out of nowhere.

I've been mainly ignoring them and nothing has happened. They haven't tried to get in contact with me or anything.

What do you guys think I should do because I really don't want to leave these guys because I used to be so happy with them, I don't have many other friends/friend groups to hang out with and I don't want to let this one guy ruin it but at the same time, I'm so sick of it. I'm so torn and I feel like crying all the time because my friends aren't acting like true friends anymore.

580,"Okay for context me and my roommate let’s call him B were living with our third roommate whom I’ll refer to H. H has already graduated college and has a full time job but wants to move back home, me and B had no issue with that so we declined to renew our lease at our current apartment and the move out date is June 5th. The thing is now especially with covid-19 and with me and B getting most of our income from our university’s financial aid with part time student work on top of that, don’t make the 3x rent rule that the apartments in our area require even though we can afford the rent with what we earn monthly. Thus we can’t qualify for the apartments in our area. 

We talked to the leasing manager and she told us that we can get a guarantor or two to be able to help us qualify. Here’s where the issue lies, the guarantor has to make 6x the rent monthly in order to qualify ($939 x 6). B’s parents are in a bad financial situation and my parents don’t make enough. 

So essentially we have no one to go to for a guarantor, and in turn will have nowhere to live for the following year because I need to be able to attend university while B who’s graduating this semester needs to find a stable job. 

We looked at low income housing and they said no students are allowed. I would need to take out another student loan if I chose to live in student housing. And many other private landlords exclude students as potential tenants as well or require a co-signer which goes back the first issue of our parents not making enough. I looked into websites where a company can act as a stand in guarantor but with the added fees they charge we simply can’t afford it. 

I’m waiting for B’s response to the guarantor criteria at the moment as a sent the email to him this morning. After that we are going to contact the leasing manager again and ask if having multiple guarantors means that they don’t all need to make 6x the rent, just that their combined income will. 

I could really use some advice in trying to navigate this situation.

581,"I think my mum's gone crazy. 


So about a month ago, my mum (C) noticed that all the biscuits and chocolate bars were going missing. I have three siblings one of whom is a baby (M)and the other is 4(T) so she knew what they were eating. I am a teen and my brother (D) is 12 so it was likely one of us. C and my stepdad (P) only eat their own stuff.


 P decided to treat us and buy some gold bars. I ate one, T ate one, and D said he ate one. but the next day all of them (there were 6) were gone. I knew I didn't have any more than one because I had wanted to have another the next day. It started to get out of hand, 20 rich tea biscuits dissapearing overnight. D would not admit to it and P was punishing us both. Eventually they got taken away and we had to ask for them. To make matters worse D got caught lying on numerous occasions so that should have made it clear that he was lying not me!.


anyway, it's been a while since then and D still brings it up (like a guilty person) and treats are still locked up. Most days C won't let us have any which is weird since we're usually allowed one a day. P is an essential worker so he's out all day. Anyway, more things are going missing, grapes, ham, and more in ridiculous amounts. My brother has always been a bigger eater than me and now suddenly he's lost his appetite during dinner. Suspicious much? C has even voiced on numerous occasions how it's obvious some things are him( such as the ham) .


Obviously this is upsetting for me because the food is dissapearing in a time when it is scarce.  I'm being punished pretty badly, and yelled at which gives me anxiety and I hate shouting a lot. 


Today, my mum left for a walk, I asked if I could have a snack while she was gone and this is how it went

Though my state isnt the best, I love our town. Now, we are thinking about buying a house. We want to have kids a few years after we buy our house. I'm concerned though about our kids attending a bad public school. When I went through public high school, my school had a ton of AP classes, finance classes, trips, etc. My husband went to school in this state and he's said his school didn't have all those opportunities. My husband doesn't want our kids to go to private school but also I'm worried about the quality of education they'll get here. I know that I'm probably 2-5 years away from having kids and they won't enter the school system until they're like 5 so that gives the schools 10 years. They may be better in 10 years. Is it crazy to decide whether to stay here based off my kids' potential education?
EDIT: I would like to add that even though our high schools were way different, my husband and I went to the same college and honestly his job is way better than mine. So I get that you can still have a successful future without attending the best public school.",28Apr2020,1
588,"Sorry, this is a long one.

My mom and I (42F) have a good relationship, but not, like, best friends or anything. My dad passed away almost eight years ago and she’s lived alone since then. She’s introverted so she normally doesn’t mind being alone and at home a lot of the time, but she does have a social life that she is sad to be missing out on. I’m 42 and married, with two bonus kids, 16 and 19, who are with us 90% of the time because their mother works in health care and we don’t want them exposed to the virus. My husband and I are both still working full time, mostly from home but we do still need to go into the office sometimes. We’re both in manufacturing, so when we go into the office there are other people there. No one in any of our circles has tested positive for the virus, but I’m still very paranoid about catching it from an asymptomatic person and passing it along to my mom. I’ve told her this many times.

So my mom is the type of person that everything is always about her. When I call her (every day, sometimes FaceTime, but always at least a phone call) she’ll ask me how my day was and typically before I’m finished with the first sentence, she is not even listening and goes on about something in her life, usually that she’s already told me the day before and the day before that. Also, she’s always been this way (makes every story about her), but it has gotten more pronounced since my dad died because she doesn’t have him to talk to anymore. My dad was a very patient listener. I am sympathetic to this, so I don’t get upset with her when she does it, I just roll with the conversation the way she wants to have it. She’s not mean or toxic, just very self centered.

She is also very independent and capable. For 70, other than being overweight and pretty sedentary, she’s healthy, not diabetic nor does she have high blood pressure. She doesn’t need us to run errands for her day-to-day life.

Before the virus, we didn’t used to talk every single day. We’d text almost every day, but only talk a couple time a week, and see each other about once a week on average. Since I’m still very busy at work, my life has not changed much, so I didn’t change my phone call habits with her. I didn’t know that this made her upset until she blew up at me one day for being insensitive to her loneliness. I honestly didn’t even know she was feeling that depressed; she was not calling me either. So since then I’ve been calling her every single day (note: she still isn’t calling me), but she seems to be doing a lot better mentally, which is all I really care about.

Until today. It’s finally a beautiful day. Other than work and grocery shopping, the only thing my husband and I leave the house for is mountain bike riding. I’ve told my mom about the rides, I’m not hiding anything, but since we are out doing “social” things, she thinks we should also come over and visit her now. Is mountain bike riding essential? No I guess not, but we’re not coming into contact with people. She asked us to come over for a glass of wine on her deck and I told her no, with what I thought was a tactful explanation, but now she says she doesn’t want to talk to me. 

I have two older brothers who call her about once every week or so. They live out of state, so they don’t have the proximity I do. I asked them today to please give her a call to try and cheer her up. I feel like the burden of keeping her upbeat and happy is taking its toll on me. She tells me her neighbors kids come and visit and bring them home cooked meals, etc and it’s insensitive of me not to do the same.

Is there anything else I can say to her to try and make her understand where I’m coming from? Should I just wait and let her be angry and hope she comes to her senses (that didn’t work out for me last time, when she finally did take my phone call, she still railed at me for about a half an hour about not being sensitive or sympathetic to her situation, but I didn’t even know she was feeling that way!!!)

So, I (m24) have been painting my whole life. 

\[backstory\]

As long as I could remember, art was my lifeline. I grew up in a pretty shitty household and relied on art to get me through every difficult time in my life. 

However, because of my childhood trauma/household stufff etc. I never believed in myself growing up. It was a silly and completely improbable concept to actually pursue art after highschool. Everytime it crossed my mind as an option, I'd scoff it off or fantasize about it the same I would about dragons or whatever, it was completely unreal...but still cool to think about. My family couldn't afford college and because, again, I didn't believe myself, it seemed like a waste of my time to even try for an art degree. 

So, I travelled after highschool overseas and ended up deciding to move back to my hometown city and take a stab at community college. I started working in special ed to pay for community college and LOVED (still do) working that field. So, after awhile, I dropped out of community college and decided I'd make a career out of special ed (had the opportunity to work upwards instead of finishing my degree).  

During this whole time, I was in a pretty toxic relationship (mirroring my household stuff) for quite a few years. This relationship in combination with already a lack of belief in myself, brought me to where I wasn't even producing work sporadically anymore. I stopped painting all together. 

Of course, the hunger for creating art never goes away. It eats at you. Begs to be released. So, I eventually collapsed. I realized I had no idea who I was, what I wanted, and why I just didn't feel like a person. I felt empty. So, I (am proud to say) ended that relationship and moved out to Denver to look into a college that offered an Art Therapy degree. I figured I could combine my love for special ed and also produce art. Woohoo! 

To shorten it up, moved to Denver, landed a nannying job for a child with special needs, which allowed me to open up free time to paint... while I ""considered"" college longer. This was a great time for me artistically. I painted a shitton. I landed my work in some galleries. I sold a few pieces. Hired a lifecoach for a hot minute. And even sold a series of commissioned work that was about two months of my rent at the time. Well, this freaked me out. The closer I got to seeing my potential, the more freaked out I became. I came up with a plan to travel for a year and paint the country. (Looking back, I see now that this was 100% an escape strategy because I was terrified of my own success).

My one year journey flopped and I ended up living a sort of beatnik, free traveler, lifestyle for about two years. \[Completely seperate tale, I am a transman and during this two years of travel was when I began my hormone therapy and physically ""transitioned"" as well... so it was a wild two years.\] During these two years, art kept calling at me. It would beckon me into painting regularly for a few months. Then I'd drop it for a few months. I would paint a few amazing paintings and then not touch my supplies for four months. I met my partner on the road and we ended up traveling a bit longer and eventually went back to her hometown in WI. I got into mixology (like, fancy drink making) there and ended up training under a rad mixologist in a touristy kinda town. Painted a mural for him. But that was the extent of my artist work done in Wisconsin. 

Cut to, my partner and I have settled down a bit in Asheville, NC. We're setting some roots. It's the first time in my entire life I've actually felt stable, grounded, and secure. 

I'm finally in a healthy relationship and living a pretty stable life, I think I've been relying on weed and cigarrettes to silence my need to paint though. I've been working on quitting both during quarantine and am finding that my desire to paint/creativity/passion for life is coming back the more I stay off both of them.

So, now, at 24... I am currently unemployed because of COVID19 (still working in special ed full-time regularly) and I finally am getting a glimpse of what my life could be like I achieved this dream. I just wake up and paint all day, play some drums, and then paint more. It's bliss.  It's freaking me out though because I have never fully admit to myself that I do want to be a full-time painter. My job might be re-opening soon and I'm getting anxious about losing this time with my art... 

I am letting myself dream of having a studio. Of painting from morning to night as my occupation. Of inspiring others with my stories and my artwork. Hell, even the business/finance side of it sounds like a fun thing to learn. But, I am terrified shitless. It's not that I'm afraid I'm going to fail or embarrass myself or anything like that. I am genuinely scared of my own success. I'm scared I'll abuse power or fall off the deep-end or something. It's like I'm afraid to let myself have that much freedom or happiness or something? So, I just stay safe in my little room and hide my art from the world. 

I ordered a book online about how to start working toward making art a full-time thing. So, that was my first step toward actually considering it realistically. 

Looking for any sort of advice, recommendation, re-directions... don't know where to go from here, I suppose.",28Apr2020,1
595,"I (19f) recently buzzed my hair while away at college. Due to COVID-19, I decided to move back home with my parents. I am bisexual, and my mother has always had trouble accepting that.

Last week, I updated my Facebook profile picture with a picture of my buzzed hair. She started crying and said that I shouldn’t have done it.

597,"Before a year ago my dad would never touch alcohol, even on special occasions. Addiction is common in our family and he actively avoided it. 

Between a stroke and diabetes he's had severe 
health problems my entire life. In every memory I have of him, he's been extremely sick and miserable, and developed some personality disorders after his stroke. Obviously, this is not the kind of person who can afford to have an addiction (not that anybody can, but he's particularly at risk). 

About a year ago, he bought his first bottle of rum, and every day since then for he's gone through a new bottle faster and faster. Now he can to through an entire bottle in a week, drinking nearly every night. 

My dad is a very distant and secretive person. He helps me with my problems, but I don't even know how to address this with him. 

I think it's gotten worse during quarantine. He's helping to engineer testing for the virus, so his job's been particularly stressful. But when he gets drunk, he goes on long rambling soapbox speeches and acts completely irrationally.

Like I said, my dad has personality disorders and his temper can be very unpredictable. I'm the only person in my family he has a stable relationship with, so I feel like I'm the only one who can get through to him. But if I address this the wrong way, he'll only get angry with me and push me away.

603,"M22 here. New Account to rant and keep it Anon.

To me, she's very unmotivated and lazy and child-like. I can see that throughout the quarantine. All she ever does is wake up, eat, watches movies and games on her phone, and sleeps.
 
She's dropped out of college because I believe she never found an interest in whatever she majored in, which is fair.
She worked in a restaurant a few states away from our home before the quarantine. Living with her, I know she isn't exactly the brightest person.

But now she's in her mid 20s and it feels very odd living with her, I don't know why, but she constantly makes child like tantrum noises whenever anyone tries to consults her. We are an Asian household so I'm guessing that's why. But it's just that she doesn't really do anything in the house unless directly told to, and she often will not reply and continue to watch shows and stuff.

So, every now and then while on her phone, she starts tearing up and is visibly crying. When I ask her what is wrong, she usually says nothing or say that she's watching something sad.

However, a few times I've noticed that whenever this happens, she's actually texting someone. 
Also relationships for her don't work, my mom tries to get her together with someone through matchmakers and it doesn't work and often leads to arguments.
During the quarantine now, she sneaks out early every now and then to ""see friends"" but she doesn't talk to them according to herself.

To add, she speaks decently in asian languages whenever needed, it's just her English that really ticks me.

Not that she cannot speak English, it's just that she seems to have a very limited amount of vocabulary to say. Whenever she tries to defend herself or speak to me, it's sometimes absolute gibberish or ""penis"" or something a child would say.

Literally I think she really may be a 26(?) year old child which really freaks me out.

I really don't know what to do about her. I don't want to think that she is dumb and lazy and obnoxious. Does any one have any advice to help her? I don't want to constantly consult or even berate her. But she constantly gets on my nerves whenever something important is happening.

If she’s ever in the wrong, she’ll make up some story about how it was actually my step dad, and even though he knows it’s all made up he’ll just keep appeasing her with responses like ‘yes I know it was my fault.’ Etc. She’s threatened divorce a few times in the past, and she goes over to him to shout and berate him for no reason at all. This can last hours, and he doesn’t do anything. I’ve tried hinted a few times to stick up for himself, but he gets super defensive and says there’s nothing wrong and it’s just what happens in marriage. I told him it isn’t, and he got really annoyed and just started telling me I was wrong.

I’m too stupid to get it I guess. It looks fun. I tried sports, but I sucked at them too.

Is anyone else struggling HARD with work from home right now? I feel like everyone is talking about how much more efficient they are, and I’m just a complete failure.

I’m a business analyst, and the entire company has been working from home for about 6 weeks with no end in the near future (Ontario, Canada). When this first started, I was distracted by the news, but I had a little buffer time while my coworkers adjusted to remote work so it didn't matter much.

It’s been 6 weeks though, and when I sit down at my computer I just feel paralyzed, most days only accomplishing about 10% of what I should. I’m behind on all my projects. I’m drinking too much at night, staying up too late, reading reddit and the news, and avoiding work.

I woke up this morning shaking and it hasn’t stopped, spent some time in the bathroom thinking I would throw up. I don’t know anymore if I’m hungover or if it’s something else.

I live with my partner and we have a good relationship. I could talk to him about it but I don’t see how he could help, other than listen – and honestly I’m embarrassed.  I was on medication for anxiety last year, and I have some refills left which I’m thinking of going to the pharmacy to get filled, and start taking again.

I just need to 'flip the switch' and get to work.  Start being productive.  I can’t seem to actually accomplish it. I’m afraid I’m not going to have a job when this is all over, and it will be all my fault.

It gives me physical pain (headaches, feeling like throwing up, nausea) just thinking of keeping it up. Even worse when thinking about the exams.

At the same time I‘m feeling guilt if I wouldn’t do the midterm exams. Probably because my parents want me to do it.

I have tried posting my stuff on many subreddits to get started with a few customers (honestly I'll do anything at this point) and I have contacted many people who requested some art on a few subreddit. But I just don't seem to get any customer, I also have an Instagram but not many followers (most of them are my friends and they are not gonna buy my art anyway).

I'm 16 and that means that after 2 years I'll have my own bank account, my wish is that I would like to save my money (gifts from relatives on various occasions) and open my account using that money but I don't have a fixed pocket money and part time job for teens are not very common here nor could I do anything due to lockdown anyway and so the commission's are the only way for me to earn something.

The most frustrating part is that a few days ago someone wanted me to draw a game related stuff for them and I was really excited as it was my first commission ever but they backed out at the last moment saying that their mother isn't comfortable with sending money to a stranger, so they cancelled the order. And it's frustrating beyond point, it seriously killed my morale and it's irritating because I had to install a different program and do everything from scratch because my previous program wasn't suitable for bigger canvas. I really don't know what to do from here, I'm desperate to get some work and I'll make anything but I need customers for that, which I don't seem to get.

If you have any advice on how to proceed from here, I'll be really grateful .",28Apr2020,1
614,"I have two siblings and they keep using my stuff. I have acne and use this product that is really expensive, so I use very little of it, but its effective enough. I have been noticing that when my bottle should be up to 45% full, there was maybe 5-10% in it.

I dont even know who uses this much without damaging your skin. I have told them countless time to not use it, but they just use everything! My Makeup, my brush, my clothes, etc.
When I confront them they always say something along the lines off ""oh, but I like it"" or ""But you dont use it""

615,What are people’s general thoughts on trying to date someone when one person is in college and one person is in high school still. Is that a bad idea? Why or why not?,28Apr2020,1
616,"Okay, so for context: One of my friends lost his battle to depression just under two weeks ago. I (16m) didn't really talk to people until yesterday because I needed to process it all, though I told my friends to reach out if they needed anything. They didn't really, so I came back yesterday and started talking to them. 

Right, so I was talking to my friend (14f) and everything was great for the entire day. I've known her for over a year, and in that time I've talked her off the edge countless times, convinced her not to harm herself, woken up to countless breakdowns that somehow she only has when I go to sleep- it makes me incredibly anxious to wake up to paragraphs saying what she wants to do to herself and it's hard to deal with her mental health on top of my own, however, I still did so because I don't want anything bad to happen to her. I've also helped her out with multiple, multiple, short-lived and intense relationships (she's in a relationship right now). She has a psychiatrist, she lives with her moms and brother, has a lot of friends, but still only comes to me. That's all just context for last night.

This morning I woke up to, again, a breakdown; with her detailing how self-destructive she was, how hard she tried to find something to hurt herself, etc. I don't know why, but I guess I expected her to be a little more sensitive after my friend's passing (I told her what happened).

I really don't know what to do, I don't want anything to happen to her but I'm so tense talking to her, going to sleep, giving her advice... I don't know if I should distance myself, I've told her I'm not trained to give her advice, that she should talk to her mother or a professional but she gets cold and keeps responding with ""I know."" or something akin to that.

What should I do? I don't have a way to contact her family.

Edit: I am getting help for my own mental health, I have been for a few years, but it's still hard.",28Apr2020,2
617,"We were together for 1.5 years. When we first started dating he drunkenly referred to her as the one that got away and told me that it pained him to know that she was sleeping with someone else. He had been in another relationship after breaking up with her so it’s not like he hadn’t physically moved on himself.

Anyway, during our relationship I found out that he had asked her best friend about his ex’ relationship status and had sent his ex a link to an article titled “Why your type might actually be your ex-partner”. I confronted him and he claimed he had been drunk when he sent it, didn’t mean anything by it and begged for my forgiveness. So I forgave him but I always had this nagging feeling that it wouldn’t be the last time he would try to contact her.

A couple of days ago, I found out that he had reactivated his account on a social networking website that he had previously used to contact/meet up with other girls behind my back. So I decided to create a fake profile using her name and picture and he quickly took the bait. He sent her a long message in which he called her sweet names, mentioned his unregretful love for her, said he would like to “at least” be friends with her and even called her “my dear ~~her name~~”.

I immediately told him I was behind the profile and broke up with him. Then I sent a screenshot of the message to his ex and explained to her that he had sent it to a profile that he thought was hers (it was for her to read after all). She didn’t care at all, she just told me to tell him to stop contacting her (she’s had him blocked for two years).

So I passed on the message to him and he was absolutely livid. He accused me of identity theft, entrapment and breach of confidence. He didn’t give two shits about hurting my feelings, all he cared about was finding out exactly what I had told his ex and her feelings about it.

I realize it all sounds very immature but I honestly don’t regret doing it. If anything, I regret not doing it sooner as it would have spared me a lot of emotional pain. I should have stopped dating him as soon as he was showing signs of not being over his ex (or when he went behind my back with other girls but that’s another story) and that’s on me. I just really hope he’s learned a lesson. I know I definitely have.

620,"Good morning Reddit, I hope you are having a better morning than me. So to jump right into it, about a year ago I met a guy that I really like. I felt like I had an instant connection with him, like his presents in a situation was simply too amazing to ignore. So powerful and almost shocking, that my face would go completely red whenever he came in. Thinking straight? Forget about it. This guy had me freaking out before I even knew his name, and knowing it didnt help lol.

Anyways we got closer and I ended up calling him to come pick me up when I got kicked out of my dads house. Which is part of the problem I am having.

My dad had been panicking over the CoronaVirus, and he started to loose his mind over it. One day he suddenly took my 2 siblings and I to Nevada from California, telling us to trust him. He made it sound innocent like we would come back in the morning if things didnt get any worse. (Spoiler alert, He lost his shit) He started saying that they were going to start gassing the sick like they did in natzi Germany, and how we had to take the backroads in order to avoid the police. His master plan was that we were going to break into a house in Wyoming and squat until this whole thing was over. I really dont know how to explain how scary it was. He talked about how we would army crawl over the boarder if we had to, and he how was going to give me a gun so I could watch his 6. He said that the government was going to starve us in our house and the marshal law would soon start taking affect to help with the new world order. He looked at me dead in my eyes and asked me if I wanted to watch my siblings starve to death. It's crazy. At some point he even demanded that we take the off roads because a song on the radio said 'take the road less traveled by' and according to him 'Some people know what going on but they cant just come out and say it. So they have to use their positions of power to get there message out there.' It was hard to look at my dad and not know how to help him,

[[Side note, he also took us down a long icy road at night. We were sliding and my siblings were really scared. We got into an argument where he took my phone and threatened me with something violent but I cant remember what he saud. I had no idea where I was, and he was going to kick me out of the car. I just really felt like venting about that.]]

What the fuck is a 19 year old supposed to do with all that?

Thats not even the issue that I am having. See I have never really been in healthy relationships whether it be with family or otherwise. My relationship with my mother is beyond terrible, and due to my parents controlling nature, I was kept the most shelter kid in the world. At 17 they would watch me through the window as I went to get the mail kind of controlling. My dad had cameras in the house kind of controlling. So I wasnt able to make any other connections.

I'm used to everything falling apart, and the people I trust leaving me. Even when they arent, I sometimes fall into that helpless 'I've already fucked up, they are going to leave' feeling that causes your stomach to sink. I try not to, but it's like getting hit with a bat. At this point it doesnt feel like getting hit is a matter of if, but when. Crying about it wont change the pain, if anything it will make it hurt more. So I brace myself for impact, because it feels better to be prepared and wrong then to land on my face once again. 

I get really panicky and I start feeling like the world is ending. Everything I do is wrong, and there is something wrong with everything I say. That little voice   basically says 'Of course they are leaving, why wouldnt they? I'm such a fucking disgusting horrible person' and I start feeling gross. Like my skin is suddenly crawling with every bad decision I've ever made. And finally it gets to the point where I want to push him away. Like im so intensely scared of losing someone that I dont even feel like I deserve anyway, that the only thing I can think to do it try to run away. To be completely by myself so I dont have to trust anyone. 

I'm a loving person, but loving people has only ever hurt me. I expect it now. I want to love him so much. I want to have a normal life with him, but I dont know how I could ever explain this to him without messing up. Please. Please please please I need advice. I just feel confused and really lost in all this. There is ssssoooo much that I didnt even put here. It just feels like too much at times.",28Apr2020,1

624,"To keep a story succinct, I’ll break it down without trying to sound mean or disrespectful. 

In Dec 2019, My sister asks me if her boyfriend can *temporarily* stay with us because he apparently has “issues with his family/people” so he left from wherever he was staying.  

She tells me it’s for one month. My sister is kinda naive, but I take her word for it, it’s not my problem but I’ll be nice and allow it but one thing about me is that I don’t like being told one thing and another thing happens. It’s aggravating and I have very little tolerance for it. 

I tell him you are required to pay me 20% (1,400) of the rent to stay for the month (Which is extremely generous considering studio apartments in my area are at least $600+). He should be taking this time to plan his next moves seriously, life isn’t free and everyone has their own problems. If issues persist with his people then he should move out and find his own place to live. That’s at least how I view the situation because you can’t stay here for an extended period of time just because of your own personal issues. 30 days go by and I’m not seeing any of that and absolutely nothing. He’s still in my house, sleeps all day, quit/lost his job seemingly. I tell my sister he needs to find a job or leave. He brought all of his clothes, bought an air mattress (used to sleep on the couch) into my home because my sister says its ok. 

We’re on month 5 now and this is pretty much how it’s been since. He needs to go, overstayed his welcome, but of course my sister doesn’t. Am I being too hard? I’ve never had to deal with this situation before. 

We’re not friends, I don’t want to be his friend just because you and my sister are together. Although I have nothing against him personally I just don’t like helping people who won’t help themselves. Btw I am a guy and we’re both 23, sister is 21 if that matters.",28Apr2020,2

1) put them in a shed or unused area of the house (no space) 

2) build a mini shelter for them outside (his parents probably will not be ok with this. there are also no supplies)

My first language is the second hardest language after Mandarin (It's not Chinese). I have trouble understanding my teachers. That's why it's better off to learn alone and buy English-translated versions of what I'm learning in school.

We act like a couple and do couple things but I can't call him my boyfriend? To some degree I get it.

There will also be a TLDR; at the bottom.

Good morning everyone, so before we dive into this we’re going into a little back story. I am a 25 Y/O M married to a 22 Y/O F. We’re coming up on our first year anniversary next month. We live in the rural south and neither one of us are currently effected by Covid-19 (I work in emergency services and she works for the government) and we’re currently expecting our first child at some point at the end of the year. Our first appointment is in a week or so.

I detailed the house (swept,vacuumed, mopped, dusted, detailed the bathrooms and kitchen, and no single dish was left dirty) because my MIL was coming down for some stuff and stayed with us a couple of days and left the day that I did (3 days ago) and washed some dishes before she departed.



So for starters I get off a 48 hour shift this morning (I recently picked up a second job to get ahead of bills credit card, vehicle, mortgage etc.) and I call my wife and let her know I’m on my way, during the call she tells me that one of the dogs had an accident in the floor and she cleaned up #2 but didn’t clean up #1 before she left.  I tell her not to worry about it and I’ll do it before I take a nap (common for me after double shifts). The call ends.

I arrive home and let the dogs outside to play and use the bathroom so I go inside to change, clean up #1 and to get some breakfast.  The house is an ABSOLUTE WRECK. I mean both sides of the sink full, dishes on the counter and stove (old food still in them from a previous night), trash is full,  the living room is in shambles from the dogs (2 Great Danes), I continue my journey through the destruction and the bedroom is also a mess.  You gotta be kidding me ?  The bed has clothes that my wife washed / dried 4 days ago and still yet to be folded and put away and dirty clothes on the floor not in the hamper.  I go outside to check on our two horses that we have and they are LOW on water.

My blood began to boil.

My wife currently has the luxury of working from home on certain days due to her job criteria and yesterday was one of those days. I understand that her body is going through fairly drastic changes (I work as a healthcare provider so I understand what’s going on with her body) but even before she was pregnant she failed to clean and do the simplest of cleaning tasks. 

The house we bought doesn’t have a dishwasher so everything is washed by hand which is a drag but I haven’t done the plumbing yet for it (the layout of our house is odd), I’m trying to redo the bathroom and do some things with the yard. I have a lot on my plate and I’m a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to cleaning so things need to be a certain way. I’ve just finished sweeping, mopping, throwing away old mail and I’m about to start the dishes.

This isn’t the first time I’ve found dirty dishes or a dirty floor, I understand with my dogs floors are hard to keep clean and after dinner you don’t wanna wash dishes. 

What should I do to talk to her about this, should let it slide or actually confront her ? I don’t think it would have been so bad if I haven’t had been at work 120 hours in the past week. But coming home to a destroyed house and having to clean it on my off day when I have work tomorrow really throws me off.






TLDR; worked 120 hours in the last week, I came home today after being on a 48 hour shift to a completely destroyed house.",28Apr2020,1
649,"Hi people of reddit,

I have a question regarding a couple of suspicious phone calls my husband took while I was away with family for the weekend. He left work and I tried to call both numbers (each different area codes) and they were both out of service. These area codes come from tiny towns in our large state that we’ve never been to. My question is, why would he have made/taken these calls and then the numbers are out of service a few days later? He hasn’t mentioned anything about the calls.
Any tech people who might know what this means?
Yes, I know, ASK, but I just wanted the reddit family to chime in with insights before I have this conversation with him.

650,"Hey Guys!

So me and my boyfriend have been dating for 5 years and living together for 3, and for the past 4 years we have both been getting our degrees. I decided to double major so I still have a year left, but my boyfriend is graduating with his degree in accounting in just a couple of weeks. The problem is months ago I had planned to fly his family down (they live out of state) and have a party at a family friends house as its much larger than our tiny college apartment.

 I also planned to invite about 8 of his friends to this big party and really I just wanted to have a huge celebration for him, as for a long while he almost dropped out when he had a hard time finding a degree he was passionate about. I really support him, and in fact we're planning on getting married soon so I wanted to make this a huge event to show how proud I and everyone are that he finished and got a job in his field right away. 

However, with COVID-19 taking place, I had to cancel all of those plans. His family is no longer flying down, the commencement through the University is cancelled, and social distancing means I can't really bring people together to celebrate for him. Not only that but the catering and cake and decorations are on hold as well with most businesses in my area being shut down .

 Luckily, most of my plans can take place later this summer and most everyone agreed that we will still celebrate as a big group at another date to really show our support of him. He and I both have the weekend of his commencement off as we both planned to have the big party, so even though I can't have the party I originally planned right away, I still want to celebrate in some way next weekend. I'm really coming up short on ideas.

I already plan on giving him his graduation gift and grabbing some store bought cake/alcohol, but I still feel like I should be doing more to celebrate. Any ideas on activities or mini-celebration would be amazing. Thank you all!",28Apr2020,1

in 2006 during 6th grade, I had a best friend I had feelings for. I told her about them, and she quickly got creepy. on my 12th birthday we went to another state to celebrate and were sharing a hotel room. at night, through out the trip she continually touched me and grabbed me, which I didn't think much of until it was time to sleep, in said hotel. she ended up pinning me down and not letting me move under her weight. I was worried since on other occasions she tried to take off my pants and what not but she never really got very far. she began to scream at me saying I should be letting her have sex with me, and If I really liked her I would have let her by now. at this point, being a child, I was crying and trying to get away. once she did let go of me she didn't try anything. despite this on several other occasions she would grope me and continuously ask and pressure me into letting her go farther. I never gave her consent for touching me or anything but I still can't decide if I'm just overthinking this or not. she never went very far and we were just kids. does this fall under anything? am I in the wrong here for thinking anything of it?

This is a continuation of this story right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g8q3ov/my_friend_thinks_my_ex_boyfriend_took_advantage/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

If you don’t want to read that(although I recommend you do) here is a TLDR: me and my boyfriend broke up about a month ago when I had to leave college. I moved back to town and my friends threw me a welcome home fire. I got drunk and emotional, and as I was crying in my room ha came to talk to me. He told me he missed me, I got emotional he kissed me and then we ended up having sex. I wake up the next morning and my friend tells me that he took advantage of me and that I should be mad at him, I didn’t believe her.

Well as it turns out he is a sneaky lying mother fucker who just wanted to get in my pants. So I’ll catch you up on what happened in the two days after we slept together. 

After we slept together I told him he could take my car because his ride home left and I couldn’t drive him. I was trying to be nice because he told me he wanted to fix things. I told him to bring it around tomorrow night. Well tomorrow night comes and he hasn’t texted me all day and still hasn’t returned my car.  My friends start texting him because they are livid. One if them said “He fucks her, takes her car, and doesn’t even have the curticy to text her or tell her when he’s gonna bring back her car.”

He eventually brings over my car and tells all of us that he finally got his truck fixed so we don’t have to give him rides anymore. My friend takes him outside and has like a 20 minute talk with him. I still don’t know how hat exactly they talked about but I know she ripped his ass. My friend then gives him a ride back to his house and he texts me apologizing for the other night. I told him it was okay, I just wanted to get a few things straightened out. He says okay and I start asking him what does he wants, and he keeps dogging the question until I give up. 

The next day he comes over, doesn’t acknowledge that we had sex, and doesn’t acknowledge the texts. He helps my friend around the house all day doing yard work and such. I’m pissed at him and I try to be bitchy towards him, but I don’t really know how to. I’ve never been a bitchy person. Well the day goes on and we hang out, kinda like we used to. Just sending digs back and forth and making jokes. At the end of the day he leaves because he was invited to a bon fire.

After he leaves I kinda break down. My friend asks me what’s wrong and I asked her “did he mean anything he said that night”. My friends look at each other and exchange a long silence. Then one of them turns towards me and says “I’ve used all of those lines to get into girls pants before. I don’t think he really meant them.” This obviously upsets me and I run to go cry alone. My friend comes in and try’s to talk to me and asks me if I want to know the full truth. I said yes. She then precedes to tell me that the whole time I was gone he had gotten a tinder and was trying to hook up with girls . I asked her how many did he sleep with and she told me she knew of one girl. 

This obviously shatters me. Because this means he really did use me. he Knew I still loved him and he knew the exact words to say to get in my pants. He told me That he missed me every day and that he was hoping i wasn’t going to get in a relationship because he wanted to talk to me. That he wanted to try TO TALK ABOUT HUS FEELINGS MORE! He said all of this because he knew it was exactly what I wanted to hear.

After this I finally decided to delete him off of snap chat and to block him in Facebook. If he never cared about me then I never want to speak to him again.

The thing that hurts me the worst is the man that originally started dating would have NEVER done this. He had only dated three girls and had sex with three girls. I thought he was finally the boyfriend I deserved. I honestly don’t know what broke him but something obviously did. 

He also know the kind of shit that has happened to me in the past. I have not had one single good experience from guys. My first told me that he would text me and then never did after we had sex. The next guy i slept with I took to court for sexual assault. Which he fucking knew about because one time I broke down crying in the middle of sex because of it. He knew how bad my track record was with guys and he still did all of this regardless.

Now time for the advice part, how do I deal with this now? Do I just ignore him, even when he comes over to finish helping my friend with yard work. Does anyone think that maybe deep down inside he did miss me. Does anyone think he’s going to try to talk to me now that I completely cut him off? I don’t know what to do, all I know is that now my heart hurts more then it did then when he originally broke up with me.",28Apr2020,1

As time as passed and as I got better he’s gotten worse and worse. He gets in his head and convinces himself that something bad is happening. One time we were out and saw a lot of babies and he started freaking out that I was pregnant because we saw babies even though everything else was normal long story short I took a pregnancy test in a gas station bathroom. Now he can’t even go to certain towns. We live in a very small town less than 500 people and there’s 2 town that everyone goes to for stuff (well say bob and Tom as the towns) for the last few month he has being refusing to go to bob because it is bigger than Tom and has more people. And when we talk about the future like having kids and stuff I say I’m going to the hospital in bob because it’s a much better hospital then the one in Tom and then he starts to freak out because he refuses to go there. And the thing is bob is much better then Tom because bob has more things to do and that’s where my doctor is for my medication. I guess what I’m trying to say is my boyfriend is severely paranoid about everything and I want him to see someone but he says that “guys don’t do that kind of stuff” (paranoid about his masculinity as well) I just want him to get some help but I don’t know how please help.

Sorry in advance for length, just trying to be detailed and explain my thought process thoroughly!!
[TLDR at the end]

**Background:** I (23F) majored in a BA in Communications and Media studies in Illinois (not too impressive, I know). I graduated in December 2019. My GPA ended around 2.5 (even less impressive). Lectures and schooling, paired with an absolutely stubborn and rigid department head, was very very hard for me. My mental state at school had a direct impact on my studies, and with OCD/Anxiety I struggled a ton. However, I have had some awesome experiences - I’ve interned as a video editor, made mobile ads with these companies, freelanced as a storyboard artist and helped set-up/manage social media pages in Chicago. Did the Disney College Program for shits-and-giggles. My real-world experience is nothing to sneeze at. I know I have what it takes to work the industry (specifically social media management and creative direction/design, even video production if I’m lucky).

**The Issue:** So obviously the first thing I do after New Years is look for a job in my field! I know it will not be easy, and I know the market is competitive - I’m *not* disillusioned. I’ve had a great summary of interviews. Before Covid, I was waiting to hear from some truly interested positions about offers in event planning, A/V Tech companies, and social media coordinators. However, I noticed a lot of jobs in this field are lumped with Graphic Design/Animation majors...what the heck?? I abandoned getting a FA Degree because I thought the chances to find work with one would be lower than a BA. I’m so confused, because now all my summers spent working for experience (and part-time serving work on top of that) feels useless with out ‘a relevant portfolio of media design, digital artwork, and typography’ as well as a ‘reel of past work’. The video reel I fully understand, and can provide, but the art leaves me feeling like I am under prepared.

**Advice I Need:** Should I consider taking what work I have done as an intern (editing photos for CMYK print, email graphics, etc.) and my hobby art, scrounge an application portfolio, and attempt to take a 30 credit MA in Art/Design? Just to bolster my credentials? I absolutely *hate* school and want to start working so bad, but now that I’ve seen the job market I feel so...defeated. Even worthless at times (say hi to my anxiety). Covid obviously isn’t helping me feel secure in my skills at all, but I could have potentially found work and be working during this quarantine if I had a portfolio. Every day as I scroll, it’s just so many jobs for Graphic Design paired with Videography, Social Media Producer, Marketing, and all these other positions I once felt strongly prepared for.

&gt; **TLDR;** Went to Uni, got a Media Undergrad, got a lot of real-world experience over summers. Now that I’ve graduated, feels like I’m missing a lot of experience in Graphic Design for many relevant jobs. Do I go back for an MA (30 credits) to refine my skills and be properly prepared?",28Apr2020,1

Why do I feel like this? I'm so damn lonely. I have no one to talk to or rely upon, I've never been able to meet people easily, and I have no ability to attract a sexual / romantic partner.

My life isn't a completely catastrophe in-so-far as that I have opportunities, as well as I have a roof over my head and food on the table, but it's not enough to keep me going.

I've seen a number of therapists and coaches over the years, all of whom have told me I'm doing the right things; that I'm affable, that I'm intelligent, and that I will succeed at life. I have no evident personality traits or character flaws that would be off-putting. Others have described me as ""handsome"", a ""people person"" and ""lovely"". By all accounts, I'm not someone who should struggle to actually meet people, date, make friends etc. It's also not for a lack of trying; I've been going to meetups, learning to dance, going to the gym, volunteering, and not once have I made so much as an acquaintance to get along with.

But it's as if I'm cursed. I cannot break out of the cycle. No matter how much therapy I have, books I read, opportunities I take, I'm still back at square one; a seemingly unlikable man.

678,"Hi there Advice! I am a sophomore in College who is currently in a job pickle. I was previously employed by my University as a Tier 1 Helpdesk Student worker. However, due to the Coronavirus, student workers were told that our jobs were put on hold. Luckily, I received news a couple days ago that our summer project has a tentative start date of June 1st, where I would be working almost full time.

Before my bosses knew this information, I was told by them to apply for summer jobs, and if I found a new job that wanted to keep me after the summer, there was no hard feelings. I had already applied to some different retail stores, one online only distributor for a warehouse gig, and a local ISP for a call center general customer service role. All pay around the same as my old Uni job, but both the warehouse and ISP job mentioned potential IT Internships down the road during the phone interviews. I am in round two of interviews, one of which is this Thursday, and the other one which is loosely next week.

In your opinion, should I tough out a month and wait for the summer project to start, or should I try to branch out to companies outside of the University for the potential job advancements?

At that point, I started growing feeling for her and given the vast distance between us, I did a few things to show her how I felt, such as sending her a gift on her birthday, which she thought was thoughtful and loved. I was honest about how I thought she was special.

I travelled again to her place for vacation at the end of last year; we went out a few times for dinner, shows, which both of us planned weeks ahead. During that week, I made a few gestures to show her how I felt -- special gifts with handwritten notes, flowers and of course picked up the tabs. She told me she had a lovely time and asked me to visit often. We were planning to meet again after the new year, and I wanted to use that time to outright tell her how I feel and if she wanted to pursue a relationship.

After returning home, we still texted. I tried to keep the sparks alive, such as by sending a bouquet of flowers to her office (which as usual, she said she loved). However, after the new year, things started changing. She came back from a trip with her parents and suddenly, her schedule had turned busy with work, and she started responding less. I didn’t have any reason to believe that she didn’t want to speak with me – everything was going well just before that. After a couple of weeks, I somehow managed to hear back. She said she’d been hectic so wasn’t able to keep texting anymore. I was taken aback and decided to tell her how I felt. She then said she just wanted to be friends and that she didn't want me to waste my effort/time.

I was just wondering what exactly happened. To be honest, it was a tricky situation anyway, with us having limited ""real life"" interaction (a total of less than 20 hours irl) beyond texts and calls, and that there's no chance of us moving closer to each other in the next two years at least. However, I was thinking: a) If she didn't feel anything all along, why didn't she fade much earlier instead of being always receptive of my advances, b) If she felt something at the beginning but changed her mind, why wouldn't she explain anything to me? or c) I've a feeling that there's something else that had happened in her life that caused her to withdraw. Any insights, based on your experience, would be appreciated!

683,"So in high school I was dual enrolled so I was able to attend college instead of high school since I was a sophomore. I had enough credits by the end of my junior year that I was able to graduate early in 2019 on the edge of 16. I'm 17 years old now and I feel burnt out from working so hard in high school. I used to do all of my work and everything came easy to me and now that I'm officially a full time college student I've completely lost all motivation. I also have no passions or goals that I want to achieve. The problem is that I just dropped all of my classes for the semester because I just fell way too behind from lack of caring. I've told my parents that I've been struggling with going to school but they only threaten to make me quit my job at a fast food place, which I throughly enjoy and get excited about, werid I know but it's my first job ever I wasn't allowed to have one in high school because I was doing both high school and college and my parents thought that a job on top of that would be stressful. Also I'm trying to save up that I can move out on my own once I turn 18 in 2 months, my parents stress me out so much and put too much pressure on me.

685,"Hello everyone, 

I (F25) have a bit of a problem with a friend who doesn’t seem to respect my boundaries. 

A little bit of background information: I am a young woman, I have PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I am on daily antidepressants and take some sleep medication because if not I tend to sleep 3-4 hours a night. 

I met my friend (F28) 3 years ago and we became very close. We share many interests and do a lot of activities together (online). We met irl but she lives in another country so we do most of our activities online. We write stories together (fan fiction mostly) and chat through the day. She has Bipolar I disorder and has been going to therapy for a long time. 

For the past year she has been getting increasingly angry at her therapist because she wants her to acknowledge her pain, and some of the unhealthy coping mechanisms she has. These are all things my friend has told me, by the way. And now everytime she finishes therapy she texts me that she’s going to die, that she’s ready to die, and that her therapist is a moron. Even sometimes when she doesn’t have a session she will text me for long periods of time about how horrible life is, that life is not worth living, and that it is better to die. However, she said she has no plans on killing herself. I’ve suggested she speak to her husband about it, suggested finding another therapist, and even writing to an organisation like the Samaritans. She shots down all my suggestions and tells me I don’t understand, and keeps saying that all my suggestions are not useful. 

Her texting and the subsequent mood swings she has affect me terribly. She refuses to talk to her husband because ‘he won’t understand and will want to take me to the hospital’ and refuses to get another therapist because ‘that will take too long’.

However, this constant texting is making my own mental health deteriorate. I’ve started doing unhealthy things to cope, and feel exhausted all the time now. 

I don’t know how to approach this situation with my friend because she is very volatile, and honestly, I’m scared she will cut me off her life if I bring this up the wrong way.",28Apr2020,1

694,"So I guess there really isn’t much I can do. Me (21f) and my bf (20m) have been together for 2 years. I was 19 and he was 18 when we got together. But this one girl always bothers me. 

1.) my bf told me he was “obsessed” with this girl in 10th grade.

2.) He said how he would j*** off to pictures of girls from his school including her. He even admitted that he had still did it to this girl up until we started dating apparently. For some reason I can usually get the truth out of him or at least I think. 

3.) He is very non secretive in front of me meaning when he’s on Instagram and stuff he would not hide or tilt his phone away. A few times I had seen when he went to search something her name in recent searches. 

4.) He once early on was showing me pictures of her and her bf and saying how isn’t it weird she’s dating him because she was better looking. 

5.) Obviously I started getting annoyed about this girl and months in I had seen again when he was showing me something on insta her name in the search. When I asked why he said he was hesitating but he finally said he and his buddy at work were showing each Other pictures of girls from high school they thought were hot.

6.) One time something happened where we have gaming computers right next to each Other and he was in his history and I saw her Facebook searched and I got mad so then says later on insta AGAIN he has looked her up and I was like wtfff and he said he was showing his friend the girl I was upset about.

7.) Now months later me and my bf were playing games online with his friend and his friends cousin was gonna join (we don’t know him well but we know of him) and his friend says his cousin is dating a new girl... THAT GIRL. ARE YOU KIDDING? obviously my bf was quiet and so was I.. now I’m upset about it again.. I hate now playing online with him and his friends because the one kids cousin is now always playing and I think of that girl. 

I’m sure there are other things I’m forgetting in this 2 year span. I don’t know if I’m being crazy or what. I just feel so insecure because I feel like he is obsessed with her. What do you guys think? What would you guys think in this situation? Let me know :( I’m tired of thinking of this.

695,"So yesterday morning, my sister who is now 18yr had a remote therapy session with her therapist. We knew that something was off though, because after my sister got off the phone, she decided to take a walk, and not much longer after that, her therapist called my mother. I’m not entirely sure of all the details, because my mother doesn’t want to embarrass my sister anymore than she’s probably already feeling... 

But apparently the gist of what has been going on is that my mom’s cousin who she was always really close to growing up, met my sister at a family funeral, and has been sending her sexually explicit messages and pictures, as well as videos, since she was fifteen. My sister evidentially tried to speak to his wife about it, and messaged her, but his wife basically called her a whore and threatened my sister to “Stay away from her man”. 

My mom was beyond furious when she found out. My stepdad had to physically restrain her from getting in the car and driving to West Virginia to beat the living hell out of him, or even straight up murder him. This cousin has always seemed off, but everyone just always thought it was in an autistic way, as he was diagnosed as an adult a couple years back. Nope. Turns out he was weird in the ‘tries to fuck kids’ way. This feels beyond fucked up, and we don’t even know what to do about it. He has a 3 year old daughter who has been neglected for most of her life, and custody of her is currently being sought by his brother... So I guess they definitely just won that battle now, because everyone in the family has seen the screen shots of what he sent her, as my mom posted in the family facebook group. 

My sister has locked herself in her room, and honestly, I feel like a terrible fucking sister rn. I am the oldest. I am supposed to watch out for her. And I didn’t. We’ve had a very tense relationship after my parents divorced, because my dad became abusive towards me, and she was the golden child. She used to tell me that I didn’t matter as a person, or that nobody wanted me... Just really mean stuff. It actually had a huge part in the development of my anxiety disorder, and my suicidal ideation. And I resented her for that. I passed judgement on her constantly, and was utterly convinced that she was just a fuck up of a human being. She was sneaking out of the house to meet boys at all hours of the night, sending nudes to her classmates, failing her classes, and being downright evil to be around at home. She even texted my other sister’s boyfriend at the time, who then cheated on my other sister WITH HER. As far as I was concerned, she was just a shitty person, and I have been actively trying to move out of my parent’s home even though I really can’t afford it because she was so bad for my mental health. 


But honestly... Right now I just feel so shitty for the way that I felt towards her. No wonder she was acting out. She was being groomed and pressured into sexual things by a grown ass man. She was a child, and he was a family member who she probably felt pressured to protect. Even if she was a mean teenager, she still didn’t deserve that sort of treatment. I just feel so guilty for calling her a whore when she probably has a fucked up view of sex and intimacy because she’s been groomed by a pedophile. She was dealing with anger issues and acting out because she was being forced into adult situations without her consent that she definitely wasn’t ready for. And she lost her innocence in a way that wasn’t fair. Instead of discovering her sexuality with boys her own age, and doing the cute puppy love stuff that most teenagers do, she had a member of our own family pressuring her into doing sexual things. I should have noticed, because all of the things that she was doing seem like neon signs screaming “HELP!!!!” Now, in hindsight. 

And then there’s the rage. Up until this point in my life, I didn’t think that I could hate anybody. I’m hate violence, and aggression only makes me incredibly anxious. I dislike plenty of people, like my abusive dad, for example. But I never thought that I HATED anyone.... But when I came home from the store to that news, I couldn’t even think. I could barely even process what I was feeling, because that level of rage and anger was something that I just hadn’t ever felt before. My boyfriend had to come over and take a walk with me, because I had such an urge to do something to get the energy out. I angry cried for about half an hour.... I’m just so unsure what to feel right now. 

Am I wrong to feel so guilty? And is it wrong if I still very much dislike my sister for the things that she has done, even if she was acting out from that abuse? How do I deal with this level of anger in a healthy way that doesn’t result in me going to prison? Everything just seems to be falling apart right now, and Idk if it’s even selfish for me to be unable to handle it.",28Apr2020,2
696,"I really struggle with assertiveness. Always have. I have been looking for opportunities to practice being assertive and finally found one.

698,"Hi everyone, so basically my situation is that my throughout my life I've always been known as the ""smart"" and ""honest"" one in my family and my parents have always gone on and on about how proud they are to have a daughter who is so honorable and hardworking and honest and who has always gotten straight A's. However, that is not true at all. The first time I cheated on a test was in sixth grade (not even kidding) and I continued to cheat in middle school and a little bit in high school. I know how wrong cheating is and I know there is no excuse for it. I never went into exams ""planning"" on cheating or preparing to cheat, but when I'd panic on a test if I thought I'd fail, then I'd look over at someone else's exam next to me and copy some of their answers. Plus, I plagiarised in my English classes by using sparknotes and other sites like those to help me write my papers. 

Anyway, cheating is considered bad by everyone obviously, but in my family is considered one of the worst things you could do and my parents said if they ever found out one of their children cheated it would be unacceptable and they'd kick us out of the house. I have felt immense guilt since the first time I have cheated and I hate that I have deceived my entire family into thinking I'm an honest, honorable, smart daughter plus they think I'm humble b/c I have always downplayed my academic achievements since I know many of them were not deserved and it always made me sick to my stomach when they'd praise me. Point is, recently my parents have offered to get me a very expensive present because I ""deserve it"" and am ""such a wonderful daughter"" and when cheating was brought up recently due to the fact that a lot of the students at my university cheated during online exams during quarantine my parents went on about how they know I'd never do something like that and that they are happy strict measures on in place for online exams so that ""honest"" people like me are protected. 

I feel terrible and I know I'm an awful person and daughter and they deserve to know I'm not the great person they think I am. I just feel like telling them at this point will likely do more harm than good and will hurt them more than me when they realize the type of daughter they raised. They would truly be devastated and I don't think they would accept me or trust me again understandably. Should I come clean or just let them live in ignorant bliss?

699,"Hi everyone.  I'm here to ask for your advice and/or opinion(s).  I've been seeing a lovely man for about five months.  He and I are the same age with very different life trajectories.  He's a father to two teen-aged girls and he's fully invested in their family unit.  I have no children and, while I do have a little experience dating a single parent, I don't have so much that I feel confident merging into their lane on the highway without at least head-checking.  Last weekend, he suggested that I could meet the girls, if I want, which is flattering, honestly, but I want to be conscious about how I move forward and engage with them.  I recognize that I'll need to take my cues from him, but I also worry that I have no idea what I, as an interloper, might represent to his daughters (were they close to my sweetie's past exes who then left, etc.?).  I know every family is different and I have no intention of becoming a parent figure to these young women, so there's that, but I want to avoid common missteps that take place when a single parent's new love interest enters into a close family unit. 

Here is what I intend to do: 

1. engage with authenticity and integrity;
2. demonstrate respect, including respect for their existing relationship structure and work to preserve/maintain those connections by not detracting or interfering with current schedules, plans, patterns of engagement;
3. keep opinions and unsolicited advice to myself;
4. be aware of family dynamics and be willing to excuse myself if my presence seems disruptive;
5. be tolerant and forgiving of any difficult feelings that might arise due to my presence.

What advice would you offer me?  Is there a book you would recommend?  My family of origin was not great, so the idea of being drawn into a healthy, happy family is both deeply attractive and oddly terrifying...

When a man marries a non virgin woman?
My fiancé initially had a problem with my past (2 before him) I had an extremely traumatic first time during my mid twenties- he doesn’t know what happened - but I was originally planning to wait for marriage so I feel even more guilty that I met my fiancé only a year and a half later. He got over my past - so he says and has never brought it up since - but I can’t help feeling like he’s settling for me and would rather a virgin. 


I have been obsessing over virginity being a prize to a man and I was reading stuff on YouTube... 
If her history did bother him, she had slept with a couple other me, but still marries her? Is she safe, or will he treat her as ‘ less than ‘

I read a comment on a YouTube that  that said ‘ even if a man marries a non virgin he will not give her his absolute best like he would have done if she were a virgin ‘ and it got me wondering..  but then.. why marry her?

And there’s a whole bunch of other guys under this video talking about how virginity is the prize and they would rather a virgin etc etc. 
It’s sorta making me feel like I should let my fiancé go be with a virgin as it’s what men want deep down. 

We’re just about to purchase a house together and have one last bit to sign but I feel like before I do that I’d like to ask him if he wants to be with a virgin deep down he should go for it. I just don’t want to be treated less than and all these men all over YouTube seem to see women who aren’t virgins as less valuable, so what’s the point. I rather be alone. My past already makes me feel awful.

I thought for a while that you were supposed to start a conversation with something interesting that happened, so I would mention funny things I did in a game or saw in a show. But several of my friends just drop out of the conversation in real life or don't text back. When they do text back a day later, they ignore what I said completely. I know I'm doing something wrong but I don't know what since they'll text me about their interests no problem. I asked my mom about it and she said to start asking questions instead but everyone just responds like 'oh, I don't know' or gives one word answers.

I met this guy my Freshman year of college and we used to talk on YikYak a lot. Eventually we met and became good friends and dealt with a lot of personal issues together. Shortly after we became friends, we became friends with benefits. I loved him, but not romantically. It’s just the kind of love you have when you care for someone deeply. He later confessed that he was IN love with me, and I couldn’t reciprocate those feelings whatsoever. We broke off being FWB and eventually stopped being friends altogether. He told me that he’s moved on from me and doesn’t feel the way he used to. He dropped out of school and moved back home, and I haven’t seen him since. A month ago, we started talking again about a girl he had been talking to who knew me. He met her on tinder and the location was set to my school since he used to go there. 
Anyways, I was supportive of him and wished him the best. They started dating and then he tells me he’s fallen in love with her and he can no longer talk to me out of respect for her. Understandable. but would someone PLEASE tell me WHY I think I’m getting romantic feelings for him after I haven’t seen him in years. I think I just miss the thought of him, I can’t tell.

He’s also shared stuff on tumblr that I feel is DIRECTED at me but I can’t tell! his girlfriend doesn’t have a tumblr that I know of but he’s shared stuff that says:

714,"I'm 20 (M), I have battled with depression for many years now ever since my parents battle with drug addiction and homelessness in my early teens. Things have definitely been better recently, I met the girl of my dreams and we've been together three years now. We moved away from home and got an apartment while she is in college. However I have recently fallen into another deep state of depression despite all these good things. 

I'm working a very low paying job 50 hours a week, they recently switched me to the overnight shift (not what I want). I am also worried for my girlfriend's health due to my exposure to people at work, I have come home the last couple nights coughing uncontrollably. I know I should get tested and stay home but my company is only offering two weeks unpaid leave and I cant afford to pay rent if I do that. I haven't been able to sleep due to anxiety which I feel makes the tiredness/stress even worse. I'm sorry for the long run-on paragraph, I just don't know what to do. If anyone is going through something similar or has any advice it would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

718,"Since I've been young, I have had a weird mind. I had an alcoholic emotionally abusive mother, she crashed with me in the car when I was like 11 years old, she threw a clock at my head, we'd come home sometimes and she'd be in the yard all fucked up on pain meds or on the couch half asleep or screaming or whatever nightmare she'd create for us to come home to, I was constantly scared from 9-12 as this happened, woke up to her dead on the floor when I was 12, all I felt was relief. I am trying to figure out what is wrong with my brain. 

Ever since I've been around 10 my mind has felt very foggy, and like there's a constant noise in my head, a silent noise, an invisible hurricane, like 10,000 constant thoughts or something pulling me in every direction, like madness. I can't hold a job because of it, I can't act normal, I have extreme rage issues, I failed school after getting terrible grades for years because every paper I looked at, I couldn't concentrate because its like my brain can't think due to the invisible hurricane and silent tornado alarm. I have been tested for ADHD but I don't have it, I've seen like 8 therapists, all useless. Been on 8 different meds for OCD depression and anxiety, all useless.

The strangest thing is that, rarely, only maybe twenty times in my life, I have woken up with less brain fog, more ability to connect to people, to understand the way someones talking to me, to think more intelligently, its like my anxiety and OCD dissapear, I feel happy, and then after a few minutes I'm back to being all messed up. Sometimes I have a more minor version of this clarity and goodness that lasts up to a half an hour and slowly diminishes through out the hour. I used to slam my head into things as a kid if that could be effecting me, maybe I have a herniated disc in my neck or some tight nerves or something screwing up my brain, I have no idea. Does anyone have any advice? Psychiatrists and doctors have all been completely useless, all those meds did was give me nightmares or make my OCD worse or make me feel nauseous. Thanks.",28Apr2020,1

721,"About a month ago ( March 29th)  I preordered these earrings from an Etsy shop I follow. I've ordered earrings from the same shop multiple times in the past but this is the first time I did a preorder on Instagram. I DMed the owner and preordered them. I paid them for the earrings and shipping via Paypal then waited. In the past, my order would come in a few days after I placed it but I still have yet to receive my package. Confused, I tried to DM the owner again on Instagram ( the same page I made my preorder in) asking for the tracking number of the package. It has been 6 days and she has not responded to my message (it is a business account so I know you can un-read messages) she has posted on her story so that means she is active. 3 days ago I tried messaging her on the Etsy store and still nothing. At this point, I am at a loss. I just want to know what is going on. What should I do?

I understand it is a strange time for us all, but I've seen new reviews on her store on earrings she released after my preorder.

I can't go outside if it's really windy since my lungs aren't strong enough to breathe against the wind and I choke. I also have a hard time breathing through scarfs in the winter. My lungs are shitty. So unsurprisingly I have a lot of trouble getting enough air through the disposable surgical masks they provide, and end up pulling them down a lot to catch my breath which is making management very upset.

724,"My roommate (met her off Craigslist) and I get along for the most part. She’s very clean and isn’t loud at night and we enjoy each other’s company. I would even consider her a friend before all of this. 

Some backstory is needed for this, I was assaulted by someone I was supposed to be able to trust when I was younger and I went through a period where I thought I’d never recover. I’ve gotten better to the point where I don’t have many triggers at all and I function relatively normally but I still am diagnosed with a few things including ptsd. One of the few triggers I have is I don’t like being snuck up on or scared by another person. I like scary movies and when I can control when I get scared by and by what. 

My roommate finds it funny to scare me and she does know I don’t like it so much but I was trying to see it as practice to help move on from being so jumpy. I did verbally express me not liking it but it was harmless teasing mostly. Anyway I came home from work around 10:30 pm and I had work at 6 the next morning so i wanted to crash ASAP. I thought I heard her walking  around the apartment which obviously I didn’t put too much thought into. I took my meds (which make me sleepy and loopy) and went to bed. 

I woke up 10 minutes later to the front door slamming shut and a low voice talking. I instantly texted my roommate to ask her if she had JUST gotten home because I had been under the assumption that she was already home. She responded by saying she was at her bf’s place. I asked her again and she swore to me that she was at his place while I was definitely hearing someone in the apartment. Literally right after she told me this, I heard a huge bang on my door like someone had just slammed on it. Needless to say I started hyperventilating and crying thinking that I was in danger. Everything came rushing back to me, the feeling of being absolutely powerless and weak. I called my roommate and begged my roommate to come home and she sounded very laid back and kind of drunk. (Later found out she had been pretty high). She then proceeded to tell me that she was just messing with me and that she was the one home. I (while still crying) told her it wasn’t funny and that she genuinely scared me and her response was “I don’t know I I’m laughing pretty hard”. All I said was good for her and then hung up. Since then I stopped talking to her because there’s nothing for me to say. She knows she hurt me as she spelled it out in a text that she’s sorry but she was high and didn’t realize what she was doing. 

I told her I wanted space and then she decided to inquire about a screen door to her balcony through our property manager and without going into too much detail, we HAVE to have a screen door and that I would be charged for it since my roommate wasn’t here when I initially moved in. Basically she’s forcing a hefty fee on me while I’m already financially struggling for a screen door she doesn’t even want. I feel like I’ve gone backwards in so many ways and I hate coming home now. Just like what I ran away from. I don’t know what to do. Should I move out or stick with living here another 6 months or so? Should I sit down and talk with her? Please any advice would help.

729,"Hi, the gender that I was born with is female. And I’ve always identified as cis female. But lately I’ve been confused. I started dating a trans female about five months ago and I love her very much. She definitely made me think more about gender and I’ve discovered I like they/them pronouns, but I also like she/her pronouns. I haven’t told anyone and honestly I don’t even know if she/they is valid but I feel very comfortable with both those pronouns and honestly if I were told to drop one I wouldn’t be able to choose. I haven’t told anyone about how I feel because I’m scared that it’s not valid. And if it is valid, I have no interest in coming out to my family. Because I still like she/her pronouns and don’t mind also being called those I dont want to put myself through the stress of coming out. Even though my mom and dad have been quite accepting when I came out as lesbian I’m still nervous that they wouldn’t understand or make fun of me, especially my mom. So basically my questions are: 1. Is she/they valid even if I don’t come out to my family and only to my friends and my girlfriend? 2: what term is used for she/they individuals? 3: If I like women and identify as she/they, am I still a lesbian?

I have noticed she has some issues with identity, she likes to be called a different name than she was given, but if I ask her what she would rather be called she insists that she is fine with going by her given name. And she has short hair, the name she likes more tends to be more for males too.

On top of all this she has high functioning autism. I asked her about it over discord and she went silent (she  has done this before too, she has trouble talking about her issues, so I dont pry).

733,"So pretty much everyone expects everyone to get along right no drama, no entitled people, no Karen's no Felicia's. Wrong!

Well wrong for me anyway, Backstory I'm married 34 old women with 4 girls I come from a large family, In this family where is a mother daughter duo who think they are entitled to anything and everything and if you don't give them what they want your in the wrong. I'mm going to call them EA: Entitled auntie and EC: Entitled cousin.

So last February My husband and announced at a family gathering we were expecting our forth child at the time, at the time we announced this, another cousin i'm very close with got all excited and announced her and her husband were expecting their forth to, and everyone was absolutely over the moon for both of us, Or so I thought. Over the next few months I started getting weird text messages from EC about how we were going to handle a forth and maybe we should think about adoption, and after repeatedly telling her that wont be happening she changed her tone and started telling us we couldn't afford a forth child esspically with the three other girls in the house, and how would they fell, we shouldn't be allowed to have more kids etc. Now don't get me wrong but we had room in our home so I don't know where this was coming from. Anyway she started changing her tone to"" I'll take the baby It can live here instead"". Now this was not a question it was more like ""this is what will happen"". Trust me that would not be happening She was a single 32 year old with her mom living with her, I even got text messages from EA saying "" we will be at the hospital to take my grand baby home the moment you have it"".I'm like um NO. I soon started getting messages from other family member confused as to I why was giving EA and EC my baby when I told them I'm not giving my baby up I told these family member EA and EC told me they would be taking my baby home with them, They told a lot of people EC was going to be a mom because of EC's cousins didn't want another baby, I'm like are you kidding me!!

When they both found out I told people I'm not giving my baby up they tried to harass me about it  so I blocked there numbers and cut all ties to them.

Fast forward to September I was due On the 29th of October and another cousin( who is actually EA's daughter and EC: older half sister) and close friend of mine wanted to throw a baby shower for me and other pregnant cousin, Our other cousin said no, I agreed and she started planning before she sent out invitations I asked her not to put her mother and sister on there and she agreed, she's had problems like mine in the past so she knew what I was going through with them and hadn't spoken to then since her youngest was a baby. When The day of the baby shower arrived While everyone was showing up I noticed EA and EC had snuck in when they were asked what they were doing there they said they had been invited, but when guest were asked to come they were told to bring invitations whit them so we could mark them off ass they came in, EA AND EC refused to prove they were invited it's took us about 20 mins to get them out of my backyard, as they were pushed out EC screams "" IT'S MY CHILD I DESERVE TO KNOW, YOU WILL NEVER RAISE THAT CHILD"". At this point I'm beyond in a joyous mood that I hardly smiled the rest of the time people were there, I hardly smiled when it was announced we were having our forth girl, I just couldn't smile to know that 2 family members were trying to steal my child scared me, I didn't want to think of something like that I wanted to enjoy every moment I had before she was born.

Over the weeks leading up to her due date we say pictures of girl nurseries on Instagram they had both posted saying how they couldn't wait to meet "" Paige"" That's what they named MY baby ""Paige"".

And I became supper depressed As they proven to be very narcissistic and Psychopathic in the past I had no Idea what they were planning. I missed my due date by a week and when It' came to going to the hospital I was terrified, Every Black car we passed on the ride to the hospital I got more nervous.

I ended up in labour for an agonising 7 hours before our little girl was born. After she was born My husband texted family members but told them we will let them to know when we will have visitors.

It took EA and EC 20 hours after the baby was born to arrive to ""collect their baby"". When they walked in they both had smirks on their face, My husband woke up and went and stood in their way. when they told him to move he wouldn't so EC went to get a nurse when EC came back with then nurse EA  told the nurse we had agreed to be a surrogate couple for daughter who couldn't have kids and said we had all of a sudden changed our minds and wouldn't hand our daughter to them to take home and the nurse asked them to so documents for this surrogacy and they told her we didn't want forms, and that's when I burst into tears I told the nurse it was all lies that this was our child and for months on end they had told some family and friends we were giving up our child to them, Which them EC said "" lies"" and calling me a baby for crying about it, My husband went onto explain they had been harassing us for months about giving a baby up to them and that  it's our only option the nurse left and went to make a phone call when she got back she told EA and EC as she had called the police and they need to stick around and show them since stealing a baby wasn't going to get them anyway, I have a feeling she knew they were lying from the start because she was pissed. They said no And the nurse said on well and left them room both EA and EC both smirked at me again and EC said now hand her over she's our now. and when I refused they started walking towards us, EA grabbed the baby out of the arms and my husband went to go find the nurse again and when the nurse reappeared she said the cops were on their way up both EA and EC stood frozen before running out of the room when the police arrived, four officers, 2 went to find EA and EC and two stayed behind and questioned us we game them our statements then they went to talk to the nurse she game them a statement the officers said they found EA and EC not far from the hospital where they were questioned they denied everything and a couple days later we sent the text messages to the officers to see, In which they still denied several family members came forward and told them there story. In which then charges were laid even After all this happened they managed to get the court date dropped back and have on many occasions still text me and harass me about giving them ""their baby"", always allow them selves to show up at my hose unannounced they do this when my husband works and I'm at home alone  because according I need help, They shouldn't even be talking to me or my husband, I already have filed a police report and restraining order but they keep going.

I know this might be all over the place right when I'm anxious I don't always make sense, and I'm sorry for it being so long.

736,"My (20F) sister's (28F) behaviour towards my boyfriend (21M) is horrendous.

This is going to be long. I'm warning you. I'm angry. I'm frustrated and I'm shaking. I need to write it down and hear some advice.

My sis is just so creepy towards my bf. I can't take it anymore. She was really spoiled by my parents when she was young because she was their first child. She always WANTS everything and when we were little, she always used to steal my toys/books/clothes etc. I was never allowed to touch any of her things but she constantly stole my stuff and was always rude to me. My mom for some reason has always preferred her over me and thus, most of the time, I was told to let it go.

Due to this, I have lots of resentment towards her and I don't really like her. I'm honestly sick of her behaviour, and I just want some peace and quiet in my house. 

My mom called me two weeks ago, pleading to let my sis stay with me because she doesn't have a job right now and she can't stay alone during quarantine. Both my parents are high risk. My mom has heart problems and my dad is asthmatic. So I thought I should let her stay with me and my bf instead of letting her go to my parents in case she infects them. There's been a few cases where she is so I didn't want to risk it.

Now I'm honestly starting to regret it. Her behaviour is creepy and strange and downright disgusting. First of all, she doesn't respect me at all. She's constantly ignoring me while having long talks with my boyfriend. She doesn't leave my boyfriend alone!

She flirts with him and constantly tries to touch him by using cheap tricks. When we watch movies, she pushes me away and tries to snuggle with my boyfriend. She slaps his butt when he walks by and loudly tells him how he has a ""perky little butt"" She also runs her fingers through his hair everyday saying ""Whoaaa your hair is so soft"" or some shit like that. WHAT THE FUCK. 

These are all just excuses to touch him. She just needs a chance. Another thing she does is ask him if he has abs so she can touch his torso. Or say ""did you see this thing I lost, maybe it's in your pocket let me see"" and proceed to pat his thighs. 

One time she wanted help with hooking her bra and she just fucking walks out in her underwear. She came to our room and my boyfriend was in the bathroom. The logical thing to do is just fucking ask ME I'm her sister! But what does she do? She just waits for my boyfriend and asks him instead even though I'm sitting right there!

I think I looked VERY upset because my boyfriend just told her no and she went back to her room. She didn't try that again.

This is not even all. My boyfriend and I can't even talk to each other without her interrupting us. She barges into our room with no warning. A few days ago, we were trying to have sex and I don't know how the fuck she realized it and starting banging on the door claiming to have a headache. 

I opened the door and asked her what was wrong. I told her I had pills for it but she just said she doesn't trust me and she wanted to talk to my boyfriend instead. After disturbing us, she was suddenly completely fine and her headache disappeared miraculously. She just came into our bedroom and started talking to my boyfriend. We were literally half naked and there was no way she didn't know! 

This is driving me crazy. What does she want? Why is she like this? It's not like I didn't talk to her. I was so angry she interrupted us because she has been doing this since she came here. I was feeling horny and angry. I just told her to get out and that we needed some alone time. I don't want to go into details but we had a small argument and she started crying. 

The thing is she never accepts it! She's completely blind to what she's doing. She denies doing it and sheds tears which ends up making me feel bad instead.

My boyfriend is so uncomfortable by all of this. He just looks exhausted all the time. He's trying his best to be nice but she's all over him all the time. He's usually very introverted/shy/quiet. He's not very confrontational and I know this is bothering him. When I talked to him about it, he just commented that it was a bad idea to invite her to stay here. He also said not to invite her ever again.

I want to know why she is like this. How can I make her see what she's doing? I'm done dealing with her. I don't want to see her ever again, but she's my parents' favourite child and no matter how hard I try, I can never escape her. Whenever I try to cut contacts with her, my mom calls me and begs me to forgive her. My mom doesn't want to see her daughters fighting with each other and she always says how she wants us to be together forever.

But I can't do this. How am I supposed to deal with this? Can someone please tell me. My mom is always taking my sister's side in everything and it's always me who has to be ""understanding"" and ""smart"" and ""older"" when I'M THE YOUNGER ONE HERE!

Please tell me I'm not overreacting. How do I make my mom and sister realize that I'm sick of dealing with this?

740,"I will give a rundown of my skills. I have created a very simple mobile app, in swift, with the help of a professional software developer. I have created a website by myself using Python as a back-end, I handled my own API call to Google to get google sheets working with the software. Basically, it is a interscholastic data visualization tool that, when granted access to the google sheet file, allows you to update the data available to the graphs dynamically. I have a theoretical background in linear algebra and differential equations in Matlab. I am currently attempting to create an image analysis tool for my research, which tracks bubble sizes in a video and outputs an excel document with the area of each bubble over time. I have concrete future plans to further my coding skills. I am being offered two internships basically, and these are the tasks for the one I am considering:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Move from Ionic 3 to Ionic 5

\- Upgrade the existing code

\- Make it cloud-based.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Map integration

Integrate Google / Airport maps so that at any given time, users can slide up the screen and see on a map where they are located (neighborhood map if they’re in town, airport map if they’re in the airport area, continental map if they’re flying).

&amp;#x200B;

3) Crowdsourcing

Implement the crowdsourcing screens that enable us to know when a passenger enters a waiting line (check-in, security, passport control…).

&amp;#x200B;

4) Motion analysis algorithm

In case the user doesn’t crowdsource the information, analyze the specific movements of passengers in waiting lines (serpentine shape, sequences of Stop for a short time / Walk a few steps) to determine a posteriori when exactly a user entered the line.

&amp;#x200B;

5) Geofencing

Use beacons to determine when a passenger enters or exits specific airport areas (check-in, security, customs…).

&amp;#x200B;

6) Go-to-gate reminder

The go-to-gate reminder feature gives an alert to passengers in the terminal area to go back to the boarding gate.

\- Measure and store the average walking speed of passengers from the moment they enter the airport area.

\- Based on the actual passenger location, calculate time needed to go back to gate

\- Fetch boarding time (updated in real time)

\- Implement slider to take into consideration user preference.

743,"Due to the lockdown and being furloughed, I am effectively in my room for 22-23 hours a day, walking for about an hour every day, going into the kitchen to prepare food, etc. My room only has 1.5mx2m (at the widest points - not a square) of usable, empty space in the middle, with my bed and storage pushed as close to the walls as they well go. I don't have room for a desk, and a chair that cannot fold is not practical as I won't be able to work out or navigate through if I have to push it around all the time. I just bought a [camping chair](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zDDsg9TrL._AC_SX569_.jpg) because it folds, but it slopes at a pretty obtuse angle and it's just a different kind of tension on my back, and doesn't help at all. I have been switching between lying down, sitting crosslegged (which, after some reading, might be why my back hurts quite this much - but it's what's natural and comfortable for me), and leaning back against a pile of pillows I have put together.  My lower back has always been tense, but now it is almost solid - I can't twist out the knots at all, and a hand held massager hasn't touched it either - but that could also be because it's on my back and I can't get the angle right.

I can't use other rooms in the house, and my room already uses the space as practically as possible.

744,"I'm an RN. 

I work at a hospital that apparently is well known for having toxic units and culture. I transferred from a good unit (the only good unit) to the ICU. Everyone warned me not to go, but I really wanted to for my career. I aspire to be a CRNA, so it's necessary to be in the ICU.

Anyway, this hospital is the highest paying out of any in my state. The benefits aren't fantastic but the pay makes up for it--on average, it's $15-20/hr more than neighboring hospitals around. It's also within walking distance of my apartment. I've been in this hospital for a year.

I was horribly bullied when I began working. A lot of lies and rumors were spread about me and how I treated my patients. Management actually had to pull security footage because my co-workers, the ones who actually precepted me, said I was ignoring my patients and performing dangerous interventions, as well as being mean. When management reviewed the tapes and my charting, it was determined to be false.

Next, stuff of mine went missing. Nice trauma shears, a Littman. No one fessed up.

Once I got HR and management involved, the bullying seemed to die down for a few months. I switched to night shift and things got better. But recently, we all got raises based on market analysis of how we're paid. I recently obtained additional certifications and my master's, so I got a huge payraise. I also had been taking on extra overtime to help pay for a vacation (that won't happen, thanks covid). 

My co-workers noticed I was making a lot in overtime (it's double time) and started to complain. My hours were drastically cut, and my shifts started to be cut as well. Management said it was due to covid. Some other co workers were cut as well, but no where near mine. We aren't union.

I've come down with horrible migranes and been vomiting before I go into work now, due to how stressed I am. I know I need to quit, but the only thing keeping me there is the pay. I would take a massive paycut going to another hospital.

At what point is it time to jump ship and take the pay cut vs staying and trying to make things better?",28Apr2020,1

I left everything what and who I love behind because of him. I was always surronded by friends and family. I had so many hobbies and goals that I wanted to reach ... and I also had hopes I will find the same happiness here too but the reality is very different. I had to wait 1,5 year to became a resident of the country which means I could not work at all which means zero income, drive a car even to a grocery store or travel internationaly to at least visit my family at all... I was just stuck in the house like in a jail with a terrible, selfish housmate for the whole damn time. From being a positive, happy person with a great future I become nobody here. We have zero friends. My husband does not have any people to hang out with or any interests besides working or napping. We live in a terrible stereotype for years ..

Marriage is not the happiest neither - we've faced so many problems since we got married (financial problems, uncertain future, hard times with our housemates, unemployment, loneliness, homesickness, there was an alcohol addiction for a while from his side, lying, trust issues and so on. We solved all of it somehow and the relationship is a bit better, but we still live like two friends than husband and wife. I have been thinking about divorce and moving back home. He is a good guy. It just feel like we are not happy together anymore.

After years of living with the people in the same house (that everytime make sure I know I don't belong here) I had to leave the toxic house just to keep my psyche balanced. I found a place where I can live for a while in peace. The only thing is that my husband stayed in the house with those housemates and did not even suggested going with me. On top of everything I have been through (I don't want to go into details what else goes terribly wrong in my life) I started to feel depressed, lonely, sad and tired of my life. I gave up on every single goal I wanted to reach because I can't reach it here in this country. Because I am not a citizen. And I don't want to spend the rest of my life being unhappy and going to work that I personally hate because it degrades me since I know I can do better. I know I can do my dreamjob in my country and be perfectly satisfied. But not here. Plus it's pandemic now and I even lost the only job I had.

I am stuck now and I don't know what to do. I feel like I should return back to my home country even though I became a resident only couple of months ago. I know, deeply in my mind, I would not be happy here anymore. There are only two options - moving back to my homecountry alone and start again or staying here and be unhappy for the rest of my life.

751," 

Hey guys! First post here, i need some help. (Sorry for my bad english)

I have two dogs, they are mixed breed (mongrel is the word?), medium sized.

One  of them, the female, is very sweet to other dogs but a little bit shy.  The other one, male, is VERY agressive against other dogs.

The  problem is that now they are living in a hostel that i have, and, since  the hostel is closed hence the covid pandemic, they can stay here. But,  i'm not living in this hostel, i'm living in a house that's near the  hostel, that is separated by a fence, very close.

Here  in this ""land"" or ""lot"" that i live, my father in law has a house too,  and he has two dogs, one belgium shepard male who is SUPER sweet to  other dogs, and one dachshund male who is VERY agressive against other  dogs.

The problem is: Once the  pandemic is over, the hostel is going reopen. When my female dog is  ""locked"" in a space or in a chain, she cries and screams ALOT! The place  that they are now in the hostel is great and have alot of space, but  has as fence. Everytime she is in this place and see us outside she  cries and barks. When the hostel is fully active, i cannot have her  there because its going to wake up all my guests.

So im thinking in bringing my two dogs down here in this ""land, lot"". But here we have two more dogs (from my father in law).

My  female dog and the belgium shepard are super kind to each other, but my  male one is agressive against the belgium and the dachsund. (and the  dachshund is agressive against him).

Since it has a fence that divides this two ""lands, lots"", when the dogs see each other they start to bark and growl.

Im  trying to introduce them by taking to a walk, individually. I use the  choke chain to correct my dog, since i paied a dog trainer to train them  a while ago, and he said that the choke chain is the best leash to  correct dogs. They improved alot, because before we couldnt walk them  out because they pulled us alot.

When  my male dog sees the dachshund on the street they started barking to  each other, and since my dog uses the choke chain he eventually get  choked but he DOESNT STOP trying to attack him.

What  can i do? IM thinking of taking my dog to the vet to get neutered  (castrated, i dont know the word) so maybe he cant get calmer.

When  the pandemic is over i need to get them both out of the hostel and  bring them here, but im afraid they are going to fight. My male dog is  medium sized and he is very strong.. he can kill the dachshund  in one  bit. Thats what im afraid of.

What is the best way to introduce them? Im walking them on the street but its not working..

So I went down and made myself a plate of whatever she’d made and she comes down again, tells me that “I should just take your plate away and throw it in the trash”.

Recently they've been non-stop messaging me and I have ignored them all because I'm fed up of trying to salvage this friendship and tired of all the excuses they give me, saying 'I do not know what its like to be them'.

763,"Ok so my mom has some cognitive difficulties and is on disability pension here in Canada.  She isn't by any means ""dumb"" and you wouldn't really know that she has difficulty with cognition and comprehension unless you really spent some time with her.  She is also an active alcoholic who suffers from depression, anxiety, and severe childhood trauma.  Despite her struggles she is very kind, sweet and generous to anyone she meets, (unless you piss her off, then watch out - you're in for an earful...)

Because of her mental difficulties she hasn't been able to find a relationship with a man who doesn't want to just use her for sex or her small amount of guaranteed disability money per month, etc...  Men use her as pawns in their life for their own gain. At one point, a guy managed to isolate her from her daughters and family 1hr away from the closest town and tried to kill her... She has been THROUGH it.

Rightfully so, because of her many horrible partners who have just used her/manipulated her, she is becoming a bit wise to it - finally.  She texted me the other day wanting some advice.

Her newest ""boyfriend's"" name is Jamal.  He is supposedly a landed immigrant from Jamaica.  He has also supposedly had his wallet stolen.  He has asked if she would send money on his behalf to someone (he says family) back in Jamaica via Western Union.  Apparently Western Union needs you to provide ID to send money.  She has never used this kind of money wire service before (neither have I,) and she was worried that her name could be attached to dirty money or that the money he is sending is for nefarious purposes. As such, she asked me if I thought it was OK to do.  I told her that I don't think she should do it because he isn't being very forthcoming about what the money is for, where it is going, why he doesn't just try to get his ID replaced, etc...

I happened to be at her house yesterday when he stopped by.  Mom asked Jamal to explain to me what it is he needs from her and why he needs her to do it after only knowing her for a short time, (a few weeks maybe.)  He got defensive and went on a man-splaining rant about ""trust"" that really rubbed me the wrong way.  He wanted to know why my mom's kid is involved in her personal life - another red flag...

Bottom line I really don't like this guy, and even if he is a legit person trying to send legit money to his family, he is being a real jerk. He continues to ""work on her"" to try to get her to send this money on his behalf and i'm so annoyed.

I’ll get straight to the problem. About four months ago, my friend adopted a 2 months old kitten (and had to pay around 300$ for the vaccs and surgery), but soon after that he had to suddenly move out and there was no space for the kitten, so i volunteered to keep him with me til he figures things out. 

Its been 4 months since that happened, and the cat is 6 months old now. Throughout that time, my friend never asked about the cat, didn’t buy him food and other necessities like we agreed when i first took him in, and it seemed to me like he completely forgot about it.

I love this cat dearly and have spent over 200$ for his food, litter, toys and other things. Last night, my friend contacted me saying that he wants his cat back and that shocked me and i still haven’t texted him back. 

I do not want to give the cat away, that would break me. i thought of two options, i either pay him the 300 dollars that he spent on the cat, or make him pay 170$ (for the necessities that i bought for the cat, excluding the toys, scratchers and treats)

772,"Im 21 and in a relationship with a wonderful man. Our situation is stressful as we live apart and are waiting on a visa.

773,"Note:this is posted for a person on quora. She is posting through me. She will receive your answers.

There is a person named J. J has given me a lot of red flags. Not sure if this is verbal harassment or not.  Please tell me if each red flag is verbal harassment.

\-Makes dirty jokes in front of me. I think that J wants me to hear them and laugh, it seems like he's just being discreet by talking to friends.

\-Has a nickname for me, which, among his friend circle, means something inapropriate. not sure what tho.

\-In our school, it is common courtesy that when you pass by someone.in a tight space, you turn your crotch away from them. J, however, finds himself in situations where he will pass through the tight space between my chair and the wall a lot, not sure on purpose or not, and always turns his crotch towards me. Not in a way that J actually touches me, but still just seems a bit off.

\-he will touch my chair so his arm is against my back on the passings listed above.

\-he seems to actually make a lot of little excuses to touch me, but they don't work.

\-All the boys, when talking about inappropriate stuff about the girls, they will say ""Imagine x..(inaudible dirty phrase here)"", however, never in front of the girls, which is nice of them. He did this, about me, while he knows I was listening 2 feet away. And he was very clearly trying to make me hear the first part(the ""imagine x"" part).

\-He likes to randomly have one sided conversations with me the halls, and he gets pretty close to my side. He gets closer as he talks to me. I guess he's trying to make it look to everyone else like we are close. I avoid him and try to walk faster, but he does not take the hint, even though he can tell it's there. 

\-Occasionally these chats will happen when there are not any people around. These chats in particular just scream all kinds of fishy to me.

Is this verbal harassment? What should I do?",28Apr2020,1
774,"I [26F] have been friends with this girl [27F] for over 10 years. We met in high school, remained friends when we went off to different colleges. I was one of her bridesmaids and was asked to be her maid of honor when she was getting married. (I rejected being maid of honor).

During the past 3 years, around the same time she asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding, I started to feel soured by the friendship. For the longest time, I considered her one of my closest friends and a best friend. During these past 3 years, I’ve been strongly reconsidering the friendship and where I stand with her. I started to examine that during really difficult and struggling times in my life, she would make the situation worse or even blame me.

I think the one situation that really keeps me coming back to reevaluating the friendship is that I was in a extremely stressful situation involving my ex. I confessed to her aspects of the relationship after harboring it for over a year at the time to try get help to leave the situation. (This was back when I was 19). When I told her, she went back to my ex and told him what I said to her. She said it was because she had become friends with him too and he deserved to know what I said. As a result, it didn’t help my situation and I ended up struggling for another 8ish months until I got the help I needed. 

After this situation was said and done (about a year after the situation occurred) I confronted her about what she did. She told me that she only believed 80% of what I was saying and that she needed to hear his side to figure out if I was lying or not. She said that he was her friend too, and that she believed he had a right to know. In the moment, I didn’t know how to respond to it.  

This is a person that I have been there for since day 1 of our friendship. I helped her and supported her through very struggling times in her life. I don’t expect her to have to do the same for me, especially where I am now in this point in life. However, I’m worried about her response to the situation. She acted as if she did nothing wrong. She basically told me that I was the one over exaggerating and that he was more believable. She said that she’ll believe about 80% of what I said, but will never fully believe me because he was so convincing and he’s “too kind” to be the way I described him to be back then. 

I don’t expect her to believe me. I can’t expect to control her feelings or opinions. I think my goal of writing this is to see if this friendship is even worth salvaging. I don’t think I can continue being her friend if that’s how she stands about this particular issue. She was supposed to be my best friend and I needed someone’s help. I can forgive her for not helping me back then because it was a bad situation, but I don’t think I can forgive or get past the idea that she thinks I made some of that stuff up. 

I don’t want to confront her about it, because to be honest, I don’t know if she’s still in contact with this ex. She IS the type of person that I believe would talk to him if I confront her about it now, even after all time. I can’t verify if she’s still associated with him on social media because I have him blocked on absolutely everything. But if she is, even if it’s just his phone number, there is a strong possibility that she would contact him and try to say it’s to help him and I “mend things”. Even if she’s told, “you have to keep this between us”, I know from multiple past experiences that she won’t. She will do what she thinks is best so everyone will get along. 

So, in your opinion, do you think this friendship is salvageable? I know the best way would be to talk to her, but I’ve already told myself I can’t because it could lead to a bunch of unforeseeable, possibly chaotic issues.

I’m trying to move on from all of it especially because of where I am now in my life, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to do so as time goes on.

TL;DR: I’m questioning a long term friendship I’ve had for over 10 years. She has done multiple things to question the friendship. One instance in particular, she betrayed my trust and as a result, greatly worsened my situation at the time. I keep on going back and forth on my opinion of the friendship and if it’s even salvageable.",28Apr2020,1
775,I called/texted the guy I bought it from and the number is disconnected. I'm aware he probably scammed me and sold he his work laptop that he wasn't authorized to sell in the first place. Will a hard reset fix this? Or am I screwed? It's a 2017 MacBook Pro.,28Apr2020,1
777,"I am an international student who just finished his 2/4 year of Uni in the UK. This last year was probably the loneliest I've been in my life and it made me have second thoughts about everything. I do have friends and all, but the cultural differences made it quite difficult to socialize and enjoy my time there. I already have everything set up there. Me and my friends we are getting a flat together, I'm half way through my studies and I like the course. It's just I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad either, but I'm not happy.

Before shit went down with Covid-19, my parents flew me back to my home country, Mexico. In the plane I met a girl that is literally everything I ever wanted we've been talking for almost 6 weeks or so.
She's amazing, I'm starting to feel something for this girl, but since I don't know what to do with my life, I don't know how to deal with her.

In México I have my close group of friends and if I stay I'm sure we would be able to get a flat for ourselves. My family is here as well and uni is not bad either. However, I'm not entirely happy living there, the country is a mess and I don't see my self having a life there on the first place. (That's why I went studying abroad) 

And to make things more complicated for myself... I have always wanted to live in Spain. Before meeting this girl I had already founded some universities that have the same course I'm studying in the UK. The problem is that those university are not as recognised as the ones in the UK or in México. So my parents don't really like the idea of me going there.

So...
Right now I don't know what I want or what is best for me so I'm asking for advice...
1.- I could finish my degree in the UK with my life all setup. Not knowing if I'd be happy or not. 

2.- I could go back to my home country,  I would be year or a term behind on uni. get a flat with my friends and give it a shot with this girl. And when I finish the degree figure something out to get out of here.

3.- I could go to Spain, miss.my chance with this girl. Not being in the best uni. But being in a place that I actually want to be and live. And start my (social) life over basically

Other points that I thought about:

-In the UK or in Spain I would be way more independent than in Mexico, since my parents are very strict with some things. (I don't mean doing drugs or any sort of thing like that. It's just being in another country I'm not forced to meeting them. And If I was in Mexico I know they would want to see me a lot. ((Which that I don't really want, I want my space)) 
- Universities in Mexico and Spain have different studying methods than in the UK. (UK is more like independent project work. Mexico and Spain is a lot of studying and exams and essays and a bunch of different classes that are not specific to the course.) 
- Spain and Mexico are probably 1/3 of the price of living in the UK
- the girl lives 2 hour away from me
-I 'know' people in Spain but I don't have any friends there really.
-If shit flops with this girl, my friends already wanted to set me up with some of their friends
- In the UK my friends are very antisocial. They are fun and all but as I mentioned over all I felt lonely that year.

778,"I made a post abt this on the subreddit to the college im considering but i guess I want the opinions of other ppl as well bc im still struggling to make a choice. 

Essentially I have two options: attend my state school for free or attend an out of state school in boston for 10k a year. 

Now, out of those 10k a year I can afford to pay 5k out of pocket so ill end up with 20k dollars of debt at the end of it all. In order to afford this I will have to work part time and during summers. 

The difference is that the out of state school is objectively much better than the instate school. It has a 98% job placement rate in the field im interested in w a starting salary of 80-100k. It is also in boston and I have always wanted to live in the city. Apart from that it has a pretty good student community and generally is what I vibe with. They also have a ‘co-op’ program in which you work full time for a semester and the average salary for that in my field is 25-35$ so some ppl are able to pay some of their loans off with it. 

If i stayed in state i wld likely focus more on saving money so that I can leave eventually than my actual academics, and im scared ill lose motivation to actually get where I want to, career wise. If I go out of state I will have to juggle part time work and a courseload, i will also lose flexibility due to possible financial constraints. 

I kind of already made the choice to go to boston but as Im nearing may 1st (enrollment deadline) I am beginning to feel less secure about it. I dont want to make a choice that will leave me in a financially comprised position for longer than I can predict. What do you guys think? Am i making the wrong choice?",28Apr2020,1
779,"Recently I have found myself really unsatisfied and bored of life.

Everything in my life seems to be okay (finances and relationships are good etc..)
There doesn’t seem to be any problems I could associate with my current feelings.

However I can’t shake this feeling like I’m just existing as opposed to living (if that makes sense), I struggle to get excited about anything and it’s taken a very large toll on my motivation.

There are a lot of things I want to change in my life, but I almost feel like they are pointless as I don’t get any satisfaction from making any changes.

I do take anti depressants, however these have vastly improved my overall outlook on life. So I don’t believe this is a side effect.

782,"Hi Reddit, this is my first post so please allow for any formatting mistakes you might see. Also, I’m writing this just after hearing about something that this ex has done so this might be a bit all over the place. 

As you have probably gathered from the title, my current girlfriend has a scumbag ex and she has just told me something he is currently doing that is really causing some damage to her mental health and is just outright scary. 

First I’ll list a bit about the ex. He is easily the worst guy I’ve ever heard of. He used to: frequently beat the shit out of her when they were together, damage/destroy some of her possessions (many of which left to her by her late grandfather who she lived with), pressure her into performing sexual acts with him that she was not comfortable/did not consent to, mentally blackmail her (saying he would kill himself if she left). 

These issues have continued to carry over into my gf and my relationship to this day. He still sends her death threats via letter. Most shocking of all the things he has done since the breakup, about 6 months ago when we got together the psycho ex hit my gf with a brick. You can probably imagine, I want to see this guys suffer in the most inhuman way possible. This sick twisted man has hurt her in so many ways and I don’t know how to cope with it. 

Anyway, the reason for this post, is that today I found out he took pictures of my gf asleep and naked. He now (the past month or so) has been threatening to expose these pictures if my gf does not pay him money. He is currently not asking for a lot of money but obviously this could very quickly change. 

My gf suffers extreme anxiety and used to see a therapist (she can no longer afford the sessions). The amount of anxiety attacks she has been inflicted with recently has skyrocketed and I’m trying my hardest to be there for her. Due to her anxiety, she is too scared to go to the police regarding her ex (partly due to their complete lack of competence after the brick incident). She has already paid the ex twice to stop him releasing the photos but there seems to be no letting up in the blackmail. 

I have no idea if there is anyone on here who is in/ has been in any sort of similar situation. I’d be very grateful for any advice on what I can do to fix the situation. Please bear in mind my gf has told me very few details about this ex (I only know his name and couldn’t find him on social media so I have no idea what he looks like) so making any sort of case with the police without her is pretty much impossible. She has outright forbid me from going to the police regarding this. I am absolutely terrified of what he’s going to do to her next and I just want to protect her.",28Apr2020,1

785,"About 8 months ago, I broke up with a guy I’d been with for 8 years. I decided I wanted to focus on myself so I put off dating for 3 months. I was mostly at work, at the gym, and with friends during that time. Then, I got asked on a date by a stranger (guy#1). I was very upfront with him and told him I wasn’t interested in a relationship. He said “that’s totally fine. How about we just go to dinner and see where things go?” I thought sure, why not. We went to dinner and had a nice time. We met up one more time for drinks and he said he really liked me and wanted it to be more serious. I repeated what I’d said to him when we first met and told him we shouldn’t see each other again since it’s obvious we want different things. *The only thing we ever did was kiss*

About a month later I was in another city for work and a guy asked me out (guy #2). I only had 3 weeks left before heading back home, which he knew, but I said yes. We went to dinner and had a nice time (again, just kissed). Although I don’t live in that city, it’s pretty close and I travel there often. We did meet up once about a month after I left and had sex. I felt a physical attraction to him but not an emotional one.

Now that I’ve given the background info, let me get back to the main story! Like I said before, I was in a different city for work and I was set to leave in about 2 weeks. I hadn’t had sex in months and I really wanted to. I took a leap and posted on reddit with a description of exactly what I was looking for in this hookup. Hundreds of responses flooded my inbox and it took about a week to sort through every single one of them. From all of them, I responded to about 10. From those 10, about 5 responded back. And from those 5, I clicked the most with one of them (guy #3). We decided to meet up a few days later at a coffee shop. We talked for about 1 hr and then went back to my place and had sex. It was great and just what I needed. And after it was over, we both played it cool and went our separate ways. We tried meeting up for sex one more time but the timing just didn’t work. 

I flew home and got back to my routine of work and the gym. Like I mentioned in the previous post, I did end up meeting up with guy #2 again and we went to an event and then had sex. But besides that, nothing had changed. I still didn’t want a relationship and I was happy just doing the things I enjoyed. Guy #3 and I would text briefly (ex. Hey, how are you?) once in a while and sometimes sext but I never thought much of it. Then, this past weekend, we were texting and he said he was stressed out with work and the quarantine so I told him if he ever wanted to talk on the phone or FaceTime, I’d be happy to talk to him. He said “how about now?” It was about 10pm when we started FaceTiming and we stayed talking until about 3am. Although it seems like a long time, it didn’t feel like 5hrs at all. We talked about everything- family, work, past relationships, food, future goals. It wasn’t until we finally hung up that I had this feeling like I didn’t want it to end. We texted all day the next day and made plans to see each other again once the quarantine was over. I’m really excited but I’m also nervous and scared. I wish I knew how he felt about me. Did the call change anything for him? Does he really only see me as a friend to hookup with? Or would he ever want to go on a date and see if it could be more? I wish I knew why I felt this way about him when I hadn’t felt this way about any of the other guys. What makes him so special and is it worth pursuing?",28Apr2020,1
786,"So scrolling through Insta last night, I (16M) found my friend's (15M) story. It said something to the effect of ""someone be my boyfriend when quarantine is over :("" and I responded with ""I mean..."" To provide some clarity, I'm gay (or something), and he is trans and gay. I had a crush on him for a bit last year, but never said anything about it. Since, I've liked a different guy for a few months, but I know that's probably going nowhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I responded to his story, I deleted my message, panicking a bit because I really don't do that much. Apparently he still saw it, and replied with ""haha what"" and I desperately tried to backtrack; I eventually told him I thought I had once liked him, but not to take that for too much because I didn't know anything back then, about what I felt about myself or anything else. We dropped it and talked about animal crossing for ten minutes before I escaped by saying I had to go sleep.

I don't really know why I panicked so hard. I've never been in an irl relationship; I had a few online long distance things but I couldn't deal and l always let those go after like a day.

787,"TL;DR: I have trauma related to my dad's abuse of pot and now I'm terrified when people smoke. How can I get over that fear?

Hey Reddit,

**Background**: My dad smoked A LOT when I was a kid and still does, and I know people say that weed is amazing and all that, but believe me, it had profound negative effects on our family life and my relationship with my dad. I remember being a kid and telling him I was hungry and he'd laugh in my face, too high to care about his (back then) only child. I remember that one time he pushed me out of his way and didn't care that I hit my head against the wall when he couldn't find his lighter. I remember how angry mom was when I told her he had taught me how to roll a joint so I could do it for him when he was too high to do it himself - I was 7 years old. Like me, my two half-brothers (his two other sons) are also visibly uncomfortable with weed despite being teenagers that weren't raised with me, which I think shows that the problem isn't only in my head. The best article I ever found that captures my experience is this one, if you're interested: [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/my-dad-will-never-stop-smoking-pot/283085/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/my-dad-will-never-stop-smoking-pot/283085/)

&amp;#x200B;

**The situation:** Because of my childhood experience, I'm terrified of weed. This is not a puritain argument, I don't think it's morally wrong - I'm pro legalization and all that. I know the virtues of it too, you don't need to tell me those. My fear is completely irrational, but when someone lights up a joint, I shut down. It's instinct, pure self-preservation. I'll still talk to them, but I'm not here. I'm in a fight-or-flight mode for a couple hours, waiting to be sure it's totally, 100% over, because before then I *can't know* that they won't turn into an unpredictable monster who doesn't care about anyone but themselves, who laugh at their hungry kids, who can't answer basic questions, who refuse to leave the party even when they promised their girlfriend that they'd be home by 3.

The thing is, that's not really viable. This fear is harmful to my social life and to my relationship, since my boyfriend smokes once in a while. I'm legit scared of him when he does, even if I am absolutely no reason to be, and he never gets very high, just ""in the zone"" kinda thing. I've been high before (on edibles, even the idea of smoking makes me feel sick with fear) so I know what it's like, but I can't stomach it. I wish I could just suck it up, but I can't, just like people with a phobia. It's also a problem with friends sometimes; I'll be having fun with a bunch of people and, when someone starts smoking, I often end up leaving because I turn into such an anxious mess that I have no more fun and I don't want to ruin it for the others either.

**What I'm looking for:** I want to get better. I know I don't *have* to be okay with pot, and my goal is not to be able to smoke necessarily, but I wish I wasn't afraid for hours in a row in my own apartment because of what might happen while, in reality, my boyfriend is being pleasant, watching a dumb movie or playing video games, totally able to answer me and hold a conversation because he's only mildly high.

Does anyone have any ideas on how I could desensitize myself? Any type of therapy I could pursue? If you're going to suggest exposure, which I'm open to, any idea or example of a roadmap I could use not to traumatize myself further by going too fast?

Please don't tell me ""your view of weed is completely wrong, wtf weed doesn't do that"" because 1) I know it doesn't for like 99% of smokers, I know I'm wrong here, this is not a rational issue and 2) it actually can do that, it sure did to my dad. Also please don't tell me to just stop hanging out with smokers; I'm in my early twenties in a very liberal city, might as well have no friends.

Thank you, stay safe and smoke reasonably!",28Apr2020,1

I’m still traumatized by this, but I’m trying to get back to normal life despite something wrong happening and not being able to do anything about it....and then I found out I was pregnant. 

I have no job because I was laid off due to covid-19. I’m too emotional to tell the difference if I want to keep the child because I’m lonely where I am, with everyone I know and my family being thousands of miles away....or if I want the revenge and satisfaction of ruining my ex’s life by filing for child support and making him answer for his actions through life consequences and all it entails.

My friends who do know, all tell me to abort, and a part of me feels like if I don’t abort, I could end up in a nightmare custody battle in the future with a man who actually raped me, along with the possibility of him doing it again and getting away with it just like he did the first time. (I have an appointment tomorrow and having second thoughts)

I feel like I’m mentally and financially capable and kind of too much of a mess emotionally to ensure I have what it takes to raise a sane and productive individual... and no one wants to hire a pregnant woman. 

Would I be able to figure out a way to file for child support (or jail time if he refuses) and keep him completely cut off? Would I be able to leave the state to be close to my family, or would I not be able to leave because of the other parent?

793,"Im trying to get over someone, someone who is my life. But they don't care about me in the slightest. Im codependent and impossibly in love with them, but realistically they just see me as the one with a mental health disorder that they need to text back in emergencies because it's their civil duty. I know this is the case, and however much I want them the situation won't change. I need to get over them, because there's someone else who loves me like that who I can't bring to love back the same way because of my obsession with the person in question. I, admittedly, drank the problem away for a bit, but now my mind is stuck on it even while I'm drunk and that's even worse. So now, in a dark place of drunken depression, I need to know: is it better to mourn the fact that this person doesn't care about me, or just try to never think of them again or what? We used to have such a beautiful relationship, they were my closest friend and I was one of their two closest. Now they don't even respond to my texts. Please help me reddit, I'm in a dark place.

794,"So I'm 16. I live in Northern Europe.

The coronavirus hasn't hit my country that hard (luckily), as in the number of deaths, because we locked down pretty quickly after we got our first case, or atleast before it got way out of hand. Of course we're still suffering the economic coin of the situation. So is every country other in the world of course.

My dad doesn't take the whole thing seriously though. He has on numerous occasions made claims that it's not bad and that the goverment and the people are just overreacting. He also made a very messy point about this being a way for the goverment to show how big hearted they are in order to get votes. I tried my best to explain to him, that nobody cares about how big hearted the goverment is, then they struggle meeting ends meat, because they've lost their jobs. I made it clear, that it's about saving peoples lives and families, while of course minimizing the cost of taking such actions. I'm not a ""shell of the state"" either. I'm against the way they don't inform people, about what sectors of society is expected to open first and so on. I'm just aware that politicians take big risky decisions like this, on the knowledge they get from experts from talking to a political party leader in goverment and having been at the parliament several times. 

I'm telling you this so you know our political views. So you can make an assessment on what to due from that.

As stated my dad has made it clear that he doesn't see the Covid-19 pandemic as anything serious. His mum (my grandmother) finished chemo a few weeks ago, after having had stage 4 lung cancer. Happy she made it though as is he of course I asume. Anyways like a week after she finished chemo, he asked if I wanted to go cycling with him, my mum and my grandmother (his mum). I said very clearly ""no, I don't want to! She is at the at risk group. First off, she is 70, and secondly, she just finished chemo. It can take several weeks (3-4 weeks) before you're immune system is at it's normal capacity again."" He asked again this weekend. He ended up not going. This weekend he asked again.  Again I said no, because she is 70, and therefor is at an extra risk of dying from it. I also made it clear, that even if she was younger, I would be very careful about doing exercise with other people. I'm personally okay with chatting online and meeting up with people at places where we can keep our distance (1,5-2 meters). I in general don't hang out around old people or that many people really, for their and everybodies sake.

I just follow the guidelines, that's it. But my dad doesn't really care. How do I get my dad to realize to take responsibility for other peoples lives, including his mothers, his own, my mums and my life? 

Note: Today he also made it clear that he doesn't care if he gets it. And if gets it, my mum and I will most certainly get it, since we're around him most of the day.

800,"I hope this is the right column to post in. I tried looking for one related to the topic, but couldn't find it.
Anyways, I'll make this short and sweet.

My gf, now ex, and I recently signed a year lease on March 1. Unfortunately things are not working out for us and we feel it's best to move on. We have not talked to my landlords yet, however, I'm writing this to find out what my best option is.
If my landlords do not want to work with myself, when we talk to them, and lower my rent to make this place more affordable for myself or work with us in a sense of allowing us to break our rental agreement so a. We can look for someone new to take over the lease and or b. For the lease to get broken and we just give them our months or whatever notice. What would be my best course of action?
Getting myself evicted? Be delinquent on payments? I ask this because I can't not afford the rent on my own for what the place is being rented for. I'd like to know my best course of action and what the reprecussions may be. 

What I was thinking is I would transfer the lease under my name and then try to afford the rent...if I can't then I get evicted and no harm done? Right now with the covid situation I am getting a provincial rent subsidy that allows the rent to be affordable for just myself to pay, however this will run out when I guess the provincial allocations of funds run out. So it could be 2 months or 6 months? After that then I'd let my landlords know that I can't afford rent and so on and so on. Would this be a good course of action?

I reside in the province of BC. 

I called the tenancy board and they said that if my landlords don't agree with what I mentioned in a or b then we can be on the hook for paying a year's worth of rent. Of course they will not tell me other options like I had mentioned. 

Anyone who has been in this position in BC your experiences would be greatly appreciated.

Sidenote: I have looked at our rental agreement and there is nothing really said about breaking lease...I believe it is just the generic BC tenancy agreement.

Summing things up, whenever I do ANYTHING, he finds the smallest detail to say I did it wrong, but when my older sister does THE SAME THING he brushes it off and defends her, for example: she left our whatsapp family group chat because she sent a PDF about the hygiene procedures once coming home from the outdoors, so I replied ""wait, wasn't I exaggerating? lol"" (earlier that week she made fun of me for asking her to wash her hands before touching our food when she came home from work). My dad said I was wrong for ""picking fights"" (?) and then, just to test things out, I left the group chat and he started screaming at me calling me immature (later I went back to the group, it was only a test).

There's no actual sexual assault that occurs in this story, but it kind of relates to something similar, so I guess that's why. However, I think it fits this subreddit as well, though, so here you go.

Warning: this post is extremely long, and takes forever to get to the point. It also contains discussions of child predators.

When I was 16 (just one year ago), I was in an out-of-school creative writing class for kids my age. One of the girls in my class (let's call her Erika) was writing a romance novel, featuring a romance between a 25 year old man and a 16 year old girl. She was a big 50 Shades of Gray fan, so the premise was basically for her to write a YA novel inspired by 50 Shades, (but without cursing or sex scenes so parents will let their kids read it).

The age gap wasn´t the only problem I had with the book. The girl (let's call her Ana) and the guy (let's call him Christian) had a pretty objectively creepy relationship. They weren't even dating - Christian would just kind of stalk Ana (even though she'd tell him to leave her alone), and say things like “I´m not letting go of your arm until you tell me why you´re mad at me” and “I know you´re only wearing that dress because you're insecure and you want me to call you hot”.

Whenever I´d point out any of Christian´s flaws, Erika would just say, “I know he's not perfect, but she´ll fix him,” in pretty much those exact words.

I was literally the only one in the class who had a problem with what she was writing. Other students would only criticize superficial things about her book, (like one guy who said that Christian should have used the word, “pretty” instead of “hot” in the quote above about Ana´s dress.) The teacher was fully supportive of the book, and even argued that the word “hot” should be kept to give the book “edge” (Erika herself made it very clear she found the subject matter completely normal, and wasn't trying to be edgy at all).

However, even though there were problems outside of the age gap, I mainly focused on criticizing the age gap while giving feedback. It ended up turning into a debate about whether that kind of relationship is ok. Literally no one else in the class agreed with me, including the teacher. He actually argued pretty passionately that there is nothing wrong with an adult dating a teenager, and as evidence he said that he knows it's okay because J.D. Salinger did it, and it also happened in some 70s movie (he couldn´t remember the name). Other kids in my class made similar arguments, (with Pretty Little Liars and Vampire Diaries as examples), but at least they were just kids. He was a grown man, and, as a 16 year old girl, it made me kind of uncomfortable knowing he considered that kind of relationship okay.

He also did another thing I found creepy, which was tell us a story about his first teaching job, at a college. He told us that on the first day, he was thinking of quitting, but then, while he was walking around the campus he saw a really pretty girl. When it was time to teach his class, he saw that the girl was one of his students, so he took it as a “sign from the universe” that he was meant to teach there. He tried to pass it off as some deep story about fate, even quoting the Pope to make his point. It was college, so she was probably technically an adult, but I still wasn't comfortable knowing my teacher makes career choices based on whether or not the girls he´s teaching are hot.

Even though my main problem was with the teacher, I mainly criticized Erika, as that's how writer's workshops are set up - you tell students what you think they should change about their books, you don´t call the teacher a pervert. However, I think it got to the point where my criticism came off as more directed towards Erika as a person, than the quality of her writing. I was never trying to insult her - I think the farthest I went was saying that the books/movies/tv shows she likes were a bad influence on her (because she had cited them as reasons she feels the way she does), and that it's messed up that she's trying to write another pedo-y book that will influence other kids the same way. I was told by the teacher and some students that I had gone too far, and I shouldn't be trying to “psychoanalyze her”.

The whole situation was very upsetting to me, so I went to an anonymous-question-asking-site, to vent as well as ask for advice. While describing the situation, I again unintentionally focused more on Erika than the teacher (though I did mention him). This, I think, caused a lot of people to tell me I was overreacting, trying to censor Erika, and that I need to learn the difference between fiction and reality. One person even said something along the lines of, “I was molested as a kid, so I think it's really messed up that you´re pretending to care about pedophilia, when really you just want to shame some kid for her fanfic”.

Though some people did side with me, and told me I should tell someone, replies like that, (as well as the fact that no one in my class was siding with me) made feel like I really was overreacting. Even when I tried to tell my friends, they didn't seem to care. I felt like my opinion was just one arbitrary opinion among many, and it would be messed up if I tried to get that teacher in trouble. I didn't even really believe he would get in trouble, as the age of consent in my state is 16, so he wouldn't have been promoting anything illegal.

When we gave the writing program feedback on our experience, I gave him a low grade, saying that he barely taught us anything (which was true), but not mentioning anything else. So, I guess this “Am I the asshole?” is twofold. Am I the asshole for criticizing Erika the way I did, and am I the asshole for not letting anyone know what was happening?

I´m no longer in creative writing class (that teacher still teaches it), so there's probably nothing I can do at this point, but that whole situation is something I can't stop thinking about. What should I do?",28Apr2020,1

I (16m) have an older brother (19m). When he was 15 he got bullied in school and he gradually distanced himself from our family, which we didn't notice at first. He always was open and had lots of friends, but the bullying broke him and he started to use drugs. After one and a half year he quit school and got a job and everything seemed to get better. 

But then he got a girlfriend. She has many mental health issues and my brother was sort of caring for her. He didn't come home very often and then suddenly, he quit his job and didn't respond to our messages. My mother was devastated and tried to help him to get out of his current situation. But the only thing he cared for is his girlfriend. After a few months it started to look better. He went to school again, to finish hos apprenticeship, but the only thing we heard of him was about his girlfriend. My mother started thinking about what she did wrong, raising him and that really hurt her. You have know, that she is really emotional and want's to make everything right for everyone. When she went to bed I heard her cry many times and my father gave her emotional support.

The next incident was last christmas. Everyone was happy and then his girlfriend called. Her mother, who has also mental health issues, got drunk and they started to scream at each other. My father had to drive him to her, becauses he had to help her. These things went on and on.

Then this year we went on vacation on peru. It was the first time since a year, that my brother didn't see his girlfriend over a week. Everything wenn't alright and some of his old personality showed again, until his girlfriend called him. She had a mental breakdown and it was the first time, my brother couldn't do anything. He was furious. He screamed, shouted and thew stuff around the room. The vacation was ruined for everyone.

And now finally yesterdays incident. At the weekend he called my mother, that he want's to go to a psychiatrist with her. She thought, that he finally want's to talk about what happened to him, when he was bullied, to overcome his mental health issues, but we were wrong. But he said, that he want's to go because of my mother. They often get in arguments and now she thinks again, the she is the cause of the problem. 

Only time sees, what happens next. I myself hope, that he leaves his girlfriend, because i think that she is the root problem of this all. 

Thanks for reading, I just have to tell this story to someone, because I can't stand it to keep it to myself for any longer. 

_. TlDr. _: My brother was bullied, got a job and quit the job because of his girlfriend with mental health issues. Now he cares for her 24/7 and my mother thinks she is the sole problem of everything my brother is going through.",28Apr2020,1
826,"I've been offered a new job that pays about the same as my current job. I feel a little bit guilty about leaving my current job, but they haven't treated me the best and have left me stressed out and burnt out. Should I feel guilty about quitting?",28Apr2020,1
827,"Hi, I've been having this problem for a few years now and would really love some advice from people who read a lot. I used to be a reading fiend, reading whole books in one day, then suddenly I lost interest. Recently I have really wanted to start reading again and so I started reading a book. After a page or 2 my mind starts to wander and as I read my mind is not on the book, I look back and I have no idea what I just read. Could I get some advice on how to focus better? Thank you!",28Apr2020,1
828,"Straight to the point, she is so protective that every time my boyfriend is around us she would roast him just because she knows how much he disappointed me.
          So my boyfriend's girl best friend (I'm pretty sure she hates me) messaged me to make her stop creating competition between her (my friend) and my boyfriend. This turned straight into a blame game and I barely think I'm his baby-sitter not his girlfriend, goddammit. It's not her fault for this but not her business too. 
         My best friend came out to me as a bi right after I did that too so for a long time I thought that she likes me so I didn't mean to make her feel wird. I talked with her  about what my bf and his friend think and I think I made her feel guilty for this. 

        After a few days (she ignored me this entire time) I messaged her to ask how is she doing and she literally asked me back : "" how can I help you?"" 
My heart is broke and I can't stop crying even she acts ok now, but I know that little by little  she is distancing from me and I don't want to lose her.",28Apr2020,1
829,"No one in my family is mature or ambitious--only other person to ever go to college and work on establishing a life-long career is my sister and she just started her journey so she has a long way to go. Furthermore, out of all the people I've met in my university, none of them seem ambitious. If they don't spend their free time doing drugs, drinking, partying, on casual hookups, or playing video games, they're just wildly immature and have no real grasp of reality and what it means to be an adult (hard to blame college students for behaving this way). 

Point being: I've exercised the only advice I've ever gotten and it hasn't gotten me anywhere yet. I've met countless amounts of people, I've reached out to other family members that I haven't really spoken to in a while or ever met, and I've been scouting clubs at my uni, but I have yet to meet a single outspoken, mature, and ambitious individual who has any sort of direction in their life, or at the very least a hobby/study that they are passionate about.

Now that everyone is forced to stay indoors (and therefore, socialize online), what are some good online communities for meeting people that will actually be a good influence on who I am and who I'm becoming?",28Apr2020,1
830,"So to keep things short, I just wanted to get an outside perspective. Basically I  drink some times, mostly when I go out and I do understand some people like to relax and have a beer or a glass of wine etc and that's all good. However since I met my girlfriend and her mum it seems like Wine is the ultimate go to every night, and often it's more than one glass. And I think its wrong? I dont understand the need to drink so much wine and get drunk out of nowhere and not going to lie I did join in at the start to try fit in, but now I feel like it's a bad influence especially on my girlfriend, the whole wine mum culture is a little dangerous, and I can see how my girlfriends mum is also influencing my girlfriend to drink more. Am I thinking too much about this and is not a big deal?",28Apr2020,1
831,"So I'm 29 and I previously went to college but stop going after about 3 years and started massage school.  I'm a little nervous about the state of things and I don't even know if and when I can even go back to work with my job being, very literally, hands on and in such close proximity to people.  I want to look into maybe going back to college but I would probably need it to be entirely online, even if I have zoom classes at a specific time.  I am thinking either business management or some type of marketing major as either of those will also benefit my massage business but will be a good back up plan.  I'm not in a great financial place right now either so price definitely factors into that and accessibility to student loans.  I am in the US, Pennsylvania to be exact and have credits from a community college and a state school if that helps with anything.  So I guess I'm asking does this sound like a good idea to attempt to get a degree? Does which school really matter if a degree is a degree? Does anyone know which schools offer these degrees and which are the most affordable?  Thanks in advanced for any insight!",28Apr2020,1
832,"My name is Molly, but I’ve never liked it. Obviously ‘Molly’ doesn’t really lend itself to a lot of nicknames, so I’ve been trying to think of some more creative options. I really like the sound of ‘Mandy’, but I’m not sure if that’s too much of a stretch. Do you think it’s close enough to ‘Molly’ to be an acceptable nickname? 

Basically, would you think it’s strange if you met someone named Molly who asked to be called Mandy?",28Apr2020,1
833,"Before everything went online, I [M21] was having a good time at college. I had a solid group of friends and groups I was a part of. Despite being fairly introverted, I thrived in friendships when I was doing stuff in a group or hanging out. I’ve never been a huge on texting or snapchat, so most of my interaction would be watching movies with my friends, going to parties, etc.

Being at home so long has exacerbated some of my anxieties, and one is that I don’t have deep enough relationships. I text in a group chat with my friend group and, and earlier in quarantine we would all play video games or just have hangouts online, but with finals coming up that’s dried up for a bit. However, it seems like all of my friends in this group will often text each other or have super deep conversations.

This friend group is a bit newer due to quarantine, and I’m not BFF’s with everyone in it, but even with the people I do talk to it doesn’t feel super *deep*. Like, one of my best friends and I will talk about our shared hobbies or interests like movies and TV, but it’s not too often we’ll talk about the future or relationships, which is something it sounds like all these other people are talking to each other about.

Maybe I’m not putting enough effort in, but a lot of times I’m afraid all my friendships are fake, even if they may not be.",28Apr2020,1

835,"So long story short, 
About 2,5 years ago I had a great group of friends, I was in love with a girl in that group in the very beginning of the groups creation. Before I could even tell her myself, I got friendzoned, I got over it and we actually became very good friends even best friends talking about everything everytime anytime. But the group lasted about 1 year, and eventually due to several fights me and the girl split our ways too. Before the pandemic I saw her at school, but she doesn’t even look at me. 
It’s weird because  sometimes bestfriends  become strangers, but It didnt bother me much. I didnt think about her for about a year, sometimes I’d reminisce about the good old days with friends  but nothing more. UNTIL about 4 weeks ago I started having these dreams with her and a couple of other people of that particular group in them, but slowly they were more centered around her alone. I really don’t like these dreams, could somebody give me some advice or explanation? I keep getting them and it hurts mentally.",28Apr2020,1
836,"If anyone knows any more about this please help me out. I have lived in the same apartment since I was born, I am 21 years old living with my mother and my 2 brothers (one is mentally disabled, cannot work). This apartment is literally falling apart, we have a huge cockroach problem in the building (one literally crawled on my face in my sleep, I just saw one crawling on my brand new shoes). It is overpriced for the condition it is in (almost $1500 a month). I am at my breaking point. I apply for low income housing every so often but never get the lottery. My mother and I are the only ones making money and our combined income is about \~$62,000.

837,"We were FWB for nearly a year, I caught feelings pretty early on despite knowing he didn’t want a relationship. I still settled for the friendship. But long story short I ended up finally cutting contact with him the other day for my own well being.

I thought once I got the guts to cut ties that would be the end of it. But now i feel stuck. How do I move on? I’ve dated other people, none of which have gotten my mind off of him.

838,"I've always loved the idea of joining the military, particularly the Coast Guard, but when push came to shove I decided not to join. I just knew I wouldn't be able to handle it for so many reasons. It's not that I didn't want to serve my country nor that I didn't want to be a member of one of the toughest, most hardworking groups in the world. It's just I was afraid and knew I wouldn't be able to handle it. Nevertheless, I'm still having a hard time, now with dealing with the acceptance of my choice not to join. While I know I certainly have time to change my mind, I still don't really want to join nor do I think I should. If there was a draft to ever happen or if we were to go into another World War, I would definitely enlist, without any hesitation. But as of right now, I just prefer to be a civilian, and pursue another dream of mine, becoming a civil engineer. Still, though, I can't help but feel like I'm letting so many people down and that I'm betraying my country by not joining. I just want to help/support my country and my family, but I feel like the only way to do that was to serve in the military. I feel like a letdown, a disappointment, etc.

What should I do to make it up to my country, to veterans and current soldiers, to my family, and to everyone? What advice might you have? Thank you!",28Apr2020,1

841,"    Para 1. (Long) Listen, I'm NOT looking for somebody to give me a real diagnosis.  I know everyone is gonna say I shouldn't diagnos her on my own but she has secretly admitted she thinks she might have ADHD to her twin sister, my Aunt.  That's bwgat made my Aunt and I think  about the possibility.  I looked up the symptoms and it seems pretty spot on.  Read TLDR at bottom please.

    Para 2.  She has trouble focusing when she gets distracted with something she's doing, she gets way too involved in a simple task that requires low effort, or over exaggerates how difficult the task is.
  
    Para 3.  Like preparing a meal, she has a lot of trouble with it and she avoids cooking meals because it stresses her our.  Example: Last Saturday she was making pancakes for breakfast and she couldn't find a spatula so she started yelling and walking around in a frenzy, my Aunt was in the way so my mom started shouting at her, just like blew up.  My mom screamed my name and I started feeling dread cuz I didn't want to have to go in the kitchen with her acting that way and she said ""Get me the spatula I can't find it the pancakes are burning!!!"" I handed her one and she said ""*No you know you can't use this metal one on that pan because it'll scratch it!!*"" And I said ""Actually no I forgot that."" And she insisted I knew and my Aunt said ""(Mom's name) just calm down!"" It went on like this until a spatula was found and the pancakes were not even burning to begin with.
   
     Para 4.  I mean, she just has the outbursts when she gets stressed over small things and it puts everybody in a bad mood.

    Para 5.  She has difficulty regulating strong emotions (namely stress and anxiety) she is very impatient and forgetful, and has a high temper towards my Aunt, though they have never really gotten along.  She is forgetful, losing her things and then has a tantrum about it and makes my brother (M15) and I look for it.  Now that my brother and I are older we don't have a lot of respect for her because of the way she behaves, and we always tell her to calm down and stop shouting.  She is horrible with time management, she is late to everything, some times 2 hours late for things.  She can't get things done, she forgets to do it or is too stressed to take the task on.  Multitasking? My mother has never heard of such a thing, in other words she just can't cope with doing more than one things at one time.  She gets horribly defense when somebody talks about her faults like being on the bathroom for an hour, or getting too tressed out over simple things, yelling, etc.
    
    Para 6.  She'll be on the toilet whilst on her phone and be there for up to an hour.  One time I was very annoyed at her, I needed to go #1 AND #2 So I was like ""Mom what the frick, other people need to use the bathroom you've been on there for like an entire hour, GET THE FRICK UP."" I said other things and I admit I was disrespectful.  Then she finished and when she got out she grabbed me by the arm and said ""Don't talk to me like that again do you hear me? Yes ma'am."" So I said Yes ma'am and she let me go to use the bathroom.  I think she doesn't want my brother and I to end up like children she hears about on the news, sneaking out at night, drinking and whatnot.
    
    Para 7.  Honestly I day dream about moving out and having my own place all the time.  But I worry about what my mom will do because she has bad health, she is overweight with type 2 diabetes.  I have little respect for her except that I make sure to be respectful to her but in my thoughts I think she is just, Ugh idk. I love her, I don't hate her but she gets on my freaking nerves.  Sometimes I go to my Aunt's house next door and we just vent about her, usually after a fight between my Aunt and mom.  But when she is normal, she's great to be around, she is not abusive to my brother and I, she does not belittle us, hit us, yell directly at us, or force us to do anything absurd.

TL;DR I have a hard time understanding my mom, she has outbursts, and gets stressed out easily.  She is not abusive to my bro and I, but I just want to know how to deal with her seemingly ADHD tendencies.  How do I react, and handle the situation? {READ PARAGRAPH 5 FOR HER ADHD TENDENCIES}",28Apr2020,1

846,"So me and my partner Allison have been together for 9 years this month. We have a two year old daughter. I love Allison immensely. She is kind, funny, honest and beautiful. I love her traits. I am not in love with her anymore and haven’t been for some while.

We’ve not had sex in 2 years. Our personalities have become so polar opposite it’s insane.

So rn I’m a sophomore in high school in Mississippi. I have a 35 on ACT and 4+ GPA. I’m on track to be a National Merit Finalist next year. I participate in swim and marching band at school. I’m also in Beta Club and plan on joint SGA next year. I currently have a 4 on the AP World History exam and am taking the AP gov exam in a few weeks. With all of that said, I am fairly confident that I can get into close to any college I would like (besides probably the highest tier Ivy League schools).

So I have two questions. The first one is pretty small because I am just wondering if I should take the ACT again (I’ve only taken it once) and try to get a perfect score? I don’t think it will make much difference, but I was going to see what y’all think. The second concern is much bigger; I don’t know how to pick out what college I want to go to. My parents are wealthy enough that I don’t apply for any financial aid, but my parents have also told me that they won’t pay excessive amounts of tuition that are required for prestigious schools where I won’t get a scholarship. With that in mind I’ve pretty much narrowed my options down to two paths. I could go to an in-state college (probably MS State or Alabama) and pretty much be paid to attend. I would also probably already know people there. Orrrr I could try to go to a more prestigious big out of state public university like Michigan or UT Austin. I’m not sure how much scholarship I would qualify for in those schools though. Also just as a basis, I would like to move out of state to somewhere more urban that Mississippi (with that said i could still live here in college and still be happy). So I just wanted some advice and to see if y’all had any college recommendations? I’ll be touring colleges once Corona is over so I was just going to see what all should be on the list!!!

850,"My bf (33m) and i(26f) have been together for almost 3 years. Over the weekend, I told him I wasn’t happy and would like to take a step back in our relationship and have him stay at his apartment. (He stayed with me 98% of the time we were together) 

After telling him why I’m not happy in the relationship (he tried to control my friends, my time with my kids, what I wear, when I go to bed, how long I stay in the bath, who I talk to etc just very controlling behavior) and explaining to him, again, that my ex husband displayed the same tendencies that ultimately caused me to leave him too, he openly told me that these issues have been present in every relationship he has had and that other women have left him for the same reason. 

I got really angry when he told me this information. The entire time we have been together I have been up front with all of my issues that could have become an obstacle in the relationship. I have also given him chance after chance, when he started this behavior towards me, to have it addressed. He always told me that he would “work on it” or he would “be better.” Needless to say, nothing has gotten better and has actually gotten worse and worse over time.

But now, I don’t trust him when he tells me that he’s going to work on his issues. I made him leave my home to allow me space, and told him that he needs to actually prove to me that he is trying to get help to resolve some of his issues before I allow him back into my life.

He has been blowing my phone constantly and tells me that the only person he can talk to about his issues is me. I don’t really understand this at all. 

Should I try to help him with these issues again or should I just call it off? I do love him, but I don’t want to be disrespected anymore",28Apr2020,1
851,"I'm currently a college student, but this happened to me about 5 years ago. Sorry if it is kind of long, but I have been overthinking due to quarantine.

I had been friends with this girl Daisy since we were in first grade. She was my only long term friend until we both picked up our three other friends as elementary school went on. By the end of elementary it was the five of us and we were pretty inseparable. I didn't go to middle school with Daisy but I went to school with one of the other girls (we'll call her Martha) and so as time went on, I got closer to Martha. Martha and I had some more similar interests, and especially because we went to the same school and carpooled there together, we became best friends. I consider all the girls in this group as my best friends at the time, but more broadly known by all of the people Martha and I went to school with, we were best friends. We still saw Daisy and our other friends during winter break and stuff, but we all had really busy schedules as usual so we couldn't hang out all the time. When we hung out as a group after long periods of time, it was great and it was like nothing changed. That always signaled to me that as a group we would be fine no matter what

My sophomore year of high school I was really active in my school. I was involved in a ton of stuff like the honors society, drama, bowling team, spanish club, along with doing a lot of difficult classes, having a job and then having my first serious boyfriend and friends on top of it all. Honestly looking back I have no idea how I or anyone in high school can handle it, yet obviously a lot of us have done it. Earlier in the year Daisy texted me asking if we could meet for lunch. We had a really nice time, talked about a lot of stuff, and then at the tail end of our hangout she mentioned to me that sometimes she felt like I hung out with Martha more than her. I don't remember exactly what she said but I know that in the past she had felt kind of left out at her knew schools and stuff so I knew that me and the other girls being her friend was really important to her. I apologized and said I would try to make her feel more included. I genuinely felt SO bad. I cared so much about her and realized how she must have felt. Being able to do things to make her 'more included'  was really hard at the time because I wasn't even able to drive yet. Also making plans with her was really hard because she had a really strict dad who always made her clean a ton and stay home all the time so I couldn't invite her out very impromptu, especially because I could never have people come hang out at my house bc my mom was a neat freak. When you're 14/15, hanging out is hard, especially when you don't see someone everyday, but I genuinely loved hanging out with Daisy. We would sometimes play basketball at the park by my house but because we live somewhere where it snows, we obviously couldn't keep riding our bikes to see each other.

Fast forward to that fall, my junior year, Martha and I received a text from Daisy saying that she felt extremely left out by us and that she felt she couldn't be our friends anymore. There was more to it and I'll get into that in a second, but I want to give a little more background as to what was happening at the time. At this point Martha got her license and was driving us to school so we started hanging out after school getting coffee and stuff. I think that this is what made Daisy feel so left out. I should also mention that Daisy didn't really have her own cell phone for a really long time, longer than most parents would avoid giving their kid one. She didn't have a cell phone until her junior year of high school and it was like a virgin mobile lg slider (which no shade on the slider, I had one too, but she deserved something nicer for how responsible she was and how rich her parents were). We would post like an occasional snap of us having fun, and I can only imagine how left out I'd have felt seeing something like that if I were in her position. Still she didn't try to talk to us about it, she just sent us this crazy long text. it basically said she felt really left out by us and that she didn't think we could be friends anymore. She then started talking about how she had a boyfriend and that she was involved in a bunch of ""prestegious"" extracurricular activities and how she basically didn't have time to deal with us. She also said that she thought that she heard that my friend and I were doing ecstasy (which side note, WE HADN'T EVER DONE ANY DRUGS) and that if someone associated us with her, that they would kick her out of those previously mentioned prestigious activities. She basically finished the text telling us we were beneath her and that we could still be acquaintances but that we were no longer her friends. Obviously that text stung. Martha responded within that evening apologizing profusely and begging her to forgive her, but I was kind of upset by this. It really hurt my feelings for her to basically plain say that she thought she was better than me and acting like her time was more valuable than mine. I was a pretty accomplished high schooler. Coming from immigrant parents  I worked really really hard for everything I did. I took a few days to cool off so I could respond. I apologized to her but also told her that I was confused as to why she thought I was doing drugs and why she thought I would risk my OWN future. We never got a response from her after this, so things kind of cooled down.

Later on I was at a party and I did something petty. I made some stupid post on twitter that basically dissed her with Martha. It was a picture of Martha and I and it said ""glad we realized 3's a crowd #thanksdaisy"". I have never bullied anyone in my entire life, and I know that that was crossing the line, but I was still really hurt and this was only a couple months later. Well, her brother who I forgot followed my twitter showed it to her and she texted us and blew up on us. Her dad also got involved and texted Martha's parents saying how rude and awful we were being, luckily Marthas mom stood up for us. I swear it was just this one post, and I know it was wrong, but I was so hurt by her. She was my friend for almost 10 years, and the only person who I thought really knew me for who I was. I know being hurt doesn't excuse behavior, but I was only 16 and the whole thing really threw me. 

In quarantine I've been thinking about how short life is, and how I just want to be on good terms with her. Senior year I was so sad thinking about how excited I was to have us go to each others grad parties and leave for college together. I know that not all friendships last forever, but this girl really was my friend. I think that we both were in the wrong at different times, but I stood by her during some really weird times. At one point in middle school she cut off one of the 5 girls from our original group which really put rift in our friendship. Martha and I were still friends with her and Daisy cut her off without a word. Martha and I remained friends with both sides, both daisy and the other girl, because we cared about both of them. 

I just turned 21 this last week. Being home from college and living really close to her has made me think about this whole ordeal a lot. I'm not sure why, but it has. **Do you think there is any way for me to try to reconcile this friendship?**",28Apr2020,1
852,"So, I've always known I have violent reflexes to unwanted physical touch. This has landed me in trouble more than once due to the unwanted physical touches upon my person not being particularly violent or harmful, and reacting violently to them. However, it is really affecting my relationship recently.

I will have phantom sensations in the night, or if my girlfriend does something I don't like that I'm not expecting (the most recent example is sticking her tongue out when I kiss her, so I kiss her tongue) I slap her. I've slapped her 3 times now, the first two were phantom or unexpected sensations while I was sleeping. I woke up to them and immediately slapped her to get her to stop. We've had discussions about my reflexes and how I can't help it, and we put it down to me being half asleep at the time, but the most recent time I slapped her without even thinking in the face.

To clarify, these aren't full on swings, just kind of swats like a ""bad, no"" kind of reaction, but it still makes a sound and she gets upset every time. I'd like to try and not react violently to things like this anymore. Any advice?",28Apr2020,1

855,"Just some background info is that I'm a junior in college in a fairly rigorous program. When I was in high school I had no idea what I wanted to with my life, other then I knew I wanted to help people. I found a program that I thought looked interesting in the medical field and after doing a few hours of observation I decided to go with it.

I got accepted into a 5 and a half year accelerated masters program at a school that looked perfect for me and I was so excited. I quickly started having some doubts after meeting my advisor, who was also the head teacher for the underclassman. She would tell me that I need smarter friends so that maybe they would rub off on me and make me smarter, and overall putting me down at every turn.
The program itself turned out to be heavily based on the students who had been deemed favorites in the first couple weeks. People my advisor didnt like would be heavily penalized for small infractions and given way lower grades.

I studied abroad my sophomore year, and it was the happiest time of my life. Stepping away from my school for a semester I began to realize hoe much I had hated it. The atmosphere, the culture, and the people were all different then what I wanted. Being able to step away from it all helped me realize how unhappy I had been the entire time I was there.
When I went back home my best friend, who had been in the same program and had been my only real friend at the school, told me she wasn't going to go back. When this year started I didnt have any friends on campus and the academic classes became a lot more advanced as I was suddenly taking post grad classes alongside my regular curriculum. 

I have become incredibly disillusioned by the entire program and the entire year I have become more and more depressed thinking about school. 
Since being sent home to finish the semester I haven't even been able to really look at my school work. I have no motivation and it hurts and makes me feel nauseated just thinking about it. 

I decided that I couldn't force myself to continue in this program, but my parents were so proud of me. They are constantly telling me how much money they have put into my schooling, and how I cant be wasting it. How I need to ignore all the things my advisor has said to put me down, and just finish it out. I know they want me to be happy, but I also know that they are gonna be so disappointed in me and try to stop me. 

This got way longer then I expected so I'm sorry about that, but any advice on how to tell my parents that I want to take a semester off would be much appreciated.

TL:DR After 3 years of college I have decided that I cant force myself to be happy in the area of study I chose, and I need help explaining to my parents that I would like to take some time off from school.",28Apr2020,1
856,"So I (14M) have 1 brother and 1 sister in my family along with parents. I am youngest and I know they have more authority over me but they are relentless. I hate my mom, sister, and father. My brother is the only kind person, he is oldest child. He actually treats me as an equal and if I am being honest, while my father wasn't around for me and him, he was sort of like a dad to me. Hell he is the only father figure I have ever known. He is the only one I care about and actually love. My mom and sister on the other hand, I can do without them. They are so careless and relentless on me. An example of this would be the K-pop they listen to. I don't mind that they like K-pop, you like the music you like whatever. (we're Arab Americans btw, and Muslim) My mom is religious while me and both my siblings are not religious. Anyways, they always play the same 2 songs 67 times a day (I counted) on average, and they look at the group Monsta X as some sort of God's. They fucking WORSHIP THEM. They also look at South Korea as some sort of Utopia, saying things like ""were gonna meet our soulmates there"" even tho my mom is fucking MARRIED. 

My sister is way out of hand, it's gone from us not talking, to we can't ve un the same room together without any problems. I ask them calmly to turn the kpop off once in a while, so there's regular TV. They just tell me to shut the fuck up and deal with it. They are also doing this thing with ""losing weight and exercising"" and they may sure they eat but if they are out on walks or they already have food they just want to let me and my brother and dad starve. It's always catering to them, and they complain when we do the same. They are always controlling the TV too, it's always Kpop or exercise videos. And all of my life both my parents emotionally neglected me and my brother. While my sister got all attention and love. And what's really unfair is how they are now getting sexual, saying stuff like how they'd basically marry and fuck the kpop members. And how they only want Koreans. But yet, if I talk about something like that and if a hot actress comes on TV I can't say they're hot while they always call the members of kpop ""hot"". That's my mom and sister. My dad is a different situation, although my mom just emotionally neglected me and I want to fight my sister and actually hurt her.

 My dad beat me as a kid. I don't like the a word, so let's just say he always beat me anytime for no reason. I'm not allowed to leave the house besides for school, I can't see friends, and yet if I'm on my computer to avoid family I'm yelled at. My dad is also heavy on religion even though he does non religious stuff, even marrying my mom in her religions way before she converted, he did not do anything the right way. So he's a Hippocrate and is heavy on religion. Me and him don't go well together, same with my mom and sister. I don't even have my own room, I share it with my sister cause mu dad refuses to move or spend money on us. I have so much anger and I just honestly, want to die. I know so many people have worse, but imagine being me. I don't even sleep in a bed. 'My"" room I share with my sister is hers. I sleep on the couch every night, and I don't have any real belongings. I can't even have any privacy, because as soon as I want it they won't leave me alone. And it's always her way or no way, my parents even side with her all the time, and God forbid I have something nice and she doesn't. 

Let me put this in an example. With me and my brother, we had to cook our own food, while with my sister, my mom will cook a full on fucking buffet. I own, one Xbox 360, that is all. And my sister wants to destroy it, my brother bought it too for me I didn't buy it. I love the thing, and they don't want me having anything nice. Another thing is they are so fucking sexist. If my sister watches a fucking softcore porno and says she'd fuck someone, she's fine, my mother even agrees sometimes. But if I play game with a little bit of cleavage shown, not even nipples, the kind you'd see in public from a blouse, I'm grounded. If you want me to go into more detail I can in a separate post, but sorry I rambled on, I had shit to say, any advice?

857,"Okay I know this may seem as an obvious answer, definitely NO copyrighting, but I am in a huge dilemma and I need someone to hear me out.

So I started up painting, and to practice I was copying other paintings by other artists. Initially I had no intention to sell these paintings, I was doing them for practice.  Heard the best way to get good at painting is copying others work, so that’s what I’ve been doing.

Well I decided I’d give one of them to my niece (for free) and my sister freaked out and was immediately obsessed by the paintings. She posted all of mine on Facebook and around 50 people replied saying they would like a painting and would pay for one.

WHAT THE F?!? So now all my family is wondering why I don’t want to sell these paintings because they’re technically not mine. And all these people on Facebook want it like asap so I’d feel bad not giving them anything.

What should I do?! Will I legit get caught and have to pay a fine if I sell these paintings? They’re pretty obscure paintings, some of them don’t even credit an artist. Found them online..

Is it easy to get caught copyrighting? Should I sell some of them anyway? Should I try and contact the original painter?

After this I’m not copying others work, I’ll do my own work, but I’m not sure what to do with these pieces. Specific people have asked for the specific painting and I don’t wanna say “no” and then tell everyone I’m a shitty painter caus I have to copy work... dear lord...

861,"TW: Suicidal Thoughts 
I (19F) adopted a cat exactly 3 months ago today, Piper. 
Before I adopted her in late January, I was in one of the worst depressive episodes of my life and in my mind there was only two options: die or adopt a cat. After talking to my therapist, she agreed that I do better when caring for a pet. My parents allowed me to adopt a cat and I immediately fell in love with her at the shelter and the rest was history. 

She 100% improves my mental health in basically every way and I am so much happier since I got her. I would do anything for her and my family has noticed I am much happier and less irritable since adopting her. Especially since quarantine, we’ve bonded even more and she follows me everywhere I go. 

Here is the thing though, I am leaving for college (5 hours away) in August and we are both extremely attached to each other. I do have a plan for when I leave, my parents and my two older sisters (at least one will still be living at home and they adore her) will be taking care of her, I’m not doubting their ability as she’s a pretty easy girl. However, she has basically picked me as her person. 
She is friendly to everyone (never scratched, hiss, bitten or anything) but I am worried because she is just so attached to me ( and I am to her). I had a job dog/house sitting before so it wasn’t like I was always around, but my family tells me that she will call out for me when I’m not home. I believe she has separation anxiety and quite frankly, I also get nervous not being around her. 

I do have the option to register her as an emotional support animal I would rather not bring her to college with me as it will be my first semester there as well as, I just do not want to risk her possibly getting out/ roommates. 

I am afraid that without her I may spiral, but I also believe that both of us would be better off if she was more attached to other family members. I would not worry about her nearly as much if I knew she loved someone as much as she loves me but I’m just not sure how to help her anxiety.

868,"Hi.

I know i'm gonna sound shitty in some of this, and I really do feel like a scumbag currently.

I've been dating this girl for just about 20 months, and we were best friends for 6 months prior to us dating. So I've spent just about everyday for the last 2 years talking to her. She loves me dearly and I love her aswell. Recently we've been going through a rough patch in our relationship. We fought last week over something, then we worked it out both said we'd try harder and within 1 week FIVE more problems arose. We both love eachother but it's just been difficult. In enters another girl, that i've honestly been crushing on hard for months. I'd never cheat or anything along those lines, and she had nothing to do with me and girlfriend 1's relationship ending, but the other day I broke up with my girlfriend because I found out something. Now i don't wanna go into too many details, but basically I found out she lied about something nearly 2 years ago that wouldve hurt me alot, but she said she did it because she didn't wanna hurt me, and now I feel as if I'm hurt more because she lied, then I am because of what she lied about. Trust and telling the truth means alot to me, especially in a relationship. Long story short, we broke up. I miss her ALOT. I can't really imagine myself without her, but smart enough I decided to text girl number 2, because I knew she had a thing for me aswell. Me and her are very similar, we both have horrible anxiety, we're kinda socially awkward. We're shy and keep to ourselves. She told me she's never felt this way about someone before that she feels about me right now... and I felt that, because I felt just like that before me and girl 1 started dating, because she always told me there was no chance she didn't like me like that. So when girl 2 told me that I felt it on a personal level, and now I feel as if I was stringing her along aswell, we spoke non-stop for 3 days. We connect extremely well, she's a sweet heart, dorky, adorable, and in general has a HUGE heart. I know this sounds awful but it's the truth, she also is alot more uhm.. physically attractive, not that my girlfriend is ugly, but she's very petite which I really enjoy. Girl 2 has a big booty, and big boobs, and she's kinda slim thick, which i've never experienced before, but in reality I don't know if we'd ever work out in the long run. I like her alot, she likes me but we barely know eachother. I feel like a scumbag thinking of it sexually but it is a part of it, I wanna be satisfied aswell. I know ya'll aren't getting the whole story.. but I kinda just really want both of them and I know that's not a possibility. I feel like im hurting both of them stringing them along, and i'm hurting myself. I'm fine with hurting myself because it is what is is, but i'm tired of hurting other people. I told girl 2 today that we shouldnt text anymore because I'm not sure what I want and I don't wanna hurt her anymore then I need to. At the same time girl number 1 is practically begging me to take her back. I'm tired of being told do what my heart wants, because I don't know what my heart want's. I keep being told ""take it day by day"" but the longer I wait the more i'm hurting people..

tl;dr I broke up with my girlfriend for reasons which I don't even know if I really honestly care too much about in the long run..

I'm stuck between being comfortable and taking a risk with seeing if girl #2 would work out.

All my life I've thought that by following the dreams of my immigrant parents, I'd be happy and successful.

I researched stuff, readed (I know bad gramar) reviews, watched damage test, compared prices, etc when chosing furniture. Also I had to came up with different placements in room so it would work well and look good. Now after all this time I came up with really cheap and nice rework. Now after month I showed them my final version (I updated them and asked for opinions) and dad just from nowhere told me he will do it else. He didn't checked prices, if it will even work or anything he just sayed after bit of thinking that he wants it else. When I absolutely shredded that idea with all the ways it's not going to work he got really mad and started trying to find holes in my idea (didn't found any so that made him even madder). Now he and mom was always togeder against me (kinda hilarious how they togeder talk shit about me and try bully me). They are like ""if you are so retarded you want it like that we won't pay for that"" and I sayed I was about to pay for that anyway and they got really pissed.

876,"Hi all,

The short version is just as the title says, but for those who care I'm going to provide more context. 

I (24NB) live with two people who we'll call Katie (25F) and Cassie (22F), and since the beginning of Social Distancing/Quarantine guidelines in the U.S. where I live (roughly the beginning of March) they have either traveled or had people visit every weekend. To recap, this past weekend Cassie visited her boyfriend in a city 4 hours away. The previous weekend was the only weekend both of them have been home and not invited people over. The weekend prior Cassie had her boyfriend over and Katie visited a friend in a city 5 hours away. The weekend before that Katie and Cassie both traveled to the same city to celebrate Katie and Cassie's-BF birthday with their family together (Cassie's BF is Katie's brother, their birthdays are within a week of each others, don't get me started on this). The weekend before THAT Katie had people over for the weekend to celebrate her birthday. Etc. Etc. Long story short, out of the last 8 weekends, Katie and Cassie have either gone somewhere or had someone over for a visit almost every weekend. 

In addition to this, Cassie works for a small business that is continuing to operate in order to make ends meet. I personally work for a manufacturing plant and have to go in to the workplace daily. Katie is the only one who works from home. So 2 out of 3 people in the house are coming into contact with an ultimately unknown number of people every day. And so every time they see someone that isn't someone they work with or ourselves I get internally stressed out because in my head I'm just seeing unnecessary vectors for transmission.

I'm already stressed out to begin with, I'm diagnosed Bipolar and truth be told I am not doing too hot with this global pandemic. these constant excursions my roommates keep making are stressing me out even more, and I have no idea how to talk to them about it.

Part of me feels like a hypocrite for being upset because I'll stop by a fast food drive thru sometimes instead of making food at home, which is arguably just as risky if not more, and I don't want them to use that as ammunition against me when I finally bring myself to talk to them. And on top of that its difficult to not feel upset with myself for getting fast food, even though I'm so stressed out that when I get home from work 9/10 times I lose all executive function and I just sit on the couch doing absolutely nothing. I'd say a good 50% of my meals since we started quarantine have just been pieces of bread dipped in peanut butter because I don't have the energy or mental faculty to do much more than that. I don't say this to invoke sympathy, I just want to illustrate where I'm at and why it's difficult to start this conversation with them. 

On top of all of this, I'm very nervous about talking to Cassie about this specifically because she, very recently, completely ended a friendship because of a disagreement. And from what I can tell the root of this disagreement came from both sides inability/refusal to see the others perspective and doubling down on why they think they are correct. I don't want to ruin my relationship with Cassie because we just resigned the lease and I don't want to sour things when I have to live with her for another year. 

TLDR: I don't know how to talk to my roommates about all the unnecessary visits / trips they're making to see people, its stressing me out and leaving me frustrated, but I don't want to come across as a hypocrite because I sometimes get fast food instead of making something at home.",28Apr2020,1
877,"I was going home from a Party around 2 am I think and was alone at the main train station (I live in a big city) waiting for my bus who would arrive in like 30 mins. I was drunk, not blackout drunk but enough that I made different decisions than normally. A few meters away was a group of some 5 guys of which one looked over to me a few times. After some time he came to me and started talking, I don't remember what he said, and handed me a beer. It was closed so I thanked him and took it. A few minutes later he leaned in for a kiss and I thought, as he gifted me his beer, it would be rude to deny him so I just went with it. After a while his friends came to us. First they where just talking with him and each other but after some time they started asking me some Questions. I can't remember anything of the conversation but eventually one of them asked me if I wanted to suck them all off. The guy kissing me whispered to me I should just say no but I still felt pressured to say yes because I was scared they would beat me up if I'd reject them, which probably wouldn't have happened but it seemed plausible to me at that time (I had a close encounter before at club where I found out the next day my best friend saved me from a guy who wanted to beat me up for being trans). So I went around a corner with them and sucked their dicks. One of them tried to fuck my butt but he didn't use any lube so it hurt me a bit and he didn't seem to have fun either so he stopped after a few seconds. None of them came and after like two minutes four of them went back to the station. The one I kissed at the start stayed with me and asked me like three times why I agreed to suck them of. I couldn't answer that question and just said I don't know every time. He then stated he could give me much more than the others which I didn't understand. Then he pulled me around another corner and wanted to suck my dick which made me ultra uncomfortable. I don't want to use my dick in a sexual way as I see it as an error rather than a part of my body but I still didn't think of stopping him. I didn't get hard, obviously, so he stopped after a minute or so. I remembered I had a bus to catch so I said bye and ran back to the station. I missed my bus and for the rest of the night I felt annoyed that I missed my bus because some guys couldn't keep it in their pants. I didn't feel raped and the next morning I still just felt confused about the situation. I'm not traumatized by any means but I still wonder sometimes if I was raped that night or not. Either way my life wouldn't change but I still think about it sometimes. What do you think? I got a text from one of the guys the following day, even though I don't remember giving anyone my number, asking if we could meet some time. I told him I was drunk that night and he apologized and never contacted me ever since.

878,"Alright so its a very long story with tons of history but I will try my best to keep it brief. Im a college male freshman and I like a girl who goes to the same college and went to my same high school. I think she liked me at one point during senior year of high school but I sorta turned down the few advances she made and that situation ended there. Well in college we rarely saw each other except for a few times I asked to grab some food or study near the end of the first semester. I then texted her a lot over Christmas and tried to hangout but she seemed busy. We had a few classes in the Spring together and we texted a little about that but I really didn't see her in person outside of classes. Well once quarantine started we facetimed multiple times to work on homework and each FaceTime lasted like 2 hours cuz we got off topic and talked a ton and laughed etc. Overall I thought they went very well and it seemed like we both enjoyed them. Outside of the facetimes however she ignores my messages for a good 3-4 hours sometimes and leaves me on delivered in snapchat for like 10-15 hours at a time. I don't stalk but I know she is into social media and stuff and is on her phone all the time, so it seems she is ignoring me. We both sorta had been initiating the FaceTimes and its not like she is using me for answers, cuz I contribute less than her typically. Occasionally she will text about something that isn't very important, so I don't know why she would do that if she wanted to ghost me.

&amp;#x200B;

Please someone help me understand what is going on here. I am lost and overthinking it is not helping. I like this person a lot, but just don't feel like letting her know is a good idea cuz it seems she would rather just ignore me. I start thinking there is no way she likes me at all (as a friend or as more) and then we have like a really nice FaceTime and my mind is confused again.",28Apr2020,1
880,"Hello everyone! Last easter, every single teacher pushed out Christian-related stuff (by the principal's order, a Christian). Every single time, I said that I was Pastafarian (the movement characterized by the belief in a Flying Spaghetti Monster, basically against the teaching of Christianity in schools), and other things, such as that speaking of Jesus would split my soul or whatever. I did this in a jokingly way.

Or so I'd thought. I live in a rather religious country and things escalated. Parents called me to talk. Not good.  My mom, also religious, said she's really embarrassed, and that the entire school thinks I'm ""anti-Christ"" now, and siding with the ""evil"" or something.

882,"Background: 

I live in an apartment with one roommate in a city heavily affected by the pandemic; we are both medical students but have been switched to online classes for the last two months. We live in a state with a stay-at-home order due to COVID-19, and both our parent’s live about 30-40 minutes away. I moved home for several weeks during the beginning of the quarantine, during which time my roommate was still going home around once a week to see his family (which I don’t have a problem with). Three weeks ago I moved back to volunteer in the city (with my roommates consent); during this time I have not gone home as I didn’t want to put my family at risk from me volunteering, though my roommate continued seeing his family. I have now stopped volunteering so that I can study for my exams and so that I can go home on occasion; before I go home, I will be quarantining in my apartment for 14 days (currently on day 5) from the last time i volunteered. We both consider going home to see our families as a form of stress relief during this difficult time and both us and our parents have accepted the risk of us going to our respective homes on occasion. One of his parents is a physician who has been working through the pandemic, the rest of his family has mostly been staying home. 

My girlfriend has been quarantining very strictly with her parents who are both high risk due to their age. I haven’t seen her in around six weeks except from a distance. 

Conundrum:

My girlfriend and I both want her to come to our apartment for four days at the tail end of my quarantine (May 3rd to May 7th) as we both have been very stressed and being together is our main source of stress relief. However, she will not come unless my roommate and I are both quarantining in the apartment together (eg. she won’t come if he goes between now and May 7th. Since he goes home once a week, often Sundays, this would mean going an extra four days or so without seeing his family. 

Conflict:

It is a difficult position to my roommate in to ask him not to see his family so that I can see my girlfriend. It is his form of stress relief and is very important to him to be able to see his family. However, my form of stress relief is seeing my girlfriend. One of us has to sacrifice on behalf of the other. Am I asking too much of my roommate? 

tl;dr- asking my roommate to put off seeing his family for several days and stay quarantined with me so that I can see my girlfriend.",28Apr2020,1

886,"I am losing my mind. I never thought that anything like this would ever happen to me. It’s one of those things that you see as a story somewhere and while reading or watching about it you just never really think it will happen to you. I never looked at it as how badly it would affect someone’s life, I always just thought about how it must suck but being on the end of being falsely accused is so much more damaging than I could’ve ever imagined. I feel like I’m losing my sanity. My mind keeps on replaying what really happened and I can’t figure out how someone can lie like that. About something to serious. I feel like I’m in a corner right now just being looked at as a monster, my family is on my side but you don’t understand how much it kills me to even think of them having that image of me. I just want to die, how can someone do something so evil like this!? It’s completely ruining my mind where I don’t even know what I want to do anymore. I deal with bad anxiety, horrible anxiety, and I’ve never had this kind of anxiety in my head before. I can’t grasp anything in my head. It is just trying to understand so much. It’s just so overwhelming to the point I feel the urge to end my life. Why? Please someone please explain to me how can someone lie about something so serious. How can a person not realize how a serious allegation can affect someone?!!?? My heart and head are pounding. I have my ideas that I have been able to think about why she would lie about someone so serious so I will explain everything.
It all started a day I was playing call of duty in my downstairs living room. My cousin was also on the couch next to me. I personally never liked her as a person since we were kids. She was a little on the disturbed side and it would always make me feel uncomfortable being around her so I just wouldn’t look forward to family get together with her family because I would be put into the situations where I have to act cool with her. 
Anyways that night.. 
I was playing call of duty and whenever i got a kill I would get excited if it was something crazy that happened. Either I did some crazy play or anything that would hype up any teenager while gaming. And when doing that i was so hyped I gave her like a high five and a hyped side hug. Kind of where you just put your arm around the person with one arm and just shake them from excitement. The next time i got hyped I didn’t do anything with her I just got hyped to myself but she jumped onto my lap (facing towards me) and started to like dry hump? At that moment I didn’t know what she was doing was but I threw her off of me as soon as she got onto my lap and just thought to myself how weird that was and continued playing my game. After that game I went upstairs to my restroom to pee. My restroom is one of those restrooms that have the first door that opens from the hallways that takes you to the mirror and sinks and then there is another door that has the toilet inside of it. So I went into the toilet door and closed it. When I finished I opened the door and my cousin was inside of the other part that has the sink and mirror, and she was standing in front of the door with the door closed behind her. From that point I put together what was about to happen based off of that weird hump thing she did on the couch downstairs. 
She pretty much kept throwing her body to me trying to get all close and I just kept on moving her away trying to get to the door but then she gets onto her knees and tells me “they say I’m good at it” and at the point I was losing my mind. I did not understand what was going on, like is this real life!? And I said no, stop. And so she stood up and blocked the door and continued saying that she’s not letting me out unless I let her do it. At that point I decided to start getting a little more aggressive because she was crossing so many lines. So I tried grabbing her but she was holding onto the door knob behind her and the door was locked so eventually I just had to literally use all my force and tug her off the door. (Quick thing, at the time of all of this I was the type of guy that always had a blanket with me wherever I went in the house. I don’t know why, I just felt comfortable walking with a blanket around me) 
With that said when I went back downstairs I was just going to go to bed and think about what I am going to do about this situation but then realized I left my blanket upstairs in the hallway. I went upstairs and of course she already knew that’s what I wanted so she had grabbed it before I even got back upstairs. She said if you want your blanket then you’ll need to come in and I just said “I can just grab another blanket, it’s okay”. I grabbed another blanket from the blanket closet upstairs and went back downstairs to go to bed to think about everything that just happened. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to tell my parents or my girlfriend at the time because it was all just so weird. I really didn’t want to break the two families apart either because I knew how much my mom cared about her older sister. (My cousins mom). So I decided I would just act like nothing ever happened and move on. Next morning I had to take my aunt to another house and when I drove her, her daughter (my cousin) came with us. Which I am so positive the only reason she came was to make sure I didn’t open my mouth. So once we got to where we were going and her mom got out the car my cousin went straight to saying, “you’re not going to say anything right?” And I just ignored her and waited until she got out the car and then went back to my house. I never said anything to anyone about. I moved on from it and completely forgot it even happened. 
I want to say 3 years later my mom calls me into her room and tells me that my cousin was saying that I molested her to her mom. I was so confused and shocked. I told my parents exactly what happened and said to give me my aunts number so I can clear out what really happened. But when I called her mom and told her she completely disregarded everything i said. She just said I believe my daughter just like your mom will believe you. At that point I was just extremely frustrated. It is impossible to get into someone’s head when they are so closed minded so I just had to let it go. 
I believe the reason she made up the lie was because she might have thought one day I was going to open up about what really happened so instead she wanted to throw out a lie that pretty much switched everything completely so nobody would believe me if I did. Which is exactly what’s happening. 
Me and my parents fought with her mom about it for a bit but then we decided we need to just let it go because it would just be a huge he said she said thing and it wasn’t going to get anywhere. Fast forward another maybe 8 months or so, I get a call from my sister saying my boy cousin (the brother of the cousin I’ve been talking about) texted her said that he hopes she’s safe and to stay away from “that man”. (Referring to me) My sister knows everything that’s going on and said “do you really believe her?” And it just went back and forth until for the first time we get the words “rape”. At that point I lost it. Did this story just really turn into a rape story?! It wasn’t about a rape for the longest, this rape thing barely came out yesterday because my mom and her mom still talked here and there about other things but yesterday my aunt called my mom and said to tell us (her kids) not to contact her kids anymore. (This happened before my boy cousin texted my sister) which makes me believe that rape part barely got thrown into the mix of this big lie. Now my boy cousin is threatening to hurt me and it’s getting all out of control over this lie she is telling. I still don’t even know what she has been telling anyone because their side won’t tell us. 
I had to make a hard decision of telling my grandma because she’s like my other mom, when I was a baby she would take me in to her house for a couple days or longer to take care of me so I grew a strong connection with her. The last thing I would want is for her side to go and tell the lie to my grandma and that be the first thing my grandmas hears. I realized that if I would’ve opened my mouth first and came out with it when it happened then they would’ve believed me and I wouldn’t be in this position so I took the initial step in opening up to my grandma so the same thing doesn’t happen to me again. Right now we are at a stand still on what’s going on, my sister is trying to reach out to people who can possibly help us through the situation because I am over being the one in the corner and getting attacked. I want to be the person who starts fighting back and I want to take legal actions but we don’t know how or where to start. I need help. Please. If you have been through something similar to this or know what to do please I beg you, please help me. This is ruining my life right now and I truly believe she needs to be put away or somehow seen by a person who can make sure her mindset gets to normal. Last thing I would want to know is that she will continue lying about stuff and getting away with it. Now that I have the word rape put with my name, my life is going downhill. I do not want anything like that to happen to another person because of an unstable person. Please if you can help, please reach out to me.",28Apr2020,1

890,"Hi, I applied for an apprenticeship in Data analytics with the NHS about a month ago. Due to the current situation, they were unable to get back to me about it, but today I got a phone call saying that they are willing to proceed with my application if I still want the job. The only problem is, I don't know if I want it or if I'm just sabotaging myself.. 

It was my dream to go to university to study chemistry, but about a year and a half ago I realised that I have a learning disability because I was really, really struggling in college. 

I have ADD, misophonia and possibly dyslexia or dyscalculia. My misophonia is ruining my life, I literally want to scream and punch something everytime I hear a noise that triggers me. I'm worried that an office environment wouldn't be good for me, but I struggled in college so how would I do any better in university?

And I know that I love statistics and maths, but I love chemistry too. When I started college I took Biology, Chemistry and Maths, but I was failing maths so I changed to stats. My stats tutor supported me so much that I might actually get an A in it, in comparison to the U I was going to get in maths. But the reason I went to college in the first place was to study chemisty. 

But I'm worried that the only reason I'm overthinking this so much is because I'm trying to talk myself out of going for the Data Analysis apprenticeship. Like, it's a fantastic opportunity, it's amazing pay, its abit far to travel but I'm hoping to get my driver's licence after quarantine so the distance won't be a problem after awhile, theres so much opportunity for progression, and even if I don't get it then it's not the end of the world- I won't have missed out by not trying for it. But what if I get it and I HATE it? What if there's someone who constantly squeaks their chair on the floor, or blows their nose constantly and I end up losing my shit? What if I look stupid because I can't do mental math and everyone else can? What if it ruins statistics for me?

896,"Backstory I lost my mom when I was 7 (She was killed by a drunk driver) and from then on life has been hard sometimes. My father has tried his best, widow never remarried, we have always been close but sometimes I do wish my mom was around so I could talk to her about certain things, so if there are any mother's for some advice right now I would really appreciate it.

Okay so I'm a cheerleader on a well known team in the us, for me it's a big deal because I feel like people see videos of us on the internet as either someone they look up to or as a learning experience, but I'm also glad these people don't see slot of behind the scenes because trust me it's bad.
So like I said at the beginning I lost my mom when I was 7 it was hard but one my mom always wanted me to do was be a cheerleader like her, and I  the team my mom was on 20 years ago I'm currently on now so it's a big deal for me, some of the other girls on the team had their mothers on same team 20 years ago to so they know how I feel. But the last couple of years have been so difficult, my dad has told me if I want to quit I can,but I feel like I would let my mom down by leaving. Anyway when your a little kid and your on a team if you mess up if the mom's are watching they will make comments about your performance and your most likely to make that same mistake at a comp, sometimes the mother of that child being picked on will always speak up for those child and then it'll spark up all kinds of drama, because everyone of those parents think Thier kid is the best and Thier kid doesn't stuff up.
The truth is I thought that would stop when we became older but before the quarantine stuff happened I had been at the gym one night taking a drink break when I heard a mom talking to another mom about me, they were saying how I shouldn't be a flyer about because my right knee still isn't what it should be in terms of strength and I bobble to much when I first get lifted up(I had a fall last summer and  and since then I have an overuse knee injury called patellar tendonitis) it's been slow heal but still am in pain sometimes, I have tried my best to not let it affect me or my teammates but it still does, my teammates have been super supportive towards me and I appreciate it, since I can't think all about myself here and about the whole team,because if I quit now I let the whole team down, anyway back to my story, so anyway I decided to peek around the corner to see who was talking about me and it one of my best friends mom's and another girl's mom I was actually devestated because this mom had become like an auntie to after my mom died and she was a cheerleader once to,so I thought she understood me. After that I hardly spoke to those woman it was hard and my best friend couldn't understand why I was being like this I don't want to tell her, it might cause more trouble, anyway one of our other best friends mom is actually our coach and owns the gyms to,apparenty one other mom heard what they said and she told them off for, I feel bad in a way because the owner is always standing up for me because some mom is always saying something about me, I appreciate what she does and she has told to come find her if more problems arise from this situation. But I also feel like I'm getting special treatment.

btw it's so hard to not be overwhelmed by that much money in my bank account I'm so impulsive omg",28Apr2020,1

899,"To sum up a long story, my partner of four years raped me.
It wasn’t violent, there wasn’t a struggle, but I did say no and told him to stop. When he started anyway, I just froze. I couldn’t push him off. My whole body tensed up so tight, but he didn’t notice. He stopped after a while after he realized “I wasn’t enjoying it” but still. He got upset after I was able to process what happened and I said he raped me, and to this day, won’t admit to doing it.
This person and I have been together for four years. I’m still terrified to do anything remotely sexual with him. (It’s been almost a month since the incident) He can’t even admit that it happened, making me feel more invalid.
I was a child of sexual abuse and as a survivor of rape prior to this, feel like i’m a bad survivor for even staying with him another minute. I feel like I HAVE to break up with him. However, I also love him so much, and I know he loves me.

I am becoming crazy about this stripper.(yea I know stupid)

I'm a male(25)  world traveler,divorced, educated, veteran, go-go dancer etc. And I'd like to think that I have a very good head on my shoulders. My home boy and I went to a strip club for food (the food is some of the best in the city).  Well I normally dont care about strippers, I strip myself on occassions and have been around the industry for a few years. I have alot of burlesque/stripper friends. I'm very desensitized  to this and have gone into strip clubs and spent only 8 bucks. I know that it's these girls job to pretend to like me but this girl  fucked up my whole world recently. I got a dance and it was so nice, we laughed so much and things got hot and heavy in the back. When I originally got the dance I wasnt thinking anything of it, like  ""I'm gonna waste my money on this girl, and I get to see some ass, cool win win"" I've had dances before but never had chemistry like this too. She mentioned this as well.
Bruh let's just say there was a wet spot on my jeans when I left. 

IDk if y'all have ever had this magnetic pull to someone before where all you want to do is talk and be around them etc. But man it's a crazy feeling that I can not shake. We text or snap all the time. So I told her how I felt and essentially she said she likes me but I met her at work and things have to be separate for her own safety.  My problem is she feels it too and have mentioned it and various ways. Either this girl is one hell of an actress or its genuine and  she legit is concerned for her safety(which I dont blame her for). Yet she said she wanted to go out for coffee or tea. 

Idk what to do about how I feel since she said things should be separate. I feel like things could either turn out really well(if I just chill and be friends like we have been) or end up cutting her off/vice versa.",28Apr2020,1
909,"Hello everyone. 

After the coronavirus reached our country we decided to keep training in secret at our gym. Only trusted members got to do this, me included, most of the time we are 3-4 people so there was little risk.

Today as i went to train i had to get the key to the gym from my friend who we can say is ""2nd in command"" because both him and my master (owner of the gym) had things to do so i would be training alone until someone else was going to join me latter this day. Last time i was there was 5 days ago.

When i arrived something wasn't right. The door padlock was unlocked and laying there as if someone didn't care. The floor lock of the door was unlocked too and only the front lock was locked. If my master or friend were here surely they wouldn't leave it like this. I don't know anyone besides them who could have a key.

Once i got in the heavy bags were gone, the matt was dirty with clear foot marks and in general the gym looked a bit of a mess. I was not aware they were doing maintanance.

I was going downstairs as that's where the locker room and the weights are. As i approached i realized the lights were on down there. No one was supposed to be at the gym, they would surely turn off everything before leaving the gym. I grabed a weapon knowing someone could be there and slowly went down.

No one was there. Some of the weight training material disappeared as well as a few cardio machines. The seats of the locker room weren't there either.

I called my friend and asked him what was going on and that the gym was probably stolen ? He refused to explain anything and said ""It's complicated"" and that he could give my monthly payment back. I asked if the gym was shutting down he again didn't answer. What was going on ? Was he aware of something about this ?

30min. later the master arrives and so did my friend. He looked a bit surprised/disapointed and asked me to wait a bit outside so he can talk with the other guy privately. He called me back in and said that he had to sell some of the things because financial stuff and what not. 

Bullshit i thought. Last time someone trained here was saturday, i don't see him selling the equipment this fast. He told me to leave and not talk this to no one, pretend like i wasn't there.

I said ok and left. I knew it was pointless to keep talking because if that was true he wouldn't ask me to wait outside and keep secrets like this. 

This gym isn't my responsibility but it's important to me and i'm pissed i have no where else anymore. I feel powerless to do anything.",28Apr2020,1

Today we texted for 4 hours straight before she had to do some homework. I called her last night to apologise for being immature about some things and for overreacting. And told her that all that I have left to say to her has to come in person because it won't feel right texting it or calling you. She dosent have a problem going out during quarantine because she's seen her friends but I haven't seen her in over a month in person. 

I know I have to earn her respect again if I want to convey my feelings for her again and just get everything out. Part of me knows she still has feeling like she hasn't deleted pictures of us or how we can still talk everyday. I realised I did things to lose her respect and that's why she thinks she fell out of love with me. I don't want to explain everything to her as to why I didn't mean the things because I know it won't help. I wanna show her that she never should of thought that way about me. We were going in a great direction as a couple before the Quarantine hit. We've broken up before but it wasn't as serious as this time because it only was for less than a week. I just wanna tell her that I don't want a bandaid over this relationship again and truly tell her about how I feel about her.

We're both 19, I just wanna spend my time with a girl where we both enjoy our time together and appreciate eachother. And we both did for 3 1/2 years. That was until she didn't feel like it and she ended things abruptly.

I just don't know when the right time to tell her about how I truly feel. I don't want to do it too late or too early because it won't have the same effect. Should I wait for her to come to me or should I go to her when I think it's time?

&amp;#x200B;

So when i was 3 or 4 my father took his own life, hung himself from the fan of my families living room, for me to only find out 17 years later that it was because of unfaithful things happening within the relationship between him and my mother (not sure who was to blame, many say him) and the fact he may have not wanted me and my brother (my mother was also pregnant at the time with my sister) for some reason this alone has never phased me. Maybe it's because of my lack of awareness and just trying to always move on. Or the fact i felt lucky as my brother and sister went through much more. My brother finding the hung body of my father and my sister not having spent anytime with her father.  

This ultimately shattered my mother, she was never the same. She was always happy and easy going but after everything i could see she was no longer who she wanted to be or thought she would be. I think it's important to say this but my family is majority Muslim (not all)  and traditional at that, so imagine being arranged married and then after having 2 kids your husbands off himself for the entire family too see. 

I think for me its important to say this (or type it) as I've never spoke about this to anybody and to move on and accept peoples advice. No one professional. I must warn as if people don't like to read about abuse it gets pretty dark. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) So, i wet the bed into my mid teens, 10-12 is the average age of when kids stop wetting the bed but mine went on for a while. This was because I'd be so scared to go the toilet as a kid i was convinced i could see dead people, or scared of my uncle who was a drugged up zombie. So every-time i wet the bed my mother would beat me and force me to eat food off the bed where i had wet myself as she was convinced it would cure me. Twice in one night i wet the bed and my mother beat me relentlessly. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) My family got a new camcorder and wanted to record events but instead they had a tape of my mother beating me with a stick and played it every family reunion and laughed about it. Idk i laughed along but deep down something didn't feel right. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) circumcision. Now i know this happens in manly culture but when ever i get intimate with my girlfriend i cant handle her seeing me fully nude. I'm not completely shy but when it comes to that area i feel robbed, as a 8 year kid i has 2 random men come in to my house and cute bits of my penis. I know it was for cleanliness and culture but i wish i was asked for consent. After the circumcision the entire family circled around me and dipped me into a bathtub full of Detol. Which as you can imagine was excruciating, i still remember the pain today at 20 years old. 

&amp;#x200B;

4) I had no free will as a child, i had to cut my hair the way she wanted, i had to dress the way she wanted and i had to do what she wanted. As a Muslim family they're strict. But later on in life i found myself not  a man of religion. To this day they think I'm Muslim, i lie about fasting (I'm so sorry to the Muslims out there but i cant disappoint her) i have a white girlfriend too and if i ever told my mom she would have a panic attack. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, when i was close to telling my mother i am not who she and my family want me to be she said she understood, then 5 minutes later berated me and sent me a shit load of Islamic books to educate me, i have the utmost respect for religion and kept the qu'ran elevated on my shelf safe but its a bitter reminder sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

To end this, I'm at uni now. I dipped the first chance i had with a girl i loved, she one day just left me. so i feel alone, i have a girlfriend but she's a nurse and has her life right. Meanwhile i'm always falling apart and trying to get high (weed only) I'm trying to stop hence this post. However every time i tell her anything she tells me how important family is and is trying to guilt trip me to get back home because of the current situation. My mother is a good person i believe deep down. Not everything in my life was bad. She fed,clothed and gave me money when i needed it. But I just cant get over the past. I haven't told her or anyone in my family i love then since i was 7.  So at this point I'm lost, how do i tell my family i'm not them (non-Muslim, has a white girlfriend, damaged, drink and smoke weed) . i just cant leave them cold turkey as i know my mother will report it to the police or come and find me.

929,"In the UK 

So my daughter (17) is a full blown anarchist and an active member in our local ACAB 'movement' group. She feels very strongly about these things and I won't say I wasn't proud when I found out. Well I recently found out from my daughter's school that she had a 'secret' instagram account dedicated to her political beliefs. It has about 3000 dedicated followers, from what I can tell. Looking through it, nothing sticks out. It has pictures and videos of her at protests, information detailing why she has these beliefs, etc. She also advocates for peaceful protests but acknowledges that violence is sometimes needed (important).

Anyway, someone found this account and sent it to her school and now they're kicking up a fuss about it. Saying that the account 'goes against the school's morals' and the public image it wants to portray and by having a student with these beliefs is damaging to the school's image. 

They told me that they had told my daughter that they expect the account to be deleted by the 1st of May and if not, they will have to discuss the future of my daughter at their school. I think this is ridiculous. They have already targeted my daughter for her beliefs before, calling her out of class to ask why she had searched 'Sacco and Vanzetti' (2 Italian anarchists in the 20's) and got angry when she told them she was learning about them in her history class. They have even gone as far to say anarchists are scum in modern society. Whatever your political belief is, I expect most would agree in saying this behaviour is unacceptable. 

Luckily, my daughter isn't to worried and says she will not delete the account (good, I don't want her to) but I am worried about the school and how they will handle this. They're using my daughter's 'quote' about how violence is sometimes needed and saying it is being treated as a threat. They've singled out my daughter so much because of her political beliefs, and now this account is the cherry on top that they need. Can they do this?",28Apr2020,1

Anyway, I quickly found a potential place but the downside is that they are asking me to move in May 1st which is in a few days.

I know that if I move with family 3 hours away, eventually I will end up moving back to the city so the thought of moving twice exhausts me to even think about. What if I move 3 hours away and then the next month we're able to go back to work? Another thing that makes me anxious is that there would be 4 other people in the house so I'd have less privacy. The obvious up side is that that the living costs would be much lower than having a roommate and I'd be in a house with a yard and not a condo. I'm drawn to live with a roommate because the place I found is very reasonably priced and roughly the same distance it took me to get to work when I wasn't WFH. I just don't want to jump and do it hastily because May is so close. But I would hate to be 3 hours away and feeling like I'm living in temporary chaos. My decision making abilities are so foggy right now. I don't necessarily think one decision is better or more convenient than the other but I am having trouble taking a side.",28Apr2020,1

934,"This girl and i know each other for 4 years, we spent a good part of that being good friends, we fell in love and got in a relationship that sadly lasted 10 days. We're basically perfect for each other and i mean it. Everything was so easy and great, but she had to know something. She is a muslim, i on the other hand, am an ex-muslim. When i told her she was very cool with it although i thought it was weird. Because it is a big deal in this situation, and her reaction was awesome and everything was fine. Next day, i felt she wasn't totally okay, and she has every right to not be, she's been thinking about the future and how it is forbidden for us to get married meaning we have no future together unless one of us converts, which is pretty much impossible for me because it's irreversible, and very hard for her because i know how hard that can be. At first, we brushed it off and decided to just keep going together until something came up, but then surrendered to the fact that there is no solution. And we decided it was best to break up, although none of us wants to move on, we still love and want each other, it's just that if we keep in touch, we can't pretend the problem isn't there and it'll keep hurting us both. So it has been 3 days since we broke up, and i never felt this empty or hurt, i feel like it's a huge mistake to let this go, especially that the problem is not between us but rather something else entirely, every night, i feel the need to text her, but that'll only get us back where we started and we'll have to say goodbye again. But i can't live with the fact that i'm losing her and look at her slip right out of my fingers and the reason is not convincing enough for me (quite naturally) that's why the decision we made doesn't seem a 100% right.

Now i'm in a dilemma, text her and keep going again or just live with the pain of losing what i believe is the perfect woman for me.

The only apparent solution is if one of us changes to the other one's beliefs. That would solve it all, but almost non doable.

936,"2019-2020 was a fucking hell. I kept failing myself and questioning my value and abilities. I've always had great ambitions and always thought I am superior to my peers so that's a way to explain this. I am going to start university soon and just a few months ago I realised how shit my highschool years were relationship and experience-wise. Barely made any true friendships. ""Fell in love"" 2 times, both times being rejected. I tried during those times to project myself from the other's perspective, and everytime I find something wrong in my actions but I cannot explain what it is. If love is about caring, then the reality is that I never felt this and I cannot fucking love, not even my parents. I deny any strong emotion towards other people (let it be love or hate) and I cannot explain why. Everytime I read a book where strong relationships between humans are a huge a theme, I become feeling lonely and wondering what is this ""curse"" that I keep myself trapped into. It's really hard to counter this since I cannot imagine myself being different from what I am now. The only way to excuse this attitude is that my parents divorced when I was around 4, but I cannot give this event any importance. I want to stop feeling this way, I want to be a human and have a general state of happiness. I won't even go into my nihilistic thoughts on hummanity, I think I've said enough.",28Apr2020,1
937,"There is a person (we'll call him Bob) who lives one floor below me who texts my roommate that he can hear us walking around and it bothers him/wakes him up. I have never met Bob.

I don't think I walk that loudly, but I do wear sandals in the apartment so maybe he is hearing me walk in them.  


Bob has texted my quieter roommate on multiple occasions asking us to stop being so loud when walking. I'm not sure how to solve this issue. I could wear socks, but I that would be pretty uncomfortable to have to do 24/7. It seems like it could also be that the floor/Bob's ceiling is thin or that he is very sensitive to noise.

My best friend just had a little baby. He’s an adorable little boy! Unfortunately he was born during the quarantine, so she cannot have any friends/extended family come over to help her during this life changing time. She had to get a c-section and is having trouble breast feeding/sleeping. She has anxiety normally and had to go off her medications for the pregnancy and postpartum is starting to hit hard already. 

She has a bunch of baby clothes of different sizes and we already dropped off a bunch of freezer meals. 

I wanted to make her a gift basket that would be thoughtful but most importantly- helpful. I haven’t given birth before so I don’t know what every new mom needs (that she didn’t realize she would actually need).

939,"Hi, my problem consists of several problems and I don't even know where to start so this one might get long. Please be patient with me as English isn't my first language.

I'm 18 years old and I still go to school. I am in my second to last year of school and I already failed once and had to repeat a class at 13. Now that schools are closed, we've been getting assignments to do at home in every subject. I know I should just be doing them, but I think my problem is about more than just procrastiation. I already talked to the school's nurse who is a psychologist too because whenever I want to start working for school, I get really nervous and my stomach starts to hurt and breathing starts to hurt a bit too. I don't know what a panic attack is supposed to feel like but I assume that that's what I have. All I can think about is that I'm gonna fail and nothing I do will fix it because it's too late and I don't understand any of what I'm supposed to do. I'm currently failing 4 of my classes but whenever I start feeling bad, instead of working through it I go to sleep to make it stop. I sleep for about 10-12 hours a day and the rest of the day all I do is lay on my bed and make up scenarios in my head that keep my mind off of things that make me anxious. Lately I've been thinking about cutting myselfagain (used to do that from age 10 to 13) and I started drinking when I wasn't tired cause it makes me fall asleep earlier and I don't want to be awake. Anyway, my school's nurse told me to get antidepressants because she says I need to function right now and therapy won't help fast enough. I put it off for a few weeks and now you can't really get doctor's appointments fot stuff like that.

I don't know how to fix this and if I should even take antidepressants for it because when I brought it up my boyfriend and my family told me I shouldn't take them.

And I really want to go to university, so I can't drop out of school, but my boyfriend and his family kinda pressure me into it because he didn't finish school either and got a good job. His mom keeps telling me that I need to find a job and I can take classes and go to university later in life too but that's just not what I want for myself and I'm so tired of arguing and explaining it that I just agreed to drop out if I fail this year. (Didn't know we'd be working from home at that time.) I feel like they're gonna make me get a job and drop out of school and I don't have the right to say no because I agreed a few months ago, even though the circumstances were different back then.

I'm trying to contact my teachers and find ways to get a positive grade somehow but my school doesn't have patience for me anymore because I keep messing up and I can't really open up to anyone because they keep ridiculing me and I feel like now that I'm 18 I should be able to handle things by myself so I don't even know who to talk to. My boyfriend is a great person but when it comes to this problem, he just doesn't get it and keeps telling me that I should just get a job. My parents just tell me to get over it and work for school. And I know that they are right but it just doesn't work.

I'm not sure if anyone can help me with this or if I just needed to type it out cause I can't say it to anyone but I am hoping to receive some answers that might help me decide what to do next. If you've come this far. thank you for reading!

940,"I did one year at a four year college but, I had to drop out for a semester. I had a financial aid issue, that’s been resolved. Now, I plan on transferring to a community college. There’s a community college 10 minutes away from my house and there’s also one that’s 40 minutes away. I plan on changing my major but, the college that’s 10 minutes away doesn’t really have any majors that I’ll enjoy. The one that’s 40 minutes away does though. The problem is that 40 minute drive everyday, depending on how my schedule is. It’s going to burn me out. I drove 40 minutes everyday to my previous college since I didn’t live on campus. After I get home, I couldn’t even study or do homework because I’ll be so tired and couldn’t concentrate. Causing me to fall behind and cram everything in one day. That 40 minute drive really sucked, especially towards the end of the week or when I had to work all weekend and couldn’t sleep in. What should I do? I really want to be able to just drive 10 minutes, but I also want to major in something I’ll possibly enjoy.",28Apr2020,1
941,"Weird title, I’m sorry. But here’s the backstory; my (21M) boyfriend and I (19F) have been together for a year. We met online and it was long distance (4 hours) for a bit but he’s moved in with me about a month ago. So my boyfriend- J- has ulcerative colitis or chrons. He always flip flops between the two so honestly I don’t know which. 

Yesterday, he had a flare up. Blood, uncontrollable movements- the works. I drove him to the hospital immediately when he got home, and had to drop him off due to COVID hospital restrictions. I texted his mom as he gave me updates but I began to get the impression that she already knew more of what was going on so I backed off. I picked J up and I told her that I was new to helping him through this so if she were to give me advice I would absolutely appreciate it. She basically told me “keep him hydrated I’ll deal with it.” 

So I did. Because it’s all I could do. I felt useless asking him “what do you need” 30 times before he fell asleep. Meanwhile his mom was taking care of doctors appointments, calling the hospital and all sorts of stuff. Only thing is she made his appointment for a scope down where she lives- again, 4 hours away. 

J expects me to drive him 4 hours for surgery- early in the morning- and then drive back another 4 two days later. Thing is, I’d have no problem if that was our only option. We have plenty of GI’s up here. We have just as many resources- if not more! Also, I have a dog and a cat that are my responsibility to care for. As well as summer classes starting up around the time of his appointment. 



I don’t know what to do. I will do anything I need to do but it feels like overkill(?) to have to continue this back and forth thing. I guess this is a vent post as well as seeking advice, so I’m sorry. It’s frustrating that he depends on his mom to do everything in terms of medical stuff. He’s had his disease for many years and he’s almost 22. I want to be able to help him but I don’t know how to. Thanks for any advice y’all might have. I’d really appreciate it.",28Apr2020,1
942,"Hello everyone!

Nowadays something just started to happen inside my emotional space, and I’m curious how you’re handling these things.

To be short, I was something like an alcoholic person which I become after an abusive relationship and very poisonous environment that almost killed me. Anyway, I did some bad things previously and under the drinking as well. Mostly lying, but lying very much. It might be because I had a really low self esteem, but it doesn’t matter now.

It’s been more then 6 months now that I stopped doing anything harmful. Became a vegetarian , meditating a lot, make some charity, but it feels like that all the dirt of my past just came to face and sometimes I feel like I’m throwing up. It’s kind of a mixture of betrayals, lies, abuse, unshared loves, childhood traumas and things like these, which I didn’t face like for 8 years.

947,"Hi all, not sure if this is the place to post this but I’ll give it a go and feel free to let me know if I should direct my post to a different subreddit. (See end of post for TL;DR)

In short, I’m looking to help my dad out financially in a rather large and not so typical way by somehow getting his arrears paid off to help him out in the midst of the present financial crisis brought on by COVID-19.  During such trying and unusual times, I’m hoping to perhaps find a not-so-typical solution to the issue of my dad’s arrears, which to date are approximately $130,000, and I’m open to all suggestions, no matter how out landish or far fetched. 

In an effort to not make this post excessively long, without getting into excessive detail (feel free to comment or dm me if you have questions or want to hear more details for context purposes) my father is one of the not-so-commonly talked about cases where he was screwed over financially (as well as emotionally) upon getting divorced from my mother. 

My father is an incredibly kind hearted, loving, and hardworking person who has consistently supported his kids and made arrears/child support payments, but unfortunately got behind on his payments during a period of time in which he struggled to find employment (without a college degree) after being laid off from his job of 25 years and was going through chemotherapy, and my mother has not been sympathetic to his situation whatsoever and will not pardon any portion of his payments. 

On top of this, my father has mentioned to me that my mother has not been forthcoming about the money he owes her, and has fabricated the numbers, but my father has no way of proving it. 

My father is represented by an attorney and they have done everything they could to make his arrears and child support payments as fair as possible, but my dad still struggles financially. I want to essentially make those arrears disappear for my dad by paying them off in their entirety, as I know he struggles to make ends meet.

More specifically my question is, how would you go about raising, or having someone donate, approximately $130,000-$200,000 to a particular cause? I want to give back to the man that has given me so much. As I previously mentioned, my dad’s arrears owed to date are about $130,000, but I’d love to give my dad some extra money so that he could put money down on the purchase of a house and do so many other things he has been working so hard to accomplish in life. I want nothing more than this burden to be lifted from my father so he can just get on with the rest of his life and retire (he’s 64 and still working!) after a lifetime of hardship.

So I have a few ideas, and I know they are EXTREMES, but I’m willing to put in the work and effort and I realize none of this will happen over night:

-Reaching out to a millionaire, celebrity, or notable charity and sharing my dad’s story with them to see if they would be willing to donate to the cause
-Putting together a Go Fund me and making it go viral
-Reaching our to a professional writer to help me put together a well written letter or proposal

Does anyone have any advice or insight as to how I could go about any of the above or know of any person or organization I could reach out to, or have any other ideas of their own? Let me be clear that I am not looking for legal advice, as my father is already represented by an attorney, but any and all feedback is appreciated, thank you!

TL;DR Looking for suggestions of different ways to have my dad’s arrears paid as a means to help my dad out in the midst of this COVID-19 crisis. Ideas I have so far include to have the arrears paid off by either reaching out to someone wealthy or a charity to have them paid off, or by putting together a fundraiser.",28Apr2020,1

951,"I'm 14,  M, and I am a Muslim Arab American. I'm gonna try and keep this short, but I'm going by each family member. (And right now with Ramadan and quarantine it has gotten so bad)

My sister- she verbally abuses me. She kicked me out of the room we ""shared"" so I sleep on couch every night for the past 2 years now. She is relentless on me, and we can't even be in the same room together.

My brother- he is actually the only person I love and care about. He is the only father figure, hell the only parent figure I ever knew. He took care of me the best he could and essentially raised me. When my dad ""beta me nonstop"" I do not like the a word. He protected me from my dad all he could. He is the oldest and an adult. He has no problem with my mom and sister because he doesn't really see them a lot. We all live in the same house btw. But he is ok

My mom- she did care for me, but she has gotten out of hand. And I hate it, her and my sister always play the same two fucking songs every day, 67 times each (I Counted) and they don't stop worshipping the Kpop bands they like and I hate it. One of my friends say I may have PTSD from it it's so bad. And she always cares for my sister and not me or my brother. Especially now, because they are on a diet together and do a bunch of stuff together they don't care about us. My mom doesn't cook for me, my brother or dad, and only cares about her and my sister. Another example of her unfair treatment is for example: they watch kpop videos and vlogs from the members.

My brother- he is actually the only person I love and care about. He is the only father figure, hell the only parent figure I ever knew.

My parents were married almost 30 years but separated for about half. The recently (3 years ago) got divorced bc my dad wanted to remarry. They're still great friends, talk regularly and my relationship with him hasn't changed a bit. 
He's very well off and very generous with helping with bills ect. My mom however is very independent and pretty proud so she hates to ask for any kind of outside help. There was no spousal support agreement and i don't think an official settlement either.

So this year i moved out from home and because of the current virus situation i got laid off and mon8is extremely tight. I can pay my basic bills but iteaves me 0 room and now i got an 'extra' bill that I'm not sure i can afford. I'm considering asking my dad if he can help me out with a couple hundred euros (he gave my mom some money month and she passed a little on to me without me asking). The thing is in the past when he's sent me money it's always been through my mom(something to do with international banks, I'm not sure why) even if i ask him to wire it directly and she's often been judgmental about it.

So i'm asking what i should do in this situation? Stick it out and see if i can make it work or ask and put up with my mom's side eye?",28Apr2020,1

968,"Okay, so I'm the last person to want to claim to have a mental illness, but I do have a few concerns. First of all, I have had concerns in the past that I have very mild depression-though I have no clue. In the last year or so I've been having some trouble.

I'm in college for a catering course, meaning I work in the kitchens and have had a job in a pubs kitchen on desserts. I get really anxious about messing up in the kitchens, sometimes I'll feel so uneasy I fake being sick (I have a pretty crappy immune system due to a previous bad diet, meaning I get sick frequently so it's believable) so I don't have to be around my knives or the other students.

In my job, I was supposed to use a blowtorch for a certain bit of preparation, but I felt so anxious about it another cook noticed and showed me how to use something else instead. When I got fired (unrelated) I was sort of relieved, because the whole thing made me feel sick and make me feel dizzy.

I've started to stay in my room more (mostly to avoid my asshole brother who likes to start fights over nothing), I don't talk to my friends as much as I used to, and I keep getting what my sister tells me might be sensory overloads (she's studying physcology and has been for a few years).

I go through swings where all noises irritate me, if someone so much as brushes against me I want to gouge out my eyes, and I just want to smash my head repeatedly against a wall or table. I've had these sort of things for a few years, though they keep happening more and more.

I get a constant sick-feeling, it's getting really annoying now, and I get tired after like one in the afternoon.

I'm aware I shouldn't be venting this all out on a Reddit throwaway, I know I should see a therapist, and not just about this stuff. It's not like I can do that anytime soon, you know, with social distancing and all. When I move out and have enough money to, I'll start seeing one. Probably. Maybe.

I don't like talking about this to my parents, they manage to always pin blame about anything on me and, for people who work in the NHS, they know shit-all about mental illness (my sister had an eating disorder and they ignored it, my brother is a narcissistic asshole with anger issues that they also like to pretend isn't a part of reality). They'd be personally offended.

I just want to know what's wrong with me, or if there is something, because I can't talk to anyone about these sort of things. A lot of my friends are immature, one has a very light and breezy idea of what depression is, and my sister is already stressed with work. I've broken down around her before, I'm not piling this shit on her again.

I jumped the gun a little bit because my grandmother is alive!! Last week she ended up waking and pulling the ventilator tube out and now she is at a physical rehabilitation center to get back the muscle that she lost. She and I are back to calling every day and she's sounds so good! She does have a blockage in her heart so she's not entirely out of the clear but gosh I am so grateful that I have her back. 

I have chosen to keep my aunt blocked for now. Partially because of this but partially because I had her blocked before for a completely different reason. I will be perfectly polite to her at family outings as per usual. 

People had been mentioning that I should have taken my grandma into my own home but unfortunately it isn't safe for her here either.

Only problem is that I, for obvious reasons, do not know this person at all, just that there are sex videos and photos of her online. Should I tell her? Would it be weird?

i’ve already adapted to the fact that tanya and carly are now the best of friends and do everything together. it hurt in the beginning when they started getting closer, but what am i supposed to do about that, that’s just life you know, so it felt irrational to get angry at them for just naturally getting closer.

for the past 3 months, on and off, they’ve been asking me to make plans. whether i said yes i’m down, or no i don’t feel like it (which is rarely because i like leaving me house) they always end up ghosting me for a while then following through with the plans WITHOUT ME. 

i understand wanting to have time with each other, but when they invite me, then follow through without me, it feels like they have a disregard for me feelings. almost like they’re just toying with me. at this point i’m just confused and hurt. its not even the fact that they make plans without me and anna, i got over that, but the fact that they make plans with us, only to follow through without us and not even say anything. if they don’t want me hanging out with them, i’m totally cool with that, just don’t send me an invite, making me clear out my day, only to never hear from either of them and absorbing a feeling of disappointment. i’m leaving in 3 and a half months for Uni, and i feel so isolated from my bestest of friends and it feels like they’re just ruining my last few months that are supposed to be the most fun and memory filled.

985,"First... I'm a little worried about confrontation because I'm small and I live by myself. So keep that in mind. 

I live on a street of college students, being one myself. One of my neighbors appears to be hosting nightly bonfires with a friend or two, and is outside pretty much all day, leaves bud light cans all over the place. That kinda thing.

Last night, my apartment smelled even smokier than usual. My windows were closed, and even then, my eyes were watering and I got a headache. I checked, and it looks like they dumped the ashes from their fire next to my window, which I've taken a picture of. 

I have asthma (for which I can't get any inhaler refills currently, so I'm reserving emergency medication), which I am concerned may be triggered, especially if I need to open my windows (no aircon) as it gets warmer.

I really, really don't want to be a Debbie Downer/Party Pooper, but if this happens again, aside from major annoyances, it would be bad for my health. As I see it, if it happens again, I have a few options...

* Get over it and use up my emergency medication.
* Leave a note on my neighbor's door and dash when they're not outside.
* Walk over, and talk to them. 
* Call the non-emergency police line (which is what I was advised to do by my neighborhood association)

I really, really don't want to make enemies, and have previously had bad experiences re: personal safety, and I'm wondering if I'm just being a party pooping nerd. Would I be justified to call the non-emergency police line?

Also, he’s remodeled our kitchen and bathroom as well as painted windows. He mows the yard. No video games and no drug use. His favorite hobby is playing jazz and classical guitar, and he’s an intermediate player. He never asks for money unless it’s gas money to drive to school. He doesn’t even eat lunch when he’s going to school. My son does say he wants to be independent someday.

The bad: He’s never had a job. Also, he doesn’t have friends and has never had a girlfriend. He’s really shy. We provide everything. I fix his meals and do his laundry. Of course not having a job, he’s never paid rent. We provide an older truck for him along with insurance payments and gas money. But I will say, he does keep the truck very well maintained (changes oil, etc) and much cleaner than I keep my car. He talks about being a loser a lot to the point that it drives his dad and I crazy. He also talks a lot about wanting to start his own business which is probably not realistic. Additionally, he always looks at rundown houses for sale and talks about buying them and fixing them to live in. But he’s never even had a job and has no money.

Why is my son in a failure to launch situation? I’ve been researching a lot and don’t know what to do? Should I show tough love or be softer on him? What to do?",28Apr2020,1
988,"F20. I’ve had a crush on a guy for the past year and half that goes to my school. Every time I was around him and wanted to talk to him or he would try to talk to me (which happened twice)I would freeze up and seem unapproachable (not smiling, blushing away) because I was really shy and wasn’t ready to talk to guys who I was interested it. I felt abit bad cause I didn’t want to seem rude or like I had played him or anything..
Lately I’ve been making changes with communication and building my relationships  and I wanted to try reaching out to him without making it awkward or silly on social media. Part of me still has the shy not so confident girl holding her back but I know if I don’t do it it’s gonna keep bothers me...

989,"I’m a 23 year old female, currently in a relationship with a 25 year old male. At the beginning of our relationship we used to argue constantly sometimes every week, at first I thought it was normal because we were both getting used to each other and there are things in which we would bump heads but then we would talk stuff out and meet middle ground. I’ve been in this relationship for about a year and almost 6 months and once again we’re constantly arguing over things that in my opinion shouldn’t become an argument. It’s just that my boyfriend has a really short temper and I can’t mention things without him exploding. He’s become very verbally abusive when we argue, he will cuss at me and raise his voice almost scream, he says it’s all because I frustrate him, he says that when I repeat things more than once it really pisses him off and that’s the reason why he yells at me but the reason why I say things more than once is because he disregards then the first few times I say them. The more arguments we have the harder I find it to move past them, the horrible things he says to me sit in my head and I find myself constantly crying, hurting.

998,"Hey there, it's my first time using this subreddit (and in general I've not posted almost anything on Reddit), and to be honest I'm not sure if I'll be able to find exactly what I'm looking for here, but one can hope, right?

Okay well to start things off: I'm a 17 year old junior in high school, and I'm starting to feel more and more pressure to make up my decision of, not only my career, but the university I want to attend. As of now, I have around a 3.70 GPA, a 28 composite (29 math, 32 sci, 24 eng, 25 rea, no writing) on the ACT, ,a PSAT score of 1340 (690/650 reading/math), and rank 15 out of 96 or so students. I have not taken the SAT yet. Right now however, I face what I feel like is a big problem. Although to begin with I didn't have a lot (say 60-80 or so?), I lost my journal and therefore have 0 community hours as of now. I planned to make up for this throughout the summer but now because of the situation of quarantine I no longer have a safety net of how much time I'll have before college applications to catch up with everyone in terms of hours in community. Aside from that, I've been struggling a lot in the ""what I want to do with the rest of my life"" field. Although growing up I've been encouraged and moved into math, (and I did relatively well on it too to be fair), I find myself unsure if I should go into engineering. For my hs endorsement, it's what I've focused on, but I just haven't really clicked well with the engineering courses so far and am not sure if it's for me. Yes, I'm aware that there's more branches of engineering, but really I find the idea of investing yourself into studying something without truly at least experiencing some of it first really scary and don't know what I'd end up choosing. Lately I've thought about something in virtual reality, but even then I'm not sure what part I'd do (software, design, making parts, etc.), like I don't really have a lot of a clue as to what any of those are like, how capable I am of doing it, and overall how happy I'd be working in that area. Not only that but lately my struggle to do well in AP Calculus AB and now BC has discouraged me from really feeling like I can excel in a field like math. I'd say I'm pretty average in most other subjects (although I don't like life sciences all that much), and I did like physics class relatively well (although it was a DE course and not an AP, so it wasn't very rigorous). Lastly, I've been overwhelmed with college letters and (being a very honest to myself person), I don't want to raise my hopes up too much just because I got a letter from a place that although is amazing, I probably was like barely in their radius for them to have enough interest in me to send me a letter. I'm not sure exactly if I should even attempt given my community hour situation, and I'm just trying to fix as much as I can now before it's too late. I'd really appreciate any type of advice from any of my topics I discussed greatly, so if you could that'd be amazing :) Thank you for your time if you read all of this!",28Apr2020,1

1004,"Before my girlfriend and I began dating, she frequently studied with a classmate at their respective apartments. While they had consensual sex a few times, their friendship had been otherwise platonic.

One evening, he ignored her clear and repeated declination of his aggressive advances and raped her. Days later, she came to terms with the fact that her consent to previous encounters did not excuse his actions that night. 

She declined to report him to their program out of fear of retaliation. But I was proud of her incredible courage after she told him that he had violated her and that she wanted the future of their interpersonal relationship to be strictly confined to the classroom. He attempted to gaslight her, but nevertheless, she persisted. She distanced herself from him for most of the year.

Today, she asked me if she should mend fences with him and cautiously return to their prior routine of studying together at his apartment post-pandemic. He’s the only person in her program with any fluency in her area of specialty; she once benefitted greatly from hearing his feedback.

We’re usually in a LDR but spending the duration of the pandemic together. Despite her very introverted personality, she has struggled with spending the overwhelming majority of her time alone during her semesters—even before the pandemic took her classes online. 

I fully, unequivocally trust her intentions. I believe that she truly thinks that they can resume a productive working relationship without putting herself in harm’s way. She and I spent a decade in very close friendship before I overcame my struggles with the level of vulnerability to which dating her would expose me. I subsequently embraced my deep love for her. She’s repeatedly expressed her desire to marry me; I dream of our future life together. 

That said, I’ve observed in her a pattern of habitually excusing those who treat her poorly—often months later.

While I think her idea is terribly ill-advised, I fear that attempting to stop her could only lead to resentment. But it would break my heart for him to violate her again. Ultimately, I just want her to be safe.

How would you proceed, Reddit?",28Apr2020,1

After tons of nervousness, anticipation, excitement, and hard work, I finished the carpet and was so proud of myself for how well I did. However, my fiancé and I realized something that made me pretty upset after how proud I was; a faint, but noticeable enough, blue streak that runs right through the middle of the whole length of the carpet. The line is perfectly straight like it happened during manufacturing (possibly from machine oil?). Besides, I was extremely careful not to have gotten anything on the carpet. It is faint enough for me to not have noticed during the installation process, however it is something that really does bother me enough to not even want the carpet anymore. My fiancé and I went to Lowe’s only a couple days later to check their roll to see if the same blue line was on it to have proof, but of course it was not.

But I just feel like a fraud in a weird way. Sometimes if I'm talking to a group of people and something I might have read up on comes up, I might share it, if it is relevant. But doing this, I just feel like I'm fake. I feel fake, as in I feel like I'm just fooling myself and others by pretending to know a lot of stuff.

But if I think rationally about it, I do like learning new stuff for the sake of learning and not for the sake of showing off. But then my feelings of feeling like a fake idiot pretending to be smart kicks in. It's like this weird cycle of me thinking I'm just a regular guy that just happens to like learning some new stuff, and then me feeling like a total fraud.

So which one should I listen to? It's kind of driving me nuts, and I can just feel the uncertainty killing my self-esteem.

Note: By saying that I'm worried about being a fake intellectual, I'm in no way saying that I might be an intellectual, if I'm not a fake one.

1017," So a little about myself and my situation:

* I'm a introvert kind of person
* I'm a US Citizen and graduated High School on California
* I don't own any kind of bank account
* I do have a social security number and a California ID
* I don't currently live in the US
* I am studying in a University in the current country I am in
* I am focusing my time on my studies so I don't have a job and also because so far I haven't been able to find one too
* For more context I'm in a Spanish speaking country so I'm fluent in both Spanish and English

Well I think that was the most important things to say about it, so for the advice I'm seeking is about what to do, so to explain more about some is that right now I'm finishing my major at the university so about 1 or 2 years until I graduate, and in reality there aren't many opportunities in my country in relation to the major I'm studying so once I finish I plan to go back to the US, but the thing is one reason that I'm in another country studying despite being a citizen is that my dad retired from his job and decided to come live back in his home country, I think my grandmother is now around 95, I'm not that young either but I'm still way under 30, but the thing is I went to a city college after high school and before coming to the current country I'm in, and took different subjects since at the time I didn't have a clue what I wanted to study.

Since my dad is retired and is here too I don't have a place to go when I go back to the US, we do have an address where all our mail goes to, but is a place that I can't go live on since is a small place and is a part of my family that I really don't get along.

In my time here I have made a good group of friends, a classmate that I met in university (will call him F1) and also get along with his brothers, one of them went to the US and right now is on Texas (will call him F2, he is staying with some family right now but I'm comfortable that when I travel there I can stay with him for 2 weeks before coming back, given because of the current pandemic I don't think I will be traveling any time soon, this year was gonna be the first time I went to visit.

I want to start planning what to do in the future since F1 and I are planning to open up a business since so far we haven't been able to find a job, but now that F2 is in the US we were thinking if we could do something with that since I'm a citizen so things might be easier for me, so I was wondering how can I go about going to Texas and see if I can set up some kind of business there and for the time being find some housing to rent and stay in with F2 since most likely I will be traveling between the 2 counties since at first I was planning to live there but now I have someone here that I'm interested in and for the time being she isn't interested in going to the US, what can I do given that for now I don't have any form of income, and I don't have bank account in the US, also I want to know how can I do about moving since that also entails from moving from California to Texas and I don't know much about it since I have lived in California for almost half my life (the other half I was in this Spanish speaking country before I moved with my dad in Cali)

As in, one of three ""besties"" at her very tense birthday dinner. She calls me most days and I don't answer, she sends me 10+ Instagram posts/week and I don't respond, she proposes wine nights and waits for me to watch the new episode of whatever reality series is airing until I tell her she should \~really\~ just watch it alone because I won't be home for a while, etc... The whole dynamic makes me very anxious and it could be argued that I am a cold bitch but I believe that the reality is we do not get along and if she can't pick up on that then it is unfortunate but I don't think it warrants a conversation. Maybe that is my flaw, but it is what it is. 

ANYWAY, cut to present day. I haven't been home in over a month as I'm quarantining with my boyfriend, much to roommate's dismay. He and I have found a new place together, and are set to move in June 1st. In moving out I am not in any violation of my current lease, as it is month to month, but I am really dreading telling my roommate. I would love to send her a thoughtful and polite text that says something like, ""Hey, \*\*\*\*, SO and I have decided to take the next step in our relationship and get an apartment together, so I will be moving out June 1st. I am sorry for leaving you in the lurch in such a weird time, where it will probably be hard to find a roommate. I will be home a bit over the next month to pack up my things and hang out and chat, if you would like. I hope you understand.""

HOWEVER, my boyfriend and sister both think it is completely inappropriate for me to give her notice over text. I can't see an argument against a text other than ""she deserves more"". But what does that even mean, honestly? If I send her a text she can have her reaction in private and think about what she wants to say to me. I think to tell her in person would be manufactured and awkward and I guess that's the crux of the matter. I just don't want to do it. I want it to be okay to text her. It isn't a breakup; it's roommates going separate ways. God I'm sorry this was so long. What do you guys think? Can I text her?

tl;dr: I want to give my roommate a 30 day notice that I'm moving out over text, but sister and boyfriend think that's ill-mannered. I think it's contrived and subscriptivist (that's not a word.....) to demand conversations be had in person.",28Apr2020,1
1027,"I’ve been “dating” a man for five months. I use the term dating loosely. A month ago, I asked him what we were. How would he introduce me to a friend? His response was that I worry too much. Nearly half of a year in and I’ve never met any of his family. I haven’t even met his roommate, who is often present when I’m at his apartment. He’s a nice guy. Respectful. Makes me laugh, but still. 

Fast forward to last week. I don’t know why. I wasn’t dwelling on this, I hadn’t been thinking about it for days or weeks, but I reached out to a man I’ve known for twenty years. We were really close in high school, always together, and always laughing. In our twenties we went on a date once, but I lived in another city hours away at the time, and aside from a goodnight kiss nothing ever came of it. But I have loved this man for two decades. He’s seen me through highs and crippling lows. We grew apart years ago when I was in grad school, pushing everyone away, and pretending the relationship I was in wasn’t toxic and abusive. He was wrapped up in a toxic marriage that lasted for five years. 

Again, I have no idea why I reached out but I’m so glad I did. Everything picked right back up, as if years had not in fact passed since we last spoke. I’ve had a few long-term relationships in my life, including an 8-year marriage to my son’s father, but I have never felt for anyone the way I feel for this man. 

So, I suppose my question is two-fold. Am I crazy, and if not how do I break things off with this other man? There’s nothing inherently wrong there, and I do care about him, but it pales in comparison to what I’ve felt for years and am experiencing again now. How do I, in the midst of covid, compassionately tell someone they’re fine, but this other person is better?",28Apr2020,1
1028,"I have a huge fear of needles and I am dreading the vaccine for the coronavirus.

background:

Hi I am a 22-year-old female and I am terrified and I mean terrified of injections and needles.

It all started as a child and I remember the day of one of my first injections when I was around 3-5 and I remember the doctor telling me to pick a chocolate from the drawer and while I was looking he preceded to injection my bum with whatever vaccine it was. I was terrified from that moment and lost trust in doctors.

When I was 9 I was knocked down by a car and was brought to the hospital in an ambulance but refused to lay on the Gurney (stretcher) incase I was restrained so I sat on my grandfather's lap and when I was in the hospital I had to be on a gurney and got the option to have my neck supported by beanbags or a neck brace then sometime after I felt a sharp pain in my hand from where the IV was put.

At 11 I went to the dentist and got teeth taken out. My dentist didn't wait until the numbing gel took effect before he put the anaesthetic into my mouth and I was screaming the whole time and before the anaesthetic was taking effect he was trying to pull my teeth out which gave me a fear of dentists as well as doctors.

I can remember all of those events clear as day and I am absolutely terrified but since then I have gotten 6 tattoos which none of them hurt and actually just felt like vibrating fork tips on my skin. However, because I have tattoos a lot of people think I am stupid as how can someone with tattoos have a needle phobia... well I do, I refuse to get a piercing, not even my ears are pierced.

I don't know why I fear one and not the other but the way I see it is a tattoo isn't given to you without your consent, it doesn't go deeper than a few layers of skin just to let the ink stay in, the vibrating is distracting you, you actually want to get the tattoo and the tattoo artist has to go easy on you because any damage is settled in a lawsuit, when you are in the studio you are treated like a human being

Whereas a injection/bloodtests can be given without your consent as they can restrain you to give you it, It goes deeper into your skin, it's a straight-on dart shot into your arm with no distracting and no other surrounding pain/vibration on your skin to distract you, the doctors don't care if it hurts as they are focusing more on giving the injection or the taking of the blood and your pain is your problem and is secondary to them, you are treated like a human pin cushion guinea pig.

The last 3 times where I refused injections/ IV's and Blood tests is when my health was bad if that doesn't tell you how much my fear of needles is from rejecting immediate care then I don't know what will. Now on to the stories of my refusals.

The first time I was in school and refused the vaccine was I was about to get it and told the nurse if she is quiet and just does it then I will be okay and then the minute I close my eyes and tried to take my mind off it and she literally did everything but be quiet and then I started panicking again. I got verbally violent, my fight/flight response was beyond average and I literally was terrified.

The Second Time was school again for a different vaccine and they didn't even try to give me it because of the last time.

The third time I told the hospital I didn't want a blood test and they said okay and I was just sitting there with a blood pressure belt around my arm and I saw the nurse come in with blood test equipment next minute the blood pressure/heart monitor machine was beeping at the sudden change in my blood pressure/breathing/heart rhythm. They decided to do a urine test instead.

The fourth time I went to the hospital for pain in my wrist that out turned to be tendonitis but they thought it was monoarthritis and they wanted to do blood tests and the colour drained out of my face and they decided not to do a blood test but to do an x-ray instead.

With this pandemic on the rise and people talking about a vaccine I literally feel like I am death row waiting for my execution date. I have spent days in the past dreading, losing sleep or waking up in puddles of sweat, lost of appetite over getting any injections or bloodwork done, choosing to not have children of my own, putting my health at risk. It's not just 'oh I'm afraid but I will get it anyway' type of situation because it's not, I am terrified like the exact same feeling as someone who is afraid of a spider having one on their face. My blood runs cold, I start breathing weird, I start sweating and I become violent. The only way someone is going to be able to do any needlework on me is if I am put to sleep on gas and air.

I expressed my fear to my grandfather but he is telling me to get over it and how he will hold me down and that he doesn't care if I pass out as long as I get the vaccine because he is at high risk with the coronavirus.

I am stuck as I live with my grandparents and they are at risk as much as myself as I have asthma but if I don't get the vaccine I can't go out and if I do go out I can't come back. People are wanting me to just deal with injections/Iv's but I am literally terrified and I feel like I am in a dark tunnel and at the end where the light is there is like a monster to tackle and that is what the vaccine is for me. I am terrified and my problem seems like a first world problem because people are dying but if there were any other situation like the flu or whatever no one would care. I just have the pressure of my fear and peoples opinions of me on my back.

edit: I had to go back and prove read as I am actually shaking from the thought of it and made spelling mistakes and confused some words.",28Apr2020,1
1029,"So, I don't know how to convey that things affect me or that they bother me, to all my friends they think that I'm chill and that nothing affects me. Usually I go with it because it's doesn't bother me extremely bad just slight agitation, but recently My best friend admitted she had feelings for me and she knew I have liked her since I met here almost 2 years ago. And as we talked 2 weeks later she claimed she loved me and of course I said it back because I was 100% sure I did and still do. But a couple days ago I had a horrible day and was in the middle of a mental break down I snapped and hurt myself to calm me down, she knew that I rather hurt myself than others and I felt horrible for harming myself, but I wasn't going to hide this from her as she would find out eventually. She got pissed off at me when I told her what I did understandably so. She told me to fix my shit then come back to her but I had already calmed down by that time and had no intention of doing it again, so I just wait 2 days to text her again but she was being distant and I got angry about it. I said that I gave up on a lot of shit for you..etc. later I apologised but she didn't want to accept my apologies and later told me that I need to fix my stuff before talking to her again and I did but I later asked if she still felt the same she replied with idk atm im without emotions and her family life has been getting worse. But she knew that I take the words I love you seriously I won't say it unless I mean it and I trusted her to mean it and I know love doesn't disappear in a matter of 5 days and I don't know if I should tell her that it hurt me or bothers me extremely
TL:DR my best friend said she loved me romantically loosely and didn't mean it and idk how to tell her that it hurt me",28Apr2020,1
