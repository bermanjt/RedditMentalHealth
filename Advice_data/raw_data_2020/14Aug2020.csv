0,"Okay so here's the backstory:

I currently live with four other people, including myself. Two guys and two girls. The guys are C and K, and the girls are A and J and me (I'm leaving real names out). The guy, who this post is about and who I share a room with and who is K, is ""acting caretaker"" of the house/property. This means he takes our money for when bills are due and pays our rent each month when it's due but he also lives with us while he currently applying to be a police officer. I have known him over a year now and at first I thought he was a good guy. Always wanted to give back to his friends and family and was super nice, well as time went on, I saw how much of a narcissist he was and he showed his true colors. What happened between him and I is not relevant, however, since he has shown how he really acts and doesn't give a shit about me or my other roommates, I feel like this factors into the current situation. 

So, my other roommates have only just moved in this year. None of us ever signed a contract or lease agreement because he told us he ""trusted us enough to not need one"". Well fast forward a little. Over this past 7 months since my roommate J has deal with anxiety and depression almost all of her life. My other female roommate and I have as well, so we try to help her and comfort her as much as we can because she does not want to be put on medication. So over the past few months, my roommates and I have been super close and helping each other a lot, along with A's boyfriend who is also our friend. 

Anyways, fast forward to about a month or two back, J and K started having problems with one another. J's ex was coming over to the house and was using her for ""things"" and would just leave afterwards. This caused her to become even more depressed and was crying a lot more at home and was making a lot more suicidal comments (which I have clarified with her now they were just jokes/sarcasm). K has stated to all of us we can come to him with our problems and is always there for us, but once A and I have been hanging out with J more, she has been talking to us about her issues. Well according to K, he didn't like this and got somewhat offended and later on accused J of hiding stuff from him because she wasn't talking to him. We all thought that was a little weird at first and brushed it off.

Well months have passed and it has slowly been growing on him. Us not talking to him about our personal issues has been irritating him. He has even told us that ALL of his previous roommates have always told him about their problems or issues. We all tried to tell him that maybe we didn't want him to know everything about us and he got upset. Once we told him this, he began eavesdropping on our private conversations and was getting info that was. Which leads up to the current situation...

So last night, I was hanging out with J,A and her boyfriend as usual. They had been drinking a little and talking about personal stuff as did I with them. After awhile, J asked her ex to come over because she wanted to talk with him so he agreed and came over and they went upstairs and so did A and her boyfriend to go to bed. After they walked up, K came out of our room and asked how my day was. So I told him and as I was talking, he interjected and asked what we were talking about earlier. So I told him it was personal stuff. He then admitted he heard our conversation, from mine and his room downstairs, and asked about J and he said he was concerned about her mental health and that he wanted to talk with her about it because if she possibly hurt herself or killed herself he ""would be responsible for it"". I tried to tell him it wasn't his issue to worry about and if she wanted to talk to him, she would. He then said he didn't like that J's ex was coming over constantly and threatened to ban him from the property. So at this point I told him he just needed to address it with her in the morning so I went to bed.

Now to today.
K asks if I would like to go to the store with him, so I do thinking it's gonna be a normal trip. As we are in the car, he starts telling me how he's going to ban J's ex from the house and if he were to come back, he will call the cops. I told him that was extreme and then I said you just need to talk to J and figure out some common ground with her. He then said if that didn't work, he was going to threaten her with a 30 day notice. I asked him why and he told me because she's ""too much of a risk to have in the house and it could jeopardize his career to becoming a police officer"". I said her business wasn't any of his concern but he brushed it off and we just went shopping. 
After we are done, we get back to the house and C is in the garage grabbing his tools while J and A's boyfriend are inside hanging out. We unload the groceries and K tells J he needs to speak with her. So the two of them sit down at the table while I go outside to take out the garbage. All of the sudden, I hear screaming coming from inside and J comes out and asks to borrow my phone. I let her and she calls the property owner's daughter to talk about the situation with her. The property owner's daughter lets her know that she will ask her mom and get back to her. So J goes back inside to finish the conversation with K. All I can hear is a screaming match from out in the garage with C. Eventually, J comes out absolutely furious stating how K threatened to get his lawyers involved and kick her out due to her depression. C and I tell her that's not legal and A comes home from work and J immediately breaks down crying. C had to leave so he went on his way. Afterwards, we all agreed, except for K, that we didn't care if her ex came to the house. He has never caused any problems or any damage or anything. 

At this point, all of my other roommates and I are very uncomfortable around him now and we have no idea what to do as a solution. We want him gone, but we can't kick him out because we have no authority. 

I'm sorry for such the long post. I just don't know what to do and this is a serious situation to deal with. I just really need other perspectives and standpoints on what to do. Any feedback or anything would be greatly appreciated and thank you for taking the time to read this! 

TLDR; One roommate threatens to kick other roommate out due to her depression because it ""would effect his career into becoming a police officer"".",14Aug2020,1
1,"So I have a very bad and unhealthy habit which is smoking- about 5 cigs a day. I live in a ""weird"" neighborhood with a lot of characters. My landlord obviously does not allow smoking inside the home, but in fact does not want us smoking in the backyard, the patio or anywhere near the premises. Normally this was not a big deal and I would just smoke at school or work on break. During this quarantine, I am trapped at home and have been walking around my neighborhood for a quiet and private smoke spot. During this time, many creeps have felt the need to come up and talk to me. I am tired of having to be rude to them to get them to leave me alone. They seem to think they can come and try their ""pick up"" skills on me- one came to me and asked me if I had a lighter while he had a lit cigarette in hand! Also its not just when I'm smoking but when I am simply walking around. I know I should not have to do this but I even wear baggy clothes and a cap so I don't look too feminine! Any tips here???",14Aug2020,1
2,"The other day my boyfriend came over to visit me and showed my parents pictures of the road and accidentally showed them a picture of a girl in lingerie he had saved. My mom laughed it off but I felt so mad and embarrassed and jealous. The fact that he gets his pleasure from somewhere else and not me makes me feel not desired and unattractive. The fact that I’ve seen his vk account and have seen hot gifs of girls he’s shared. The fact that he doesn’t make out with me often and we are long distance. The fact that he’s turned me down because he’s tired or not in the mood. How we never are intimate through text or anywhere else. It makes me sad and frustrated. A while ago I even sent him a picture of me and he told me to do sit ups, instead of praising me.",14Aug2020,1
3,"Summary: what would happen if I blackmailed/ exposed someone intentionally. 18 years old no prior. NC 

Story:
hi! all so I want to make sure u all know I have OCD before I post this so this could easily be a false memory of mine I just want to see what u guys would say to this. I wasn’t worried up until 2 weeks ago when I had stopped it a while ago and I’ve had many false memories in the past, but that being said...

so I did findom right findom is where men come to be humiliated by you, given tasks, blackmailed, exposed everything that involves being humiliated by someone and they give money for all of that in return. They would give me money to be blackmailed, exposed..etc basically 

I did it last year 2019 and quit it. 

Ik I blackmailed consensually all the time as people would come up to me asking to be blackmailed. I also exposed people they would send me embarrassing photos just for me to expose them and laugh at them

well what if I blackmailed someone on purpose kinda thing. Like what if I was like send money or I’ll expose you, and they DIDNT want it. I deleted all my messages and my twitter account so I cannot go back and look if this occurred. 

I KNOW I blackmailed consensually all the time so I most definitely could’ve accidentally blackmailed some people intentionally on there either by getting confused if was someone else or just not knowing the basics of findom yet 

I’m also very worried I exposed someone’s embarrassing pic without asking first. Usually they would send me embarrassing pics to want to be exposed and humiliated but I’m worried I posted something embarrassing they would send me without asking first :/ this was done in the findom world a lot tho lots of the pictures and videos are of the humiliating tasks the findoms would give the subs

I would like to know how much jail time this would be. I am 18 no priors and worried. It’s been a little less than a year since I quit around January 

Any advice would be great I’m 18. NC",14Aug2020,1

5,"I knew this girl, she was toxic, I ghosted her after slowly fading out of conversation. That was earlier this summer, and now she texts me a ""hi"" out of nowhere. I did some research before ghosting her and decided that toxic friends aren't worth talking to because they're toxic. But it kind of feels wrong that I haven't responded? Like, I don't wanna talk to her, but is it wrong of me to ignore a simple ""hi""? Do I say ""hi let's not be friends"" or what should I do??",14Aug2020,1
6,"So my brother sent me a picture of my niece and I showed it to my gf saying she was adorable, but after she saw it she said that my niece was ""white passing"" keep in mind my niece is Mexican and only 1 year old, I didn't know what white passing meant so I asked her and she said she looks white and I did a bit of research and apparently it's when someone of a certain racial group gets accepted into another. So I told her that my niece wasn't white it was just the reflection from the white walls making her look white then I sent her a picture of my niece in natural lighting where she looks how she normally does and I asked her why was that the first thing that came up to mind and she said it wasn't but I just feel weird about how she was focused on the color of her skin and I just want to know am I just over reacting or is it acceptable that I feel disturbed by that. I would also like to note that before she had seen a picture of my niece but one where she didn't appear to be white and she was saying that she was adorable and couldn't wait to meet her but in the recent picture that I sent her, her whole attitude towards her changed. Also she said she was mad for some reason I don't know why, I'm sorry for the bad grammer it's just that I'm im a rush but please I would like to hear your comments on the situation was it right or wrong what she said?",14Aug2020,1
7,"So my parents went to Gatlinburg in 2015 for their 25th wedding anniversary, and came back with the “wonderful news” that they purchased a timeshare so that we can have a place to stay in Gatlinburg every year. I was immediately stunned because I thought everyone knew timeshares were scams, but I didn’t know specifically how, so my parents were confused why I wasn’t that excited about it like they were. I asked them if they had really researched it beforehand, and they said no, it was a gift they got for each other for their anniversary. Nice. My parents never go on vacation, so they were sitting ducks for some nice predatory salesmen to take advantage of while they were celebrating. 

Fast forward a few months later, they are calling my mother demanding money that she said she had already claimed and she’s having a meltdown. We end up fighting, it gets ugly, and since then, my parents don’t speak about it around me because it ends up freaking me out and we start fighting. I see letters in the mail all the time from the timeshare company and I just try and pretend I don’t notice them, because there’s nothing I can really do. This is their mess and they have to fix it, but it’s hard to watch. 

Today, my mom told me that she’s contacted a lawyer she’s apparently seen on TV and heard on the radio that specializes in helping people get out of timeshares. I don’t remember what she said the person’s name was, but I’m just so skeptical of it. I know that getting out of timeshares is extremely difficult and they probably will need a lawyer, but has anyone had any experience dealing with this process? Any particular ways better than others? 

It’s hard to not be angry with them, and hard not to feel bitter by their naive choices, but I don’t want this to get worse for them because I refuse to help them through this difficult problem.",14Aug2020,1
8,"I posted something on r/Findafriend because I want new friends. 

I got a message from a guy a little around 25 minutes after posting it, asking me a sexually explicit question although I made it abundantly clear that I was a minor and did *not* want to be hit on. I got uncomfortable at the question and he burst.

He started calling me names, telling me to go fuck myself, wished sexual assault upon me, and said I should go rape my 11 year old brother. And called me a bunch of slurs against my sexuality. I blocked him after that.

I feel like shit now, even if I can't get any advice I would just like some positive comments below before I go give Kurt Cobain a visit. Thanks for anything you send my way.",14Aug2020,1
9,"I often find myself out of the loop of many mainstream news outlets. To prevent that, I am here to ask which of the (federal) departments should be followed? 

I know facebook is probably the most active social media, that allows users to keep their favorites at the top of their feed.

10,"I'm really scared and nervous to post this long wall of text, but I dunno where else to ask or vent for this. This may or may not be long post, and I've never really talked about this with anyone. I'm also scared to post on reddit, feeling I'll get ridiculed, made fun of, and no one believing me. But I need to get this off...so here goes.

I'm a young adult living with my mother currently and have been for all of my life now. Growing up, my mother had next to no friends, was sick a lot due to family genetics, and worst of all, grew up having epilepsy. All of the numerous seizures she's had over her life damaged her brain, she tells me, and had to be dropped from school due to that. My grandmother, her mother, had to work all the time and couldn't always be there for her, thus having my mom isolating herself at home due to no one wanting to put up with her. She is a deep, religious Christian, still is, and this has caused issues with me I'll get into in a bit. She eventually had brain surgery around 1994, and made it through alive, which I am very proud of her for, but during that surgery, lots of tissue were removed, doing so she's unable to do functions that people that haven't gone through what she has would be able to normally due. During her time of healing, her brain was asleep, and she couldn't differentiate from right and wrong, and was took advantage of by someone. This is how I came to be, and I wish for the life of me I had a proper father and could go back in time and change things for her. However, I'm grateful I'm even here at all.

Skipping to modern years, my mother began going to a Pentecostal church and she found her home, with the ""right preacher that preaches things that isn't preached in other churches."" Her words, not mine. Thing is, they mostly just preached about the end times and how every single little bad event that's been happening means the end of the world is near the corner. My mother started believing that and has been forcing me to ""prepare"" as well, and it's been annoying me. She's let up on that but she still thinks and worries she's not ready. She met a guy at said church and got into a relationship with them, thinking they were Christian as well, only to be torn apart, used, and manipulated. He was not a good father and parental figure, and only wanted my mother around to use. I had to push her out and keep reminding her what bad of a relationship it was and how it's mentally draining her and her funds. She eventually did break off from him, but the aftereffects had damaged her.

What I mean by that is what's been bothering me. Slowly, from that relationship, her health has worsened. For one, she keeps, what she tells me, getting bothered and attacked from Satan, or ""the evil one"" as she keeps having thoughts go through her head that aren't from her. She's been watching sermons like crazy now and every time I see her, that's all she watches, she never used to be like that, and forces me to watch them to with her. I don't want to disappoint her and not to bring her down, but I'm not religious and find them bothersome to watch. She's usually crying a lot more often to, and her right hand shakes when this is happening, saying it's the holy spirit in her, but I doubt that. Always, she comes to me constantly, asking me if she's still saved, will she still go to heaven, if she has fear and anxiety  in her will she not go to heaven. I don't know any of this and how to truly answer, and when I direct her to talk with a counselor from a church, she says they never have the time for her and they will never believe her, even though I tell her that not every counselor is the same, and she doesn't know that for sure. All she has is my grandmother and me to be with, and she's never been able to make friends or go to groups and have a lasting conversation. She says they're too busy and never want to spend time with her. 

Despite all this, my mother says she isn't trying to ruin my life or bring me down, yet she wants me to not leave her, and think that if I move away from her, I'll forget her.  I love her to death and I want her to be happy, but I have my own interests, my own friends, my own anxiety and suicidal conditions that I am dealing with as well, and having to balance all this is making me lose motivation to live. These past few weeks, she's been having heart problems, more ""attacks from satan,"" tremors, and I'm constantly worried about her state of living. She takes tegretol to keep her seizures from happening again, but her doctor said that she was taking too high of a dosage and I'm scared for life of her dying. 

I'm torn and conflicted to the point of just feeling like life just isn't worth living if this is how mine is. I want to support her, especially what's she's been through, but I don't know everything and can't always be around to answer. Plus, I eventually want to leave and have my own place and life, but I feel horrible doing that to. I'm scared to even post this long of a story since I feel like no one will take me seriously, and I've been made fun of in the past for telling it. Plus I'm still unfamiliar with posting on Reddit, so I don't know how the responses will be. I have barely enough friends to turn to, and even then I feel like myself no one wants to do anything with me, adding more to my stress.

So, what can I even do...? I am very very sorry for the long post, I needed to get this out somewhere.",14Aug2020,1
11,"22,F. This is a stupid thing to need advice for, it’s not life or death. But it’s starting to consume a lot of my time, feelings, and it’s starting to affect my work. 

I’ve been working at my current job for about 5 years now, and about a year and a half ago we got a new manager. I developed a fun little crush that was something I’d joke about with my friends. However, and especially recently, I’ve developed much stronger feelings that are no longer just a fun little crush. I struggle to focus at work and do what I’m supposed to. I just want to be near him and hang out with him. Sometimes we’ll talk about movies, music, etc. and an entire hour goes by of my shift before either of us realize we haven’t done anything. We are SO similar. We like the same things, we think the same, we’re both sarcastic and cynical and dark humored. I’ve never met someone who is that similar to me. He’s my ideal guy, very reminiscent of Nick Miller (he even says so himself) 😂

This is really new for me because I RARELY have strong emotional feelings for guys. I have not ever been in a serious long term relationship, and I haven’t ever really been interested in one until now. I don’t even really know how to explain how I’m feeling because it seems so childish and adolescent. I’ve never had a guy consume so much of my brain capacity. I think about him all the time and it’s incredibly distracting. 

To top it all off, he is 16 years older than me and has been in a relationship with a woman for 4 years now. I know the chances of me having a relationship with him are so slim, but I honestly don’t know what to do because my feelings for him are becoming very overwhelming all the time, not just at work. What do I do? Do I quit and try to find a new job in the middle of a global pandemic to remove myself from him completely to forget about him? Do I just try to get over it?",14Aug2020,1

14,"
My family owns a house on a quiet dead end street where our house it second to the last at the end. Nearly all of our neighbors are 60+. We don’t live in an affluent area, but the houses on our street are not rentals. The neighbor we are having an issue with definitely owns his home, there’s no landlord to call for help, and my house is the only one with a clear view into his back yard. We are on friendly terms with him, but not close because he’s at least 20 years older than my husband and a bachelor with no kids or close family that ever visits. The dead end turns into a heavily wooded area with a lot of wildlife. 

Our problem is that our neighbor has stopped moving his back yard entirely. He’s got close to 1/3 acre and no fence around it so we see a lot of deer and such back there. Especially now that it’s become quite brushy and probably hip high. We also have started to see snakes around our house that we never had a problem with, and most distressingly, we now have mice in our house. 

I believe that this is due to the conditions next door. We have brought the tall grass up to our neighbor earlier this summer and got a lukewarm response. His lawnmower is broken, can’t afford to fix it, can’t afford to pay anyone to cut the grass. That’s understandable and my husband and I would be happy to help if he had asked before it got out of hand since we want to be neighborly and we like the guy. Now, though, the yard it too over grown for us to handle and we can’t afford to pay for it to get fixed either. 

The obvious solution is to call the city and report him, but based on our previous conversation and our unique position of being the only ones who can tell how bad it is back there, he would know it was us who called and resulted I him getting fined. We don’t want to be on bad terms with the guy, and we are sensitive to the financial aspect of a guy his age in his physical condition, but we are getting pretty fed up and I am livid about the mice.

25,"Election day is coming up in my country. 

There are two major candidates, and then a few more ""lesser known"" folks that are also running.

Guy #1 who is currently in office and is an objectively horrible person. Racist, sexist, and a whole lot of other stuff that would take so long to write out. Any good accomplishments, if any, are overshadowed by all the bad stuff he's said and done. You get the picture.

Guy #2 is a lifelong politician who does not have a great track record either. he's signed bills that support racist policies, and is known for being pretty creepy with women. Is probably the better choice of the two, appears to be somewhat more intelligent &amp; collected. The other is an arrogant blimp.

Both candidates have multiple credible sexual misconduct related allegations against them.

Others: we also have several lesser known independent candidates who probably all have better qualifications, but, I'm told could split the vote so that guy #1 will remain in office.

I already know I'm absolutely not voting for guy#1. And I know people say vote him out at all costs, but I really don't think I can, in good conscience, vote for guy#2. I want to vote for one of the smaller candidates, but I don't want to be guilty of letting my vote be wasted.

He's not answering my text even though he should've been back at my parents by now. What do I do now?

35,"I had to make a throwaway account for this post because it is something that I am pretty ashamed of. So a couple of months ago around mid/early June I was on YouTube trying to masturbate ( not pornhub or any other similar site because I have a pretty weird fetish and YouTube has many videos involving this fetish) and I had already gotten erect over a video which I would deem acceptable to masturbate to but the video finished so I was looking for another video to continue masturbating to and I saw a video that looked fine so I clicked on it and this is where I made the fuck up that has lead to 2 months of me feeling guilty and very uncomfortable in my own mind. Basically I had misinterpreted the title. In the title the word ‘daddy’ was used and I interpreted it as the sexualised meaning when in reality it literally just meant father . It was a young girl in the video. I can’t be too sure but she was probably about 10 or 11 ( you couldn’t see her face so it was hard to tell) and although I am not totally comfortable revealing what my fetish is I can tell you that I m 100% NOT a pedophile . I’m 15 years old so by law I can’t be but I would still say what I did is extremely morally incorrect. The only reason I clicked on the video is because I thought it would satisfy my fetish , I didn’t expect the girl to be so young and I do not get aroused over children but for some reason on this particular day my morales went out the window as I attempted to masturbate to this video of a young girl and her father. I was suspicious of the girls age as soon as she came into view but for some reason attempted to continue masturbating . I don’t remember paying full attention to this video and I think my focus shifted to around the room a couple times but suddenly I thought to myself ‘what the fuck am I doing this is so morally incorrect’ as I realised how young the girl must have been. It was as if I was in a trance and had just snapped out of it because I suddenly went totally soft and I clicked off the video. I cried my eyes out and even started getting suicidal thoughts as I thought I didn’t deserve to be alive anymore. I’ve clicked on the video a couple times since then just to see why the fuck I was even trying to masturbate to it and each time I did not find it at all arousing and was disgusted that I had attempted to get off to this. I have still been masturbating since this has happened and I can assure you it has been to adult women but I am still utterly ashamed of this and am in desperate need of some advice to stop feeling so ashamed because this guilt is really holding me back from progressing in life.",14Aug2020,1

I’m 17 now, I turn 18 in November.

I legally live with my mom, as in according to the divorce decree, I live with my mom and my dad pays child support.

I recently moved into my dads, and my mom is saying that not only will she not pay child support, she won’t send back the child support he pays. It automatically comes out of his paycheck every month. She’s saying that because the divorce decree she’s not supposed to pay it. So she’s telling my dad he needs to change it legally and then she’ll pay it. I know that legally that’s how it goes, but here me out

If you had a child with a woman and after you divorced he lived with her, you should pay child support.

Now say the child comes and lives with you, does it make sense that you still have to pay child support?

It’s three months, and I’m upset because my mom can’t just suck it up and pay for three months, when my dad has payed for almost 15 years. He told me that her lawyer also a while back got it raised because they included his military disability as part of his income, so basically the money he earned before he even met her that comes from the government now is part of the total and increases the child support.

I told my mom that she didn’t have to pay child support, I just wanted her to return the money my dad was paying for me back to my dad.

 I NEED HELP FIGURING OUT how to quickly legally change my address and get it to where she has to legally pay child support. Where do I go like what court. I live in Texas.

It’s bullshit that she’s doing this, and yes it’s the law, but just because it’s the law doesn’t mean it’s right. I’ve been living with my dad but she says technically I’m just visiting him, despite me being there all week and only going to my moms every other weekend..
I asked my sister what the 700+ dollars of child support goes to and she said food but you aren’t here to eat it. Yeah no shit because I’m at my dads.

45,"   So, bear with me. I (21f) live with my boyfriend (22), his brother (14), and their single dad (40), and have been for several months now. At first it was amazing, and it still is for the most part, except for one tiny detail that's driving me crazy. Recently the brother and the father have become huge slobs, leaving their dishes, trash, food, and belongings all over the house. I am a little bit of a clean freak, so something like this makes me feel really disgusting especially when I have to use the kitchen and there's garbage piling up on the counter, mail strewn about, crumbs from long past meals, empty beer cans, and sticky residue all over the counter. We had a deep cleaning about two weeks ago and I was able to keep up with things by emptying the dishwasher every morning and then rinsing and placing all our used dishes in it as soon as we were done eating, as well as wiping counters and just being CLEAN, and it felt so good. The counters were easy to maintain for those two weeks because no one was really home all that much, and I just picked up whatever little things were forgotten here and there. 
  Except a few days ago my boyfriend's sister came over with her two babies, and my father-in-law to be decided to order pizzas, make big meals, and use up a ton of dishes and just leave them out everywhere afterward. This went on for two or three days. The house is a complete disaster again. Not to mention, the little brother who lives with us always leaves his dish and utensils out from every single meal. He doesn't even bother to put them in the sink that is three feet away from his eating spot. It's disgusting. 
   Today, the father just made it clear that he expects my boyfriend and I to clean the house and wash all dishes even though I have faithfully been putting our dishes in the dishwasher and cleaning up after ourselves consistently. The whole mess belongs to HIM and his younger son. I have no idea what to do, I'm at my whits end, I do not want to clean up their stinky disgusting mess that they just keep making worse day after day, and I don't want to live in a house that's not looked after. What is so hard about cleaning up after yourself thirty seconds after you've eaten/used an item/spent time in a room and gotten things out of their place? Like, just, *put it back when you're done.*

51,"Let me preface this by saying that she's had a drinking problem for a long time. I didn't realise the extent of it until recently. My brother lives with my uncle and his wife and says that when she would go to work, she would put beer in a coffee tumbler so that no one would notice.

They got married in April. They got pregnant in May. It was not a ""woops"" baby.

We are closer than most families and we hang out with my uncle and his wife, drinking and having fun, whatev. I had my birthday party there last year.

So basically... Apparently she has been lying to us, drinking ""non-alcoholic"" beers. But really she's been either A) pouring the non-alc out, and pouring real beer into the can to drink from or B) pouring real beer into a glass and claiming its non-alc.
I visited her once in June and saw firsthand she was drinking from a glass. You know how some people like to drink their beer from a glass? My aunt has never been one of those people. I've only ever see her drink directly from a can. This made me see that my brother was likely telling the truth.

She also has been smoking weed. This is an issue too - but there isn't as much research to show the dangers this could pose to a baby. Whereas there is SO much research about how dangerous alcohol is.

I don't know what to do. I'm usually so close to my aunt. My brother has forbade me from telling them I know. But I can't be fake, so I've just been avoiding her. I can't even look at her. 

My uncle apparently knows of what she has been doing and has been angrily blaming my brother for ""influencing"" his wife as my brother drinks and smokes weed too.

55,"The title explains most of it but il elaborate

My friend of 5 years, we've gone through high school together, gotten blackout drunk together, and now a large group of us have a holiday planned (with this person coming along). So this person I considered one of my closest friends has potentially stolen over £600 from me over the last year.
This person works with me, building computers as a side gig while I'm in college so theres a decent amount of cash and high value computer parts in my home.

Il give a rundown of why I believe this is the case as the burden of evidence currently lies on me, I have to prove thats hes guilty before he proves innocence.

-£10 missing from my wallet during a night where a group of us were over drinking (with our suspect present all night) this was about a year ago
-£40 missing from my computer desk that I was going to use to pay him for helping out
-£100 missing from our store of cash in the living room, this was when I got really suspicious so we hid the cash in a more secure location
-This more secure location previously had £1300, I had spent about £600, so that tin should have £700, today it has £300 which has since been hidden in an even more secure location.
-Additionally £50 has gone missing from my wallet, I havent been outside in 3 days and I, without doubt, had £80 in the wallet yesterday

This combined with the following pieces of information are backing up my suspicion on where this money is going.

This person gets paid relatively little in comparison to the profit I get from each computer sale, for his age it's well above minimum wage but still not near my income

He has recently paid for the flights for our group holiday about 2 months earlier than we had planned
A few days ago he paid the final amount of his share of the villa, being his sole employer I know his income and a rough idea of his spending habits and unless theres another alternative source of income the amount he makes from me doesnt support his lifestyle and these recent holiday payments.

Now there is the distinct possibility I've gone down the rabbit hole and built up this pessimistic image of the situation but I'd like some fresh perspectives, what would you do in my situation, if anyone has been in a similar situation I'd love to hear how it played out.

I apologise for the wall of text but I hope you can understand my concern and I appreciate you for reading this!

57,"Hey, I haven't made a Reddit post before so please bare with me. I'm 17 and I live with my grandad and brother but I'm supposed to live with my parents. I've lived at my grandad's house (Unofficially) for pretty much my whole life. The problem is that my grandad is 82, feeling ill, and constantly grumpy. His foot was injured over three years ago by someone who stepped on it whilst in a rush, weird, I know. I can't blame him for being grumpy either, considering his arthritis and his back problems and now the trouble he has walking.

The main issue is that the house is a mess, a seriously massive mess. He constantly argues with me and my brother about cleaning the house, and cleaning my room. Now, I don't mind to clean my room, that's perfectly acceptable but there's so much stuff that has been hoarded in my room that doesn't belong to me and when I ask him where I should put it, he just says think about it. I've found myself getting lazier and lazier, even making cereal seems like a big chore sometimes. I've stopped making my bed properly and I've got clothes littered everywhere. Whenever I try to move them though, I end up feeling so tired.

I've got so much to do, college work, forms to fill and find a job. It is my fault for letting all this pile up and being negligent in the first place but I always end up feeling so miserable and irritable because of the house. My parents' house is exactly the same, it's like we're a family of hoarders. My grandad often turns the WiFi off to spite me or my brother, and I need that for college work. He is always in a bad mood and he drains the energy of everyone else. I get so angry sometimes when I try to explain anything to him, he always brushes whatever I say off.

Now, I used to use the site for the more, well, erotic polls that were on there. Back then, I didn't really see anything overtly disturbing, but recently I came back at sixteen, so, I looked a little deeper through the search results and found some really messed up polls which seem way too fixated on children and teenagers. Like, a lot of them would have titles like 'kids being tied up', or something similar, and may of them would be specifically asking for replies from 'boys' and 'girls' and would ask for age ranges of 13 - 18. Now considering that these are clearly erotic, or fetish based polls, this is really worrying. I know that in every website, these kinds of things can slip through the cracks, but Mr. Poll is not a very large website, and these kinds of search results are really common.

66,"tonight my sister(27F) received a call from one of her close friends(27F), asking her to go with them for a one night trip to another town.

At first she was kinda excited but half hearted (because of our strict parents, who are really difficult to convince) but her friend told her that she and her husband (33M) will talk to mom (55F)and dad (56M)to get permission for her and they also said that they will make sure our parents truly want her to go on the trip and they won't have any problem with it (because sometimes they let you do something but after that the nagging and scolding won't stop)

So ,my sister was on the verge of accepting the offer , but for reassuring she asked her friend if there will be other people and if yes, who are they ?

Her friend said that my sister's ex boyfriend(27M) will be there and honestly my sister didn't really want to reject the idea of the trip just because of him.

She also said that one of their co-workers(28F) will go with them and will bring this really beautiful friend(24F) of her , who also works in the same institute as them.

You see, it's not that there are still feelings between my sister and her ex. It's just that she knows how her ex's mind works and how he's inconsiderate and all it takes for him to be in a new relationship is a pretty face. So ,she's not sure if she would be able to handle the atmosphere the situation will bring.

TL;DR my sister wanted a trip but her ex is there , alright , accepted!! But what should she do when he won't stop hitting on other pretty girls and making the atmospher hard to deal with?? Specially when it was already difficult to convince the parents for the trip!",14Aug2020,1
67,"I rarely get any matches or likes on online dating apps/sites and if I do they're always overweight. I can see my own top 4 abs - not ripped but I'm trying my best. I'm not attracted to overweight women. Who are the guys matching to thin women? What do they look like? Is there anything I can do to be one of them?

68,"We are in our 20’s. we’ve been together for 2 years. Pretty much half of it is long distance and we are still on long distance. we will be reunited soon. 

all the time when we are apart, i feel like I’ve been the worst girlfriend. Now I communicate everything to him, which actually I think hurts him more than when i repress things. i am quite blunt and i do say hurtful things. Obviously I regret right after what I’ve said it already. 

Just things like i expected him to do what he promised to do, but sometimes things happen and he has to change plans. i would get annoyed. I’ve been like 1% better the past few weeks but I’m still not proud. he often would say that i accuse him a lot. for example, i would ask or say to him that he likes this girl because she has big boobs etc etc. i know, how mature. 

those are just examples. there are other things that I’ve done and I’m not proud of. i just feel extremely sad and regret it so much that i haven’t been as supportive to him during these times. and he is still with me. i can’t believe that. 

i just want to change and be the best girlfriend for him because he truly deserves it. and i hate being a hateful and jealous girlfriend. 

i am worried that one day he’ll just get sick of me and leave. i don’t want that.

69,"So long story short my dad had a stroke 7 years ago and it’s still hurting our family to this day. He’s still alive but in a nursing home. My mom makes me feel guilty about a lot of things. She may not out right say it but I can see the sorrow look on her face every day. My sister told me not so good things about what she had to deal with growing up and now I can totally relate. It just seems when I have a life of my own or I’m busy with work and friends my mom makes me feel guilty because I’m not “spending enough time with her.” She even called me cold hearted because I had this conversation with her but she just won’t accept it. I can’t fill that void my dad left and neither can my sister.

Has anyone else had to deal with this? It just baffles me how your own family can give you so much grief",14Aug2020,1

I'm basically always ready to get erect spontaneously, just never fully erect. The problem isn't getting hard, it's staying hard. I can't stay hard for longer than a few seconds, no joke. I can't even stay hard enough to put a condom on without constant stimulation. I have watched a lot of porn and used to masturbate a lot which i think may have desensitzed me aswell as reduced both the quality and duration of my erections. I am a pretty fit guy and am oy 20 years old. I am really really worried. Both for myself and my relationship. As I mentioned I am a virgin but I'm not one to suffer from mental issues.

71,"Before this year, I was working a job I loved, going out regularly with friends, traveling around countries, and active in my life. I remember so many highlights less than a year ago, sitting by the beach, being at a party, hanging out with close friends and family, even simple pleasures, like browsing stores, and eating in restaurants, even cheap fast food, telling myself to enjoy and soak it in, since we never know what the future holds.  

Since everything shut down this year due to covid, I lost my job, entertainments all cancelled, rarely go out now, been stuck at home most days. I was in the hospital last month for declining health, now feeling better, but at the time almost wish I didn't live, since I was going through chronic body pain, from poor diet and lack of exercise.  

I've always wanted to spend some time resting at home and start a business, which I finally got too do, the former which now became to excessive at the cost of everything I miss, and the latter of which is now on the verge of failing. The only nice thing is I was able to get on the $600 unemployment, which was amazing, but now even that's over, and my industry is likely shut down for the rest of the year. 

I know in perspective, there's many in the world now going through much worse, homeless, with responsibilities and folks to care for, on the verge of losing their lives, once in a lifetime milestones like graduation cancelled, cities that have been bombed or destroyed by protesters, but individually, still feel so much to be desired and missed. 

I don't know what to do, what's the best subreddit to go too, just me ranting and lost on my situation, if anyone else is going through similar, advice and help is appreciated!",14Aug2020,1
72,"Hi, please take the time to read this as I really need help about what to do and if I’m in the wrong or not. I’ll do my best to be fair and not be biased.

So here goes. Me (male 17), my two younger sisters (10 and 7), and my mom (39 important to note). Are victims of domestic violence and verbal abuse by my father (who left us a year ago)also cheated on my mom. Ever since then my mother has been talking on the phone with another man. Here’s the thing since my dad left, my mom would secretly have this man enter our house at night for sex (since my dad wouldn’t give her any love, she found someone to do it with after he left). Now I know that my moms been through a lot with the abuse, but so was I and my sisters, I know it wasn’t easy. But here’s the other thing in the recent months my mom would invite him over to our house multiple times and he would stay for a couple days (all he does is lay around in the guest room and eat food). This man isn’t a bad guy, he’s a nice guy that likes to help people (or so my mom says), he’s helped us look for a used car online since we didn’t have one, helped pay for my drivers license (mom didn’t have job yet at that time) which wasn’t necessary since my mom’s brother (22) could’ve paid. He’s also helping us find a new home online since we’d like to move from our current home. As you can see everything he’s doing isn’t necessarily difficult, it’s stuff I could do my self  since it’s literally just searching online. Now for more context on this man he lives in the city an hour away, he himself has no car, no job, and still lives with his mother. That’s right no car, me and my uncle (mom’s brother) literally have to drive an hour to his house and come back just so he could stay at my house for a few days and while he’s here every night my mom and him would have sex in the room he’s staying in. Okay but look I’m not perfect either, I’m stubborn, when he’s visiting my house, i stay in my room and don’t do anything to associate with him, I don’t even look at him and I give him a quiet attitude if he speaks to me, my sisters too would stay in their rooms and stay quiet . But here’s my problem me, my sisters, and my uncle don’t like this man coming into our house for absolutely no reason, especially me and my sisters who are afraid to have another person coming into our life after what my dad did. And we are Muslims to clarify if my extended family found out about what my mom’s doing, they would loose there mind since their religious. Lastly my mom says if I don’t let her do these things, she’s going to leave me and my sisters.

So here’s where i’m asking for your guys answer, who is in the wrong? Me and my sisters who don’t want this man in our life or my mom who is going at it with this man.",14Aug2020,1
73,"Bit of an unusual question but hear me out.

So I broke my humerus back in December during an arm wrestle of all things, and it basically split my humerus into 3 parts, the surgeon took one look of the X-ray and said he likes a challenge, so yeah it was a pretty nasty break.

I remember the first 3 nights were horrible as they kept me in hospital and had to keep postponing the operation and every time I would try to sleep I would get flash backs and it would just repeat over and over in my head.

From what I can gather it was probably some sort of PTSD and the sound of the snap kept ringing every time I thought about it.

I’m doing fine now and I’m mostly healed, fully healing and physio can take up to 2 years to get back to where you were even though it will never be 100% which I feel like I have come to terms with for the most part. 

So  most nights I struggle to sleep before 3 am, I usually wake up around 10am for work (at home)

Occasionally when I struggle to sleep I will think about it and for the most part it’s fine, but sometimes I still get that cringey squeamish feeling about how it could have easily been avoided (don’t arm wrestle a guy twice your size or follow your arm as you’re losing) and I knew I wouldn’t beat him but I wanted to see how easily he would put me down, neither of our arms moved for about five seconds so stupidly I thought I had a chance and put all my body weight into it and that’s when I started to lose.

I’m sure most people will agree that it’s probably wise to go see a therapist or something but others might see it as not that traumatic of an experience but for me it was, and I’ve dealt with metal health issues in the past and still do, and one of the main reasons this experience was so impactful for me was because it meant I couldn’t lift weights anymore which is always helped with my mental health.

Thankfully recently I’ve been able to go back to the gym, chest exercises are pretty painful on the arm and my bicep and triceps need a lot of work but for the most part I’m getting there so feeing optimistic.

So my question is could this whole event be a major factor in why I struggle to sleep most nights even if I don’t necessarily think about it all the time? I’ve always stayed up late but as of late I seriously struggle to sleep before 3 am or even 4 some nights.

So if anyone has any advice on the topic of insomnia it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",14Aug2020,1
74," 

I can’t talk to my parents about this for various reasons, and there aren’t any other adults I feel comfortable with asking, so here it goes.  
I want to go to college for 4 years, community college for the first two because it’s cheaper, but I also want to move to a different state and live with my SO so I can have in-state tuition benefits. I don’t know how to do this, or how to explain to my parents what I want to do. I also have little help finding colleges or scholarships and am worried about being a burden even if I can find any job. My parents have a little over 10k saved for college, but that’s not very much and if I play this wrong I might not get any of it as help. I need a lot of guidance.   
How could I explain this to my parents?  
How do I find colleges and scholarships?  
Should I even go through with this? I really don’t like the place I live and want to leave as soon as I can, but I know it’s not normal for people like me to do so.",14Aug2020,1
75,"This may be lighter than some other posts here but for whatever reason it popped into my head today. To preface this story, I’m a guy [M19]

At college I met this guy [M21] we’ll call him Jason, through some clubs. As college went on we interacted a good amount, and we were friendly enough. I’d see him through clubs,but I didn’t see them enough to consider them a good friend or anything. We could definitely joke around a bit though

We’d always end up at the same parties (smaller school), and he would always try to convince me that I was gay. Jason is gay himself to put things in perspective. In reality I’m closer to bi, but in general I don’t really label my sexuality, and I’m typically interested in women. At that time though I was definitely questioning myself a little, and I really didn’t appreciate his assumptions. 

I’m pretty sure I told him that too, and he’d sometimes give me a sarcastic “sure” or a funny look if I did something more “gay”. It would be worse at parties because when I’m drunk I don’t care as much what people think, so I’d end up doing silly stuff that would garner a look from him.

This had been happening for a while, and at the Christmas party we were at I was especially drunk. We had joked a bit throughout the night, and at one point I jokingly slapped his ass as I walked by him. 

Even though I didn’t like how he would try to pressure me into admitting I was gay, it wasn’t right for me to do that. In my drunk mind I thought it would be funny, and I guess at the time I didn’t think it was a big deal. In reality he probably didn’t care *that* much, but I just feel stupid now. It doesn’t matter if he was a guy or a friend, it was wrong. I haven’t apologized to him for it, but I don’t even know how I would go about it now.",14Aug2020,1
76,"Hey Red,  


So I am having some issues and I am looking for input.  
The main issue is that I am tired and grumpy *all the time* now. It has been a few weeks and I need to get some kind of handle on myself. If anyone has any suggestions regarding how to cope with this kind of thing, I'd welcome them.  


I'm gonna give a BUNCH of TLDR backstory in the hopes that anyone might pick through and give me advice or help me reframe my thinking into a better mindset.  


**The Backstory:**

I'm going through a lot of small changes.  
I'm engaged as of last year, mostly happily, my partner and I have had some disagreement regarding our circumstances here and there but nothing serious. We are unhappy in our basement apartment, it makes me sick (I'm asthmatic) but we can't afford something better. They would like to move to Europe when we get better work and can save, I like some aspects of this and dislike others.  
We agree that we want to live somewhere spacious and somewhat rural. We agree on most things we want in life and are merely held back by financial constraint (school debt and cost of living leaves us without enough room to move).

  
I am obsessed with vintage stuff and collect it, with an emphasis on military gear.  
I'm getting my gun license in September. My partner doesn't like firearms and has concerns, but has agreed to let the issue rest for the time being. I'm not unsympathetic, but I am also an adult and capable of being safe with them, so I feel like it's an acceptable direction for me to go in.  
I'd like to shoot black powder recreationally.  
My partner hates when I spend money on any military gear and sometimes takes issue when I buy things for hobby purposes. I get annoyed by this because I always make the bills with money to spare and feel somewhat entitled to engage in things that make me happy (Sewing, gaming, collecting, etc)  


I buy things online.

Usually I buy things using money from sales, but sometimes I add money to an online bank account until I have ebnough to purchase what I want. I used to open parcels with my partner because I wanted to share the things I love, but inevitably the first question asked is 'how much was it?' and now I just try and open things before I even bring them into the house. I'm basically hiding the things I buy because I am tired of being asked or questioned instead of getting the enthusiasm and partnership I hoped for. I have been winding this behavior down recently because I feel it's problematic for a number of reasons, but it does happen every so often. To address the financial side, I am not in debt from these behaviors and spend within my means, always having lots left over to meet monthly needs and still save a little.  


Been off work due to Covid, but returning in a couple weeks. I work in a warehouse for minimum wage. I have asthma, and am at high risk of getting really sick if I contract Covid-19.  
I used to be really afraid but cases have been low in my area lately and I opted to return to work voluntarily, and am not feeling very stressed. I feel the quarantine has been great for me and has allowed me to spend time on myself and my hobbies and I feel I have done a great amount of introspective development.  


Warehousing isn't my field of work though. I'm a game designer by trade, I have a degree. I have worked in my field, but it was either for free at a startup (which hasn't paid me yet and owes me some ourstanding money) or for short gigs. I've been graduated two years and feel significant pressure from my partner and family to 'get a job'. I have tried, and haven't been successful in finding steady work in my field (but have always had steady work in general, sometimes working 2 or 3 jobs to have extra income). One of the first questions I am asked at gathering is 'How is your job hunt going?"" and I always try to shut it down because I am tired and frustrated of answering or talking on the matter.I'm frustrated that it takes me so long to get anything done on my portfolio or resume. I feel like it's a burden and I am just not making headway. I really want to break into my field already and have a steady job so I can afford a better lifestyle.  


I used to spend my leisure time playing games or sewing to recuperate and gain back lost energy from socializing or work, but recently have begun to try and spend more time with my partner and less time doing computer stuff because I agree that it's probably unhealthy for me to spend a lot of time at the computer. I think that my inability to recoup energy from my 'normal' outlets is a large contributing factor here, but I don't want to return to how I '*used*' to do things.  


I'm not really sure what else to provide, but I feel this is a decent account of my recent circumstances.  
I just want to stop being frustrated and putting this down has helped me vent a little.",14Aug2020,1

81,"Long story short, I started planning my wedding for next year. My fiancé and I have been together for almost 4 years, and we have had our normal share of issues, but our relationship is great. We know we want to spend our lives together. Whenever I bring up the wedding or my plans, he complains about the cost and points out that he would be good with being bf/gf forever. I try so hard not to let it get to me, but he doesn’t care if we ever get married, and says it’s just to make me happy because it’s what I want. Is this normal? I appreciate his honesty with me, but can’t help that it hurts and doesn’t feel as the same as it did before I started planning. I have always been thrifty, and only planned a small wedding that costs $2,300 total. So it’s not an expensive wedding, and I don’t know if I can go through with it, if I’m the only one that really wants it. He is faithful and is a great life partner.

85,"Little background: I graduated in December 2019 with a BS in Psychology and Human Services, and a minor in Sociology. I loved what I learned while I was in college, but now that I’m graduated I’m realizing maybe this field isn’t for me. I don’t really want to go more in debt for a Master’s degree, yet I cannot find any jobs in my area (rural SD) that pay better than what I make waiting tables. I originally went to school with the intention of becoming a counselor, but have lost the motivation to continue school. After realizing the expense of grab school, I added Human Services to my majors. Taking those classes my last semester showed me just how truly uninspired I am with social service and case work roles. I’ve learned in my job searches that I don’t really want an “on-call” job that takes up all of my time, yet I want to feel I’m doing more. 

I’ve considered opening my own business, but I have no idea what that would be or where to start. I just feel completely lost and uninspired by anything. I have no clue where to go from here and feel my life is at a complete stand still until I figure it out. I don’t want to be a server my whole life, but right now it feels like it is all I have.

90,"F 14. for the past couple of months i have been having these moments happen and then find out that they never happened. all my dreams i have been mixing them up with my reality. i don’t know if it was a dream or real or just a moment that never happened. or doesn’t even have to be a dream i just have moments and relapse they never happened. 

for example this just happened. my mom broke up with her ex like a year ago, i woke up today and he was at the table with my mom. i asked my mom what was happening and she said he was going to stay with us for a couple of weeks. then i went outside to scooter (which something i do a lot everyday.) i came back home from scootering and saw my mom and asked her where (ex bf’s name) was? she was so confused and asked me what i was talking about. she hasn’t talked to him since they broke up she said. 

that’s just one example, things like this happen a lot. then i feel light headed and dizzy, i never know if what i’m doing in this moment is reality or im just “imagining”. i feel so distraught all the time, like i’m dreaming. distanced from real life. i can’t really explain it but i everything seems hazy. i honestly never know if i’m doing something real or not. i feel like i’m delusional just talking about this. 

it’s only gotten worst lately, i have a dance comp coming up and i have these “moments” often, i’m worried i will fail and just be hazy.

what should i do about all of this? what is wrong with me? why?",14Aug2020,1
91,"Alright so basically my (21f) brother (28m) guilted my mom (50f) into taking on about $14k of debt for his college onto a secret credit card. My mom has no income and makes really poor decisions. She has decided not to tell my dad. She has already declared bankruptcy a few years ago. 

My dad (50m) is bad with money too. He is obsessed with it though, pretty much all of his attention is on money. We’re definitely well off though, he’s just obsessed with it. They’re at the age where he wants to get an easier job though. And as far as he knows, they’ll be debt free in a year. 

My mom keeps telling me that the credit card companies can’t do anything because she has no ties to her bank and they won’t bother suing her. Well, I know that her sister was tracked down and they took money from her kids (my cousins) because her name was on their accounts. 

I asked my dad if my mom’s name was on any of my information, and he said no. I’m still really freaked out that something bad could happen due to this debt. I wonder if my dad could lose anything since he’s married to my mom? Like maybe the house? Or his car? I don’t know how any of this stuff works. I don’t know the interest rate on her card. I don’t know how fast it will rack up. I don’t know how many years this has been going on. My mom said the company calls her every day. She brings it up to me all the time. I’m near my breaking point. I’m so worried that something horrible will happen if I don’t say anything. Then I would feel so bad that I didn’t say anything beforehand. 

I don’t know if I should:
a) Stay out of it (it would keep my mom from lashing out at me, but my dad would be pissed if he found out I knew and didn’t tell him)
b) Tell my dad (which would result in a huge argument between my parents, potentially get my brother kicked out, and ruin what little of a relationship I have with my mom)
c) Something I’m not thinking of",14Aug2020,1

Listen I don’t want to sound ungrateful, because I know so many kids would love to be in my position, but everything feels so temporary. I’ll be in a good mood and motivated AS EVER to get shit done, but then it just passes. I used to love working out and doing my school work, but now I feel at a distance. I’ve tried so many times to overcome my negative mindset and have been lectured probably a thousand times by my dad about how I need to change, but it just goes over my head. I researched how to manage my life, how to manifest things into my life or out, how to fall in love with myself, etc. but maybe the problem is, is that I am too busy let looking for outside sources rather than looking inside myself. I am beyond grateful for everything my dad has done for me, but I kind of want to just end everything.

96,My sisters the perfect child never been in trouble valedictorian of her class. I’m the mentally Ill troubled kid who gets into trouble. ( I honestly am a good kid I made good grades I don’t party or sneak out I’m just not as perfect as my sister so by their standards I’m troubled) my parents said for my birthday last year I could decorate my room like my sister did for her birthday. Then totally forgot about it and I never got my room decorated regardless of how many times I reminded them. I didn’t get a birthday party or anything like they did for my sister. She came back for the summer from college and they redecorated her room again and had ME PAINT IT AND CLEAN THE CARPET. They bought her a bunch of new shit instead of just using the stuff from her dorm which costed hundreds of dollars (way more than what I wanted for my room) and then when she left for college they gave her MY TV . On top of that they never made her work in high school and yet they forced me to get a job (which is fine I like working I like my job and making my own money) it’s just a bit of a double standard since they never urged her to get a job like they did me. And they bought her a brand new car and always pay for her gas. And they gave me her old broken down car from the 90s and I pay for my own gas.plus she got her card the day she turned sixteen her sophomore year and I didn’t get mine until the end of junior year when I was 17. I wouldn’t be complaining if they’d done the same for my sister because I’m lucky to even have a car in the first place. They just did so much more for her than they ever have done for me.,14Aug2020,1
97,"Hello world,

I’m a 24M. As the title suggests I’m trying to love myself a little more everyday. One obstacle that I’m stumbling upon and that upsets me is the fact that although I receive external input that I’m good looking I cannot fully feel it within.
This turns to be kinda of a handicap since I can only find attractive the really pretty girls (don’t know why it also grinds my gears). 
But their looks and confidence kinda intimidate me since I cannot fond myself “worthy” at 100% when I’m trying to get a girl I really like.

A measure I’m doing for the past months os always telling qualities that I cherish of myself in the mirror.

Do you guys had any of this two problems (not finding yourselves beautiful and only liking the top 1%?)",14Aug2020,1

Pretty much my most frequent customer, we'll call her Anne. Anne owns a local store and over the past month or so I've been there more and more. Besides building a website for her, I helped her set up a coinbase account to invest a significant amount of money into BTC. I know, I know, risky investment, but it isn't my money and she knows the risks. Not my circus.

She's been talking to a man named Louis for some time. I don't know a lot about him, but I spoke to him on the phone once. He was abrupt and clearly from another country from his accent. She intends on letting him ""manage"" her investment by giving him access to her coinbase account with all the money in BTC. I believe she is being catfished and warmed her as such however she assured me she was ok. It's not my business and I did my best to warn her but I still feel like I could do more.

She's been having trouble getting him access to her account as they keep flagging the accounts when he tries to log in (from all over the country, and I showed her as much).

He got busted for dating and being explicit with a girl when he was 25 and she was 14/15, mind you age of consent in the state I live in is 16. I find it hard to judge him since I do know a girl who had a boyfriend who was 21 when she was 15 in a state where the age of consent is 18. 

He’s a nice guy with a girlfriend and I like playing call of duty with the both of them. But I know there’s a lot of people who judge him for what he’s done and I’m not a huge fan of it either. What should I do?

102,"Hey everyone, so let’s just right get into it. 
I’m gonna be a junior in college, and I start soon. My classes are a mix of online and optional in person, and I don’t think I’m worried about it. I’ve been home ever since March, which is 6000+ miles away from my uni. My parents want me to stay and drop the semester because they understand how stressful and tedious the massive time difference affects my classes and work. They want me to stay home and intern at this massive-regional company that’ve are hiring. It’s a good idea and It’d be amazing experience for my future resume... But, home isn’t really my favorite. I grew up bullied, harassed, severely depressed, anxiety-ridden and struggle with PTSD/panic attacks when I come back home to visit. Not to mention that I suppress most of my personality here. Although, I have been seeking help and counseling in my college town, since my parents aren’t really understanding of mental health care. Which brings me to my next point. In my college town, I have the opportunity to be back in my circle and safety net. Most of my friends are going to be there, and I’ve built very strong and tight bonds with them, that I consider them family. These friends are people that have massively impacted my mental health in ways I never even imagined, quite literally saving me. So going  back to college I’d get the opportunity to be back in my private space and focus on my work (school/freelance). 

I don’t know if I should: 

A. Take a gap semester, and potentially interning for 2-3 months (if I even get it) and just kinda deal with the emotional and mental turmoil that’ll come with. 

B. Be back in my college town, with my friends/support circle and only having homework as my main source of mental/emotional turmoil lol. Allowing myself to just be and also be outwardly expressive.",14Aug2020,1
103,"My sister works at a kindergarten and is very anxious about germs, parasites, and diseases. Whenever we talk, she always brings up how worried she is about getting lice, pinworms, corona (which I know can be serious for some people but my sister is very healthy and young) and a bunch of other things, most of which aren’t that dangerous and are just a minor inconvenience to have.

She seems to fixate though and is constantly stressed about catching these. She over checks herself for lice and worms and can’t stop thinking about possibly catching Corona at work. It makes me sad because she spends so much time being worried and I know it takes away from how much she enjoys life. I don’t know how to help her because with anxiety like this, you can’t just talk them out of it a lot of the time. What can I do to help her not worry so much so she can be happier?",14Aug2020,1
104,"So, this was actually three years ago. But I find myself thinking about it quite often. We had a social studies project, and me and my two friends chose to make a documentary on police brutality. We were about twelve at the time.

For some reason, and I still don't really understand why, we found swivel chairs extraordinarily funny. That and mustaches. We put these two together and decided that I should record my self spinning around on a swivel chair with a mustache. And then look at the camera dramatically and say that police brutality is a serious issue. I honestly can't see how I found this funny, and looking back I just making a complete joke of something extremely serious.

Now, one of my friends in the group is black. She showed the video to her parents to see if there was anything we were missing. Obviously, they pointed out that there was a full on racist clip in the documentary against police brutality and it got cut out. 

I never really made much mention of this, never mind apologize. By the time I understood the meaning behind the words I said I had no idea how to approach the topic. Fast forward to now and I'm rethinking all this. I really want to apologize, but yet again, I'm at a loss to how I could even explain something like that. So, I guess, what does Reddit think?

I'm trying to calm myself down because it's middle of night but I cannot stop crying whilst thinking of what I dreamt about and how it might come true.

My dream : started with my fam and I on balcony, black clouds started forming and suddenly sky opened up and its started to rain. Soon thunder followed. After a min or so all around started to shake but it wasn't from thunders nor it was earthquake, it seemed more to be caused by big sound blasts from explotion, strong one but not in our sight. Thunder stopped, and so rained followed. All of sudden a big black mushroom looking thing appeared caused by explosion so close and again sky opened but this times it was from a burning red rocks that started going our way, as we rushed in my bro was first, he tripped over door so I fell in with him and in slow motion as I turned back I saw those rocks going through my mother's face.

110,"Okay, some condescend relationship history with these people: 

I'm a straight male. My co workers/teammates of several years, let’s call then Tasha and Holly. Tasha I’m super close to, and we sometimes hook up, but have a kind of messy/complicated not-relationship FWB friendship. She’s also one of my best friends and someone i care about very much and would support in any argument basically unconditionally. She’s black.

Other coworker, Holly, she’s white (me too btw. Well, mixed, but I look white) we are friends and we hung out once outside of work on our own, no romantic history, but honestly, I kinda have a crush on her. Tasha and I took her out for drinks on her bday one year. Her and Tasha talk, but Tasha makes fun of her a lot (more than me and little meaner) and is mostly annoyed by holly’s texts and makes fun of me for the time I got drinks with Holly. Not really out of jealousy (but maybe a little), but she knows I find holly attractive, and I do flirt with holly on occasion, but she’s never shown much reciprocation beyond enjoying the flattery so we basically are pretty strictly platonic.

Awhile ago the Tulsa massacre came up while I was chatting with holly, who had never heard of it, but looked it up and said “that was a 100 years ago, people should get over it!” It really bothered me, partly for tasha’s sake, but my own ideals as well. It felt gross to be a person whose best friend was black, and I mostly stopped texting Holly or responding to her texts for several weeks. But she ignores me sometimes, and I ignore her sometimes, out of being busy or whatever.  Nbd, right?

Eventually I’m fighting with Tasha and text Holly back again out of boredom (it’s quarantine guys, sorry). We start chatting more than usual, she seems to have missed me, and I feel super weird and bad about having a crush on a girl I think is racist. Tasha and me stop fighting, and we talk all the time. Then Tasha sends me a screenshot of holly commenting something on some facebook article about how it sucks that confederate monuments are “being replaced with statues of a career criminal \[george floyd\]” and tasha is PISSED. She unfriends holly on Facebook. A couple of days later, I decide yeah I have to unfriend holly too, to support my friend, and also in arguments about race, I would generally support black people and black causes.

Several weeks later (a lot of ignoring holly’s texts, but I did like a meme she dm’d me on Instagram), PRESENT DAY: holly texts me, “is tasha upset with me?” Fuck. I say that sounds like a tasha question. Of course I’m screenshotting and showing Tasha, who says ""why do you give two fucks about her?” (I don’t! But I guess I kinda do. But fuck that racist shit.) so Holly tells me she asked tasha who tells me she hadn’t answered yet. So here’s what I’m thinking of texting Holly: 

“But I haven’t been texting you and I deleted you off Facebook, wouldn’t it make more sense to ask if I’m upset with you instead of if Tasha is?

Unrelated to if Tasha is upset with you - there was something on fb you posted awhile ago that really bothered me, like something about how George Floyd is a career criminal. And the thing where we were talking about Tulsa and you looked up the Tulsa massacre and said it was a hundred years ago so we should be over it. Those things and the mindset behind them just really bothered me, like more so than normal cause I’ve known you to be a nice and intelligent person I wouldn’t associate with having views about race I find really insensitive and ignorant. I mean, I thought about going in to why I feel that way, but I worried it would result in either (A) us just fighting about it or (B) you agreeing with me to avoid arguing or so I won’t be upset. But idk, one thing is there’s a lot of views I have I wouldn’t say on Facebook or things I wouldn’t say at work cause they’re controversial cause there are a couple work people on there, it really bothered me that you wouldn’t think about Tasha even thought I know you consider her your friend. Like, considering how saying George Floyd is a career criminal seems incredibly insensitive to your colleague who is black and has kids and family that are black and I imagine she probably worries that some cop might someday get trigger happy with someone in her family because they figure based on their implicit bias of skin tone that person is probably just another “career criminal.” Not that you have to have black friends or family to support black issues. It just really upset me that you would say that, especially knowing Tasha would probably see it.

Anyway, that’s why I just don’t feel like talking to you right now if it’s not work related.”

What do you think dr phil’s of Reddit? Is my text stupid? What could I leave out? What could I add? Should I text back holly at all? Also please keep in mind that I mentioned that romance stuff because it's relevant, at least to how I feel (I'm kinda, okay really, in love with Tasha, but she's not interested in anything more than FWB right now and that's an advice column entry for another day), but it's more of a subplot in this situation: what I care most about here is being supportive of my friend who is black.",14Aug2020,1

Story:
hi! all so I want to make sure u all know I have OCD before I post this so this could easily be a false memory of mine I just want to see what u guys would say to this. I wasn’t worried up until 2 weeks ago when I had stopped it a while ago and I’ve had many false memories in the past, but that being said...

so I did findom right findom is where men come to be humiliated by you, given tasks, blackmailed, exposed everything that involves being humiliated by someone and they give money for all of that in return. They would give me money to be blackmailed, exposed..etc basically 

I did it last year 2019 and quit it. 

Ik I blackmailed consensually all the time as people would come up to me asking to be blackmailed. I also exposed people they would send me embarrassing photos just for me to expose them and laugh at them

well what if I blackmailed someone on purpose kinda thing. Like what if I was like send money or I’ll expose you, and they DIDNT want it. I deleted all my messages and my twitter account so I cannot go back and look if this occurred. 

I KNOW I blackmailed consensually all the time so I most definitely could’ve accidentally blackmailed some people intentionally on there either by getting confused if was someone else or just not knowing the basics of findom yet 

I’m also very worried I exposed someone’s embarrassing pic without asking first. Usually they would send me embarrassing pics to want to be exposed and humiliated but I’m worried I posted something embarrassing they would send me without asking first :/ this was done in the findom world a lot tho lots of the pictures and videos are of the humiliating tasks the findoms would give the subs

I texted him on July 26th to let me know any days that work between now and the week of August 10th... I would also call every few days but he never answered... 

nearly two weeks went by until he responded with a simple ""what?"", which drove me up a wall.

A couple days later he texts me that he's been extremely busy at work... and also says that it's unacceptable to be calling and texting this much... how much this overwhelms him and how wrong it is.

It feels like a trap... He completely ignored me for nearly two weeks, pushing my patience to the limit, and then he blames me for calling/texting him a lot which I wouldn't have to do if he had not
ignored me for so long.

She told me this, “Your eyes look too sleepy like a cow’s eyes, your thighs are too big like a pig’s butt, your lips are too thick and your skin is like a pig, your head is too pointy and flat, so that means you are dumb, you look black.” 

I’d gladly turn black, black is beautiful. But damn, I really cannot stand her words anymore. She is the one who gave birth to me, so I’m sorry I got a flat nose bridge like her, and a similar head shape like her. I’m sorry I turned out this way. I’m sorry I look “too Asian”.",14Aug2020,1

131,"For back story my sister recently got a kitten that was about 3 months old, and we recently discovered she needs treatment for worms and fleas. 

Earlier today my sister called me in tears, saying that while she tried to go over a baby gate the kitten jumped at the same time and she didn't know she was behind her. My sister lost her balance going over and stepped on her. The kitten couldn't move her next and it was stuck in an up position, and seemed neurologically damaged, but I didn't know about the extent of the damage until I got there. 

My other sister and I rushed the kitten to the vet, and since her breathing was shallow I gave her breaths on the way there. My boyfriend left his work for a bit to drop his card off to us at the vet, because my sister who owned the kitten didn't have the money to pay, and we feel like it's a no brainer to do whatever we can to help any animal we can. 

Unfortunately, the vet said there wasn't anything they could do, as her pupils wouldn't dialate and they said she had no feeling in her hind legs. The only real option was to put her down. 

It was heartbreaking, and I'm not sure how to console my sister. We buried the kitten and she has plans to plant perennials on her grave. I suggested daffodils. 

However, Im also not sure what sicknesses I should look out for now. My throat hurts just a bit and my chest has hurt a bit and so has my stomach, but the chest and stomach are on and off and I'm not sure if it's just a coincidence or not.",14Aug2020,1
132,"My dad is a massive hypocrite. He always criticizes other people but is unaware of his own problems and faults. For example, he tells me that I need to exercise more and eat less snacks (which I guess certainly is good advice for most people), but he is overweight by 20 pounds, and he has a huge potbelly and jiggly thighs. He never exercises and eats a lot of snacks himself. He spends several hours each day during the weekend slouching on the couch in the basement, eating stuff like cookies and donuts and chips and drinking soda or juice and watching TV. He reclines the couch all the way back, and it's disgusting when he does that because his feet smell terrible and look terrible.

Also, my dad tells me that I need to make my bed every morning when I wake up. Okay, I guess I should, but he is the one with terrible bedroom habits. He throws his dirty clothes on his bedroom floor, and he goes to bed wearing nothing but an underwear (or at least that's what my mom says). He also spends close to 30 minutes each time he's in the bathroom, and he rips a giant fart that echos throughout the house because of the toilet bowel and all those sound wave effects, and I try so hard not to giggle when he does that. When he brushes his teeth, he just wets his toothbrush under the faucet and runs it across his teeth once. Not making my bed isn't that big of a deal, because I'm the only person that sleeps on my bed, and my dad rarely goes in my bedroom. However, my dad's bedroom and bathroom habits are intolerable and make me want to move out, considering the fact that I am responsible for vacuuming the bedrooms and scrubbing the toilets. I swear one of these days I will just throw my dad's dirty clothes in the toilet bowel.

Finally, my dad lectures me about spending too much time on my phone. I do admit that I spend more time than necessary on social media. However, my dad is the one who spends too much time in the bathroom. We have only 2 bathrooms in the house, and there are 4 other people in the family. I don't even know what he does in the bathroom that takes half an hour for him to finish. Often he ""forgets"" to flush after he comes out of the bathroom and it smells like a nuclear attack when the next person needs to use it.",14Aug2020,1
133,"My boyfriend (25M) and I (22F) both live together. I attend the college that he works at, but I am planning to attend remotely due to health concerns. I have asthma and lung damage from two pulmonary embolisms I had previously. I am also overweight which is also why I'm concerned. My boyfriend works at the college too, and it is opening soon. I should also mention that this is in South Florida, where COVID has been particularly bad. I'm really worried about COVID spreading in his workplace or around the campus. I really don't know if I'd survive if I catch the virus and I'd rather expose myself because I value my life dearly. I also love my boyfriend and I want to stay close to him. However, I am considering spending a bit of time away from him at my mom's house (which is 20 minutes away) until seeing what actually happens on campus and if the precautions put in place are enough. Everyone on campus is required to wear a mask and social distancing is enforced. At his desk, however, (which is a cubicle in a larger space with other cubicles) he does not wear his mask because his glasses fog up and he works on a computer. This makes me especially concerned because if one of his coworkers has COVID he could easily catch it while working. Would it be a good idea for me to isolate and stay somewhere away from him or a bit or would I be okay to continue living with him? If I did stay somewhere else it would only be temporary until I could see how things go at school. It is really difficult that I even have to consider these things or fear for my life because my college is reopening. This is really screwed up.",14Aug2020,1

On the other hand, he’s super fit and fits the ideal male standard. I really want to go through with it but I don’t want him to judge me because I don’t live up to his standards (I have heard him make demeaning comments on other women’s appearances).

138,"I'm kinda freaking out.

So, a little background, I just turned 15, and I'm about to be a Sophomore through Covid. I've always been a very good student, always all A's and I take a bunch of notes, but the end of last year, when classes were done online or over zoom, things took a hit. I'm not really going to go much into it, but basically I'm not super fast at working in front of a screen. I'm not very fast at working on a computer, and I ended up spending 10+ hours a day where my classmates did maybe 3. Not exactly sure what I did wrong, but it was not very fun. 

Also, starting around a year ago, I would sometimes get to a point in a conversation where I get lost. It's a little weird to explain, but it's like someone starts talking, you listen, and suddenly BAM, they're asking you a question and you don't remember anything they just said. It never really was too horrible, just a little inconvenient. I'm not really that active in most conversations anyways, instead always quiet, or nodding, with the occasional smile or okay. 

But the problems started arising around a week ago in a conversation with a friend over phone. They were talking about one of their many fanfic obsessions, when I realized the last thing I'd understood from them was like, 3 or 4 minutes ago. I'd kinda just ""floated"" for that long, and it was like it was erased in my head. I thought it was really weird, and it wasn't like I wasn't paying attention. I was processing everything they were saying, and I apparently asked questions, it just kinda, I dunno, didn't stick?

The same thing ended up happening a couple times since then, and I kind of realized that it was only happening when someone was talking for a long amount of time, and it happened a lot more over video or a call than in person.

The problem is now, Zoom school is starting in around two weeks, and if I don't figure out how to stop myself from spacing out, I could really easily miss 5, 6 minutes straight of a lesson. That, combined with my subpar online work skills, means I'm certainly going to screw something up big time. I really need to keep my GPA high this year, because I'm planning on trying out for GSP (basically 6 weeks of a free college thing over the summer for juniors, sister did it, and it really helps for college applications), and this virus screwed up most of the things that would have helped me stand out, like a job at the pool, marching band, academic teams, etc. 

So, I don’t really know what to do. I can't exactly just see how to snap myself out, because I can't readily cause it by myself. And I really don’t want to miss something big or important when school comes back. 

So, I guess that's why I'm here. Do any of you guys have anything similar? If so, do you have any advice? Or even if you don't have something, I'd really like some help. Any tips for keeping you locked and attentive, or knocking yourself out of the zone? 

You guys were super helpful last time, and I'd really, really appreciate anything you guys might have to say now. Thank you all so much.",14Aug2020,1

The other day, my mom and I were getting out of a friend’s car and my friend said “I’ll text you later, I have questions. You know what I’m talking about?” And my mom said “yeah.”

Immediately, I felt anxious because the first thing that came to my mind was a surprise party, but I talked myself down from that idea.

But just now, I was sitting next to my dad and happened to see a picture of me at my new school on his phone when I glanced over, and my glance lingered just long enough to see the name of a Facebook event that appeared to be a surprise party. I’m feeling a few different things right now:

1) Guilty that the surprise is ruined, because I know that work has gone into it
2) anxiety that I won’t react authentically and everyone will know
3) nervous that my knowing will cause me to prepare for it in ways (makeup, clothes, etc) that give away that I know 😭

What should I do??? I so wish I hadn’t seen it. I think I’m fine with the idea of the party, I just feel so bad that I know. I want to confide in a friend but chances are that if it’s a party they’re invited, and I don’t want to ruin it for them either. Ugghghhhh 😭😭😭",14Aug2020,1

hi! all so I want to make sure u all know I have OCD before I post this so this could easily be a false memory of mine I just want to see what u guys would say to this. I wasn’t worried up until 2 weeks ago when I had stopped it a while ago and I’ve had many false memories in the past, but that being said...

so I did findom right findom is where men come to be humiliated by you, given tasks, blackmailed, exposed everything that involves being humiliated by someone and they give money for all of that in return. They would give me money to be blackmailed, exposed..etc basically 

I did it last year 2019 and quit it. 

Ik I blackmailed consensually all the time as people would come up to me asking to be blackmailed. I also exposed people they would send me embarrassing photos just for me to expose them and laugh at them

well what if I blackmailed someone on purpose kinda thing. Like what if I was like send money or I’ll expose you, and they DIDNT want it. I deleted all my messages and my twitter account so I cannot go back and look if this occurred. 

I KNOW I blackmailed consensually all the time so I most definitely could’ve accidentally blackmailed some people intentionally on there either by getting confused if was someone else or just not knowing the basics of findom yet

Usually they would send me embarrassing pics to want to be exposed and humiliated but I’m worried I posted something embarrassing they would send me without asking first :/ this was done in the findom world a lot tho lots of the pictures and videos are of the humiliating tasks the findoms would give the subs

144,"Okay, this one is a doozy. So I (23F) was raised by my grandparents (my dad’s mom and step dad). I was just raised by them as an only child. My biological mom is abusive and I saw my dad about 3-4 times a year (it’s not his fault, family court never took his side) and as a result my grandparents were important and special to me. I called my grandmother mom (I only seldom called my grandfather dad because I did have my dad in my life and he loved me). 

Anyway, growing up my grandparents did their best. They weren’t perfect, and to be honest they could’ve probably been reported to CPS multiple times for neglect. I never got the medical care I needed due to money and just the fact that they were both old and very sick. I was also absent form school all the time (despite this I was always a straight A student). I acknowledge that my grandparents couldn’t take the best care of me in the entire world, but they were precious to me and only showed me all the love in the world. I know I probably sound like I put them on a pedestal, but I loved them so much, and they never physically or emotionally abused me. They were nothing but accepting and loving towards who I was as a child. They both died a year apart from each other when I was 15-16, and it just flipped my life upside down. I then moved to live with my dad.

My father and I bump heads a lot, but I love him with all my heart as well. I’m a daddy’s little girl. However I can never talk to him about the love I have for my grandparents. (I lived with him and my stepmom/stepsisters until I moved out but for the sake of keeping things simple I won’t go into that). The reason being is because my grandparents were allegedly very abusive to him as a child. He has a lot of anger issues because of it, which I understand. I don’t know exactly what happened, but he’s told me a few horrible things that they’ve said and done to him, and my biological father (while he hated my grandmother, he’s a respectable man and I know he wouldn’t lie about someone) told me that there’s things that they’ve done to my father that my father doesn’t even know. My biological grandfather did talk about me having to be loyal to my dad as he loves me. 

The thing is, I believe it. And my biological mom was very abusive towards me, so I know the pain. But my heart is just so conflicted and I’m heartbroken because one of the two most important people in my life were apparently horrible people. I just feel betrayed and hurt, because I want to be loyal to my father and if you’d ask me if I’d ever love someone who abused my father, of course I’d say never. But the people who abused my father were apparently some of the two people I loved the most in my entire life.

I just don’t know what to do emotionally. Id like advice on just what you guys think of the situation and what would you guys think/feel if you were in a situation similar to mine. I",14Aug2020,1

So I currently work as a leader in Before/After School Care. My shifts are 6am-9am &amp; 2pm-6pm each day, and for the last 3 out of 4 days he has contacted me outside of said shifts to ask or tell me things that I do not feel are urgent enough to be contacted on my personal phone.

I share my role with another person and she says that he hasn't contacted her outside of work at all.

We are not on-call, nor are we expected to be. Which is why I'm starting to get a little frustrated that I'm being contacted on my personal phone for things that aren't urgent.

150,"Last year I thought I was bisexual (I misinterpreted anxiety attacks as attraction). I came out to my mother and friends around late fall. But a couple months ago, I realized that I'm aromantic and asexual. I hated coming out as bi so much. It was really awkward and I felt weird doing it. But now I'm realizing that I'm not even bi, so that was all useless. 

How can I correct myself while being as non-awkward as possible? I really don't want to turn it into anything big. I also didn't actually explicitly say it to some of my friends (I had a desktop background that said ""I am bi"" and they acknowledged that they saw my desktop background). Should I even bother coming out again? (I could just not date anyone). 

Would it be less strange if I just brought it up during a conversation? How could I steer a conversation to a point where I could bring that up in passing? Should I just send an asexual meme to some of my friends?

Am I overreacting? Should I just suck it up and graduate with a marketing degree and work in business, or at least work in a practical field of work that will guarantee a steady income?

Now I don't stop him from doing anything because I like it and I have fun hanging out but I feel really guilty. Am I wrong for not stopping him? What should I do? Also why is his girlfriend following me on instagram, I dont know her, she has never even been mentioned to me at all",14Aug2020,1

She snuck out to see me and eventually got caught and now she is grounded and I understand there should be consequences. However her dad thinks I just wanted her for her body and I would like to prove to her dad that I care about her and would like to remain in her life. I would like to prove I am different from the last person and I would like to try and make it easier for her because it is also my fault. Any advice?? Please.,14Aug2020,1
157,"A couple weeks ago a missing ad for a dog popped up in my Facebook. It was being shared throughout the local communities. Here is part of the ad:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The reward has been raised to $1500. Please share tips of all possible sightings. You will be paid the reward if your tip leads to his recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a screenshot of the whole ad and can link it if people want to see it.

So today my little brother (13) and I (17F) were walking along one of the trails at our local park. This was the area in which the missing dog disappeared, but we weren't out there specifically looking for the dog. There's a fairly big pond in the park where you can catch and release fish, and that was why we were there. Anyway, we ended up spotting this husky dog that I immediately recognized from the ad. Long story short, we were able to catch this dog after spending 2 hours trying to get him to trust us. We brought him home and I looked up the ad to get the phone number to call the owner.

After taking a bunch of pictures (and video) for the owner, he confirmed it was his dog. When he asked for my address, I asked him about the $1500 reward. This is where things got kind of weird... He said he had the money, but he didn't think people would actually ask for it. I told him my brother and I spent 2 hours to catch his dog and he said we didn't have to do that. We could have just called him and he would have came and got his dog. I told him there was no guarantee the dog would have stayed in the area if we didn't try to get him to trust us. The owner then said that we were in possession of his property. He said if we didn't give his dog back that he would call the cops. I got scared and hung up.

I'm just wondering what to do. My mom is at work for a couple more hours, so she doesn't know what's happened. She is a single mother and I just really wanted to help her out with some of the bills. I know the $1500 will make a huge difference. Should I give the dog back even if we don't get any reward? Or should I try to get the guy to pay the reward?",14Aug2020,1
158,"Okay so here’s what’s going on: About 2 weeks ago my best friend sent me an invite to her graduation party. Back then I truly believed I would be able to attend and I PROMISED her I would be there, but recently so much crap has happened in my life that prevents me from going. 

First off, I recently got into a car wreck and got grounded by my parents. I’m not allowed to drive anywhere, which means I don’t have a ride to her party. Secondly, I have been experiencing a lot of mental distress recently due to some psychological issues I have, and I’m not in the mental state to socialize with people right now. I truly believe that if I go to her party I will have a panic attack or breakdown on the spot. I don’t want to ruin her party due to my instability. Lastly, COVID cases are rising where I live and I feel unsafe attending a big gathering in the midst of a pandemic. She said there would be social distancing and mandatory masks, but I just don’t feel comfortable putting myself in that position. I was kind of hesitant beforehand when I first got the invitation, but recently my concerns have gone up due to the high levels of corona. 

I love my friend and I want to show her my support. It also seems that she doesn’t have many people attending her party, so I think she’s really counting on me to be there. How do I break the news to her that I can’t make it? Am I being selfish for not going? I think this is going to crush her—she has been looking forward to this party for months and my not being there might make it seem like I don’t care about her. To make things better, I do plan on making plans with her separately to give her her grad gift.",14Aug2020,1
159,"Ever since they came by to do maintenance at my property all of my citrus and a number of other plants have been rapidly dying, some almost to the point of losing all their leaves.  I've done my best to try and get them back to health but nothing seems to be working.  I will probably have to get them all replaced, and the citrus had just started fruiting too.  On top of that, a number of yard lights had stopped working, and after searching around for a while I found wires that had been cut clean and carefully tucked away into bushes to hide it.

F 14. for the past couple of months i have been having these moments happen and then find out that they never happened. all my dreams i have been mixing them up with my reality. i don’t know if it was a dream or real or just a moment that never happened. or doesn’t even have to be a dream i just have moments and relapse they never happened. 

for example this just happened. my mom broke up with her ex like a year ago, i woke up today and he was at the table with my mom. i asked my mom what was happening and she said he was going to stay with us for a couple of weeks. then i went outside to scooter (which something i do a lot everyday.) i came back home from scootering and saw my mom and asked her where (ex bf’s name) was? she was so confused and asked me what i was talking about. she hasn’t talked to him since they broke up she said. 

things like this started happening when i was very sad about my dad dying, i had moments where i thought he was still alive, where my mom told me i could go see him. but then i would realize that never happened and that he was still dead. i didn’t worry because i knew that when you are very overwhelmed with saddens things like that may happen but they never stopped it only  branched out with other things.

that’s just one example, things like this happen a lot. then i feel light headed and dizzy, i never know if what i’m doing in this moment is reality or im just “imagining”. i feel so distraught all the time, like i’m dreaming. distanced from real life. i can’t really explain it but i everything seems hazy. i honestly never know if i’m doing something real or not. i feel like i’m delusional just talking about this. 

it’s only gotten worst lately, i have a dance comp coming up and i have these “moments” often, i’m worried i will fail and just be hazy.

what should i do about all of this? what is wrong with me? why?",14Aug2020,1

164,"So first let me be honest, I’ve never made a reddit post before. So bear with me.

I’ve always been considered the “weird” kid. Not weird because of the things I’m into or activities I’m involved it...  just weird. My personality itself is not necessarily weird; overall I’m just very sarcastic and people usually think I’m really funny. But I just... do strange things.

I have so many memories of all the weird things I’ve done and honestly it rules my mind. It’s so much negativity that is just brings me down. And I need to know if people can relate... and if there’s anything I can do about it. Or if I’m overthinking it(which I doubt)?

I don’t know if it’s nervousness that triggers it or what, but it’s like social cues go out the window for me sometimes and I’ve said and done things that no one in their right mind would ever think of.

Like for example, my aunt and uncle asked me how my mother was doing since moving to another state and I told them how much she made a year. And that was awkward. Why tf did I say that ? 

Another time I feel like I could slam my head into a wall for was when I had a public speaking class, and I was discussing serving and tipping. Now in my head I had this visual of a chart that I did not print out at the time expressing the categories of people who “tip most” and it was insanely stereotypical. And when an Asian kid in my class asked me who tips the best I really said WITH CONFIDENCE “white families”. And then kept going on like I couldn’t stop. Now for anyone questioning that I’ve been in multiple interracial relationships and I have interracial family. I just GENUINELY did not register at all that it was fucked up.

I can’t describe other situations as anything but misuse of social cues. When I was a kid and did basketball I would just freeze up in my last year. I wouldn’t do anything. I remember one time someone passed me a basketball during a game and I crouched down and tried to bounce it really low and try to get it to bounce higher, like get it to raise on its own instead of picking up the ball. And we ended up losing our turn. If you can imagine anything more cringe than that you’re not picturing it right.

The other thing I do is freeze up, my whole mind will just go blank and it’s like I can’t even generate a thought. This has happened to me in classrooms, when I’m training for jobs. Idek

I have SO MANY MORE just awkward stories like that that I kick myself for. And it’s things like this that consume my thoughts. Does anyone else experience that ?

Now on top of all this, it gets better guys. People have consistently kicked me out of their lives and I never know why. I’m someone people just don’t want to be around. When I was in 4th grade the girls in my class that I sat with (we had 2 assigned tables the class could sit at) wanted me gone so bad that one of the lunchroom supervisors came over and told me I needed to sit somewhere else. When I was in middle school my best friend from elementary school completely stopped talking to me(she was very pretty and popular and I think just registered that I was a fucking loser). She was also my neighbor by the way. When I was a freshman in high school I sat at a table with some “friends” until they told me they didn’t want me to sit with them anymore. I’ve had MULTIPLE friends decide they do not want to be my friend anymore and had even told me it to my face. A couple of them being best friends of mine. One I was very close with for years and she told me she did not want to be my friend anymore. Another girl removed me from everything and just started ignoring me(also a best friend), in college I moved in with 2 good friends of mine. Out of no where the one decided she did not want to hang out with me anymore and the other one followed. Does anyone else relate to this?? What is wrong with me??

I just wish I was normal. I wish I knew how to act like a normal person.",14Aug2020,1
165,"I will say that I have dealt with divorce before.  My parents got divorced right when I was about to go into high school.  That time it sucked for sure, but I felt like I could still talk to each of them normally, and both parents gave me an explanation and I did the every other weekend at dad's deal.

My mom has been re-married for about 11 years now, but beginning in December thing between her and my stepdad started getting very rocky.  He has always had a masssive anger issue.  Most of the time he is fine, but it seemed any time my mom would ask him to just help out around the house (she would do everything around the house in terms of cleaning and upkeep) he would just explode and start saying things like ""YOU \*\*\*\*ING BITCH!!  \*\*\*\* YOU!"" Just stuff like that at the top of his lungs.  My mom would start balling her eyes out, but after a couple days everything would be back to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, one thing my mom has always tried to get my step dad to do is downsize his massive toy car collection.  He has thousands upon thousands.  They took over their entire house and my mom could not keep up with the cleaning and all the house chores and the most my step dad would do is sometimes he would fold a basket of clothes or put some dishes away.  most fo the time he would watch tv all evening and night and smoke weed.

Well my mom decided to sell the house and got a smaller house that she could keep up with.  My step dad was supposed to sell a bunch of his stuff before the move but he kept dragging his feet and so he never did and brought it all to the their new house and quickly took over the entire place.  My mom brought this up to him one night in December and this time he got so angry she told me he started choking her as hard as he could and then raised his fist to beat her but stopped himself before he actually did it.

My mom demanded he get anger management and he agreed and I thought everything would be resolved, but apparently he skipped most of the sessions and when he did go apparently he just wouldn't listen to the counselor and didn't think he had any sort of problem.  Last time I spoke to the guy was in April and later that month my mom told me she was pursuing divorce and that he was now just leaving the house every day and coming back in late evening just to sleep.

Well fast forward to today and I had to go over there to help my mom with something.  I get done and he comes in and goes straight downstairs.  My anxiety skyrocketed cause I didn't know what I should do.  I was never close with the guy but I never hated him either.  I just stood there frozen not knowing if I should go downstairs and say hi like nothing happened, or what.  in the end I tip toed out the front door without saying anything cause I was not sure how he would react and I really did not know what to say.  I feel really bad about it.

166,"I have best friend for 4 years now, recently the past year or so hes been opning up more and more on how many chores he does, how stressed he is about school and how its just to much for him sometimes
 Always adding the compliment that im there at the end of the day for him. Recently its.. been getting worse. Ive been hearing how they just give him two options a day. Either play games or play with the dogs just one. Either wake up and relax or wake up and shower. Not both. Either watch a movie or just talk. Not both. Tbh.. in my family idk. We dont do things like that, we dont have that options but i dont think its normal either and hes been really stressed with getting more chores and being yelled at more and more by his parents. Hes tried talking with them and sometimes it works but then it goes to normal. Recently theyve had a new rule in place that he can only talk with me for only a certain amount of hours. Hes been telling me how miserable he feels and how much its making him worse. I keep telling him to talk to them and he has. A few days ago he was telling his mum that it made him want to kill himself and she listened, they talked, then today it got back to normal of him having a time limit, them talking. I waited an hour and a half and when he came back he said he was crying and that he got yelled at, his dad stormed out calling him complicated and then his mum complained he was rude, disrespectful and just making things harder.

But i KNOW my fucking best friend. He has never ever sworn infront of me or anyone cause he doesnt like it. He is the politest and nicest person i have ever met they are lucky to have him as their son because he always stuff even i wouldnt bother. Hell ive never seen him get angry at stuff or anyone! He just gets sad and blames himself if something bad happens.

He keeps telling me hes overreacting and that hes sensitive for crying but its fucking normal because his parents are suffocating him. I finally told him today that this isnt normal and i dont think its healthy.  But i dont know what i can do. I live in the uk and he lives in america. Im only 15 and hes 18+ (yes his parents still put phone rules at that, idk for me i have a view of hes an adult why does he have that rule but idk..)
All i can do is just be here to talk to him but i really feel like i need to do more. I know hes got therapy and i know his parents are just trying to do their best but their not fucking going about it properly

177,"(Content warning: bullying, mental illness, suicide, concussion)

To anyone reading this, a warm hello. This is going to get a bit long, so I thank you in advance for being willing to stick through it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am writing out of a place of pure desperation and anguish. I am in great need of advice and helpful perspectives regarding my situation as explained below. Your time is invaluable to me and I am forever grateful for even a single lent hand.

I am currently a 20 year old student attending a public state school in California, after entering in the fall of 2017 upon my graduation from high school. High school, recognizably so by many of you, was a period of chaos and suffering. But I had been carrying a certain weight on my shoulders since my early childhood that essentially destroyed any sense of self and belonging that I may have possessed. 

The bad parts.

As a child, I attended a small unaccredited private school for a specific religious sect, emphasizing religious principles over everything else in its curriculum. Unfortunately, I was relentlessly bullied and targeted by students and staff alike because of symptoms of ADD and dyslexia that I exhibited, as well as my shyness and antisocial nature. I developed PTSD after getting kicked in the head multiple times by one classmate and receiving death threats from another. I hadn't been formally diagnosed with the aforementioned disorders until last year, as my parents didn't believe in the existence of such conditions, attributing them to the workings of the devil and a deep lack of faith. It's also worth mentioning that they are immigrants from a third world country, so they didn't have much exposure to these kinds of topics growing up. As a result, I was ill-equipped with the necessary social and academic skills to do well in middle school and beyond. I almost dropped out of school after my first suicide attempt in the seventh grade, and I stopped attending classes altogether after my second attempt in the tenth grade.

My parents finally intervened as an attempt to salvage any remaining potential I had for a successful future. I was placed in a psych ward for a little while, fully returning to a school setting by the 11th grade. Most of you are familiar with this moment in one's academic career as the time to take standardized tests and start applying to colleges. I found myself hopelessly scrambling around with requirements and whatnot because my parents were not at all familiar with the system, and my school's college counseling services were virtually nonexistent. I got rejected by most universities that I applied to, but I was able to secure a spot at an affordable, half-decent state school that was nearby enough so that I could still receive psychiatric treatment on the side. Fast-forwarding to mid-freshman year, I develop a concussion after tripping and hitting my head against a metal pole. I start to lose my memory and I develop tinnitus that is still present to this day. I can't attend class or apply myself anymore. As a result, I barely pass one of my classes with a D. I am in 10th grade again. Every semester forward I find myself enrolling in classes and withdrawing 5 weeks in because the pain becomes unbearable to the point of physical collapse. My psychiatrist urges me to take a leave of absence, but I do not concede, thinking that I will make it better myself. I end up adding more and more withdrawals to my transcripts. I start to take two classes per semester thinking that it will keep me on my feet while I recover. I perform well, but I am left with a lingering sense of emptiness and squandering.

The good parts, and a cry for help.

Throughout this long-winded post, I actually haven't revealed a single bit about who I am as an individual. Since childhood, I harbored an intense passion for reading, chemistry, and biology. I cried day and night at the ward to be able to study those subjects again. After returning to school in the 11th grade with a newfound motivation, I entered a research program and was given the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to participate in an international biology competition for undergraduates, where my teammates and I secured a 1st place title despite being high schoolers! It was the first time in my entire life that I truly experienced a sliver of joy, and that was the first time I actually envisioned a future for myself in a research-intensive field. I was fortunate enough to have parents that were willing to cover all university expenses, so I decided to fully dedicate myself to my studies. I knew that I ultimately wanted to attend grad school, but after a rocky start I was rendered unsure and even deemed myself unfit. Hell, the only thing I'd known up until that point was rocky starts, which lead me to question my worth and belonging in a field pursued by the topmost achievers.

I have since fully recovered from my concussion and I am in a much better place physically, mentally, and emotionally. My passions are returning, stronger than they have ever been, and I feel prepared to take on the multitudinous academic challenges that await me. I want to start anew, as I haven't really been making progress toward any degree in particular. The problem is that I don't know where to go or who to ask for help. I want to attend a new university because the one that I'm at is quite miserable. Professors are disillusioned, classmates are unmotivated, and there is a distinct lack of school spirit. I am willing to do whatever it takes to have a fresh start, because I feel that my records (constant withdrawing) and my past are not at all indicative of my character and my potential. I have a pretty good GPA despite everything, but even if it were subpar it would not be the reason behind wanting the change. I don't want to simply apply as a transfer student-- I want to be re-matriculated as a freshman even if that takes nullifying all units that I have accumulated thus far.

Has anybody else been in a similar situation? I would appreciate ANY bit of information or advice. Would it be possible for me to drop out, attend a community college, make the grades to prove my worth, then apply to 4-year universities?

Thank you so much. You're doing a great thing here helping a stranger on the Internet navigate her life.",14Aug2020,1
178,"My life has been a mess for as long as I've been alive, but this'll be long enough as it is so I'll start when I was 12, I was a somewhat smart 6th grader so I always had free time to do whatever I wanted while the class was finishing whatever they were currently working on, I listened to a lot of 90's rap and I thought I could make a few songs, I wrote like 3 or 5 throughout the rest of the year, i never thought it would go anywhere but it was fun and I had nothing better to do.

7th and 8th grade were ok, at that point in my life school was my happy place away from home, my parents were divorced and I'd go to my dad's place on the weekends, they'd use me as the messenger so they could argue with each other without texting, my mom's husband, who to this day i still don't consider my step dad, would yell at me for no reason and I just hated life, nothing was enjoyable for those 2 years.

High school started and life started getting good again, I stopped seeing my dad, the only connection we had was that he paid for my phone that I got a month before 8th grade ended, I was in a class called latinos in action and l was more patriotic because of it, life finally felt good, i was happy for the first time in a long time, i met a girl in my lia class, we became good friends, after a while I asked her out, she told me her parents wanted her to be 16, so I decided to wait, on valentines day that year I got her a giant cupcake with a plastic rose on it, she told me she loved roses, i made sure to remember that.

That same year I got back into my music, I synced up my phone and saw my old songs, i read them and they were really good, i realized I had a chance at making rapping my career, I went for it, over the course of that year I made like 20 songs, around the same time I found out a few people somehow stole my music, i put weeks of my life into figuring out how they stole my stuff, I never shared entire songs, only a screenshot to snap and insta, the only thing that I could come up with is that they hacked my phone, way back from when I was 12, because a few songs I wrote back in 2016 were stolen and posted in 2017, I still don't know, but thats my best answer.

I had my phone taken away 2 weeks before 9th grade ended for reasons I don't wanna get into because of how long this already is, I had it taken away for 9 months, I only got the phone im using now back in February because I got a job and I was paying for it, I missed 1 of my 4 high school summer breaks, I missed out on hanging out with friends, I missed out on all the memories I could've made just because my mom took my phone.

Sophomore year was decent, I was back in my lia class and although I didn't have a phone at the time, life was somewhat good again, I was talking to all my friends again, getting closer to her, when I got a phone again I went right back to my music, i wanted to buy recording equipment but I was stupid with my money and didn't save, I found out that she started dating someone that lives 2 states away over summer, that hurt me slightly because she was still 15, but I talked myself into believing that it was because her parents didn't know, on valentines day that year I remembered that she told me she loved roses, so I got her a bracelet with 12 roses, around the same time I found out she was single, so I took my chance, prom was around the corner so I decided to ask her, over the past year or so i became an amazing chef, im going to be on guys grocery games when the world opens up again, so I decided to make a cake, icing and everything, from scratch with fondant spelling ""prom?"" It was a Sunday when I decided to ask her so I texted her asking when she would be at church, she said 12:30, so I went to her house at 11:30, she said she was already at church so I left it at her door and went to work, when I was there she texted me saying that she was having a bad week and that made her day but she already had plans, that hurt but it is what it is.

A few weeks after that our class went on a college tour, on the bus ride she was talking about prom, i couldn't hear her but someone yelled out ""wait, i thought (my name) asked you to prom"" so that let me know that she told people, but with that guy asking, everyone in the class knew, besides that the rest of that day was terrible, the tour was nice, while I was walking home with a friend he asked if I saw her story, I said no, he showed me that some kid asked her to prom and she said yes, she blocked me from seeing her story so I wouldn't know, she didn't have plans, she just didn't wanna go with me, I cared enough over 2 years to do everything I did, and she didn't even care enough to be honest, im only 16 but I mean this, i loved her, i wanted to marry her and spend the rest of my life with her, I thought about what I wanted to name our kids for fucks sake, i loved her, and she didn't even care enough to be honest,she still has the pan because I didn't wanna ruin the cake to take it out, im a better cook than baker, i don't wanna talk to her just to ask for it back, I went to work that night and I got fired for something that wasn't my fault, I've been looking for a job but because of the pandemic I haven't gotten anything.

And here's where I am now, just a 16 year old trying to get my life together, I don't know what to do, and I don't think I ever will, I just want my music to take off but with it being stolen I doubt it, and i need to do like 22 packets if i wanna graduate.",14Aug2020,1

He never had anyone since me. I had someone serious but never stopped loving him.

How do you get someone out of your head when it felt so special and so precious? And that it never really got its chance due to bad life circumstances? How do you stop loving someone when you are both single and both got your lives sorted and stop thinking that the timing would now be perfect?

188,"Should I tell my (F22) boyfriend M(30) about my abuser?

TW: sexual abuse , csa 


This is a long one... 
I was molested by my cousin (let’s call him Jack, M27) on my dad’s side from the age of about 8 to 12. So he started doing this to me when he was 12 and he stopped when he was about 17. I didn’t realize it was wrong until I started hitting 12 and getting aggravated when he’d try so he’d stop.The crazy thing, he admitted what he did to me to my mom. I guess he had a guilty conscious and confessed to what he had been doing. She told my dad who scolded me. Idk if he told them how long or what he’d do but I’m sure he just told them enough because my mom took me to the OBGYN to make sure I was good. All I really remember was the doctors asking if we actually had sex bc in being so young it could mess w/ me having children in the future. We didn’t. After that? Everything went back to “normal”.  No one talked about it, the trip to the doctor, nothing. Almost as if it never happened. Being young once again I just went with the flow. I thought it was something we never talked about. Now, 10 years passed and I still talk to that same cousin. I’d bury what he did to me deep in the back of my mind and act like nothing happened , that was my normal. I’m 22 now and I cant hold them back in anymore. It haunts me. I was so young, I didnt know any better. My parents? Why didn’t they do more? Im disgusted with myself. I still see Jack now and then at family functions &amp; we talk casually. He’d hug me when it’s time to go &amp; id get awkward. Try to dodge them smoothly, but other than that you’d think we were normal cousins. This don’t even take the cake. Get this. I’m a gamer &amp; play w my other cousin on my mom’s side (let’s call him Phil) who’s 6mo older than me and like a brother to me. He knows Jack through family parties &amp; met him around 8yo, he’s turning 23. Through playing games and hanging out, I’ve met Phil’s rl friends and we’ve both made mutual friends through gaming. Guess who also know them through gaming w us and hanging out? Jack. He plays online with us too. I also went to the same school w Jack meaning it was a Middle School and High School, so I met his friends who all also know my mom bc we’d have parties  and they’d come. I know it’s a bit confusing but I’m just letting you understand through 10 years, Jack and I live life like normal family do &amp; have many many mutual ties. Through family on both sides, to friends online and off. Now this comes into relationship advice bc I’m dating my bf who’s amazing to me and I want to spend my life with and he’s speaking on us moving in together.He met Phil and Phil has asked me when am I going to introduce my bf to Jack. Jack even asks me when he’s going to meet him and acts as if he’ll do the big brother rough him up bit. I get silent every single time. My boyfriend cannot meet my molester. That’s sick. I want to tell him so bad about that part of me but I feel like he’d snap or not want to be around my family(which would be reasonable). He’d want to do something and if he sees Phil- who hangs out with &amp; respects Jack-he may tell him and that will start a domino effect of “Did you know?” Trust me I want to tell my bf and Phil so bad. But so many people are attached to this and they don’t even know it. In building our future I dont think it’s fair to hide what Jack has done and who he is bc if I have a baby w my bf, I know he wouldn’t want him around our child. He won’t want him in our home. He wouldn’t want me in contact with him. Which is ALL fair. It’s just that it would throw so many ppl off and to explain why will throw them off even more. Sometimes I wish I could just disappear.

197,"Okay. So basically, my friends made a groupchat without me, which happens all the time in teenage friendships. However, this is more complicated than just that. 
This somehow never occurred to me until now, but all of my friends are brown, so I’m the only white person in the friend group. They have several hardships that I’ve never had to deal with because of this. I’m assuming this is why they made the groupchat in the first place, which I wasn’t even supposed to know about.
I don’t mind that they’ve made a groupchat specifically to talk about these issues that I don’t deal with, I think they do deserve to have a place to vent/rant/discuss with other people that have gone through similar things as them. It’s just that because everyone but me is in there, I worry that they’ll just using that as the main one, leaving me behind. I also don’t know if I should start seeking out specifically white people to befriend in case of situations like this? But that feels wrong. I don’t want to befriend people because of their color. 
They have talked about issues regarding racism in the groupchats I’m in however, so I don’t think their uncomfortable speaking about it around me. Usually I just let them rant, but occasionally it does come to the discussion that one of my parents is brown as well. My parent, as well as a lot of my friends, is biracial. So I have seen it firsthand and the effects of it even though it’s never happened to me specifically. 
I just don’t know what I should do. Do I confront them about this and how it makes me slightly uncomfortable? Should I start looking for specifically white people? Do I just stay silent?

An old employer offered me a position as their assistant bookkeeper and really wants me back because of my work ethic. They are confident that I can learn, but honestly, I’m not too interested in the field of work. But they offer health benefits, would price match my position (if not give me more), and I know that they are a stable business. 

When they called to offer me the position today, they asked if I could see myself doing something like this and if I feel comfortable with math.

208,"Hi! First time post!

I’ve been having a really hard time moving on from this situation.

So my new neighbors moved in at the beginning of the year &amp; I’ve been irritated by what they do &amp; how they act.

They even had a rent check ‘stolen’ one month and were upset the landlord didn’t let that slide...

Anyway

I don’t live in the fanciest part of town, but it’s a quiet neighborhood. They also have a friend who comes over and wears this shirt that says ‘Fuck This I’m Out’ in big letters every time, and that really urks me for some reason. They’re loud and always rev motorcycles after they do some trading for other motorcycles. 

When they first moved in, they asked if they could split the Internet bill, and I said sure. First month, they paid. Second month, they didn’t. And had every excuse under the sun as to why they couldn’t pay. 

They then offered me a motorcycle for exchange for the internet and I said ok. They never gave me a title after asking over the weeks. Then one day it was gone &amp; they said they sold it.

After that, they agreed to mow the lawn in exchange for the Internet &amp; I was totally on board with that since I have a hernia and carpel tunnel developing. 

Fast forward a few months &amp; they have completely neglected the yard. He would have his brother come out and do it, but he would do a terrible job &amp; only mow half the front yard and sometimes the back.

After three weeks of it not getting cut, I asked if he’d be cool if we split the bill on a service coming out. He said ok. I paid $55 to have a lawn care service come out. Long story short, he gave me $5 after bugging him several times. ‘Oh I haven’t had time to go to the ATM’ this &amp; that.

After confronting him about going half on a lawn care service a few weeks later, he proceeded to tell me that I never once offered his brother gas money to come up and do the yard. And how I haven’t mowed it at all this summer (even though I did have a service come out &amp; we had an agreement) I was so angry. So I cut off the WiFi entirely.

His mom came over, complimented my hat &amp; started asking for envelopes &amp; I said I didn’t have any. She then asked for the WiFi password &amp; I explained that he still hasn’t paid me the half of when the lawn care service came out. She told me that they’d get me next week, like they always do, so I said, ‘Get your own internet’ &amp; shut the door.

I escalated this to my landlord &amp; my neighbor kept flooding the group chat with how I wasn’t compensating them for gas or whatever. At that point, I said fine, I’ll just take care of it for the rest of the year, despite an agreement between us that was broken. The landlord was also aware of the agreement. 

I took a few days to chill out &amp; messaged him asking if there is some sort of way to create a win win situation, like me paying to have half the lawn mowed and he mow it once. Zero response.

I am trying to let it go. I even mowed the entire yard to my liking. But I feel so angry. I feel like now I am going to be stuck mowing it or paying a service since I started some drama. I feel like the lawn should look good since all the other ones in the neighborhood look nice.

I also feel like I was taken advantage of &amp; that I am the one who looks bad. I’ve been thinking of moving because of this.

I feel so much anger towards them. I don’t even want to look at their faces. I wear headphones anytime I go out of the house, and always play music so I don’t have to hear their footsteps. 

Part of me feels like I am being judgmental, but part of me also feels like I shouldn’t feel bad about that considering how loose their word has been &amp; how they have broken their promises several times. 

What would be a good way to let go of this? I don’t want a war, I just want to be a little comfortable.",14Aug2020,1

212,"I'm a 23-year-old stand-up comedian and a writer/editor. I got an English undergraduate degree and had originally planned on becoming an English teacher. I started graduate school for it, but it was clear that my passion was comedy/writing/editing, and I also wouldn't have made a good teacher which isn't fair to the students, so I dropped out early in the semester with no financial consequences. To clarify: it is not my dream to become a famous stand-up comedian. I write books, co-founded a satire site, and I hope to get my manuscript(s) published someday.

I currently live at home, am on my mom's health insurance, and I am currently enrolled in a masters program for Library and Information Science which starts in a few weeks. I'm dreading it, because in my core, I AM a writer, and I feel like that's what I should be doing. But I'm also a Diabetic with other health issues so I need a stable job with health insurance. I can't take any risks, and there's not really any jobs in writing. I've had a few editing gigs, but they're not hard to come across, even with experience. As for my career, I can see myself working for a government agency library, while my practical ""dream"" job would be as a private investigator for an organization.

Point is, I'm having trouble accepting the reality that I need to work hard in grad school and just to have health insurance someday. A lot of my artist friends are rich and don't have to worry about that. It's priviledged of me to even be thinking about it, I know. But the first time that I dropped out to work on myself and pursue comedy for a year (which was going well pre-pandemic) I felt so free and happy for following my heart. I hate the reality that I need to work at a job that I hate. I need someone to kick me in the ass and remind me of how miserable the alternative is, I guess. How can I accept this and put my head down and work hard despite it not fully being what I want?",14Aug2020,1
213,"I need some advice here. I (19) don’t have a job right now due to a busy schedule, my summer job ending, and me just now getting access to a car that works.  My mom (mid 50s)wont treat me like an adult at all. Though my room is messy (she does have a right to complain about that I’ll admit) it’s almost like she’s trying to manage aspects of my life and refuses to give me control of them. I haven’t been able to do what I want to my own hair. She insists that natural is “nappy” (we’re black) and though I have tried to protest braids, she always forces them on me- to the point that I thought of cutting my hair short a few years ago so she couldn’t touch it. She’s constantly screamed “you need a job” without me even having a way to a job consistently until a month ago, and couldn’t take me herself. She’s complained about me not cooking, and yet every single time I make something, without fail, the first thing that comes out of her mouth is that something is wrong, or that she “wishes I would have done x.” If I were to respond to her in the same way, she’d yell, ignore me like I didn’t exist for a couple days, and probably tell the whole family. She’s constantly expecting me to help her with something even though when I need help she just looks at me. The only time she’s ever really happy or even proud of me is when I’ve made an achievement of Some kind. Something makes her mad and she rants to me almost in a way that projects onto me as if I was apart of it somehow (1/2 the time it’s about a situation where I wasn’t born). I get her childhood sucked and all but still. Don’t get me wrong, she takes me on vacation, I have more than I need, she gets me gifts- but I feel like she’s never even made the effort to even connect with me.

222,"I (31 NB) have been having a very difficult time with my husband (31 M) of ten years.  We are in a poly relationship with another guy (28 M) for about a year now.  We all just moved in together a couple weeks ago.

Basically it boils down to the fact that my husband is very lazy and very irritable.  He has always been dealing with anxiety and depression (as have I), but lately (last couple of years) he just seems completely unmotivated to participate in any life activities to the point of not getting out of bed at all.  When he is awake he's irritable as fuck and snaps at me and our bf all the time, flying off the handle without warning.

This has been something we tried to work through for years and it has only gotten worse.  Therapy, anti-depressants, it all just doesn't seem to work.  

The problem is that he's 100% dependent on me and has no safety net to fall back on.  I make good money and pay all the bills so he doesn't have to stress.  If I divorced him he would be penniless living with his mom.  

I've never been through this before.  I feel the overwhelming urge to kick him to the curb because I'm not happy with him anymore, but the guilt of abandoning him is so strong.  What do I do?  How do I reconcile these issues?",14Aug2020,1

228,"Standard tinder match about a month ago now, turned into a 2 week «fling» where we hung out at her place and basically acted like a couple for 12 days. Making dinner, learning about eachother, amazing sex, meaningful talks. 

This was from both our sides meant to be a short term thing, I was moving away on a permanent basis, and made this abundantly clear before we met. We seperated amicably and recognized what a blast we had.

It has been 2 weeks since then, and the problem is we still talk. A lot. About our problems, family and so forth. I am catching feelings, and it is killing me. Because It is not feasable to be in a position to try and date her potentially until a year from today, and that means realistically me and her being seperate people for so long as well. And the thought of her being with somebody else is keeping me up at nights and waking me early.

It is a pit in my stomach, a sick jealousy I am very familliar with. It helps writing it out here. Thankfully. 

The saying «you cant be friends with a female» resonates. You can even say I am a total simp. I wish to stay friends with her, but it is foolish of me for my sub conciousness to give me a pit in my stomach, because it wishes, I wish she wouldnt be with anybody else. Because that it how jealousy operates. It isnt always rational when it comes to whats what. And whats what, we are never going to be together, but I do have feelings for her.

I'm Hispanic and going to college was something that was just assumed was going to happen and I will admit I am lucky that my parents are able to pay for me to go but the fact that I don't know what I want to do feels like I am wasting their money entirely.

234,"Ever since that gigantic ass storm happened on Monday there's been no power. My friends in the next town over have power, and places near me I go have power. But my town is too insignificant to be a priority.

My tablet, old phone, and Nintendo DS have died. I keep my phone charged by charging it in the car and using it as little as I can. I don't have any nearby friends, the only way I can connect with anyone is online, which has been a little rough.

I've tried my non-digital hobbies, but it's difficult to draw when it's so unbearably hot. I've moved to the basement to cool down, and it's still not that better. It's so hot; I'm sweating and feel dizzy all of the time. I'm fat so that doesn't help with any of this.

Most of the food in the fridge and freezer have gone bad, and since there's no oven I can't make anything new. I've been eating lunchables/Doritos/unhealthy food ever since this started. I've been eating like shit and feel like shit.

Normally, due to anxiety, I go through periods of time where I sleep fine for weeks and then have sleep problems for around 4-7 days, and that starts with one sleepless night, which happened two nights ago.

241,"Our relationship was pretty rocky leading up to the break up but immediately before, I really thought we had figured things out and it was looking up from there. I had finally seen her for the first time after 4+ months of not seeing her due to quarantine for her birthday and had gotten her flowers and gifts. We both seemed happy but a couple days later (a day after my birthday) she texts me saying that she needs to take a break in order to self reflect and really think about us so I sadly, but willingly accepted but was caught off guard because I thought I was doing a better job at being a good boyfriend.

A week later she texts me the simple words of ""We're done"" and just like that I was single. No explanation. No chance to actually respond or ask why. Just a ""we're done"" and I was left wondering what I did wrong leading up to it. Regretfully, the previous 4 months our relationship was rocky and I was struggling to manage my time and give her enough love and attention she deserved but after looking back at our old conversations and really trying to understand what could have gone wrong, I personally still don't fully understand why she broke up with me the way she did especially after I thought things were looking up...

After no communication for about week after that text and doing various things to try and dsitract myself, I see that she was streaming on Twitch again (we both were streamers and is a major factor in our relationship's struggle but that's another story) and my stupid self decided to tune in anonymously because the title of her stream said ""I'M IN SUCH A GREAT MOOD"" Once I started watching, I instantly felt my heart sink to my stomach because she breifly announced to her viewers that her and I had broken up but immediately followed it up with her announcing that she has been talking to this new guy at her work and let me tell you, I have never seen her any happier talking about this guy than when she was even with me...she looked so happy and her smile was so genuine. I'd never seen her smile like that in maybe a year.

That obviously broke my heart to see and I spiraled into a deep depressive state and cried for hours. I tried talking to my friend about it and he helped me a little bit but just today I tried texting her asking if I could have some closure on our break up so I myself could at least try to move on since it seemed like she already had. To which she responded with,

""I have my closure. You don't care about me and haven't for a while. If you want to talk later fine but I don't feel like I owe you a reason.""

And that obviously dug the knife deeper into me. We never ended up talking about it and now I'm just left here wondering why... I'm not questioning the motivations behind the break up. I know I was a bad boyfriend for quite a while in her eyes, but what I don't understand is why after I thought it was getting better that she willingly just dumped me over text just like that and got over me so quickly and moved on.

I'm not asking for pity. I just want advice on how the hell I can even begin to try moving on from her. I really thought she was the one...but I know I'm a fuck up. I just need help moving on..",14Aug2020,1

245,"I was in an on and off relationship with this guy for almost 4yrs.....It always ends on bad terms. I felt that he has never put in much effort..he would go days without texting me and claim that it was just something that he would do and never really paid any attention to it...while at the same time he would have very close relationships with other female and would talk to them daily..when they were having a bad day he was there...pick them up.. to take them to a quiet place, feed them and talk to them...never once have I gotten any of that from him...

.when I would mention it he would say that it was hard to talk to me...that he never knew what to talk about....even when I would start the conversation and suggest topics he would never give it effort ..how is it hard to talk to your gf when most of those females he would comfort he barely knew. them on Facebook or campus and start convos with them then bam they were best friends..like what the fuck

&amp;#x200B;

After a while, I got sick of it and just blocked off all contact because I was sick of him giving me the bare minimum and give stranger everything he had to offer..He would contact me through family members..... asking to talk but the time I would talk to him..... I was only met with more excuses as to why he was like the way he was...He would go on and start other relationships with other girl and I would be pissed for a time then it would go away...

&amp;#x200B;

But in those relationships, he would give these girls everything...he talked to them, took them out, bought them things and would even through disses out to me for no reason.  None of those relationships ended well either. He would get cheated on and I admit it made me a little happy...  Know that I'm in college and have decided to start dating ..he's been contacting me asking me to be friends...why?.... I never got anything out of the relation, not his time or effort...

Plus he only contacts me when his relationships go wrong mostly because they cheated on him...the last time we talked I cut it off because he would search his ex-girlfriend's page 20xs a date...

I felt like he was using me a way to not be along..like I'm not worthy of getting his full attention or something

 Like I'm keeping someone else spot warm until finds that one person he's looking for.....He got a new phone and changed his number so I decided to contact me because I blocked his old one....he keeps asking to be friends with me.

I run the skateboarding club on my campus and have grown it exponentially since i began running it. This officer has threatened me on numerous occasions and flat of lies about what he's allowed to do i even caught him turning his body cam off and trying provoke physical confrontations with me.

7 months back i was skating around campus it was the end of the month and this same officer followed me then stopped me i asked him why he stated u was committing criminal mischief which i clearly wasnt so i told him id stay at the scene and allow him to investigate what exactly i had damaged.

When I did that he called for back up and stated i was behaving disorderly when his partner came he began behaving in a similar manner threatening me and threatening to arrest me for not IDing myself. Ive never had police officers behave that way especially campus officers i began having a panic attack and told him i would ID myself and he simply responded ""too late"" and arrested me anyways.

They then began handcuffing me and i wasnt resisting in anyway whatsoever the officer who was the one who originally stopped me then took his pepper spray out and shoved it in my face solely to scare and intimidate me i asked him why he was doing this and that im not resisting. Then he started telling me all these orders which i couldnt understand so he then talked to me like i was an idiot and that if i didnt obey him he'd ""smash my face into the pavement""

I had to drop out of school after that due to all the legal fees i needed to pay in order to get my charges dropped as well as go to therapy as i relive that interaction everyday since it happened.

How do i deal with the PTSD?

P.s. i already filed a complaint with the university and the officer got reprimanded for his behavior. After i filed the complant i requested the body cam footage of the other officer in order to prove to the university what this officer did and when i got it the video cuts off immediately after the officers start handcuffing me other other officer left his body cam off the entire time which i already knew before even requesting the footage.

252,"I'm a 20 y/o college student who has terrible handwriting and no idea how to fix it. 

For one, I'm pretty sure I hold my pencil terribly wrong (I press my hitch hikers thumb into it very hard when holding my pencil). People say there isn't necessarily a wrong way to hold a pencil but I get physical pain fairly quickly after writing a few pages and I cannot draw a straight line. I have a gigantic callus on the side of my thumb and besides that I think after years of holding my pencil wrong my thumb has been kind of warped as it has much less range of motion than my other thumb. 

I know handwriting is very important and I try to improve it but I never get anywhere. If I try to use less force when writing my handwriting becomes significantly more messy. I also have difficulty holding a pencil in other ways as my thumb is so screwed up.

Any advice on fixing this? I really want to improve.",14Aug2020,1

256,"i'm Male, almost 24, and i feel just like a shell, I have moved location multiple times since i left home at 18, i dont have any university degrees, i've lost all my passion for my hobbies i used to have, and any spark i do get, dims within a week. I have a job, but hours have been cut because of the pandemic, so im finding myself with more time at home, and frankly, it's making me feel worse and worse. I work out 5 times a week, but the good feeling after the workout fades fast.

How did any of you guys that have been through a hard time manage to get out of it? i want to bring that spark back into my life, the spring in my step, I used to be extroverted and loved meeting and talking to people, I had passions, i actually felt emotions. but as i've gotten older i have become more, essentially monotone with my voice and life in general. I'm not depressed, just lost at the moment.

How did you guys find direction? I want to go to University/College, but how do I pick a subject when i have no feelings for any?

257,"Just got hired to a new job a couple weeks ago. The other day I went into work and this other guy that works there asked me where I went to high school. He said he recognized me. I asked him if he played any sports, as I used to wrestle and my brother played football. He said he was on the football team but never got along with most of them. I'd figured he knew me through my brother, and that was that. He later on (like an hour or so later) ran into me again and told me that actually, his middle school girlfriend was my high school girlfriend. I didn't know what to say to this which I assume made me visibly uncomfortable since he then apologized for ""bringing up bad blood"" because he somehow ""knew it ended poorly""

I kinda chuckled and said I thought it ended great, and I haven't spoken to her since then. He apparently has and he said he occasionally still does talk to her. 

The conversation ended there. I didn't think much of then, but now that I think about it I realize the problem. After we had broken up, she had told our mutual friends that I was abusive and manipulative which caused them all to stop talking to me. I had figured that at the time she was just trying to scramble together as much support as she could to try and get back at me or keep them as friends without me or something along those lines. But now that I know she's been talking about me with people I didn't even know it makes me worry about how she's ruining my reputation. 

I thought about reaching out to her again but she has me blocked on every social media and I no longer have her number. The only form of contact I might have is this guy at work but even then I don't want him involved in my personal life to begin with. 

Any advice or tips on what I should do? Is there anything I can do?",14Aug2020,1
258,"Hello reddit! Long time lurker, first time poster. On mobile and all that, so my apologies. 

Here is my situation. I’m a rising senior, with a 4.7 + gpa. I’m enrolled in International Bachelorette classes (IB) and have been doing exceptionally well, my grades are usually 95+, with the exception of math, which I’ve struggled with since I taught myself pre algebra and algebra. I received and 82 in that class. After finishing my courses online due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, my parents *highly* encouraged me to get a job. I signed on to work at a furniture store, working in warehousing and delivery/installation 65+ hours a week. I did this for about a month before the long hours got to be too much, as it was putting a stain on my relationships. I recently started a new restaurant kitchen job. So here’s the problem.

I’ve been heavily involved in the swim team for four years, if I participate in this season five, and should become captain if I do. (Started a year early in middle school). Due to scheduling requirements I have to be available to open or close at the restaurant four days a week. Now, if I go to school, I can also work, but if I work, I cannot swim as the times overlap. I could also go to physical school, and swim, but I’d have to give up my job. The only way to both swim and work is to give up my IB classes (and thus scholarships) and do online school, which unfortunately doesn’t offer IB classes, but it does offer AP classes. 

My parents are offering no advice, and I don’t know what to do. I’m not sure if I want to pursue a degree, but if I do, I think it will probably be in nursing or education. Feel free to ask questions here if it helps. Obviously academics are important, but so is the responsibility of a job. I pay for my car insurance and phone bills, so I’d still have expenses my parents wouldn’t wave. Obviously sports and the job are important, but I really don’t know if I should give up part of my potential scholarships to play a sport my final high school year and be captain.

*As a note, all scholarships associated with the Ib program are dependent on tests that take place at the end of the two year courses. It’s not guaranteed I’ll get anything other than GPA credit from my classes.",14Aug2020,1

260,"Here’s the story: I’ve know this person for about 4 years. We’ve worked together on and off over those 4 years. We are currently both managers at the same location. Yesterday was his day off. I worked all day and had some difficult customers and scenarios. 
So today when we saw each other we talked about normal things and I began telling him about this particular customer who was being really harsh, how I reacted and handled the situation. I also explained that some of the employees witnessed this customer’s behavior, commended me on how I handled it and continued to comment on how condescending this customer was being. 
After I finished the story/venting the first thing he said to me was “I’m not meaning this as a joke, so I want a serious answer. How’s your mental health?” 
I was kind of shocked that was the first thing he said because we usually vent about things and poke fun at the rough situations we deal with. So I answer “I’m good. Just venting like normal. Why?” He followed with “your face is telling me otherwise but okay.” I asked for clarification and started to feel a bit offended. He didn’t say much after that so I told him I wouldn’t vent anymore since he was concerned with my normal feelings and walked out.

I’m still a little upset because It seemed like he was treating the situation as if I were overreacting or acting crazy? As I mentioned we vent about situations often so I was totally caught off guard with the mental health question. While there’s a part of me that thinks that’s a good thing to ask someone when you’re concerned, is it right to point blank ask someone in a vulnerable conversation? 
Would you be offended in this situation or do you feel that maybe I’m reading too much into it?",14Aug2020,1
261,"My boyfriend and I are from drastically different backgrounds. He’s very wealthy and I am lower middle class. It’s not that he’s arrogant or likes to boast or anything - he is actually very very humble. But sometimes I just can’t help but feel a little inferior. Not just to him but to “his world” and the people in it and the people he associates with. 

For example, I asked him for the number of his tailor (who he’s spoken marvels about how good he is). That tailor that he uses has a long relationship with him and has altered a lot of Chanel garments for his business. The tailor is also in a more wealthy part of town. I couldn’t help but think to myself what the tailor is going to think when he sees my cheaply made clothing that I bought off the sale rack (because I can never afford to buy anything full price). He offered to introduce me so that he gives me a good price (being that he knows my bf) - I cant help but have it in the back of my mind: does he feel sorry for me in a way? 

None of this has anything to do with my bf or anything that he has said and or done. It’s just the way that I feel sometimes. I never felt inferior until I started mixing with people that are from high status. Just feels so gross sometimes that I feel so underprivileged. 

He’s also always pushing the Ivy League schools (because he’s Ivy League alumni). Makes me feel inferior because I went and got my bachelors at community college and plan to go to grad school at a state school. He’s just always talking about how great they are and how great it is to be at one. I personally subscribe to the notion that it doesn’t matter what school you go to, it matters who you are and what you do when you go there. I think that hard work and drive is the path to success, not just going to a fancy school. And I still believe that but sometimes in the back of my mind I do feel a tad bit inferior because I have such “humble” beginnings compared to him.",14Aug2020,1

265,"I’m 18 and I still live with my mom and grandparents. I been smoking weed for a considerable amount of time by now. I started mostly cause I had really bad insomnia but I’m just pretty much an avid smoker now tbh. But recently my grandmother smelt it and questioned it and after doin her own investigations I guess she decided to text my mom while she was at work and ask her if I smoke. She told her bout the smell and my mom said she’s been kinda noticing it too. My mom ends up calling me and is of the bat mad as most parents are (unnecessarily) when confronting they’re child. She ask me if I smoke and I came clean and said I do and she was pissed but I couldn’t pin point why. Ik for a fact it’s for the most part because I was hiding it from her and as she said sneaking around. But I couldn’t tell if she was ok or not with me actually smoking. Me and my mom are for the most part very close but that almost came to an end when I was dating my ex a few months ago who she didn’t like. She was then mad cause she said I was sneaking around with the girl. Besides these 2 instances I don’t hide anything from here but the issue is she is someone who is very hard to convince once her mind is made up and she has her guard up all the time and it can really fuck up things because she just simply won’t listen. I don’t lie to her but because of me doin these things she doesn’t believe anything I say and it can be extremely frustrating. I understand that sneaking something is a form of dishonesty but I’m not a liar. I’m not sure what she wanted me to do. Did she expect me to walk up to her and say “hey mom I smoke weed.” Idk I’m just not sure what to do now in regards to handling this situation and trying to defuse things and get her to actually talk this out with me without fighting. When it comes down to it despite stereotypes and what someone may think about marijuana users, I get my shit dealt with. I do what I gotta do and more. I do what literally everyone ask me to do for them in the house and more. I still have things together for the most part I’d say. I just need advice on what to do from here",14Aug2020,1

To start, at this point I’m (M18) and of course like everyone in the US, quarantined, I’m currently working  as a lifeguard under COVID quarantine, I’m considering a second job just to gain more money and hopefully able to move out next year, once I get my full time job hopefully as an electrician in January of 2021

Also not to mention I’ve struggled with mental health issues since middle school such as anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and panic attacks and unfortunately though they not as bad today they do still haunt me to this day

As you can see from the title, I think I'm in love with my Best Friend. By the way, my best friend is transgender (FTM) but it hasn't changed anything between us.

I've had sleepovers with him before, and they were really amazing :) I loved every moment of it. He jumped from his bed and jumped into my arms, and I enjoyed it a lot lol. His dog snoopy stopped it, as he's very protective of his owner. He also did some handy stuff (by that I mean just grabbing onto my arm and stuff like that) Everything he does is cute, and I can't wait for his binder to come and he's been so confident ever since he came out. I love him so much, and even though it's 1 year away before I move to Arizona, I'm scared of losing him. I already lost my other best friends when I moved.

I did technically tell him I loved him in the way I told Reddit, but it was all in a joke for a confession that was supposed to be for me confessing about something stupid. I don't think I'll ever tell him, most likely. He's amazing, and I know he loves me but I know not in that way. I feel confused, this has never happened to me before. I certainly have had crushes before and while yes they were all failures, they were never with people I was that close to at the time.

We also text each other daily and all the time, though mostly during the night for whatever reason. I would rather stay up all night and text him, because he's that amazing.

1. Don't feel like I am ready for a job just yet and there's lots more to learn. (I want to work as a Machine Learning Engineer) 
2. I am passionate and would like to create new knowledge possibly going into the academic field later.
3. The job market in the U.S. is down due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

I’m a girl (20) and have a brother (19). We get along well. I really enjoy talking to him because we have some similar interests, evan though I’m not a football fan or watch twitch I listen and engage politely/ enthusiastically  when he goes on and on about them. But I’ve realised a lot more recently evan though he’s always done this, is within a conversation after he’s stated his opinions or talked a lot about what he’s interested in, then I’d give my opinion or start talking about what I’m interested in he mostly walks off,  talks over me to someone else or starts fidgeting with stuff in my room clearly not listening. I find it embarrassing, really upsetting being ignored and I’ve started  having thoughts like my opinions don’t matter or everything I say is wrong, or of course he walks away your so boring. I’m in two minds of either confronting him about it but I KNOW he’ll just wouldn’t care and stop talking to me altogether which I really don’t want.

Which im like great yay! But she spends all her time with other people. And im really disappointed because i miss her and love her so much and just want her validation and affection. 

When she comes over to my house its not because she wants to hang out but its so that she can have dinner with her boyfriend, sleepover, and then go to his house in the morning. She makes plans with him and my friend and her boyfriend infront of me and when i ask if i can come she sounds bothered and reluctant. Like im a burden.

When the three of us hang out its them talking and flirting and me walking not being apart of the conversation and being dismissed for 2 hours and its really embarrassing and i cry after because it hurts dude anywayyyyssss🤪

I hate to say it but i feel really hurt because i am being used and unappreciated. And im trying my best to be supportive but its so hard 

Im really bad at telling people how i feel and i dont know how to bring this up without making her feel like a burden because i doubt that she knows how much she is hurting me",14Aug2020,1
287,"so, i broke my leg back in May, it’s recovered now but i’m still not fully 100 percent (still walking with a limp), i’m unable to get a job due to the pandemic and even if i did, my mom is Eastern European so she’s skeptical of everything.

288,"I went to my girlfriend's house for the first time, and hung there for a little while. I brought my PS4 and we played video games most of the time, even watched some movies. She and I were really enjoying ourselves. I even had a good short conversation with her mother about how things are in my own life. Everything seemed fine until her mother cooked, and I am just going to be honest.. the food wasn't good. I felt myself gagging trying to eat it. I couldn't finish it all. 

I got home and my girlfriend messaged me about how upset her mother was with me, saying I ""made myself too comfortable,"" and ""wasted food.""  Not sure how I made myself too comfortable just sitting in the same spot all day in the basement. Also, I wasn't supposed to walk upstairs (where the only trash can was...) so how else could I throw anything away?

So, as of now I'm not invited back over.

Was I in the wrong anywhere? Any advice as to how I can fix things?",14Aug2020,1

What’s a good way to initiate a conversation online? Just a simple “hey”? Or how would one go about this. I haven’t been in this stage in quite awhile so I’m a bit nervous and I guess hesitant.

290,"Best friend is miserable because I am happy

Long post...
I am a 23 year old female happily dating my 29 year old boyfriend. We have been officially together for 6 months but casually seeing each other for 9. He makes me so happy. He is the kindest most genuine person I have ever met. I know it is early on and we are not rushing any big decisions such as living together, marriage, ect. But I can definitely see us being together long term. I have known him for 5 years, on a purely friendship level.

My best friend apparently had a thing for him. I was unaware of this until my bf asked me out in December 2019  and then suddenly she was considering asking him out again. She claims she had asked him out twice the summer before  but he didn’t “realize” and wanted to ask him again. My boyfriend does not recall this and says she did not. Whatever...I said ok you liked him first, I’ll back off. She texts me a day or two later saying how she was just lonely, doesn’t like him like that, and he’s just a nice guy but she’s not into him. I double check ensuring her that our friendship means more than any guy and she reassures me it is ok and she does not like him. That is the total extent of any involvement between them. Period. Another important thing to note is my bestfriend is fooling around sexually with one of my boyfriends good friends in private as well. 

Boyfriend and I hit it off in a romantic way right off the bat. And I thought everything was done. Over the last few months my best friend has told me numerous times shes so lonely, she is so jealous of how happy I am, she is so jealous it is too the point she can no longer be around my boyfriend and I together, she had feelings for him when we got together, all stuff like that. She gets mad when we double date with couples because she doesnt have a boyfriend to be included with. Meanwhile I have never brought my relationship into our friendship I make time for just my bestfriend and I. I never have them both at my apartment at the same time. The only time we are all together is in a group setting because we all have the same friends. 

I have really tried to be a good friend over the years and I still am. She was literally crying telling me how she can’t be around us because we are so happy and she is lonely. I have tried talking to her and telling her to date if she is lonely. All of this bugs me. I am happy for my friends when they are happy...i want them to be healthy and happy. I dont get jealous like her. I don’t know what to do, i feel like she wants me to chose between them. I really care about her and dont want to lose the friendship but shes making things awkward and making me uncomfortable with the things she is saying. She told her mom I stole the guy she liked away from her and now her mom hates me. She is 22 and is acting like a immature middle schooler in my opinion. I dont have the energy for this anymore and I just do not know what to do...I would love to try to save the friendship because I do care about her. 
This is the shortened version she has said many things alluding to how she likes my boyfriend and basically trying to guilt trip me. We have had conversations to no avail it seems. She gets jealous when my boyfriend and I make plans. Example: she said she wanted to go to DC. I said in passing oh, bf and I were actually planning a trip to DC for this date. Blah blah. Then she was mad and jealous. 
I will take any and all advice please.",14Aug2020,1
291,"My therapist is on break til next month, so the internet will have to do :'D 

This has been a reoccurring problem in my life, but it's only gotten worse with quarantine. I'm not a naturally confrontational person- I *always* get the blame for it if it goes wrong, so I just bite my tongue. I'm used to feeling like my baggage is my baggage and that no one cares about it, however, my reputation in social circles is being the 'mom friend' who helps you sort out your emotional help, talks you out of bad ideas and finds/encourages resources to help. 

But I don't have that friend- at all. I never have. I really wish I did (hell, I'd probably marry someone who cared about me that much) but I don't, and it feels like I never will. Whenever my friends do something that bothers me, I feel like I can't confront them about it without seeming preachy or like I'm overly sensitive. I wouldn't say I'm super sensitive, but I have my weak points. 

Recently, I've had a friend push my buttons more than most. They see COVID as a hoax, see recent politics as riots before protests, and just overall don't seem to care because they live in a small town where no one else cares. I want so badly to just scream whenever they talk like this, it hurts so much. I'm going into healthcare, my little sister is disabled, I've lost family members to COVID, I'm a black person- these events are all deeply important to me, and hearing them brushed aside makes me feel invalidated like I'm just crazy. 

I feel like I always do, like *I* have to be the one who suffers while everyone else can laugh it off and move on. But I don't know how to bring it up- I don't think I can anymore. I don't want to lose them as a friend, I don't want to lose any of my friends, but I just feel trapped. I really don't know what to do or how to fix this before I grow up",14Aug2020,1
292,"sorry if everything is a bit messy and short, i’m talking on mobile.

My mother (50F) is Asian. My Dad is white. My Dad is who I have to thank for educating me on what I can and cannot say. My mother, on the other hand, is the opposite. She doesn’t think of any other race as “inferior” to her, nor does she think she’s superior. It’s the words that come out of her mouth that hurt me.

Today we and a couple of my Dad’s friends went out wine tasting and driving around, and my Dad’s friend puts on this music that has the n slur in it. My Dad’s friend (68M White) starts singing the song and says the n word multiple times, even when the song didn’t say it. I was shocked for a minute that he said it, but before I called him out on it I wanted to tell one of my parents.

My mom doesn’t usually act racist, and in fact the day before this happened, she was really nice and was interested in the anime I was watching (One Piece lol). I thought about watching One Piece with my mom one day. Anyways, when she got in the car I whispered to her “Mom, [insert Dad’s friend’s name] said the n word multiple times” and she says the n slur with a HARD. R. And then she goes on to say other racial slurs like Chnk and another one for Filipinos. she can say the filipino one because she is filipino. the others... I was so sad I heard her say them. I wanted to say shut up to her so bad. I told my Mom and my Dad’s friend to never say those words again. The friend apologized but I still haven’t forgiven him, but my Mom just told me to shut up.

During the car ride I started crying because I was fighting with people earlier this week about then saying the n word, and I wanted to scream knowing I was in a car with 2 people who said it at the same time and place. What makes it even worse is that my Mom still hasn’t apologized, and just decided to act like a 9yo making a fit. I tried to explain to her that she can’t say those things in the car, but she just turned her head away. 

My Dad is the best person in my life right now, because he actually helped me call them out in the car. My Mom just told me and my Dad to shut up.

Later when we got to the room, I started arguing with her why she said it, and her response was so pathetic. she said no black person was there to hear her say it. ffs, her nieces are half black. If they knew she said that, they would have unforgivable beef (more than they have now). Right now, I can’t call see her as my mom, im just saying it so that people reading this don’t get confused.

What bugs me even more is that the friend’s wife did nothing. In fact the only thing she said in the car was “hey, Cayley’s just sensitive to those words”. No, I’m not. In fighting for BLM with everything that I can do, and the people in the car just humiliated all of that. Later that day during dinner, my mom was having an attitude towards my dad and I and i said with a smirk “you have no right to be mad” and the fucking friend’s wife said “it’s no laughing matter, Cayley”. I couldn’t believe her audacity. The fact she was white makes it worse, and I don’t understand how she could defend my mom.

To add to the racism, the friends have grandchildren who listened to the music that my Dad’s friend said the n slur to. Keep in mind, they’re only 5M and 2F, so I cried even more thinking of how they’ll grow up.

I really need advice on how to handle this, because right now I can’t forgive my mom or my Dad’s friend and friend’s wife.",14Aug2020,1
293,"So im 17F and I'm having serious financial problems right now and I need advice on all of this. Btw I dont have any family and only 1 friend so im on my own with all of this. My old job closed and im 100% reliant on unemployment at this point. Ive basically been working full time to provide for myself since I was 16. My current guardian doesn't buy me anything and isn't helping me with any of these future payments.

1. I just got a car last week with the money I had been saving up from working before the lockdown. I did a down-payment with finance. The monthly payment for the car with a protection plan is 200 so I didnt have a problem with that but then the teen driver insurance got added on which boosted the price to 500 a month which is way more than I expected it to be because my guardian didn't tell me how much insurance would be until it was time to pay it. So is there a way to decrease the cost?

2. Im supposed to be starting college soon, but im not sure how to pay for it. The college im going to is out of state, but because its out of state I can't get grants from  the state I live in, but I also can't get grants from the state the college is in because im not living there yet(im doing online classes until corona clears up and until I get the money to move there) so I'd basically be paying out of pocket until I move. So how do I get college money?

3. Speaking of moving I dont have the money to pay for rent because of the car payment. I need the car to move because its on the west coast and I live on the east so I need it for transportation, work, and school. Right now I've set a budget for some apartment supplies but even then i still have to buy furniture for when i actually move which is even more money. Probably a thousand minimum. The college im going to doesnt have dorms. So is there any programs for assisted rent and utilities?",14Aug2020,1

Sometimes I am happy too. I have no motivation to do anything I used to love doing or pursuing any other interests I have. I want to get better at drawing or doing game development and things like that but I just have no motivation to practice or learn anything. I start and shortly after I just end up staring at a blank screen not wanting to do anything. I also have job idont want anymore but I have no idea what to do. I juts feel like I could be doing more.

I also have no energy to go out and do anything. My friends ask me to go out and I always say I cant or im busy. If I do end up going out i feel like im faking my emotion. Like I should be happy right now and I force myself to be happy. But when I get home I'm so emotionally drained. I could never tell anyone I know about this cuz i dont actually like talking about how I feel. I don't want my friends thinking its because of them that I'm not going out.

297,"Just got hired to a new job a couple weeks ago. The other day I went into work and this other guy that works there asked me where I went to high school. He said he recognized me. I asked him if he played any sports, as I used to wrestle and my brother played football. He said he was on the football team but never got along with most of them. I'd figured he knew me through my brother, and that was that. He later on (like an hour or so later) ran into me again and told me that actually, his middle school girlfriend was my high school girlfriend. I didn't know what to say to this which I assume made me visibly uncomfortable since he then apologized for ""bringing up bad blood"" because he somehow ""knew it ended poorly""

I kinda chuckled and said I thought it ended great, and I haven't spoken to her since then. He apparently has and he said he occasionally still does talk to her. 

The conversation ended there. I didn't think much of then, but now that I think about it I realize the problem. After we had broken up, she had told our mutual friends that I was abusive and manipulative which caused them all to stop talking to me. I had figured that at the time she was just trying to scramble together as much support as she could to try and get back at me or keep them as friends without me or something along those lines. But now that I know she's been talking about me with people I didn't even know it makes me worry about how she's ruining my reputation. 

I thought about reaching out to her again but she has me blocked on every social media and I no longer have her number. The only form of contact I might have is this guy at work but even then I don't want him involved in my personal life to begin with. 

Any advice or tips on what I should do? Is there anything I can do?

298,"So I'm curious if there's anything that can be done or what can be done to bring attention to small towne police corruption. 

For a few years I lived in a small town that made me feel like I was in a movie. The whole thing was just insane and I could barely believe it. Talking to people from when I was in high school there they would say ""yea there's nothing to do around here but drugs and rape."" I had a group of friends and nearly all of them had experienced this, even as children. It was absolutely horrifying seeing the bruises on my friends inner thighs where the father of one of the students at our school tried to rape her. And after the police told her they wouldn't do anything, that he was good man and would never do anything like that. Just the complete and utter disregard of what I'd believe to be the polices job to take seriously. Slowly everything became very real.

The police were known to ignore people and just be generally corrupt. Which blew my mind to bits thinking that all these people who've told me their experiences just accepted that they couldn't go to the police because they'd be told for a whole list of reasons why they couldn't be helped.

  Now years later I'm talking to a friend who tried contacting the police to report child sexual exploitation and nothing. The town knows the police are corrupt and she knew it when asking but didn't know what else to do. She's at a loss for what to do and I wish I could help her. I don't know what to do.

 I just want for my friend to be able to get justice and recognition. And it sounds crazy to me that this place exists like there should be some higher authority that would recognize this and do something but it's as if the whole place is in it's own miserable bubble. 

I guess what I'm asking is is there anything I can do? Is there a way to bring in a department or something separate from this town to ask for help  or have listen to her?",14Aug2020,1

I have known him since kindergarten and even back then, he would always ask me to give him my stuff and if I didn’t he would threaten to stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with him from 3rd to 5th grade. Once middle school came, he became friends with me again. My other friends and him always came to me for rides because my parents were the only ones who would drive us places.

Once high school came and everyone got their license, he pretty much never asked me to do anything or talked to me. Then after high school, all of his friends went away for college so he started inviting me places again. Then when they come back for the summer, I receive no invites at all. It’s literally like clockwork, as soon as the semester ends, he doesn’t invite me anywhere until college starts back up again.

I told him that if he’s really my friend then would he would invite me to his house or parties when he has them, but he just calls me “crazy” or delusional” even though I have proof of it.

A few weeks ago was his birthday and he had a huge party at a Lake House and invited everyone he knew except me. Also, this week he and bunch of his other friends went on vacation to the beach which he knew I wanted to go. In fact, he told me I was welcomed to come, but when I said yes, he never responded. And a couple of weeks ago he told me they weren’t going to the beach because nobody could go.

Today, he sent me this long text saying he’s sorry and that he has been a bad friend. He is also I have done bad things, but overall he’s sorry. I don’t know if it’s sincere or the fact that his friends will being going back to college soon.

Should I forgive my friend?",14Aug2020,1
300,"To put bluntly, I've been living at home all my life (23f). My university was in town, so I lived at home through uni and this heavily effected me not being able to go out as often, be too reliant on my parents (car, going to school getting dropped off bc my parents work), an not being able to be my own person, and learn and enjoy life. I did have some internships where I moved out short term in different cities and i honestly grew and learned so much during those short times and wish I could move out permantely. It's also because I have toxic af parents who don't appreciate kids, see me as a return on investment, baby me too much, bring me down,....etc and so much. I swear my blood pressure probably gone up the past few months because of doing school online in my room while my parents are crazy af (that's why im always in my room avoiding them. Typically I'd at least be on campus but not possible rn).


I appreciate having saved on rent. It's super helpful. but I still have loans. I realize I can't progress with being my own person as long as I'm living at home. I finished uni at the end of December, and start working in town in January, so I don't even have an excuse to move out, because work is a 20 min drive away. but fuck like it ruins me being able to meet new people, date, explore, be independent. I'm just another statistic of a millennial in their 20s living at home. So what do I do?

I could save up and live at home for a year, so that I have enough to pay off student loans, but it means being at home still. With covid, idk if i'll be working from home in January, but if i wasn't at least work would be my escape from home. My mental health would still go in shit though and dating would be difficult.


I could move out, but im ngl, moving out within my city is silly from a cost-savings perspective. I'd have to buy a used car to get to work in addition to paying rent within the city, even when my home is 20 mins away from work. I could alternatively ask my work place (its a rotational program) to do my second year in the bigger city thats an hour away which would force me to move out, but apparantly COL is way too much right now in the big city, however, i'd have peace of mind and be more independent in a year when im 24. So I could suck it up for a year then move out at 24.

To save detailing her personal struggles, she has had an immense amount of pressure dropped on her shoulders with her sick mother and has lately (within the past month or so) begun a slow but sure mental break down. 

She has suffered from OCD and anxiety in the past and managed to keep it at bay for many years, however, her mother's condition worsened recently and she has fallen back into the pit of despair. I've tried everything to help her and for the most part, when we're together, she is the same positive and happy person. Receiving that shocking call this morning that she had been in a bad car accident was the most panic-inducing moment I've ever experienced. My entire body went numb while I was speeding to the hospital, I thought I was having a heart attack. She expressed no intention, no plan, no reason to believe she was in a state that couldn't be helped, so how could this have happened? The doctors are theorising that her increased SSRI dose could have caused these thoughts to manifest, but she isn't that person?

I can't make this any more about myself, but the stress and pain from all this is unbearable. Knowing that she was alone in her car this morning, with thoughts that not even the worst person should have and there was nothing I could have done to save her.

So me and one of my closest friends sell weed together. We’re both super broke and whenever we get some weed we sell it together and try to combine our money. So I worked my ass off and racked up enough for a QP, for those of you that don’t smoke that is about 600$ (this is a big deal for us). I fronted him half of it to sell and long story short he left it outside and it got wet and useless. This was about a month ago. 

He said he would pay me back by selling some shoes that he has. He went on a 1 week vacation without even taking pictures of the shoes (and I heard he spent a lot of money on that vacation because my other friends were with him). When he came back I called him every day asking where’s the pictures of the shoes, did you sell the shoes. We’re really close so there wasn’t any big pressure really. It’s been about 2 weeks since he got back from vacation and he hasn’t even taken pictures of them yet. Today he finally did and sent them to me, (the plan was for me to sell them because I have more sales on the website where we sell shoes). 

He sent me some shitty ass pics and told me to post them. A little Later, one of my friends told me that he said he was gonna take shitty pics on purpose just to piss me off. At this point I really just wanna beat the shit out of him. He’s not taking it serious and the way he’s making it seem, it feels like he doesent give a fuck about paying me back. What do I do?

307,"My sister is a kind lady and earlier in life a natural nurse. She is now a manager in a tertiary college - polytechnic.

To meet her she is bright and enthusiastic, engaging and generous. No alcohol or gambling or anything else. She was married but now divorced - no children which is a great regret but she never talks about it.

She rarely ever talks about herself. If asked she uses the broad brush of ""stuff happened and its all good now, tickety boo"".

My sister is aged 59 but has the energy of 40. Until she crashes at weekends. Friendly but like most of us has just a few close friends who tend to be emotional people like her. 

About 10 years ago her speech began to become a gabble. Most of the words were repeating in run-on sentences and focused on finding examples of great things about everyone else. 

""Mike you have always had good ankles. And Jen you have such a good voice!"" 

She loved our father but a hour before he died he told her with exasperation to shut up and get out of the hospital room. This is a very good example of her almost uncontrollable speaking.

308,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, I hope none of my family sees this because this is very specific to our situation haha

&lt;&lt; LONG BACKGROUND, SKIP IF YOU WANT&gt;&gt; My mom (39F) and my stepdad (35M) have been married for 5 years. They met online and my siblings and I (17F) met him like 2 weeks into their relationship. Him and his daughter (15F) moved in about half a year after we met them and got married a few months after that. I have anxiety issues and don't do well with change, so I wasn't super fond of him from the beginning, but he has since grown on me as a father figure. I do think I have a pretty good grasp on who to trust, and I have just never fully trusted him. There were several instances when I was younger when he would act in strange ways. At least, they seemed strange to me since my family thought I just had something against him personally when I brought them up. He has always seemed very narcissistic in little ways, showing his body off all the time and acting like my mom should be grateful she had him. If anyone said anything he didn't agree with, he would snicker and mock them, even if what they were saying was 100% rational or true. 

This year, I started noticing little changes in my mom's behavior. She's gorgeous even though she is a little curvy. She started talking about plastic surgery, dressing up for every occasion she would see my stepdad, putting in hair extensions, etc. This wouldn't have been a problem if she was trying to change herself to make herself feel better, but she has since told me that it was because my stepdad hated how she looked. He told her that she wasn't his type, he told her that he loved all of her except her belly, he told my little sister to tell her that he thought her outfit looked ugly, he told his ex-wife to send nudes to my mom to motivate her to lose weight, etc. She has had multiple breakdowns in front of me expressing that she doesn't feel loved. He stopped paying her any attention unless she was dressed in clothes that showed off her butt and perfect hair and makeup. She is one of those people who is extremely dependent on their partner, so this was the end of the world to her. Regardless, she didn't want to leave him. 

He has also been a negative force in my sibling and I's lives. He smacked my stepsister in the mouth when she was 13, and when I called him out for it, he told me to know my place. He constantly nags on and on about how my stepsister isn't as well-behaved as my bio siblings. She now has emotional issues that he mocks her for. He calls us lazy for taking 30-minute naps. We have a huge list of chores (the entire house plus cooking, he doesn't do anything) which is fine, except for the fact that we all are honors students involved in several extracurriculars and don't have time 24/7 to clean. We could do the entire list but one thing, and he would get upset that the one thing wasn't done. My mom blames it on his OCD, but they try to blame their marriage failing on us not doing all of our chores when told to. They can't agree on how to parent, but I don't think they should drag us into that conversation. He doesn't give us any positive reinforcement at all but gets upset when taking our phones away all the time doesn't encourage us to do what they tell us to. I also recently found out that my bio dad's child support has been going towards paying for the house that they can't afford. Since they have shared finances, he just takes the money and says it's supporting us anyways. I'd be okay with that if he didn't use the money from my stepsister's bio mom to take her out multiple times a month but get upset with my mom if she takes my bio siblings and I out once. &lt;&lt;BACKGROUND OVER&gt;&gt;

Now for the real shitty stuff. All of these relationship issues caused my mom to feel like a failure as a wife and mother, so she asked a male family friend for advice on how to get my stepdad to love her again. My stepdad flipped, accused her of having an affair, threw away their wedding ring, smashed pictures of them, etc. (TW) The same day, my little sister and I come home to her delirious screaming for my stepdad to come back. She was acting recklessly while she was drunk and it ended up going south very quickly. (She is fine now; this happened about a month ago). When the ambulance and police got there, my stepdad didn't ask any of us if we were okay after seeing our mom dying (something that even the NEIGHBOR asked). He didn't want to see my mom in the ambulance, either. He was actually completely unphased even though he knew exactly what was happening. Then, I hear from my mom that he was crying hysterically in the hospital when he got to talk to her??? I don't want to invalidate his emotions but the difference between his reactions in front of us and in front of her was completely different. My sister and I found several concerning and depressing messages to him from my mom minutes beforehand, and he told her to stop talking like that. It was my bio dad who actually became concerned with the messages she sent him about taking care of my siblings and I. If it weren't for him, I probably would have lost my mom. 

I know full well it's not entirely his fault that my mom did that, but I can't rationalize in my mind that he still loves her when he knew full well how she was feeling because of him. This wasn't the first time she had texted him like this. Stepping back and looking at the trauma he has caused my family over the past few years, I've decided to stop talking to him. I get to the point of almost having a panic attack just by hearing his voice. I can't get the image of my mom dying on the couch screaming his name out of my mind. My mom is adamant that she is staying with him and is telling me that I'm being defiant and should make some attempt to sympathize with him. I can't help that it's my body's reaction to freak out whenever he's near. For now, I'm living at my bio dad's house, but I want to be there for my mom as much as possible. I have no idea what to do about it. At this rate, I'm just going to keep living here until I graduate and just leave things as they are, which I know is the opposite of what my mom wants. Maybe I am being a little drastic, but it's all very overwhelming right now and I don't know what kind of an example to set for my younger siblings.",14Aug2020,1
309,"Honestly, I don't even really know what kind of advice I'm looking for here. 

My car was stolen last night and I just... I feel so weird? So unsafe, sad, and angry. It was parked in what was supposed to be a secure garage where I work. No badges have been required at this garage, so the thief was able to just drive away with my car with no problems. This was what I was greeted with after a long hospital shift.

I work in a bigger city, and crime isn't uncommon there. The police said that this garage has been having a lot of issues with theft and people breaking into cars but the parking service seems to not really care about that. They don't even have useful cameras and claimed they were too blurry to see if my car was on the tapes anywhere.

I had a lot of stuff in there, as I frequently have long commutes for school and work. Sentimental key chains, change of clothes, stuff for my new apartment, new set of interior lights.... like I just had so much stuff in there. And not to mention that car was my baby. I loved that car, I mean I still do, but I just feel like something really special to me was taken away. Does that make sense? Is that normal? 

I tend to form heavy emotional attachments with *things*, and my car is no exception. I love my car and I am so devastated it is gone and I'll probably never see it again. 

I feel so angry at this entitled person who thought it was okay on some level to get into my personal property and leave with it. I've always been hesitant about letting anyone else drive it, and now some jerk head is doing who knows what with my car. 

Ugh. Is it normal to feel so sad and grief- stricken after a theft like this? What even should I expect? I don't know. I just feel so sad and violated, somehow. Sorry this is such a rant, any insight to what I should do would be fantastic.

He feels like he won’t go anywhere in life because he doesn’t like his current job, can’t see himself anywhere else, and doesn’t have any hobbies. We have been together for 2 years and he’s only 20. I tried to be kind and understanding, but I started to notice he was getting alarmingly sad. I had a conversation with him about going to a therapist and getting back on meds, and I told him how much he means to me and his family, but it didn’t seem to change his attitude much. That was a few days ago, and he seems a little better today. 

About an hour ago I was curious so I went on his phone to see if he bought any drugs (he’s not supposed to be smoking because he gets drug tested at work) and he did. Then I got a little too snoopy and I noticed he’s been looking up “most effective ways to commit suicide” and “how to volunteer for the front line”. I’m terrified. I don’t want to lose him but he doesn’t talk to me. How am I supposed to help him? I’m afraid he will get angry that I looked through his phone if I tell him what I saw and make it worse.

313,"Long story short, I received a text for my Mom that my old PC from 2005-2009 that has been sitting in storage in my old wardrobe (their house) has just been booted up because they would like to give it to a relative just to play some games/watch movies on.    
(I thought it had crashed and was unusable a decade ago, but I don't like throwing away my old machines in the hope I could salvage it one day and recover something I needed.)  

  
Thing is... I had a \*ahem\* ""career"" as a NSFW Artist and there may very well be a lot of sensitive ""data"" on there. My mom's a massive snoop, so no doubt she will go through every folder directory on that thing. Except I can't remember if the machine crashed, was formatted after a virus attack, or was purged before I got a new one. It's \*that\* old.   

My whole day has been ruined and I'm going to spend the next week of my life wondering: \*""What did they see on there? Was it wiped? Did they find it all? Are future family dinners going to be incredibly awkward now? Do they now know their son is \_\_\_\_\_\_sexual?""\*  

    
God, this is the equivalent feeling of your parents finding your old teenage journals and going through your box of memories (Mom has actually done that before which lead to me just destroying everything from my high school years). It's so personal to me. Not even my closest friends know about this double-artist life I had once led.  
 Anyway, we're currently living in a curfew'd lockdown period, so I can't exactly rush over there right now to retrieve it. How do I tell them to unplug it, put it back where they found it and not give it away without raising suspicions if they say ""But you're not even using it"" or ""What's on there that you want to keep?""

326,Some more details: I work for cost plus world market in a liberal town that has had a mandatory mask law. I am definitely dealing with less people not wearing masks than many retail workers but I am struggling with the corporate policy. The corporate policy is to offer people with out a mask a mask to wear and if they still refuse to offer curbside service. If they continue to refuse to wear a mask we are supposed to let them shop. Now this gives me a few options. I am high enough in the store that if someone comes in without a mask I can easily get away from them by doing office work or working in the warehouse. But this leaves my cashier (usually the lowest paid worker in the store to fend for them selves). None of them have complained to me  but I have a moral problem with being protected by my employee who I should be protecting. I could take my break and call the cops on the person not wearing a mask. I could risk getting in trouble with corporate and just tell people without a mask to leave. They more than likely will not fire me. I don’t like any of these options. TLDR How should I handle my employer hamstringing my ability to enforce mask laws in the store I work in?,14Aug2020,1

I’m a complete newb to cars  and know very little about mechanics. I’m the beginning of July I bought an old Pathfinder from a mechanic friend of mine who told me it’d be fine at the very least until next spring. 

The vehicle never ran very well, I did some minor repairs after buying but today it died completely. The mechanic shop I brought it to said that it looks like there could be a ton of things wrong and that it may not be a simple fix. 

The problem is, I don’t have any knowledge to validate anyone’s claims on the state of the vehicle. I’ve been told mechanics are shiesty and both parties I’m dealing with are mechanics. 

I’m definitely not angry with my friend, as someone who knows nothing about cars it makes sense that he could’ve honestly expected to last a year and have it die at 2 months, it seems like a very small margin of error, like when my dad was diagnosed with cancer and given two months but died the next week.

345,"Long story short, I work at a home for teenage boys who are 10-22 with Low IQ, 95% of which are legally obligated to be at this residential intensive program by law for sexual crimes. It’s a sexual program. It is a 24/7 monitoring program meaning that these kids, can never be out of our sight. We have cameras in all rooms except the bathroom. Some of our kids are pretty independent and relatively normal, some are completely unable to care for themselves, dangerous and so low functioning that they can’t help their behaviors. 

We have a kid here who has a chromosomal deletion that causes similarities to down syndrome and he even has the similar facial markers. We’ll call him don. Don is so low functioning he cannot even wipe himself properly, he cannot do transitions, he is constantly in time out and cause disruptions. His vocab and ability to talk is identical to low functioning downs, and he constantly screams, is aggressive physically etc. I don’t normally work at this house but got pulled for ratio one night and put on third shift to have his group bc I’m a veteran staff. Routine on third shift is: chores and house duties all night while monitoring them sleeping then we get them up early and have them do routines: get dressed, breakfast with their group and then hygiene and 30 min drive in 3 separate vans to their special school. We have all been taught non violent physical restraints per state of MA, highly regulated and monitored via cam by the state and specific states depending on who’s from where etc, and we don’t use medical or mechanical restraints. 

This student has broken vertebrae from sleeping in a dog cage his whole life and is getting surgery in a few months. He tiny and frail so is seated holds only but requires them due to his behaviors. This particular morning, he was responsive to his routine and for once got up, dressed and went back to his room where his peers were asleep. He’s loud and he honks and he was pacing the room, after being made to ask for permission by me, which he did so I allowed it as everyone was getting up. The supervisor running the shift actually suggested allowing it bc it often helps to regulate him. Well as he is doing this, a senior third shift SUS who is the head of us on third came into the room, saw him and began yelling at him. I told her I allowed it and she said no, told him to sit that he wouldn’t be manipulating me and screamed for him to get on his bed or he wasn’t allowed to have breakfast. He immediately started bugging out and ran 10 ft to his dressed while yelling NOOOO and flailing but he wasn’t near any other kids nor in a position to harm. He was also still perfectly in view of both  of us. 

This woman grabbed him IMMEDIATELY, and mind you all students are only allowed to be escorted to time out by 2 staff not one, in a very specific way each on one arm. The policy at this program too require prompting verbally before sending to time out with redirections (3x= stop and think- failure to sit quietly and reflect sends you time out but we can’t just send them right away unless they physically or sexually hurt someone or threaten to injure and even he knows this.) He began swinging and screaming I HUNGRY repeatedly and crying but wasn’t a threat still. This woman dragged him across the floor by his shirt which is a Giant Nono obv  and like threw him on the bed, shocking me bc he was actually doing well for once and she did this without like any reason. He threw a bag of cards everywhere after that and she became irate screaming he wasn’t getting breakfast that, he does this every day and that’s why he’s not allowed to eat and repeatedly “you’re bad!” 

I told her that he was not doing anything and she yelled that he was doing this for a show etc. he’s legit too low functioning to even understand simple conversation but I just said I’d watch him do his time out and she sent his group to eat without him where he could still see them. He sat on his bed sobbing and yelling I HONGRY, DON EAT! Over and over while hitting himself which I assisted his hand away from doing and she did not allow any staff to let him eat. His group returned and she instead of allowing breakfast made him pick up the cards which he threw again and cried. She left after that but stated she’d know if he did and she’d watch the tapes etc so nobody is to allow him food. he was so irate and distressed he did what he does always and flipped out. She did everything we were trained to not to, escalated for no reason, went hands on for no reason and then literally tortured him verbally and psychologically over nothing and I couldn’t understand or believe it. I asked mad people to help after she left it they said he’s a special case bc he does this always but legally we can’t. Nobody cared even after seeing it because “he’s like this.” This was abuse. 

I was told he wasn’t allowed breakfast for 3 days this week bc if similar things and the kid is emaciated. I was told staff carrying and drag him to time out solo all the time. It was all on tape so after shift ended and they got to school. 

I was extremely disturbed anyway by this series of events and can’t accurately describe it to its actual bad extent. Immediately after bringing vans back to the residence I documented the incident and called the person at HR and the house manager and asked them to watch the tapes: and now everyone hates me and is criticizing me as she’s extremely liked but nothing has been done as far as I know.

This is literally abuse and I’m being ridiculed and told I was heavy handed by reporting her and that it wasn’t a documentable worthy thing. But am I wrong? They denied the kid food, physically harmed him and for no reason. It was avoidable. It was wrong. So why do I feel like shit. I’m not sure who else to bring this to but it’s haunting me. Do I escalated it to the state? Idek what the fuck to do.",14Aug2020,1

The food isn’t gross and I am not a picky eater, however, I’m very reluctant to swallow. Forcing myself to eat makes me feel sick as well. I eat very little a day and the only time I’ve had an appetite is when I would smoke. Marijuana is not legal in my state and I do not want to rely on it. I just want to be able to stomach things and get nutrients. I am also 5’1” and weigh 115lbs.

I have one in real life best friend who is opposite of me. I used to have about 10 friends and I lost them due to them being fake and us just falling out. 

The guy who I met through my girlfriend is cool and I like that he likes computers and is into them like I am. My girlfriend told me he has been hurt with friendships and relationships so he doesn't trust people so well. I am trying to get to know him more but he sometimes isn't as responsive as I am. We talk on Facebook but I feel like I talk more than he does. He will reply and we will talk but sometimes he'll just reply with one word and it's hard to talk. I just don't want to get hurt.

351,"This needs some background:
About half a year ago I got a call from a friend of his. He said that my brother had weed on him. When my brother came home I confronted him. I we had a serious talk about it and he seemed to understand that he is way too young for weed and that if our parents would find out HELL would break loose. We made a deal to not tell our parents about this and that he would never smoke again, but if I would find out that he did I would tell them about it.

 This morning I went into his room to get some dirty laundry. I found a pack of cigarettes on the floor and a small empty plastic bag (you know the typical kind you put drugs in). It has a slight hint of weed smell when you open it.

So now I have to rat him out.

But I dont want to. 
I know that he will get SO much shit from our parents. They are really affraid of drugs. I don't want him to get in trubble. But at the same time, he made a promisse and he broke it.

More details: last time we talked was July 26 and it was about our fitness goals and how that could help cosplay stuff.

So some back story. My brother, Terrance,had a friend throughout childhood and into his adult life. His name will be Javier for the sake of this story. So they are both 27m, I am 24. I had a huge crush on Javier from 14 until about 20ish. My best friend had a sexual/romantic relationship with him for about a year after we turned 18. When we turned 18 Javier had a sudden interest in me. We had a somewhat sexual relationship that was mostly hidden. We didn't hook up often or publicly, but it was quite intense. My best friend broke it off with him after i told her about our relationship. Eventually after she got into a serious relationship with another guy and ""I got over my crush."" My brother stopped hanging out with him due to growing apart and no longer hanging out. They also started to have different morals and generally didn't agree on things. 

Now at our age, he is playing this weird game. He adds me randomly and she doesn't know about it. I never reply to the requests on my social media. She occasionally replies and hangs out with him. This is sort of her M.O. - as in she tends to tell people she's single and she hangs with them. When he adds me, he wants to hang out and spend some
time together. I tend to ignore his requests and don't hang out with him. Recently though, he adds me more often on social media and insists that we hang out. I want to hang out with him but I'm scared he is just trying to use me. I don't want to be just another person in his long line of relationships. What should i do?

360,"Hey guys. I’ve been having the worst 6 months of my life. Let’s start with this I’m 15 and my birthday is on Monday, my family decided that because we haven’t done much over the past 6 months that we will do a “birthday week” for me. So far the week has been going to a funeral for my uncle (who committed suicide) we are out of town staying with my grandparents. I got kicked out of my room that I have always stayed in so my 17 year old sister who’s almost 18 could sleep on a bed (she’s been sleeping on a couch) I’m quite tall for my age (6’2) I get the couch and my sister gets the bed. Not a big deal except I’m longer than the couch and my head and feet hang off the edge. I tell my mom she says suck it up along with my dad. This is where I’m at currently but there’s more to the story of what’s been going on over the last 6 months. 

This year was great for me until the virus hit. I have a decent amount of friends that I talked to everyday or every other day at school and stuff. Now I hardly talk to most of them I feel like I’m missing out because my mom isn’t letting me do anything. I did school it went well I called my best friend everyday up until my dog died. He got put down. Then nothing “bad” happened for a month. Then out of nowhere playing soccer I broke my hip. I’ve been out for 4 months now (I play soccer everyday day at high level for my age) but now I can’t play soccer like I love to do. 

Next thing you know we are going out of the state to go to my grandparents vacation home. Nobody lives there it was all peaceful up there until my entitled grandparents and my entitled little cousins came up there. My little cousins would not leave me alone and I became a “slave” to my grandparents. Remember I just started walking on my own without crutches off of a broken bone. They had me mowing the lawn, watching the kids, doing very simple things that they could do themselves but didn’t want to like getting a drink for themselves and stuff on top of that they had me carrying 40 pounds of ice from the shed to the house (the shed is at the very least 200 yards from the house) while nobody else was doing anything. I told my mom and she was trying to do something about it and we eventually just ended up leaving and staying in a hotel.

Then we got the news that my uncle died and we came up here to another state for his funeral. We leave to go home finally after like 2 months away from home. But my birthday is on Monday and we leave Saturday and drive almost cross country (Montana to South Carolina) to go back home so we aren’t getting home till late Sunday night. I had plans for my best friend to come over on Monday but my mom told me I can’t since we need to “quarantine” when we get home. So I can’t even see my friends or anyone but my family on my birthday. 

I really don’t know what to do. I don’t have depression or anything. Never had suicidal thoughts. I just feel like I can’t catch a break. I let my parents know how I feel and there telling me to suck it up and that I’m just spoiled (which I probably am). What should I do?

362,"My (22, F) parents are going through a nasty divorce. TL;DR, my dad cheated (probably more than once) and manipulated my mom for \~10 years (in a 20+ year marriage) into thinking she was crazy and didn't know what she was talking about. He displays very narcissistic behavior. We found out, not from him, but from flight and hotel records... 

He never directly admitted it to me. After 4 years since the discovery, they are still going through divorce proceedings. He is still with the mistress (I had to pull this information out of him). He wants me and my little sister in his life... but honestly, as a woman, I still feel wronged and am disgusted by his relationship. I want to move on and let him be happy... but it upsets me that he'd sacrifice authentic relationships with his two daughters to be with his mistress... It's hard when I'm the only one who has to confront him to talk about it. Why do I have to be the adult in this situation??

My mom is also still very angry about it. And any progress I make in forgiving him is guilted by her. She says I don't understand and I should do what's right (aka by telling him he's an asshole and that if he doesn't leave his mistress that we can't have a relationship). I wish she would move on so we can too... But do I even forgive him?? Should I??",14Aug2020,1
363,"I talked to this person online, found out we are the same age, same country, and were planning to meet up or attend the same colleges. But then these few months she started getting depressed and even got diagnosed with moderate depression by a professional.

I asked people irl on what I should do but the advice hadn't been particularly useful, like someone suggested I study with her so she doesn't get depressed about her unproductivity and someone else suggested I stop talking to her but she still initiates text with me even when I made it pretty clear talking online drains me.

So here's the thing. I know depressed people need support from their friends and I also realise I can't be the one supporting her because frankly, I can get way too affected by her depressing emotions and for the past few months it has been affecting my productivity as I spend way too much time online talking to her and trying to help...until I realised it's absolutely draining me and that I don't want to talk to her anymore.

I'm partly hesitating because we clicked well when she was healthier (as friends) but right now I'm really scared of getting emotionally dragged down as I get really influenced by the negativity which also made me have angry outbursts way more than usual. But leaving someone in need seems 'bad' and I'm not sure what would happen if she lost a friend she apparently trusts

After that I took the bus with her on her way back home then went back myself.After this the quarantine kicked in and we couldn’t see each other for a while,so we FaceTimed all the time for hours on end all day.This continued for a few months just waiting out the quarantine hoping we can see each other again.Eventually her parents let her go out to hang out with friends when she was actually going to see me. We went back to the same time and we talked about the stuff on our minds and just chilled out. We spent a few hours together and then around 7 or so she had to go home.

A family friend is having a baby shower next weekend, and I completely forgot. Well, I knew about it happening in August months in advance when there was no date set, but I'd muted the babyshower Whatsapp group when notifications kept going off about planning every single aspect which annoyed me. 
I'd planned to go away with my boyfriend that same weekend. My mum just casually said last night ""you know X's baby shower is on the 22nd?"" And I'm planning on being away from the 21st to the 23rd. 

I've looked for alternative dates but everything is booked the weekend after, or the week before (this weekend) and I have annual leave booked at work too. 
Also, as I'm from a backwards Indian background, the idea of me going away for a weekend is seen as a massive sin so I've said im going away with a different friend. 

My mum keeps trying to pressure me into cancelling the weekend away as the baby shower was booked for months, which it was, and she wasn't to know I'd muted the group. 
I grew up with the baby momma (lol), but I also feel like I need a break. Like of course I book time off work but as I live in a multigeneration family (I'm saving for a house), I never truly get a break. My boyfriend is saying he isn't trying to pressure me into a decision but he says sometimes people can't attend things and that's okay, and I do need to make a choice soon (obviously because its next weekend) and I feel like he's understanding but feels like he comes second best alot of the time.

I have nothing in savings, no credit, no nothing else. I have only one debit card that I got when I opened my checking account with Wells Fargo back when I was 16. The years I was working when I was in high school I never made much. Honestly I didn’t really think about saving at that point. However, I also didn’t get to spend much of my own money for myself. I would make about $300 every two weeks and most of that would go to my parents to help with bills and groceries. That’s how I lived for about the time I worked in 3 different restaurant style jobs. When I graduated high school I got a job at the Amazon Warehouse and there is when I started making way more money a check then I ever did. However, the more I made, the more I gave to my parents. It came to a point where I never broke $1,000 in my checking account the entire time I lived with my parents. I then enlisted into the Air Force where I am now. As I explained before I only have about $2,500 to my name. Nothing in savings or anything like that. My bills go like this:

Spotify: $15
Internet $59

I’m unable to sleep more than a few hours a night. I know I’m fucking up my life and my physical and mental health. I know this is depression. 

But.... I’m scared to see a new therapist. I fell in love with my last one and we carried on a romantic and sexual relationship for a year and a half. In the end I came out worse than when I went in. I know what happened was an ethical violation on his part. But I equally bear responsibility as an adult woman. I was stupid and should have never let it happen. I shouldn’t have gone back again. And again. When he pushed me beyond what I was comfortable doing I did it because I wanted to please him. I was scared of disappointing him and losing him. But looking back I feel there were moments of manipulation and trickery. I question the authenticity of what we had and I hate myself for allowing it to happen. 

I know I need to report him. I struggle with how I can realistically do it. I don’t think my fragile mental state can handle it now but the same will probably be true next year and the year after. I’m always in this “fragile mental state”. Do I move on and act like it didn’t happen? Or do I suck it up and do the right thing? Ah but then the guilt I will feel if I report him. The guilt will overwhelm me. 

I know I need to talk to a real therapist but I’m scared to trust again. I can’t even imagine sitting in a room alone with a man. But even a female I feel guarded.

In addition to this, I work with \*mya\* and we share all of our friends. I'm hurt and don't know what to think of the whole ordeal. I still have love for \*mya\* but never want to see \*mya\* again.

380,"Like the title says, in a couple of weeks I'm moving across the state to college. I've lived at home with my parents and brother all my life up until now. Don't get me wrong, I'm definitely going to miss them, but my issue is more that I'm leaving my 11 y/o dog and 2 y/o cat. Unlike my human family, they won't know why I've abandoned them and I'm so distraught about this. My dog is v attached to my mom so I'm less concerned that he'll worry too much, but my cat follows me everywhere and is always with me. I don't want him to think I did this because of him. I realize this is probably dramatic, but it means a lot to me.... does anyone have any advice on how to feel better about this?

Note: I can't visit in between start/end semester because my mom is immunocompromised and I would hate to accidentally bring anything back to her.",14Aug2020,1
381,"So I just started my first full time job and it’s going really well. Everyone is super nice and helpful and I genuinely enjoy my time there. However, when I get home I feel awful. I think a big part of it is that I feel guilty for not spending as much time with my family, though they are super supportive of me having the job and don’t say or do anything to make me feel guilty. It takes up a lot of what used to be free time and that also upsets me, but I didn’t always make the best use of that time so I though working would be a good thing to do. 
I also end up going down this rabbit hole doubt about whether I’m good enough, if people like me etc... but I’ve never been given any reason to believe otherwise. 
I could just really use some advice because like I said, I really enjoy my job when I’m there. I’m just confused because that’s not carrying over to when I’m at home. Is it something I should continue with if it has this effect on me?

387,"My friend (20f) studies in a different city but is back with her family because of Covid. I’ve known her for five years now and over the years anytime she had bruises she blamed it on a fight with her younger brother and laughed it off, or made excuses about having to study as to why she couldn’t hang out with us, etc. 

She told me last night about just how physically and verbally abusive they both are towards her. 
She still tried to laugh it off and defended them to an extent. 

A few examples:-

1) When her tuition teacher touched her inappropriately when she was in middle school, she told her mom who told her to shut up, and when she told her dad he beat her up, changed her entire wardrobe, shamed her, AND DIDN’T EVEN FIRE THE TEACHER. They just made sure that he didn’t sit near her (The teacher quit after a few months because she didn’t sit next to him).

2) Her younger brother asked her about periods and when she was talking to him about it, her mom got mad at her, threw the food she made and broke a plate over my friend’s head. 

3) She came home late because of a farewell party (we were finishing high school) and they got mad at her for it and didn’t talk to her two entire months. We had important exams coming and the stress was piling on. They talked to her the night before the exams because our teacher called them up saying that this behaviour is not doing her any good. 

—

She told me she was being beaten up every day for two years straight (Age 13-15). Sometimes her father hits her without any reason. She’s been beaten up with almost everything you can imagine. Her father has also said at many occasions to her mother to take her away or “he’ll kill her.”

Her brother, thankfully, isn’t abused like that (or as much) but she is. 

I no longer live in the same city but I did offer to help out by calling the police or child protective services, but her family has a hold over them and would do nothing. Calling the authorities isn’t an option at all. 

I’ve even suggested going to live my family who live near her but she said that it wasn’t necessary. 

The country we’re from, living with your parents is seen in high regard. In fact if you don’t stay with your parents, you’re considered to be ungrateful by many people in the society. 

Nothing has happened during the lockdown but I’m very worried about her. Given the stories I heard, they don’t need a reason to hit her. 
She said that’s she’s fine and that she keeps to herself all the time. To the point where she only comes out to eat food (they don’t even check up on her about it). 

How can I be there for her and help out? The most we can do is talk on the phone, have video calls, etc. How should I approach this topic with her? How should show that I’m there for her for anything she needs?",14Aug2020,1
388,"I'm an 18yr old female who had just graduated highschool (w honors!!), and I am VERY unsure what to do with the upcoming years ahead of me. I'm very proud of graduating because I've suffered with depression, a toxic family and anorexia and never thought I would make it to 18 alive. I need advice as to what to do next. 

Backstory:

I grew up with an EXTREMELY racist father and immigrant mother, as a mixed queer girl that watched my father side with the oppressors, himself being racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and an emotional manipulator. My mother stays with my father bc they have 5 children together (incuding me) and she'd have no way of taking care of us all by herself.

I've had to spend my childhood cooking, cleaning, and taking care of my siblings since I was 13 because my mother worked full time while my piece of shit father layed in bed for months scrolling through Facebook, yet still controlling her. 

Lower-class poverty has always been my norm, and my dollar tree christmases were never good, and I always felt like shit for getting a few more dollars spent on me. I was ostracized by my peers for not being like them, but I wasn't given the gift of being in normal circumstances like they were. My family has been nothing but unloving and toxic, and I have been given enough hardships to last a lifetime so I made a pledge go myself to be different than my parents and to my siblings. I love my siblings with all my heart and would do anything to help them. If I help myself, i could help them.

I have problems seeing myself as ungrateful and useless, things my parents often tell me. And when trying to apply myself to something I want to do, I'm often discouraged and reminded that I've never been enough.

I've been reading things about the national guard and I think that might be the solution to my problems. I have no money for college due to not being unable to work bc I watched my siblings all the time, and almost no structure in my life. I know I don't fit the bill at all. I'm a female, 4'11, 125 pounds, queer and a liberal. If I join I feel as if I'd be ostracized just as I was in school, but also the fear of being taken advantage of. 

But I think the positives outweigh the negatives, I'd get 100% of my tuition and fees paid for at my state school (my dream school), housing money, structure, stability, and if I help myself out and get a car and save up for an apartment, I can let my siblings live with me and I could take care of them until they go to college (they are 2 and 1 year younger than me). I feel like a long-term dedication to something more than myself is the only real way of healing and I think it has to be this. I try very very hard to be postive, and consider myself to have an overall postive outlook on life but in the environment I'm in it's hard.

If I were to join the national guard I'd be able to have a normal college experience, meet other people like me, study towards my dream of being an artist, and have something to be proud in.

I need advice as what I should do, should I join the national guard? When should I do it, maybe sooner the better right? If you have any advice as to what I should do to make my situation better pls, comment.",14Aug2020,1
389,"I just can't get hired; the people who look at my resume apparently decide I'm not worth the time, and the ones who message me CLEARLY haven't read my resume and end up wasting my time. Example... I had an interview recently. I wore business casual, as per the email, and used all the ~Internet tips~ in my interview. Also, the ONLY other person there to interview was in jeans and a tee shirt. The interviewer clearly hadn't read my resume, as he asked what my last job was. I informed him that I haven't had one yet, and he said that he ""was hoping for someone with experience"" and ended my interview *three minutes in.* COMPLETELY wasted my time and effort (and his own, too!) just because he didn't bother to even skim it.

I know it's hard to get a job right now, but I really want to go to college in a different town (my town sucks) and need to start putting money away to move. Also, I can't get unemployment because I haven't had a job previously.

390,"I’m wondering if anyone can give me advice about being ok with not having a boyfriend? I’ve never had one, and I don’t see it happening. Before anyone says “OP fix your self esteem and love yourself first” I do love myself, and I’m proud of who I am, I just don’t see myself getting a boyfriend. 

I never had any dates in high school, not even to school dances, and no one has shown interest in college. When I finally decide to put myself out there in college, my friend introduced me to a guy who I thought was cute, and he rejected me within two seconds by walking away after I said hi to him. I want to stop thinking about the possibility of loving someone and them loving me back, bc it sometimes hurts me to think about how that probably won’t happen. 

Many of the guys in high school told me I wasn’t cute, and that hasn’t changed much in college, so how do I move on and accept that I probably won’t be in a relationship? I know some of you may think it’s negative to predict this, but guys have never shown interest, and college hasn’t been better boy wise for me either. How do I accept that I might live life without a partner, and move on from the idea of a relationship?

Btw: I don’t have trouble making friends and keeping good friends in my life, I feel very supported by those close to me.",14Aug2020,1

392,"Not sure if this is really necessary here but it's better than asking anyone in my Discord messages.

A little time before my birthday (25 July), my mother sat me down and told me the situation. A lot of the PC's that could handle the games that I want to play *(or really could handle Discord, Chrome, and other programs at the same time for that matter)* are a little pricey for her taste. I could either get a new PC now and spend anything below 1000USD (her budget), or wait for a better deal when Black Friday arrives. I told her I could wait, me not knowing when Black Friday comes. I know know it's in November.

So here's what's happening: I have a laptop that's about **7 years old** and can barely handle Minecraft with no external programs running at the lowest settings, fully dusted out. I'm not necessarily happy with it due to it's age and **dead pixels I have on the display** I've never told her about.

I've been thinking about that new PC everyday for what feels like an eternity, and I'm not a perfect person so I'm a little impatient with my laptop at times.

So my question is: *Should I convince her to buy me a new PC now, or wait until Black Friday?*

393,"So I’ve been dealing with a LOT this year, I’m well known by my friends for not really talking about things that are going on, I tend to try and help everyone else with their own issues and never make time for my own, it’s only really since the middle of last year that I’ve felt confident enough to actually talk to them about things that I’ve been through after they all told me that I could trust them. However. This year I made a new friend, she fit well with our group and we got close and she became someone who I would go to for advice. She always asked how I was and I did the same to her. About a month ago she had a small get together with drinks and at some point it got a bit more dark and they started discussing shared trauma. I already didn’t feel too good, I had a lot on my plate. So I stayed out of it while they all talked. She noticed I wasn’t inputting and asked me to share. I didn’t want to. They all asked me to share. I didn’t want to. I had a panic attack. They all backed off but said if it’s causing me pain I should share when I’m comfortable. So I took one of my oldest friends aside and told her that I felt I had too much in my head to pick one thing to discuss. 
Cut to 2 weeks later and half of our group start ignoring me. I ask the girl I recently met what’s going on. She sent me a very very extensive message about how I’m toxic and I only talk about myself and I’ve upset some group members by saying “my problems are worse than yours”. She said I have to accept it and I can’t defend myself because that would be making people feel bad for me. She said I needed to grow up and learn that other people have problems and I need to admit that I’d been a dick. 
This made me feel awful, I felt backed into a corner like I couldn’t say anything other than apologise for the things I hadn’t done. With everything I already had going on it threw me completely out of it and I had multiple small breakdowns. I was embarrassed and hated myself. Until my best friends both told me I’d done nothing wrong, I explained the situation from my perspective and they said she was simply saying things that she knew would hurt me to claim my spot of “supportive mum friend” in the group. 
I’ve made peace with everyone that I “hurt” and I was working up the courage to face her, the thought of talking to her made me panic, I still felt like I couldn’t say anything to her after what she said about me. And then I find out she’d blocked me on everything because I “took too long to respond” and was clearly “wallowing in the drama”. I feel even more horrible about everything that’s happened and I don’t know what to think. Is she right? Am I toxic? Or is she trying to manipulate me and my friend group?",14Aug2020,1

395,"Hi I keep struggling. 

I don’t really know where to go with this at all.
I’ve been struggling for a few years with a trigger that’s been normalized a lot because well, it’s marijuana.
A few years back my (16f) boyfriend (16m) was struggling with depression and turned to marijuana to deal with these problems. The thing is i didn’t like it, and he wasn’t of legal age anyway. It was all around bad. So he tried to hide it from me, didn’t work. It’s been a few years now, my boyfriend ended up in inpatient therapy.  But i never got over it. And just before he went he told me he lied about it again. If the worry from him attempting to commit suicide wasn’t enough i was also living with the realization he’d lied again. I don’t want to over explain it but i still get so much anxiety from the mention of it, a joke, a song, even just a post like this. I don’t know what to do. I don’t have the money or insurance for therapy, the only access i could find was through my school, but corona hit before i could really talk to them about anything, and at that point my boyfriend was in a mental hospital so my worries focused on that instead. I thought it was something i could live with but last night i had a dream about it and I’ve had the worst anxiety all day. It’s like it just happened all over again. I can’t eat, i can’t stay calm, i feel like i can’t even function. I constantly have fear he’s off smoking again and i have no clue. I’ve had this terrible feeling in my stomach every time it’s mentioned and now all day again. I know he wouldn’t do it, and that he’s so much better now, but i can’t shake this feeling.

2. More hours at work ($13 hourly/$1800 saved up) to pay for my classes, my mother said she would go half and half with me, my classes would be around $3k split between us.
3. Work for a few years after graduation while setting up an emergency fund (3 months of living expenses in a HYSA) and putting the rest away to save for school so I can go back later for the thing I'm passionate about, its also worth mentioning that my city has a low cost of living.

401,"So basically, my girlfriend(26F, bisexual, we'll call her Jess) and I(25M) have been dating for about 1.5 years. At the very beginning of the relationship we had a conversation about how sexually open we were. We both agreed that group sex and any other new sexual experiences that come our way are welcome; however, we still have not done anything out of the ordinary at this point.

Her best friend(26F, also bisexual, we'll call her Sara) is very sexually open and she is known by the friend group for being obsessed with anal. During that conversation we had that I mentioned above, Jess asked me what sort of sex I'm wanting to have. Of course, being a typical man, I said anal and threesomes. With all previous girlfriends I still haven't had the opportunity for either one. But this is where she got me...when I said anal, she just casually said, ""Oh, well I'm not trying to do anal very much, so maybe Sara let you fuck her in the ass?"" 

Anyway, so Sara lives hours away, so I've only ever met her a few times. There was a lot of people, including Sara's family around. 

But next week, Sara is coming to visit us for a few days. Jess has already casually mentioned that Sara will be sleeping in our room with us instead of on the couch. She said, ""I know the couch won't be too comfy, you know?"" But our couch is notoriously comfy and huge, and Sara is very small.

It's also worth noting that Jess almost explicitly watches threesome porn.

Here's my questions:
1. Am I dumb, or do you think I'm right?
2. Assuming I'm right, how can I make sure this goes down smoothly, and what sort of advice do you have for someone experiencing either anal or a threesome for the first time ever?

He just told me he follows a bunch of porn subs on here and that he tends to use them to get off. While this upsets me it’s not even the worse part.

It has been almost 48 hours since I have heard anything from her whereas in the past we would never go more than 12 hours without messaging the other person.

Her reddit account is quite new and she only uses reddit to talk to me so I can't check her activity or whatever since she saw a random post of mine and reached out to me. We don't know each other in real life but we have the other person's gmail account which I have tried to reach out to. She is 28 and lives with a crazy BF who she says she has to keep our reddit friendship a secret from and sometimes just hangs up because her BF comes near her or something. I hope her crazy BF didn't do something to her, we were talking normally when she suddenly just stopped replying altogether and she has not replied to my messages since. I think she is in trouble, but I can't do anything about it, I don't know where she stays (only her country), I don't know her handphone number even though we talked about exchanging them but did not get down to it. I just wish there was something I could do. 

I am frightened for her safety because there is no way she would stop replying me and scared that I will never get to talk to her again.

The day that school ended for me my family had a drive by graduation where they all drove by my house with balloons and signs. It very wonderful and I had long conversations with each person over the phone from my mom and dad's sides.

That was three months ago now and I have started to look more towards my future and trying to make the best of my current situation.

Yesterday, my dad informed me that he still wants me to have a graduation party within the next four months. But, suprisingly, I realized that I've done a full 180 about throwing any kind of celebration. Now that I have been back home for these past few months, I've started to become very annoying by the way that family acts or the way that I am forced to act around them. I don't feel like I can really be myself or I'm constantly on edge that a fight with start or that I will feel obliged to pretend that I'm having a great time when I really just wanted to spend a chill night with my friends, who because of their beliefs, my family will not like to be around. I'm very different than the rest of my family. As much as I love them, my personalities compared to theirs just clash so much. Not to mention, just thinking about how sad I was for all those weeks just makes me upset again.

When I told my dad that I just wasn't comfortable with having a party of any kind,  he completely ignored my feelings and said that this is what the family wants and me not allowing them to celebrate for the second time would be selfish. I asked if my feelings matter, he replied that I should be more open to it. It won't hurt you and you will enjoy it when the time eventually comes. I asked him if we could wait until next year when there would be no question of someone getting a life threatening and by then I would gotten a new place and had plenty of distance from these rough couple of months and our relatives, but he wouldn't hear that either. If you didn't catch on, my parents are divorced and it was a nasty one, so I'm not sure why they think that they can plan a party together when they can't go one day without arguing.

At this point, it doesn't feel like a party for me, but one for them. I'm so confused about what to do that I googled reddit advice and created a reddit account. Again, I know that I sound like a terrible person, but I would like some advice on how to get them to understand how I feel without them just saying that I'm being dramatic and that I'm trying to hurt them. At least some validation for my anxiety and sadness about having to relive some of the saddest times in my recent years while being forced to be the center of attention.",14Aug2020,1

414,"So me and my friend have known each other for a year now. We clicked really well and practically have our own language according to people. Safe to say we are very close. For the past 2-3 months she has been very off and secretive, more specifically this past month. Since I’m not working (Furlough) I spend a lot of time at home. We used to always make plans to meet up and hangout and do stuff together. But this stopped abruptly. Whenever I mentioned doing something she would be busy or ignore the request and talk about something else. Whenever it comes to her plans I am down and make the time for her. I make it clear that we need to always make sure our communication is solid and she can trust me to tell me anything. In the past she shuts down and doesn’t tell me things to and I quote “avoid conflict”. I agree that I do react and don’t think at first but when she said this she was referring to a comment I made about a friend of ours I stopped talking to (he was being a huge dick to me and it began to bother me tremendously). This friend also made a very racist/colorist comment about black women that bothered me to the core and I texted her and told her how problematic and effed up he was. She ended up ghosting me when I sent her that text for three days. Only reason she talked to me was because we had a road trip planned and paid for. When I asked her why she did it and why she ignored me she said that she didn’t see his comment as a big deal. I am an Afro Latina woman and her not seeing a problem with his comment was a slap to the face. I decided to move forward from her problematic comment and make peace with it. 

Fast forward to my departure (leaving for work in different state) while at the airport she tells me she has something she has kept from me. I already had a feeling she was seeing this old friend of ours, I had seen her texting him and hanging out with him on Snapchat. But again, I chose to ignore it because hey she’s my friend and she matters more than some simpleton. Well she tells me she is seeing this guy. She said “we are taking, idk”, I said “I knew it, I just knew it”. I add “you know how I feel about him, if you guys get married I am not coming to your wedding”. I had to stop myself and regather my thoughts, I apologized and said “listen do what’s best for you, you know how I feel about him and that’s not going to change but if he makes you happy it is what it is and my opinion doesn’t matter”. She doesn’t say much, we hug, and I leave. Today I felt so bothered by all of it. After processing what had occurred.

 I called her at 7pm to show her my new place and she didn’t answer, said she was driving. She mentioned at the airport we should make more time to call each other so I can show her around and we can catch up. I had a feeling she was at his place, a couple hours later I check her location (we share it for safety purposes) and she’s at his place. She has time to text but not time to answer a FaceTime (this is an ongoing thing). 

I am honestly checked out of our friendship. I lost a lot of trust and don’t feel like the friendship is doing me any good mentally. She is a good person but as of recently has not been the best of friends. I don’t know what to do other than explain to her how I am feeling and go from there.... I also feel like if the person who’s supposed to be like your sister is unable to share things with you out of fear of conflict than maybe then friendship is not as solid as y’all make it out to be. I just want some advice on how to proceed and if anyone has experienced anything similar, I could really use some advice...",14Aug2020,1

417,"Context: there's this girl at my college who I don't really know (I just know her name and that she's on my course) and I'm really, really into her. Stunning is an understatement. A few months ago (March/April) after an exam I tried talking to her at the bus stop to try and get to know her. With minimal response to my questions and later putting on her headphones, I figured she must not be interested in me. She seems nice but she already has some male friends so maybe that's why she might not be interested. Idk if she has a bf or not but if I'm going to guess then she probably does (although I have no evidence to support that)

When colleges reopen in September, should I try to talk to her again and see if I get anywhere? Or should I just assume that she still isn't gonna be interested in me just like the first time and accept failure while I thirstily check out the perfect looking girl wishing I could be with her?",14Aug2020,1

At some point I snapped out of it, and pulled myself out of the bath, forcing myself to throw up 3 or 4 times until I had nothing left to heave.. I've dealt with suicidal depression almost half of my life, and I've gotten extremely close before as far as ideation and planning go, but I've never actually attempted. In all the previous cases, it was brought on by an episode of intense panic, dread, and hopelessness. I'll admit I wasn't feeling my greatest today (I was drinking to deal with it) but it didn't feel like anything more than my usual dose of self loathing and fear. The decision was kind of spontaneous.

421,"On mobile, so sorry. 

I know that teachers are not allowed to tell students who to vote for or go on a political rant about who they hate or praise. They can only suggest and recommend to vote and that's it. 
I want to know if it's the same for anyone else in the same authoritative position (doctor, therapist, etc.)
I'm in physical therapy at the moment, and my therapist usually helps me do exercises. They started a conversation about if i was going to vote for a candidate and after i expressed my disinterest to vote for the person, they were confused and demanded to know why, saying the person was great and was doing a great job. After waiting for me to list reasons of my dislike, they rebutted and said very racist and cruel things that basically wished harm on minorities. 
I thought they were joking in the beginning, but as they continued to be serious and insisted, I was really uncomfortable. I still have no idea if that was actually real because of the cruel things they said.
This obviously was a very awkward and uncomfortable situation and continued even when i tried to shut down the conversation by stating we both had our own opinions and i wasn't interested in politics at all. 
Can they do that? Is it passing a boundary of patient/PT relationship or is it just ethically wrong. 

Also, I'm sure it's obvious who this is about, but I'm not trying to get into another political debate. I just personally am uncomfortable with someone trying to make me see why their candidate is the best choice and make my reasonings (that they asked for!) seem worthless.",14Aug2020,1

I’ve been talking to this guy online in voice calls with other online friends when we play games together or just talk about life. 

Once we talk privately we mainly talk about dating, tinder, mental health, how it sucks to be single, our exes etc.
It’s also common for us to joke sexually within our group with no intentions.

Yesterday me and this guy spoke privately over text and I thought we were just being our goofy selfs joking sexually. Until he pulled out he’s horny and I thought hey well, we both single and miss that feeling with another person. I didn’t think he had a thing for me or liked me because of our topics we always talk about.

So we texted, didn’t send any pictures or anything like that. Just simply sexting that was neither more pushed by me or him it was very mutual. 

He later had posted on his story that he’s been used and abused............yeah.
I commented on this and he apparently has a thing for me now and because I don’t look at him in a romantic way and want to potentially move forward on this, potentially a relationship I’ve now “sexually exploited him” and messed with his feelings and made him feel useless and a “simple sorry won’t do it”, we live in different countries and we are not even each other’s types.

I’m afraid he will make it really weird in the rest of the group.. I’ve tried being nice and understanding even if I think it’s absolutely ridiculous and cringe.. it was literally just sexting for like 40 min..

He eventually goaded me into sending him some lewds (essentially nudes but clothed). I didn’t really want to but i did anyways. The next day i told him outright that i wouldn’t do it again because he and i don’t know each other well but i wouldn’t be opposed to sending some after he and i have known eachother better. He reacted well and said he didn’t want to make me uncomfortable and that it’s a win win because he gets to know me better and he gets pics.

From then on the day goes pretty normally and we talk and watch shows together for 6 hours. Throughout the day he would comment on my body and i made sure to remind him of what i told him the previous day. Everything was fine until towards the end of the call. I started getting texts from my best friend and he started to get controlling. Asking me who i was texting every time i picked up my phone. I told him it’s nothing, just my friend. Then he started to get quiet and cold. Sulking even though he told me he was texting this girl who was constantly flirting with him (he ended up blocking her because he was tired of it.) Eventually we both get in bed as we usually do and he’s still quiet and reserved. 

I made a couple jokes about how he was having an attitude and he was upset. He then said he wasn’t upset which escalated to him yelling. Eventually i calmed him down and we settled into silence. After about 5 minutes he drops this bomb on me. Says “i think we should stop talking.” I asked him why and he said it’s because i don’t want to hurt you. I tried to get him to explain more saying i’ve been hurt by much worse and he said it didn’t matter. Eventually he just said “i’m just gonna go” and hung up on me with no explanation.

436,"Hey, guys. Sorry, the title is probably a little confusing.

I met my roommate, James, a few years ago. We were roommates during freshman year of college, and we just got an apartment together for sophomore year with 4 other friends. In the first semester of freshman year, last fall, James’s older brother committed suicide. He’s been suicidal for a long time. James became deeply depressed. He stopped going to classes, stopped waking up, and just lied in bed and slept for around 20 hours a day. This was new behavior and went on for the rest of fall semester (he dropped out of classes.)

James cried on my shoulder multiple times about this, even telling me that I reminded him of his deceased brother. I believe him without a doubt.

James went back to classes in the spring and had a good semester. He also got a job and worked hard.

A few weeks ago, James’s stepdad died in a car crash. James is obviously devastated and depressed again, but he seems to be coping better and is still taking classes in the fall. James opened up to me, one of our other roommates, and my girlfriend, Emma, last night, about the details of his stepdad’s death. He cried about how devastated his mom is. Once again, I have no doubt that James is telling the truth. I can’t remember him ever lying to me, and this would be one fucked up lie.

He also brought up a huge new curveball that none of us expected: His brother faked his death last year and reappeared in July. He told us details of how his brother faked his death (visiting his fiancée in another country and sending home fake ashes, seemingly getting his fiancée in on it to deceive the family.)

Emma acted very empathetic throughout this conversation, until today. Today, Emma went home to her family and texted me something along the lines of, “My parents think it’s a little suspicious that his fiancée somehow had the right to have him cremated and they could send ashes across the border to James and his mom. Also, he asked us not to mention it to his mom or girlfriend. That’s kind of suspicious. Something doesn’t add up with James’s story.”

I am disgusted for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the “plot holes” are easily dismissed: The box probably wasn’t labeled “human ashes,” and, in their trauma, James and his family probably didn’t look into the legality of the cremation; James’s brother was somewhat estranged from the family for a long time before this. And of course he doesn’t want us to bring this up to his mom or girlfriend; it’s awful and not nice to talk about.

Secondly, Emma has absolutely no right to discuss my roommate’s business with her family as gossip to try to poke holes in. I’m absolutely appalled.

Emma is on vacation for a few days. I told her tonight, after this conversation, that I don’t want to talk to her. I said that I’m disgusted by what she said, and I said that she’d be furious if I said the same things (suggested that they were lying about severe trauma) about one of her best friends.

This all leads me to my question: Am I overreacting? Did Emma bring up a reasonable point, or was she out of line to try to dissect James’s life? I feel that it was unacceptable, and I am PISSED to say the least.

TL;DR: My roommate/very close friend underwent severe family trauma. My girlfriend discussed it with her family and told me that she thinks he might be lying and asked for my thoughts. I told her I don’t want to speak to her. Am I being dramatic?",14Aug2020,1

439,"UK results day for GCSEs is coming up this month and I'm scared. After seeing everything about A-level students getting lower than expected grades, I can only imagine that it will be the same for GCSEs. If that's the case then I've truly fucked up my life. Throughout my entire life I have been lazy and unmotivated. I always made bad choices and now that's just coming back to haunt me. I only need grade 6s in Maths and English for one course at college, the rest I need 5s. I only expected to get dead on a 6 at most but now everyone is being told to lower their expectations. I don't have any room to expect less. If I don't get the grades I need then I have failed. I don't want to resit because I know that I'll either be pushed to next year's classes or I will be pressured to catch up after the resits which will just make things worse for me. I already have no value as a person because of my shitty choices in life but I will be completely and utterly useless if I fail. I don't have a backup plan, I have never had one. I have nothing to fall back on because all my life I was convinced that I would get every thing I need and wanted, let's face it, that's not a big thing to be convinced about considering 6s are only average. I would literally have no reason to even live if I fail, I've never felt this bad before. I sound like I'm depressed but I'm not diagnosed so clearly I'm just being dramatic or some shit but seriously, I refuse to live doing crappy 9 to 5 jobs. I refuse to live knowing that I wasted all of my potential. I mean, I only have one person to live for anyway, my girlfriend. I'm not that great though so she would get over me if worst came to be. She says that she would still love me if I failed and worked crappy jobs and had no value but I really doubt it. She is a top level student, even if she got lower than she expected she would do amazing. She deserves better. I mean, what even is the point of living if you know that every one will be better than you? What's the point in living if all you are is wasted potential?

I have so many hobbies or interests I wanna pursue, like writing, programming, editing but I have to live with the fact that I'll never be confident enough to strive for them and make it somewhere. I promise myself that I'll do something productive each day, like work out, learn something, extend my knowledge, anything but the shame of failing at those simple tasks each day deteriorates my mental state more than ever. I am genuinely interested in so many subjects at school, but never actually make an effort to do the work necessary to be good at them. My parents assure me that I need to study what I love, and that not everyone is perfect but I can't even do that. 

I can't make anyone proud. I can't motivate myself to do things. I feel like I have no control over myself. I feel like a terrible person for being a disappointment and failing at things that I have no valid reason to fail at. Please help me. 

How can I motivate myself to do things?? How can I force myself to be productive? How do I fix any of this??",14Aug2020,1
441,"We've been friends for almost 5 years. We're both 17 and females. 
The thing that worries me, is that I think she's constantly depending on others for her happiness. It's like she clings to a certain person, and drains them with her problems, or taking them out on you by causing an argument. I love her, but it’s like she has too high of expectations from me. She just expects me to always be there, and when I’m not, she gets mad.

For an example, we hungout today until 6pm. She asked if after dinner I wanted to go out for a run. I really wasn’t feeling it, sometimes I like to have time to myself, because being around people too much can become tiring to me. So I told her I didn't really want to today. She got mad, and we had a huge argument. Around 7:30, she messages me asking if I want to go, when I didn’t message back for 5 minutes, she said she’s done, and she doesn’t think we should be friends. She phones me and explains in this whole rant that the reason she messaged me that is because she doesn’t know why I’m friends with her because I’m “such a good person” and how she’s shitty, she continued by saying that she feels guilty being my friend. Then she says if I want to stay friends, she'll be happy, but if not she would get it. 

She had a breakup 2 months ago with her ex bf, and she’s been devastated since, there’s never a hangout where she doesn’t rant about him. Before him, she was never really happy either, she’s always dwelled on things that make her sad instead of looking at the positive, and I feel like looking at the positive is hard for her. Her bf made her happy, but near the end, they were fighting a lot, and she was begging him to stay, he did for a bit, but then ultimately left. At the beginning of the breakup, she’d phone me up a lot crying, or when we’d hangout she’d cry, which was understandable, I’d listen and give advice when needed. 

So she also brought the breakup up, and said that she likes running because it’s something she does to better herself, and likes me going with because I’m the only person she really wants to hang with, and talk with while running. 

something I got from that is that she’s expecting me to always be there to make her happy. Even when I really don't feel like hanging out. And I feel bad for saying this, but it can be emotionally draining, and somehow her sadness always has a way of bouncing into me. 
Also, I feel like this isn’t healthy for her, because I think that to be happy, you have to be happy by yourself, not because of someone else, and you have to be able to believe in yourself and actually believe that you can be happy. 

We also hangout almost everyday, and we don't have a ton of other friends, So that might be a reason as to why she widely depends on me.

And the thing is that I’m not sure she’d do the same stuff for me that I do for her. Last year I went through this really dark time, I ended up getting grounded for a month, and my parents really hated me at that point and I hated myself. After I got ungrounded, I tried talking to her about it, and she would listen a bit, but then change the subject to one of her problems that she’s faced when I was gone about some boy, or how hard it was without me. 

I started cutting myself with scissors, then razor blades, but on my hips so no one could see. I never told anyone about it. I stopped myself a few months ago, but when I finally had the courage to tell her I was even doing it, she told me that she’s done it too, but with rulers or her finger nails, then she started crying because her ex bf helped her through it. So I comforted her and listened.

So I'm just really confused right now, and I'm not quite sure what to do about it all.",14Aug2020,1

I purchased a Nutribullet on Amazon but received a Breville Active Blender. The order was fulfilled by Amazon so I am surprised by the mixup as I only order this way for my safety. I am confused though because when I check the Breville item on Amazon its weight (1.7kg) is totally different to the Nutribullet (2.6kg) and the weight on the package says 2.6kg. Am I stuck with this item or can I return/replace for the blender I ordered?

447,"Hi redditors,

As many on this subreddit, I desperately need advice on how to deal with my current situation.

Here’s a little background before I tell you what’s happened. I’m a 21F staying for a few days with my brother (12M) while the parents are away (I moved out a year ago). So me and my brother are super close, I love him with my whole heart, and he trusts me the most out of our family members. Having said that, I know him pretty well, and I can tell when he’s not comfortable. Our parents are divorced and both of them are manipulating and sometimes toxic, but that’s not really relevant in this story. Our grandparents live in another country and occasionally we Skype. Our grandpa is the most amazing human being, and our grandma is kinda toxic and super self-centered but we’re kinda used to it at this point. 

So here’s what’s happening. Me and my brother decided to arrange a Skype call with our grandparents. Everything was going great, out of us two I was the one doing the talking for the most part, because I know that my brother is not a huge talker and I didn’t want there to be any awkward silences. Although he doesn’t really like to talk much, he told them a couple of cool stories about his summer. Our grandma is really extroverted and she loves to talk. About 15 mins into the call, our grandpa went for a smoke and there were just the three of us left. So my grandma decided to ask my brother “So I see you don’t want to talk to us?” in a really passive aggressive manner. I asked her why the hell she’s asking him this, because there’s no right way to answer this question and not hurt anyone. I could see my brother getting upset (understandably so, imagine really putting an effort into something you’re not comfortable with and then being undermined like this). After that, she hung up. I texted her right after that we both love them very much, but this is not a good question to ask anyone. She said that she doesn’t like seeing her grandparents not being eager to talk, so I said that this was definitely not the case. Also, I mentioned that it’s a really manipulative question. After that, she blocked me on what’s app. 

Am I overreacting? How do I deal with this?

Any advise would be appreciated.",14Aug2020,1
448,"Hello everyone, please read it’s important. Sorry if there’s mistakes, english isn’t my native language.

Tuesday, I paid my landlord with the money I got from working. Yesterday in the evening, he called me to tell me that two of the banknotes (which combined makes 150€) were fake. It never happened to me before so I was very surprised and got them back. Now, I know that kind of things can happen to anyone, but there’s many details that I find extremely weird. 

1. I have no insurance these two banknotes are actually those I gave to him, so what makes me sure I actually gave him fake money ?

2. I gave him those Tuesday, and he supposedly directly tried to put them in his bank account, yet he called me only on Thursday, two days later, to tell me about it. Why waiting so long ?

3. In my country, once you give fake banknotes to a bank, they take them away and NEVER give them back. If he really went at the bank, then how could he be able to get them to give them to me ?

4. Weirdly, I still owed him 150€ from a previous rent from the previous month, and now all of the sudden this is this exact amount of money that his supposedly fake.

All these details combined makes it very hard for me to actually believe I was given fake money. Again, I know it can happen but all of the things I mentioned makes it very hard for me to think I’m wrong. I really feel like the landlord is trying to ""scam me"" into giving him fastly the 150€ that I still owe him and gave me two fake banknotes he owned to make me believe I paid him with them. I will go right now to a friend’s shop who might own a machine to detect if money is fake or not, so I’ll know for sure without risking to have the money taken away. 

Until then, I really need advice on the matter. Do you think that I am imagining things, or that all of this is really weird, like I do ?",14Aug2020,1

We hired loads of new people and a group of them would attempt to do backroom instead of their own job on shopfloor as its a little more laid back, this was okay at moments however now things are calming down there is one that is pretty much just going after me so they can be back there.

Their shift starts half way through mine and they linger about back room trying to out-do me, a manager notices occasionally and sends them out on the shopfloor, I finish before them and they then take over from me after i leave.

Prorblem is they get on with a lot of people and recently they have been talking behind my back or making snide comments about how they should be back their because people who work less hours are useless, all sorts of things il avoid mentioning becauae I dont want this to drag on.

I dont want to go tell a manager, it feels like such a petty thing and a manager can hardly stop somebody talking bad about me behind my back, it just stresses me out, I used to enjoy my job and i liked backroom but I feel like just going back to shopfloor but my manager will be disappointed as he needs me for the majority of hours the other person is not in.",14Aug2020,1

456,"For some background my girlfriend and me have been together for going on 7 years all the way back since highschool and we are now well into college. We both live with our parents still due to the financial situation we are in. I visit her house regularly and generally will stay over a few days then at my house then back and sorta come and go as I please. Her Dad works in the medical field and has been forced to test weekly for Covid-19. I had been over about 3 days and her dad is sent home early. Worse case scenario he has tested positive. Normal circumstances I'd have went home IMMEDIATELY however the night before I had sat right next to him during dinner and had a lengthy conversation with him about something. 

My reaction: Upon hearing he was infected my first thought was obviously to quarantine myself. I thought of doing this at home however the more I thought about it the worse the idea was. My mother works a fast food dead end job for little pay and my grandmother lives with us. Our house has one bathroom so regardless of how well I try to stay away from everyone there would be situations where theyd be in contact with something I was. My grandmother has many many health issues and basically checks every single box in the list of high risk factors for covid. This caused me to reconsider my options. I decided to quarantine at my gfs house instead. Her mother and father basically agreed to let me. I have started showing possible symptoms and think I've made the right choice but dont know what to do in relation with my job. I work retail and when I called to give them the info because I do not live where the person tested positive they are saying I have had ""casual contact"" and they need me to come into work.

457,"Hi,

I apologise beforehand if my English is bad. I'm in a pinch and I need advice. I've accidentally impregnated a girl I've been seeing for a while. She's pregnant for \~5 weeks now. I've decided that since I actually liked this girl, I wouldn't mind paying for abortion since both are not ready for a baby. Anyway, to cut the story short, she entirely blamed me for the pregnancy (the sex was consensual and she also knows I didn't have protection back then). She decided that its unfair that she had to suffer the pain and the pregnancy so she blackmails me into telling my family just so I'd be suffering as well. She has pictures of me half-nude (top half of the body but you can know it's me in my room) and also a picture of us together in my room.  

I live in a conservative country where it's illegal (depending on race) to have intercourse out of wedlock. So telling my family is a BIG no and I would actually be kicked out of the house if they know. I've sought advice from my lawyer friend and there's an actual law that states (I'm paraphrasing from my native language btw):

1. A girl who's guilty of pregnancy out of wedlock can be fined up to $$$$ and jailed not more than 2 years.

My friend said that I can counter her blackmail by giving her this, but I can also be charged with the same. So I'm afraid she will call my bluff. She also recently decided to not have abortion just out of spite and not because she wants the baby. She has a complicated family relationship so telling her family is not an option either. I completely am ready to take legal action if this situation worsens but I don't think I can charge her for blackmail since she's not asking for money. Should I  counter her blackmail with the law I've mentioned that could get her fined/jailed? Or do you have any other advice that I could work with.",14Aug2020,1
458,"i met this girl through a mutual friend in my group a few months back. we bonded pretty good and figured out we had the same interests in a lot of things. music, tastes, say stuff at the same time, etc. only issue is, she lives nowhere near me.

i have a theory where i think she might have a crush on me but can’t really prove it without asking her closest friend. if i do that then it’s awkward if i’m wrong and then i’ll have to find a new group of people because awkward situations don’t suit me. it also doesn’t help that long distance relationships leave kind of a bad taste in my mouth. i don’t think they work too well especially in my case due to how far this person is. but despite all of that i’d definitely still try.

i just can’t get past the fact of how cute she is. she’s weird but in a good way and funny all the time. she has none of the hyped up features that people like (ass boobs etc) but really she’s kind of skinny. i have no issue with that because i like her for who she is. but then there’s the concern that she doesn’t like me back and she’s just being friendly with me because we all hang out together as friends in discord. also i forgot to mention this girl has crushes on literally everything so who’s to say i’m not another crush to add to the list you know? AND ON TOP OF THAT she’s had guys in the past try to hit her line and get in a relationship with her and whatnot and has repeatedly said that they’re weird. how do i know she won’t see me as just another weird ass dude tryna get at her?

as much as i want to get past her and talk to other girls i can’t because she’s always in my head. i’ve NEVER been this corny and dorky about a girl ever. obviously it’s a sign of some sort but idk i guess i’m just lost.

One of my biggest fears and saddest thoughts is, is that I have worked for all I have, and I have no one to pass it down to, I'm an only child and my partner's siblings look like they're never going to have children for various reasons. I follow a lot of people online for years, who many have gone on to have kids, they're all in and around the same age as myself. I've had pregnancy dreams many times, and I generally love the feeling in a dream. It's always positive.

I'm 31, so I feel like time is limited. My hobbies/passions take a lot of  my time and are very important to me, I really enjoy my free time as well without being tied down (my biggest commitments right now are my dogs, but they're also tied to my work/passion/hobby too), but I'm also caught up on having to make the decision to have kids sooner rather than later.

460,"My current boyfriend is a single father to 3 children. His ex lives over 3 hours away and visits the children only a few times a year, and generally just does not care about their well-being. The children are 5, 8 and 9. The 5 year old has never been in school, can only speak a few words, and is not at all potty trained. The two older children have sever speech issues, and have hearing aids, but he never puts them in. From what I know, he has had the cops called on him multiple times and CPS is often at his door. This has happened twice since we have been together (less than a year). Here are all the incidents I can think of currently:

The two older children beat each other until they were bruised, teachers reported this to CPS

Bugs were found in the kids lunch boxes and water bottles (the home is bug infested especially in the kitchen) teachers reported this to CPS

A teacher was concerned that the children were being left alone when he was at work, CPS was called but found this report to be false 

Cops called by random bystander because he allowed his 8 year old to busk outside a gas station. He was shirtless, dirty, wearing no shoes, hair unbrushed with his pajama pants on inside out. He was playing a guitar he found at Goodwill, and he was using a broken beach pail to collect the money. By the time the cops arrived, they had left. But a gas station worker informed him of what happened. 

At a restaurant, while I was there, someone called the cops on us because of the way the kids were screaming

When he was with his ex someone called the cops on them at Domino's because of the rough way they were handling the children 

Someone called the cops because of the way he was handling the children when putting them in his car in a Walmart parking lot

CPS was called by a teacher at the school because the children are all unvaccinated, but he claimed religious exceptions (he's an atheist) 

There are more incidents but those are all I can think of right now. He NEVER allows CPS into his home. It's bug infested, filthy, filled with wild unfixed animals and completely hoarded. But he knows his rights, and he knows the children will be removed if he allows them in. Here are the issues I have personally observed:

He takes Ambien and gets extremely drunk to fall asleep every night, he usually goes to sleep at 4 AM and wakes up around 2 or 3 PM

The home has NEVER been cleaned in any way, it's hoarded with no floor space and trash everywhere

There are 4 unfixed cats, 2 unfixed dogs and a bird in the home (not cared for or cleaned up after)

The children have never seen a dentist, are all uninsured and do not go to any doctors appointments or receive any medical care

All of their teeth are rotting out, they drink XL sugary sodas from the gas station and candy daily

Their hair is never brushed, they are never changed into pajamas, their faces are often filthy and their clothes worn for days, they also rarely wear shoes/shirts even in public

They are yelled at 24/7 and spanked often 

On school days especially, they wake up 5 minutes before school starts, are often late, and HAVE NEVER eaten breakfast

I believe they are all underweight

They are all developmentally severely behind in all areas, they have no friends because he is aware CPS will be called by suspicious parents

He sleeps on the couch until 2 or 3 in the afternoon while the children run unsupervised around the house

Even when it is 100+ degrees, they are in a hot car with no AC for hours driving around

Their only outings/social interaction in life is Walmart and Goodwill

I originally believed the children were autistic, but now I think their developmental issues are due to neglect

While in school last year the 8 year old threatened to kill his teacher, bit them, tried to call 911 on the school phone, and then tried to run out of the building. This resulted in CPS at the door again, but sice they weren't let into the home nothing could be done. I am at a lose as to what to do in this situation. I am staying with him only to be able to save these children. What is the best way for me to build a fail proof case to have these children taken out of his ""care""?

i recently met a very kind girl, who shares quite a few interests with me, although we are very different in many ways. in fact, she almost seems to be the polar opposite of me, i'm a very cold, walled-off, yet open person, but she is a very warm and loving, yet closed person. but she opens up to me very well. she's gotten to know me quite a lot, and i very much have some feelings for her. but i just have this weird idea in my head that somehow this isn't what i want, that she isn't that ""ideal"" person i have waiting in my head. i should note that i recently got out of a narcissistically abusive relationship 6 months ago, and am still quite traumatized by it—i'm still processing some aspects of it. i've mostly moved on from the person, but the damage is still there. after that happened, i just feel like, what if i'm somehow drawn to abusive people? and that this person is so drastically different that it makes me uncertain?

it's very hard for me to connect with people, and often, weirdly i find that i connect with very ""internet-culturey"" edgy weird people like myself, and she, again, seems to be the exact opposite of that. it all feels very foreign, i've always been a (shudder) _misanthrope_ for most of my life, especially after escaping my recent abusive situation, and i've always connected with similar people. but she isn't that. i don't know, it's all so hard to describe.

464,"My professor is reporting me to student conduct because they found that a graph on my lab report was identical to another student’s. Since this class was online, we were all given the same set of data to analyze. I (wrongfully) figured that since everyone had the same data, it wouldn’t matter how it was graphed as long as we analyzed it independently. This is a one unit class and the graph ended up being worth only a few points.

I had trouble making the graph with the software we were instructed to use due to covid-related difficulties that affected my personal life and housing situation. I do not say this to make excuses, only to provide some context of the pressure I was working under. I have taken lab classes before where I was allowed to submit identical graphs as my classmates. The professor did not provide a grading rubric of the lab before it was turned in, so I did not know how the graph would be graded. 

My professor said they would be reporting me two weeks ago, but I have not heard from student conduct. I asked my professor if I could see the evidence they had, but that email was ignored. A week later, they responded to ask about minor details in the graph, presumably to get a confession from me. I have not responded to that email. 

Again, I am willing to take responsibility for this, and I understand how this is technically plagiarism. I should have clarified the instructions and made the graph myself, but it seems excessive that this could prevent me from attending graduate school or studying abroad.

This happened the other night. I live near a block of apartments for slightly older residents. I don’t really know anyone who lives in there by name as I’ve never met them properly, but I occasionally say hi when I walk past. 

Apparently a police officer went to these apartments the other night (you need a key code to get in) and visited a random lady there and woke her up. She freaked out thinking something awful had happened to a family member, and was surprised when he asked her if she knew “banana-fresh from number ____”. 

The lady (let’s call her P) said no, she didn’t know me, and why was he asking her about me? He claimed that I was reported missing and he wanted to know if she knew anything about it. P got a bit upset with this guy because she was confused as to why he was waking her up when she had work early the next day, and asking her about someone she’s never met before. The policeman kind of just mumbled and left, and that’s when P decided to call my neighbour T (who I do know, and often speak to) and ask her if she’d heard about a girl called banana-fresh going missing. T got really concerned, so they went out looking for this policeman so T could hear what was going on for herself and try and get a bit more information. 

She said it took ages, but eventually they found him. He’d parked right up at the top of the road and round the corner, and T said it was as if he was trying to hide his car. 

She approached him and he basically said “oh no, banana-fresh isn’t missing, but someone who lives with her is.” I live alone in my flat, but I do have a boyfriend who comes over occasionally. T is actually friends with my bfs mum, and although the policeman didn’t give my bfs name, T put 2 and 2 together so now she’s really concerned, and tries to get even more information out of him but apparently he wouldn’t say anything else. Eventually, P said she was really upset that he’d woken her up and about how he was handling the situation in general.. (like if I really was missing or my partner was missing, why wouldn’t you come looking in my flat? Why would you go ask a random lady who I have no connection with about it?) P said she was going to call the non emergency number and put in a complaint about him, to which he responded “please don’t do that, I’m in enough trouble as it is.” 

Then he left. 

I found all of this out because T came to my door to check that everything was okay, and I was baffled as to why someone would think I was missing because I’ve not been going out due to COVID. There was also no reason for my bf to have been reported missing. 

I called up the non emergency number myself to see what the deal was, and the guy kinda just said “there’s no report of you being missing” and “this is a bit weird isn’t it”. He said he would let me know if he found anything out and I haven’t heard back since. 

I suffer with severe anxiety, amongst other MH problems, and I’ve been a paranoid mess for the last few days constantly checking my windows to see if there’s anyone out there. My initial thought was is it someone pretending to be a police officer? But apparently he was dressed in the uniform and had a police car too. What worries me is that he knew my name (didn’t mention my last name though) and knew my house number. I don’t know, I really don’t understand it and I need advice on what to do next? I’ve tried to follow up with the police but to no success. Any advice or thoughts on this would be appreciated.",14Aug2020,1

My bf and I have been together for almost two years but the past few months with Covid and both of our mental health declining I just don’t think we should be together anymore. We fight ALL the time like almost every time we talk but when we see each other the seks is amazing and so addictive. I’ve never had a guy make me feel the way he does. I’ve realised over time I’m not physically attracted to him and the personality I fell in love with isn’t the one he shows me now. Without giving away too many details so people can identify us, he is controlling, manipulative, lazy, “borrows” hundreds of dollars that he hasn’t paid back, doesn’t put in effort or do anything for my birthday, is selfish and super paranoid/insecure. I know it’s his mental illness getting the better of him but I just can’t cope anymore. Over the past couple of weeks he has gone through EVERY contact in my phone while I’m sleeping, blocked uni mates from my phone, brought his friends into our arguments and accused me of cheating (which id never do).

471,"Hello! 14M speaking.

Before a week, I would crush a 600 page book in 5-6 days. I loved reading and I always found a reason to read. 

I went on an excursion to a village (I didn't have time to read there). When I came back, it seemed that all motivation for reading was lost. I couldn't think about it.

I now spend the entire day talking with friends via Viber/Messenger/Instagram. I blocked myself from those apps, but I still don't find motivation in reading. 

IMO this isn't depression, because I don't feel disconnected from myself, I only lost interest in this one hobby. I still play Overwatch, Minecraft, chat with friends.

I was just thinking not to send him an invitation but I know he’s going to ask me why he didn’t get one and he already knows when it is since my other friends have mentioned it infront of him.

477,"My nan died this morning, I don't know what time, she's been dying for a while. She hasn't been well for some time. But I don't know too much about it because I haven't spoken to her in 2 years. My family ostracized me for coming out as bisexual publicly years ago and then we started to patch thing up. But I met and fell in love with a woman. When that happened everyone in my family (excluding my mum, dad and sister) cut me off completely. They didn't want to talk to me anymore, deleted me from social media and would interact with my son at family gatherings but not me. 

When that relationship ended and I met my now husband, the damage was done. I went to my neice's christening and noone would speak to me, it got to me so much that I had a panic attack and made an excuse to leave early. Later that year my husband (then fiance) and our kids went to my dad's birthday party and I tried to introduce him, but other than a simple hello noone would talk to us, and my grandad wouldn't even look at me.

I married my husband in a small ceremony with our parents and kids but noone in my extended family congratulated us, even my dad didn't seem like he wanted to be there. 

Then my nan got sick, I found out from my mother (who is divorced from my dad). My mother isn't even part of that family anymore but she knew for over a month before anyone told me. Any updates I got were through her weeks after anything happened. My dad and sister kept forgetting to tell me, but my sister always called my mum. 

Last week I got an instant message from my dad telling me nan was nearing the end and that I should call her. But I didn't see the message because I was busy. It wasn't until a few days later when my sister messaged me that I realised he had told me to call her before it was too late.

But my sister's message came when nan was put into an induced sleep. And I tried to contact everyone who I knew was going to see her, but noone would let me call. I wanted to say goodbye, apologise for everything, just so she could go peacefully without thinking we were in turmoil. But noone would let me call. 

I was too late.

I woke up this morning to a message from my sister asking if I had spoken to dad. And then over hour after her message I had a text from my dad telling me the news. I woke up to both sitting in my inbox and I was heartbroken. My mum called and spoke to me, my dad called my sister but he text me over an hour later. That was the final punch to the gut.

This feeling of remorse and guilt is eating away at me. But I don't know what to do. If I go to her funeral and everyone still ostracizes me I will break. If I don't go everyone will hate me even more than they already do. If I manage to patch things up with my family and I ever end up in a relationship with a woman again (doubtful but if anything happens in my marriage: divorce/widowed etc) then the cycle will repeat.

492,"Basically, here's my story. After three years together, my ex-boyfriend broke up with me pretty much out of the blue on July 18th. On July 21st we met up in person to talk a bit more about what went wrong and why he felt like he needed to break up with me so suddenly when we had been talking about moving in together in half a year and after he had told me he saw us getting married and having kids together in the future. He gave me very vague reasons, and when we were saying our goodbyes he told me he just needed to focus on himself and we couldn't be together anymore because he felt like we needed to go our separate paths. Then he added ""who knows, maybe in the future our paths will cross again and we will want to try it again"". I didn't like that comment at all, but I let it pass. After the 21st we went no contact. It was hard for me at first, since after talking to each other every day for three years, not talking to him was one of the most difficult things I have ever done. But I didn't text him or contact him in any way. I felt really proud.

Last Friday, however, he texted me. He told me he wanted to talk and catch up. We talked the next day, which was strange for me, and we talked about how we could re-establish contact little by little and see if we could try to be friends. I felt a little weird with it, but I went along. Then we talked about getting lunch together (we live 5 minutes apart from each other, which is difficult enough already) on Wednesday (two days ago). But I started to get confused again about my feelings towards him, because I still feel like I want to be with him, so I told him I couldn't go to lunch with him and that we should go no contact again for a while. He agreed and respected my decision.

When we talked last Saturday and we established we would try to talk again, he told me that he felt like he didn't want to lose me from his life, but at the same time that we couldn't be together because he had to prioritize his family (they're going through financial issues) and work on himself. I told him that he could've done those things with me in his life, but he didn't agree. So I didn't continue talking about it. 

I'm not sure how to feel. I still want to be with him, although he hurt me badly. I'm also not sure how long I can keep the no contact again, because I am doing much better about myself since we talked, and these next few days I have plans every single day, so I feel like I'm going to be distracted enough that if I talk to him again, I won't be so hurt like last time. Because when I talked to him this last Tuesday, I had spent the last two weeks alone, because everyone else was on vacation and I was stuck in my city alone. 

Anyway... So I wanted to know if there's any advice for me out there? I don't even know if I explained myself correctly or not... Thanks for reading all this mess.",14Aug2020,1

494,"Don’t worry I’m not suicidal, I just wish I had not been born.

Here are a few reasons:

* Physical
   * My  hairline sucks. I know it’s pretty trivial but I have spent years  trying to find a style I like and I can’t, and because of this I have  never felt attractive or handsome. A real confidence killer. In a way it  stops me from being the person I want to be.
   * No  matter what I do in the gym I don’t get stronger or fitter – I know the  theory behind physical fitness but I can’t seem to apply it to myself  (I got an A in my Strength Training class at Uni). I usually either  injure myself or plateau and I cannot get any stronger and I don’t know  why.
   * I have a small penis. Nuff said.
   * Besides  the miniature member I also have frenulum breve, which can make sex  painful for me. Because of this I am a bit scared of sex and have only  had it a couple times.
   * I’m somewhat short. Not a big deal but it doesn’t help.
   * I burn instead of tan, so I have a complexion approaching that of Edward Cullen.

To be honest the physical ones don’t really bother me too much on their own but it’s basically icing on the cake…

* Mental
   * No  matter how hard I try I can’t really improve at anything. Take sports –  I played a sport throughout high-school and even made it to a national  championship one year, although I was basically carried by my teammates  (and the best team in the state was disqualified that year so we  basically had a free route to nationals). I have not improved since I  was 16 besides some minor stuff. The state finals were televised, and we  were the butt end of some jokes online about how bad we were with some  prominent figures in the sport making fun us on Twitter. This manifests  itself in almost everything – I play a lot of video games but I can’t  find a way to improve, and not for a lack of trying. I have watched tons  of cooking videos but I still find ways to mess up even simple stuff  like steaks. And it’s not that improvement comes slowly, I literally  don’t know what I need to do to improve. I end up doing the same thing  over and over because I am not creative enough to find a different way.  This kills me because I used to think of myself as somewhat smart and  able to find solutions to problems, but clearly I am not.
   * I  am huge pussy. I shy away from confrontation and I am often scared to  talk to people who I think are “cooler” than me. I am probably the last  person you would want to be with in a dangerous situation because I  would be that one protagonist in a movie who runs away and gets everyone  killed in the process.
   * I’m  lazy af. I procrastinate all the time, and the rare occasions where I  do something productive only last a couple hours. I have basically been  sitting at home collecting unemployment and playing video games, waiting  for the school year to begin. I have no discipline and no mental  toughness. Everything I have in life is curtesy of my parents, I haven’t  really done anything myself even though I live on my own.
   * I  only have one real friend. I have a lot of people who I am on friendly  terms with, but nobody really wants to hang out with me and I am not  really close with anybody (besides my one childhood friend). After  reading this list, why would they?
   * Do I need to mention I’m a bit of a pessimist?

Ok so this all sounds bad but I have tried to think of some things I am good at too.

* Things that are good about me
   * I’m  pretty good with computers and I often do tech support for my whole  family. I have a lot of experience with a bunch of different software.
   * You  can’t tell from this but I am actually a pretty good writer. I have  written papers, from creating the abstract and doing the research to  creating the final draft, in under 5 hours and usually get a solid grade  on them. I don’t really enjoy writing though, or else it would make a  good career.

That’s all I can think of. I wish I could join the military but I have a medical condition that makes me ineligible.

I’m  not really sure what the point of this word vomit is other than for me  to perhaps find some catharsis in my issues. Don’t feel obligated to  upvote or comment, but if you do have some advice that would be  appreciated. Cheers!",14Aug2020,1

I talked to my sister about visiting, she said ""Yes please!!"" (she really relies on my visits, and she wants me to spend as much time as possible with the kids always). I bought a ticket for about a week and a half in the future, not wanting to buy any farther in advance as things are now fluctuating so quickly.

Welp, my ticket is for Monday, and they announced today that the UK is imposing restrictions on the Netherlands again because their case count shot up.

If I go, when I come back I have to self-isolate. That means I wouldn't be able to be near my partner for two weeks (I guess we'd have to find a way to split the house up, but it's a 1-bedroom, maybe a tent in the yard or I'd have to rent out a self-isolation accomodation). I could work remotely but I couldn't go to shops, gym, nothing. I'd be giving up my life for two weeks.

However, maybe two weeks isn't that much of a sacrifice in the grand scheme of things? My sister is afraid it won't open back up for the rest of the year, and I already have a plane ticket. Is she being unreasonable or should I start planning these weird next three weeks?",14Aug2020,1
497,"So to give you guys a full rundown of how I’m absolutely paranoid at my neighbor, we’re going to dial it back to the summer of 7th grade. Me and my family moved to the outskirts of town, not too far from a very small and quaint town with a name that a lot of people can’t pronounce. The area has a handful of neighbors that are nice, and one of them is my mom’s cousin. We live on the farthest side of the street that parts on a gravel road with 2 other houses, my family, the neighbor across the street, and right down the very end of the road is the main issue. Mr.C (Not his actual name for clarification) The short, chubby, late 70s man is the father and grandfather of the neighbors across the street and the owner of a giant chunk of land around the area. 

When we first moved in, I, at first wasn’t too fond of moving out of the old house. I just stay home, and I didn’t talk to any of the neighbors for almost a good year. I did get over that after awhile and became good friends with the neighbor kids. That lead to me meeting Mr.C, he and my mom met as she was renovating the house but I, being stubborn, didn’t want to really meet him. Soon, due to the sociality of the old man, I got to know him more and more, he came over more and more. 

The first, maybe 3 years, were ok with him, but as the months go by, he started to really get comfortable. He would come over unannounced, make suggestive jokes, and even give me money just for being “me”(?). He would give my sister a little bit of money but he mainly gave me money. He slowly but surely got more comfortable with coming over. Which at first, my family gave pity to him, having lost his wife and being a bit lonely, we would at least listen to him and he would get a cup of coffee for himself, but he became too comfortable even for my mom to bare.

A little side note: I don’t know how long he’s been doing this particular thing, probably a few years now, but he would sit in his son’s driveway in his old rickety truck for hours just chilling there.

The past 2-3 years, heck maybe even 4 years, he progressively gotten more and more suggestive with his jokes. Along with that, almost every time I would let the dogs out to go do their business, I’ll turn around and go do whatever I want to do and not even 3 minutes later, there he is, at the door or making his way across the yard. There’s been too many times where he will open the door, if I accidentally don’t lock the door, and yell for me or leave something on the table. Heck he’s even made it up the stairs one time and called for me while I lock myself in my room. He has made countless sexual jokes like, for instance, one time I was talking to a friend about wanting a furnished basement (I just think that’s absolutely awesome) and he says “Well I’ll know what you’re doing if I hear you yelling down there” suggesting to somethings that made me very uncomfortable. Every time I’m wearing a certain pair of shorts that has words on the backside, he makes an effort to say “what does that say? Cedar- what?” I’ve since then stopped wearing those shorts and make an effort to never have my backside turned towards him. When he gives me money, he always leans in real close and wad up the money in his hand and he whispers something along the lines of “get yourself something nice to eat”. Just recently he somehow got my phone number, I’ve never answered it, even if I did, I didn’t say anything and I would just immediately hang up so I don’t have to wait until it rings through. How did he get my number? How did I know it was his number? I told my mom there was someone who kept calling me and she said to grab my phone and she’ll call it on her phone, it showed up as Mr.C. How he got my number, my mom suggests that it was his grandchildren since I hung out with them years back, but I remember having a different number back then. This is just the very tip of the iceberg worth 6+ years of suggestive jokes and unwanted visitations and overall discomfort.

You maybe yelling at your phone telling me to get a restraining order, or tell him the fuck off. The thing is, my family is too nice, we can’t just tell someone to go get fucked like that. We’ve put up with him for years now and we just deal with it, even though we actively avoid him like the plague. As much as I’d like to take a Ruger and threaten him to get away from me, it’s just something I can’t do, we don’t like making a big scene out of things but these past few weeks- heck, months, years even - this paranoia and anxiety has been growing. The times that he calls me is too precise, one time he called me as soon as I got upstairs in my room after taking a shower. He comes out of nowhere when I let the dogs out- I don’t even let my dogs out for that long anymore because I’m so annoyed and scared that he might just come up out of nowhere and not leave. The gifts that he gives me, I don’t keep, the stuff animals, I’m scared that he somehow puts a camera or a mic inside of them. I know he’s old but he has a friend that lives in his shed that is a “tech wiz” and flies drones around, there’s been times where he said  “whenever you go swimming, holler for me and I’ll have Jeb fly the drown down and take some pictures”. I got special blackout curtains in my room just in case, I can’t even enjoy the nice country scenery or let some sun in the room because I’m scared that he somehow put a camera in the trees or he’s staring at me. It gotten to the point where I’m heavily considering moving out of the country to get away from him because I’m scared that moving towns or states won’t be enough. I’m considering get TOR in case he’s looking at my PC or even through the camera.

I need advice, help with how to deal with this messed up issue. Yes my mom and other immediate family members know what he’s been doing and yet they just kinda put up with him, but it’s gotten to me, it’s really gotten to me. Is there anything that I can do?",14Aug2020,1

505,"Hello all! I am 32 and trying to figure out what I want in life. As with many, Covid has thrown a wrench in my life. I was a bartender by trade for a long time that was finding himself wanting out of the business. When the job was taken away from restrictions I felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders. I finally had my excuse to get out of the business for a bit. 
As the days turned to weeks then to months I started to think of the next step. I love to write but I don’t have the attention span to do it. I am creative and have come up with fun premises that people enjoy. However, the thing that stops me is me. I feel like what I’m going to do is not good enough. I’m scared to fail so I take my legs out from underneath me. 
The past month I decided to sign up to be a WWOOFer. That is a program designed to place people in farms to work in exchange for a place to stay. I was very excited about it in the beginning. Although, the closer I got to it, the more worried I became. The farm I was going to be working on was very remote and I didn’t have my own car for travel. The people wanted me to live in the house (that they kept saying was small) and my brain saw it as the walls closing in. So after waking up with panic attacks for days at a time I decided to not go. This has caused a rift between me and my hero growing up, my sister. 
She is a doctor was upset that I wasn’t doing something to challenge myself. I understand where she is coming from but, I didn’t feel comfortable going at this time. 
I have trouble following through with things because my brain is wired to tell me I will fail. With the farm it was basically telling me I would die somehow. I need to figure out what I want to do long term and stick with it. I feel like I’m stuck in life and do not know what to do. I’m great when it comes to an idea. I’m horrible when it comes to the execution.

The gym opens at 5 am and begins playing LOUD bass-heavy music by 615 at least. I asked the gym owner if he could wait until 8 - no answer.

The gym is also very small so it seems they are using the street to work out. All day long there are people running up and down my street in large groups. No one is wearing a mask.

510,"Hey, I’m 22 years old and I’m living with my mother to help pay rent. Currently I’m paying $750 a month that’s not including the WiFi bill which is $100. My two sisters are also living with us.

511,"I am 14 years old. I am a content creator not only for my personal brand, but also for my school. At home, my life is usually just about playing games and working on projects I need to get done. My mom is in her 40s, and my dad is 50 years old. I like doing what I do, but I don't think my mom supports me. I have made really notable works for my school, some of my projects were used in school events. I also receive offers from people that want me to do their work.

One of these requests, was from my mom. It's a bittersweet story. I keep driving myself into delusion thinking that my parents care, but actually they don't. For one, my mom lusts over money, especially during this pandemic where my dad lost his work overseas. Nothing unusual yet, right? Well, way before the pandemic, ever since 2017-ish, my mom has started to care less and less about my achievements.

I think she lost her passion in raising a child, and simply just raising me because it's her obligation as a parent. Whenever I show something to my mom, she would either change the subject, or completely ignore me, which is pretty fucking toxic. There are times that she would compliment me, but those compliments were emotionless and I didn't feel any support or even feelings of happiness coming from them.

My dad, on the other hand, actually acknowledges my achievements. My dad is religious, kind, and smart person, unlike my mom who is being blinded by the glitter of financial wealth. Anyway, when she asked me to make some sort of ""product ad"" for a Juice Company, since she was a distributor, she would constantly bug me to finish it but I don't even want to do it because of everything she's done.

She keeps telling me ""I'll give you half of what I earn from this"", and every time she keeps telling me that, I would always believe it, until I realized it was all bullshit. She would make excuses about why like ""I'm the one making money here!"" or even ""What about the school money I give you every day?"" and ""Yeah, and that phone cost me money!"". She would always say that it's MY fault that I did what she asked and I am getting sick of it.

After those past experiences working with her, I find my mom to be a shitty little bitch who is too entitled to money, but I don't have a choice because I'm a minor and she's obligated to watch over me. I don't want to talk about this, or get any authorities involved in my situation. I don't know what I should do because every little argument we would have is petty, obnoxious, and stupid. 

Like I said, I think she is being blinded by money because she's acting like a slave for money. She wants to have more of it, even though what we earn as a family is already enough to sustain our needs. Am I in the wrong for not wanting to do what she's asking for?",14Aug2020,1

Title sounds bad but hear me out.
I (f/22) have been in a serious relationship with my girlfriend (f/20) for 6 years now and although the time isn't right yet we are talking about children. 
We would like to adopt but we would also like to have biological children through IVF. I would carry my spouses baby so to speak. She doesn't want to carry, so we spoke about us using her egg. Now the problem is that my spouse has a long line of severe autism in her family. She, herself is only affected mildly but her siblings are more severe and the parents are on the spectrum aswell. I can see how frustrating it is for everyone and how much harder a neurotypical life is and I want to actively avoid ending up with my own children living with this diagnosis. If they did end up with this or anything else, I wouldn't love them any less and I'd do everything to make their life a good one. 

Just to be safe tho I don't want to use her eggs as there is such a high chance of the child ending up with autism. I have slightly addressed it before but not directly as I'm not sure if it's in my right and not wanting to upset her. Don't get me wrong I would like a mini her running around but I don't want to risk the child having to go to special school and struggling severely to fit in etc. I don't see the point in risking it as of now, for the child and selfishly also for myself. There's also alot of screaming and stubbornness going along with it in her family. I just don't want that for my family.  I will mention it as a concern and I'm pretty sure she already knows it's a concern of mine but she also loves her (autistic) siblings (of course) and I'm threading on thin ice whenever I say something about autism in general.

516,"To begin with I am 22 and I had to move back in with my parents cause I couldn't afford my appartement anymore connecting to covid-19 issues.

My parents have always been a bit annoying with food - nothing too bad. Since just before I moved out (I was 20) they started being too controlling.

If I am cooking they will look over my shoulders and stand really close to me (I'm talking 10 cm between us), they will comment on my spices, on how I bake things and what ingredients I'm using. Sometimes when I'm grabbing something from the fridge they will start stirring in the pan (no mom, you dont stir a fucking omelet) and even add so many spices that it changes the taste of the dish.

They also sometimes right when I start making lunch start to cook as well. I'm talking about me chopping herbs on the cutting board and them standing next to me waiting for me to finish so they can use the cutting board. We have multiple cutting boards.

And when I eat they stare at me. Literally stare at me. Every minute or so they ask if it is good. I have told them multiple times that their behaviour is not appropriate and makes me feel uncomfortable. I have told them that its very annoying that they do these things.

They didn't stop. So I started cooking for myself when I know they are away and now I always eat by myself in the study or sometimes I take a walk to the park and take a tupperware container with me. My dad brought it up cause he thought I wasnt eating at all anymore, and I told him what I did and why. He got mad with me and said they didn't do those things and that this is the first time he ever heard of this.

518,"Some backstory, I have an auto immune disorder. All of my co-workers know I'm high risk, and scared to death of Corona. The co-worker who tested positive is the child of another co-worker that I work with in much closer quarters (child is in a different department in our store). The parent (P) of sick co-worker, sick co-worker (S), and I all get along extremely well and have each other's phone numbers.

Well, P was missing from work today, forcing the manager of our department to work 16 hours in a row. I kept asking my manager where P was, and they would just tell me ""not here"". Later in my shift I started guessing why P was missing, and within a few minutes asked if S had tested positive for the 'rona (their SO's sibling had tested positive recently). My manager did not tell me I was incorrect, like they had been with my previous guesses. At first I was outraged that no one had told me right away, considering I'm taking multiple immune suppressing drugs, and everyone that works here knows that. Manager explained that our company could not warn other employees of the potential contact, as it is protected health information of S. I totally understand HIPAA, so even though it was frustrating, I let that go. 

My manager technically didn't tell me or even confirm that S had tested positive, but it was implied. A few minutes of silence later, it occurred to me that P or S could have texted or called me at any point to warn me, and didn't. If they wanted me to keep it quiet, I 110% would. I respect their choice not to share medical information with anyone, but I am deeply hurt that they chose not to contact me.  

I'm not sure if I'm being selfish by being so upset over the matter.

522,"TL;DR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I (23M) have been struggling with my mental health since I was 9. It has been a very long, hard battle. In particular, during my final year of High school when I was 18 it hit me hard. I was extremely suicidal and hated myself so much that I legitimately believed the entire world would be better off if I were to kill myself. I couldn't bring myself to do anything during that year, from participating in classes to the gaming (PC and Tabletop), writing, reading and anime that I always loved before.

&amp;#x200B;

One memory from those times that really stuck with me was of the last day I decided to show up to English class. During the entire class I couldn't even show my face. I entered the room, sat down and immediately placed my forehead on the desk and wrapped my arms around the sides of my head so that nobody could see my face. I still don't even know exactly why but I was terrified of anyone seeing my face. I never showed up to any classes again after that.

&amp;#x200B;

I struggled with this level of insecurity, self-hate and wishing to die until I was 20. I'm honestly surprised I made it through those years.  Those were the worst years of my life and during them all I could do to find peace was to participate in escapism. I would completely immerse myself in a game world or anime world in order to escape my own thoughts and feelings.

Now for the reason I mentioned all of those things from the past, is that I have improved dramatically. I no longer hold onto much self-hatred, I don't take life too seriously or feel suicidal often anymore. I have lost 85lb, begun grooming beard much more effectively than before and cut my hair shorter so that it framed my face better. I no longer constantly worry about what other people think when they look at me, or get offended/troubled by it when people look at me with negative expressions. I even feel pretty confident and think of myself somewhat highly some days!

&amp;#x200B;

I have come so very far but there are still so many issues. One of the biggest issues that bother me right now is that I have no passion for anything I do, nor do I get enjoyment out of doing those things. I'm not saying that I don't smile and laugh and enjoy some things in the moment, but it's all so temporary, hard to find and very unstable.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to have a burning passion for writing and I would write constantly just for fun. I wished that some day to become an author that could support himself off of his writing alone. During my senior year, my passion for it died when I was really hurting. I have never been able to rekindle my passion for writing. I actually struggle to write coherently and effectively at all. I'm not sure what happened to me, but I can't seem to write even texts or posts like these with any fluidity or consistency. My *ability* to read has not been disrupted by this, but I no longer find any enjoyment at all in reading. Regardless of the quality and type of content, it is actually emotionally difficult and painful to force myself to read. Even my favorite novels are now painful to read.

&amp;#x200B;

Something lesser, but similar to me losing my ability to write has happened recently with everything else I loved in life. I can no longer find much, if any enjoyment gaming on my PC. Anime is difficult to enjoy, and when I do find something I like, I always end up feeling very depressed afterwards it. I don't have any friends left to play Tabletop games with anymore, so that's just completely off the board and honestly I can't think of anything else at all I want to do with my free time either.

&amp;#x200B;

I have made so much progress in the last few years and improved my life and mental state dramatically. I have gotten so much better, and yet I feel like there is an invisible wall keeping me from the life I see everyone else living right now. At work I hear people talking about their passions and their goals. I see people's faces light up, and I hear their voices raise in pitch when they talk about the things they really love. I want to feel that feeling they are experiencing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best way I can describe my feelings of frustration and emptiness is this: Imagine life is [OSRS](https://altarofgaming.com/osrs-membership-worth-it/) and my subscription just lapsed so I'm now [F2P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play) again. The activities I enjoyed most are now either entirely disabled, or very important content has been removed from them so that they aren't enjoyable anymore. I want my premium status back, damn it!

&amp;#x200B;

I know that my issue is rooted in the depression I've been struggling with for most of my life; I just hope that someone who has been through something like this already might have some advice about how I could overcome this. I would really appreciate any advice anyone may have for me.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S.: This took me two and a half hours to write, and I cut out huge amounts of detail to avoid the post getting any longer. If you have any questions that might help with giving more/better advice, I'll be happy to answer them. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you actually read all of this, thank you; I hope you have a wonderful day.

TL;DR: I can't seem to find enjoyment in anything I do anymore and would really appreciate any advice that might help.",14Aug2020,1
523,In September I’ll be moving into an apartment and need to work to pay rent. I’ve seen most people don’t take corona seriously and are fine with putting other people at risk. I want to find a job that is safer than working at a grocery store or something like that. I keep having dreams that I’m out in public and someone touches me and then I end up beating the shit out of them in my dream for exposing me to corona.

back then i had a car so, it was easy to leave when I get aggravated but staying in my room pushes me to retaliate and say something back. 

every morning, she’s yelling at me in front of my sisters or talking shit about how i won’t be anything in life and my little cousins are going to be better than me.

532,"
I’ve been with my bf a few years. We had a really healthy relationship until the pandemic when I guess my mental health deteriorated and he had a really hard time supporting me (although he never told me this). I went to stay with parents last month and he barely spoke to me. 

He admitted when I got back-and he seemed totally unenthusiastic about me being back after six weeks apart-that he had “needed a break” for those six weeks. 

So basically he had taken a break unilaterally. When I heard this I asked him to leave my apartment and said I would take a few days to think things over and I’d reach out. 

In these few days I’ve felt happy and felt relief that I didn’t have to be trying to make him happy, figure him out, ask for closeness. He has reached out a few times and expressed a genuine interest in moving towards open communication and repairing our relationship. 

Which brings me to tonight, we are talking. On one hand I want to give it a chance because we’ve never really had open conversations about feelings and the relationship(it was generally always smooth sailing). On the other, I’m not sure if I’m too hurt to continue. 

Any help?",14Aug2020,1

534,"My job no longer exists for the time being. While i’m waiting for it to open back up, my wife got me a job at the store she works at. I don’t want to get too specific, but think target and walmart. We have an app to check our schedule as well as a physical schedule posted every week.  According to the app when i checked (which i have screenshots) i do not work today. I get a call from my wife this morning that they’re pissed because i’m on the schedule and not there yet. I check and sure enough i’ve been added and nobody told me. This is the second time it’s happened and idk if it’s on me for not checking my schedule more frequently? Or maybe i’m in the wrong for not checking the physical copy? But why should i have to if we have an electronic one? And a secondary problem i’m having here is that the management continues to go to my wife about these sorts of things instead of directly to me. She doesn’t feel comfortable with it for many reasons, and honestly it’s starting to piss me off, because i’m my own person, she’s not my handler. If they have problems, or concerns, or even just want me to pick up a shift, they should be going directly to me, for many reasons, the most important one being that she’s lower management and not allowed to be directly above me, as that would be a conflict of interest, yet they continually try to force my position to be directly under hers which will inevitably get her in trouble if an employee takes this to HR. The whole thing is a mess and i wonder what i should be doing about it.

547,"So I’m a pretty attractive girl. I’m 23 years old, petite, nice body. When I was younger I was very unattractive and it seemed like one day I woke up and everything fell into place and suddenly all eyes are on me. At first, I was kind of a bitch about it. Imagine waking up one day and all the guys you had the biggest crush on and would never give you the time of day suddenly begging for your attention. But now that I’m a little older, I’ve been trying to tone it down a little because I’d rather just keep to myself. I just moved into my own apartment in a big city which has been fun, but lately it seems like I can’t leave the house without being catcalled or bothered. Sometimes it’s harmless, sometimes I take it as a compliment when it’s being said nicely, but most of the time it comes off as threatening. A little back story, I was severely physically abused by my dad until I moved out when I was 18. I’ve healed from it but, of course, i’m still very paranoid of men. I’ve been followed many times and I just want to protect myself. It’s gotten to the point where I ask my friends if they think I’m overly catcalled and they told me that they know when they’re with me they’re gonna get catcalled too but not as much when they’re alone. It’s gotten to the point where I think it might be me or a kind of vibe I’m giving off. And I’ve tried a lot of different things. Going out in no makeup, huge clothes, nothing works. 

I should also note that whenever I get mad at the men who catcall me, they always get very upset and start yelling at me, when all I really want is to be left alone. Or even when I ignore them, they get upset too. So I guess what I’m asking is, when I want a guy to leave me alone, how should I relay that to them in a way that won’t make them act aggressively?

And also I hope you guys don’t take offense to this. I know there are so many terrific guys out there. And I’m sure the majority of the guys who do catcall me mean me no harm and don’t realize that they’re hurting my feelings. I just want to spread some more love in this world and be able to communicate with them on a human level and not a hot girl they wanna f level.

549,"We have been friends since we were 13 . We have another best friend but she isnt as close to her as she is to me . 
She often complained about things she is not happy with including her bossy mom and I never had any problem listening to her , giving her advice and cheering her up but recently she has been so frequently whining about her life that I have started getting so sick of her . A week ago , she told me she thought of attempting suicide but stopped because she's a coward and suicide is considered a sin in our religion . When I asked her why she told me she just felt like she should . I tried to keep the conversation going , asked her why she felt so low that she considered taking her life but soon I was tired of hearing her repeating same things over and over . I ended up putting my phone in airplane mode so I don't hear from her for couple of hours . 

I know I sound like a terrible friend but I have been putting up with her for so long and I honestly think she doesn't have good reasons to be all unhappy , frustrated with life and to feel suicidal.  
It isnt like she is homeless or an orphan or someone who doesn't  have a penny  . All her problems she tells me about are so little as compared to what I have been through . I literally went through hell and did not tell a soul and she has me who listens to her whenever she wants to talk . But her repeating same stuff is getting on my nerves now . 

I have big goals in life and I keep around those people who are positive and contented and she used to be one of them but now all she brings in my life is her negativity .
Recently she has been complaing alot that I am not letting her visit me . I tried to explain to her once again that I have not been meeting any friend in person until virus is over/almost over .And she called me selfish . 

I do not know how to stand her anymore . I have tried to tell her that life is all about ups and downs and she needs to accept it . She is an adult now and she must know how to face the music and not let herself be bothered by every thing . But SHE CAN NOT STOP PRETENDING LIKE THE MOST SENSITIVE PEROSN ON THE FACE OF EARTH . I completely understand that some people are more sensitive than others but her being an attention seeker bitch is something I do not want to deal with anymore. But I have no idea what I should do now . I do not know if I should just tell her that she needs to stop being a whiner or stop talking to me . Any advice ?

551,"Hey everyone, first time poster here. I started working for my best friends company when he started it a bit over 6 years ago. I have never been paid a lot and certainly not what I feel I deserve after earning a college degree but the position is chill and provides me a lot of free time and flexibility to pursue other avenues as I choose. I was in school until last year and the schedule worked around me to allow attending all my classes while still working my expected weekly hours. 

As time has progressed the income of the store has declined and then with COVID, declined substantially to a point where the business is barely profitable after expenses. Lets say we used to make 100k a month in revenue. Now we bring in 33k with a 2% month over month improvement as quarantine orders have been lifted in our area. I maintain the highest position in the business and am paid more than anyone else in the business. I earn enough to pay my rent in the cheapest possible apartment, cheapest reasonably safe car, utilities, food, and that's about it. After yearly bill increases I have little room to spend on optional expenses these days.

In 6 years, I have not received any raise at all in the past two years. Today, a parents wealthy friend offered me a part time job at $75 an hour for 20 hours per week. Taking it would very quickly exceed my current monthly income. On the other hand, while being extremely successful financially over several decades, he is always in the midst of a pretty severe manic depressive mental condition. I have personally witnessed him in the past going from hot to cold in short periods of time. My parents are psychologist &amp; psychologist so I trust their professional opinions on the matter when they unequivocally tell me he is not stable mentally. 

Should I take the offer and force my job of 6 years to work around whatever new hours I need to work for the new job, knowing it easily might be a short term job before he switches manias and decides to not continue our arrangement? Or should I stick with what has not been life changing but very stable for 6 years now? I am honestly leaning toward taking the offer for as long as it stands but it would suck to do that and then lose both income streams.",14Aug2020,1

Not only did she claim to hear footsteps, she also says my chair creaked and that there was a faint phone ringing (the phone did this twice). When she went to check our mailbox, she looked at one of the windows to my room and apparently saw a face or a ""a pair of eyes"" staring at her from the window (apparently it was the face of a young girl).

When I came home she told me all of this and I went to check my room to see if someone or something was there. There were no one there, and nothing was stolen. This led me to believe that there hadn't been a robber in our house. I also checked the entire house to make sure no one was hiding.

558,"This is a throw-away account because I’m just unsure of what to do.

I work at a student style housing apartment complex that houses around 600 people. I just recently found out that one of my coworkers tested positive for COVID about three weeks ago and none of the workers were told about it. I’m not sure if management knew, but she continued to work while having COVID in the office with 10 other people in very close proximity. We have something called Turn where everyone works 12 hour days and we are next to each other day in and day out for weeks so the likelihood of all of us contracting it is extremely high. Since we are getting apartments ready for people to move into, our “teams” have been in current residents apartments doing repairs as well as empty apartments getting them ready for new move-ins. We have been in every single apartment in the complex and have been in close contact with residents who come in to pick up packages etc. 

Fast forward to three days ago when said coworker who had COVID’s father died of COVID and brother currently has COVID. She went and visited her family for three days for the funeral and returned to the office without getting tested (since she said she already had it she couldn’t get it again and therefore didn’t need to be tested). I believe she told management about this but management told no one in the office about her situation. I understand that you cannot specifically say that so and so has been in contact/infected but shouldn’t management have said that they are aware that one of the workers has COVID and that we should all get tested? It seems that the company would rather sweep this situation under the rug in order to get apartments ready even though it seems negligent to allow people who may have COVID to be in contact with so many people. 

I just found out about all of this yesterday, from another coworker not from management or from the person who supposedly has COVID.
Here’s the thing, we have 400 people moving into the apartments and none of the office staff have been tested at all. None of the apartments have been disinfected.
So...
Am I just overreacting? Should I tell corporate about this? Should I confront a manager or the coworker? If I do can I trust that they are telling me the truth even though they haven’t told us anything? Should I call the CDC (hyperbole but maybe)?

I grew up knowing that while I was adopted, my brother and sister are my brother and sister and my parents are my REAL parents. It was a win-win situation. 

When I was 18 my mom finally told me the name of my birth mother. I unsuccessfully tried to find her but stumbled across someone who knew her and was able to connect me to her mother, aka my grandmother. We talked a few times but she was older and we eventually lost touch.

Now, 18 years later I'm in my thirties and I stumbled across the facebook profile of my biological mother. I had been spelling her last name wrong the whole time. I sent a tentative message and in response received several nasty messages from two of her daughters stating I could not be the adopted daughter since they already found her. They sent me the profile they found as proof and I was instantly concerned. This woman is ten years older than me meaning my biological mom would have been three years old when she had her... highly unlikely. I am finally able to speak with them on the phone calmly, explain that I believe they were catfished and my DNA is on file with 23andme and Ancestry. I said just take the test. They agreed and the test for two sisters came in this morning saying we are half sisters with 24.8% DNA matched.

My questions are: I have no idea how to navigate this situation. My own mom doesn't seem particularly interested and has no advice and my brother and sister have both advised me to just be cautious. I really don't know how to go about getting to know this side of my ""family"" while not stepping on any of my own family's toes. This family is low income, low education, a half brother with trouble with the law. My own family is higher income, high education and are very private people. (I fully recognize they do not in any way need to be involved with my biological family. I'm at the age now where this does not bother me, I just want to protect everyone's wishes.) Any advice for how to move forward getting to know these people? Specific questions to ask? Boundaries to set? I'm totally lost and the generic texts we send back and forth you can clearly tell are us wanting to say more but having no idea how to navigate just finding your long lost sister. I text my oldest half sister semi-frequently but it’s generic and obvious that we both aren’t sure what to say. Two of my half sisters and my half mom have said they want a relationship. 

Any advice, tips, suggestions, thoughts would be incredibly welcome.",14Aug2020,1
564,"This one might be cliche. But unfortunately I have reached a point were I must consider drastic measures. 

Long story short.  I am 33M single. No high education degrees. Family affairs have led to a place of complete rock bottom. Financially I am independent and I live off passive income. My country has cheap loving standards so I van maintain simple life with little to no luxury.  I simply need to change location and possibly my lifestyle. 

Temples for devotees?


Oil rigs?

Volunteer assignments? 

Even religious missionaries.

TLDR; I was sent a suicide note from another student in my online course. The note was last edited 5 hours prior. I notified our school of this, and they gave me b.s answers. I had to spend 4 hours finding all information on this girl, and was in contact with multiple police departments in different states on opposite sides of the country. An address was eventually confirmed, and a well-being check was conducted. The PD confirmed that my school did not make any contact or request a well-being check. I don't know how to proceed?

I am attending a self paced online course at a state university. I don't live in this state. It is an English class, and I was on my first writing assignment. After I completed my rough draft, I had to upload my paper to our course website, and conduct a peer review for someone elses paper. Once I submitted my paper, the computer automatically gave me someone elses paper, who would have recently submitted theirs and has been waiting for a review. I clicked on the link to their paper, it was their suicide note. I'm not going into details, but yes, it was a suicide note. It was nothing related to the topic our paper was supposed to be on, and was personal. The note was last edited 5 hours prior to me viewing it.

I contacted my school immediately. I have no clue who this person is, all I have is their first and last name. I told the person on the school chat that I was sent a suicide note. His response was ""I'm busy in a zoom meeting right now, I can give you a call about this in an hour."" Unacceptable. I called the school and was bounced between different departments for 30 minutes, and I just kept getting the same basic ""we'll look into this when we get a chance"". Unacceptable. 

Over the course of 4 hours, I tried to find out who she was and where she lived. I had her first and last name, and I eventually found her Facebook. She attended specialized schools all over the country, and there was no way for me to message her or any family members. I tried, the messages wouldn't send. I started calling police departments in the towns she had attended school. Was in contact with one states PD for some time, they informed me that they had gotten in contact with a school, she moved. I called a state on the complete opposite side of the country, they told me they would look into this. State #1 PD had the same lead and also contacted state #2 PD. I eventually got a call from state #2 PD that an address was confirmed. Got a call from the specific sheriff,went over specifics, and they were able to conduct a well-being check.

This process took 4 hours. I asked state #2 PD if anyone else or a school had called about this matter. They said no, that nothing was on file. The school I attend did nothing. In theory, they should've been able to lookup her information and immediately requested a well-being check. They didn't. At this point, it had been 9 hours since the last edit on the suicide note. 

I don't know how to move forward with this. The actions of my school are completely unacceptable. This girl could've killed herself in those 4 hours. I don't know who to contact, or if I should even do anything at this point. Also, some background information, I suffer from a diagnosed anxiety disorder and ADHD, and have found a family member after a suicide attempt. Not only was I having a full out panic attack for 4 hours during this whole thing, I'm honestly fucking traumatized. I legitimately considered taking myself to get a mental health assessment after this, and still am. 

Also, yes, I am aware that my school probably could not go into specifics with me due to HIPPA, but it was confirmed by the states PD that the school never attempted to request a well-being check, which is what I am upset about.

So, how should I proceed?",14Aug2020,1

567,"Hi, just a warning this a long one. This is sort of a vent but also I need some outside advice.

So, pre-COVID 19 I was trying to find a full time job. My husband is in grad school so I started to shoulder the financial responsibility until he's finished ( he helps as much as he can). Anyway, I was applying to anything and everything and I got this job. Even the interview was strange, the initial ""phone interview"" was him in his car and then we set up a normal interview. The interview went well, it's for a non profit so I thought it could be a good fit for me (I want to be a content writer). The position was for an admin assistant BUT he liked my skill set and wanted to expand my position to handle social media and start making blog posts for the project. I was really excited. The pay isn't great and the hours aren't great. But, he told me that if I accepted the position I would get a pay raise after my ""training"" and then by summer(ish) I would start doing social media and blogs and get better hours. Then, COVID-19 hit. The old admin was supposed to train me but she dipped without training me and I was left with a binder of how she did everything and my boss is out of office everyday working with the non profit. So, I pretty much learned everything on my own and it was difficult.

Fast forward to now, It's been roughly 6-7 months that I've been working here. I do everything smoothly, he cut my hours back so I'm not working as much and saying that I should apply for grants to supplement the rest of my pay. I spoke to him about my pay raise and more hours, telling him I understood that COVID hit everyone hard but once my husband goes back to school I won't have as much money either. I got furloughed from my other job for a while and was unable to get unemployment since I was still technically employed. He avoided answering and said that he was going to give me more hours once another project of his takes off and I would essentially be an admin for both projects. He is a pastor so I already shouldered the responsibility for the church duties and his personal ones. So nothing he promised is even being addressed.

Aside from that, I'm not white. And have been very active in the BLM movement (I'm a poc but not black) and he tries to be very white savior-y to people. Recently he expressed interest in applying for a grant but they need a black employee. I just got an email from someone else in the non profit and the wording made me feel icky. It said ""...we may be able to recruit a black employee through this..."" and I was unsure how to feel about that sort of thing. Maybe I'm just sensitive... He's said several other things that aren't outright racist or sexist but it's enough that I feel gross about how he paints himself as a savior of poc and women.

I guess I just need advice on if I should act on my feelings? I started looking for other jobs but it's tough right now but another part of me feels guilty for leaving. I'm just unsure if I'm being inconsiderate or not. Or if I'm being too sensitive? My husband thinks I'm underpaid and underappreciated and I should just find another job and leave immediately.",14Aug2020,1

A month or 2 later or the end of July I texted him and said hey man and he didn’t text back for over 2 weeks so I said damn and I wake up and see it says user not found (we normally text on Instagram) meaning he blocked me and I texted his number and it doesn’t say delivered which it normally does and it goes straight to voicemail I don’t know what to do if I should let him go or text him on another account which I did but try to find out why?

I have money, but I would like to stay under $10K. Is that reasonable? And quite honestly, where do I even go? I feel that if I go to a dealership I'll get swindled because I don't believe I know enough to counter-argue or haggle what's worth it and what's not.

573,"I had very toxic “friends” in Highschool before I transferred to a new school (I’m 17 now). We were good friends at first but they started to be really mean. It all went from insults over theft to physical violence, but the worst thing was the emotional terror. They would tell lies (on the internet) about me so everyone hated me, they would scream at me and if I didn’t do their homework, they would steal my food. I tried to talk to the teachers but they didn’t believe me. (It was a religious, all girls school, how could there be such thing as bullying, they said). I still hoped it would get better and we will be friends again.

When I transferred, I thought I could leave it all behind and that went great for a few months. But they just messaged me out of the blue and said it was all my fault, so I guess a teachers has spilled something. They went on to tell me what terrible of a person I am and that they never did anything wrong. 

A few months ago, I only wanted karma to do its job and I wished they would get some sort of punishment. But now, I just want to get over that. I guess I never really stopped missing our friendship.

I have had this feeling of being watched and its gotten so bad I was online yesterday trying to find where its being posted online.  I feel like I just KNOW this is happening. I hear it though. I hear them almost non stop day after day and I now thing even though on the videos in my apt you can really only see me and im very obviously not holding the camera but never see their faces hers or whoever is with her.

so. my boyfriend is an extrovert. i’m an introvert. with shitton of mental problems. 
i have been pretty happy ever since we started dating. of course the random depression and whatnot creeps up my ass.
but there has been a few times where i can tell i’m spiraling and it’s most likely going to be bad. 
but...he’s not the type of person you can vent to. i made the mistake of doing it once and his reaction was..something i’ve never experienced before. he couldn’t handle it, i think i had made him sad too. idk he was just saying “i can’t do this rn” “i’m going to bed” and was seeming like _he_ was the one with problems. so. i didn’t vent to him again.

but whenever i’d get bad, instead of telling him i’m getting bad, i just sorta...don’t talk to him at all. (we’re in a ldr) and it lasts a few days before i come back and explain that i just wasn’t ready to talk and we continue like normal.

but somehow the topic of me feeling bad made its way in the conversation and instead of avoiding the topic i told him that i didn’t like venting to him cause last time i did he didn’t seem to take it well, and as i expected...he was doing the same thing again. he was like “i can’t handle this rn” and all i said was i didn’t want to burden him with my problems. because he’s such a sweet boy and i don’t want him to realize how fucked up my life is and have him worry.

but i started feeling like a bad boyfriend because i was trying to tell him it was okay but he was..idk being weird again and he seemed to be getting sad and so i said “see? you’re doing it rn. i don’t want to make u sad i don’t like venting to u” and _he_ was getting mad/sad and he said “i’m sad cause u never talk to me about anything” and i’m just trying to help him not feel like shit everytime i vent??

he’s such a loveable goofball and isn’t one to really handle ..’serious’ topics but he’s told be before that he hates being treated like a baby like he can’t handle anything but i feel bad because that’s how i treat him because anything other than laughing and memes he can’t seem to handle the seriousness and tries to drive the conversation to something happy and i feel not listening to and invalidated because i can’t talk to him? but he wants me to talk to him? but i can’t because when i do he freaks out?

and honestly i don’t know what to do i need help trying to successfully communicate with him.
we are happy together and the only problem we have is the venting thing. i don’t even like venting because of my anxiety whatnot but we talk about everything else except the more serious topics.

587,"So basically, I don’t really believe in ‘best friends’ but if I had to pick one I guess it’d be the guy i’m talking about - We graduated a few years ago and when he did he became friends with this guy i’ll call Alex, infact they’re neighbours. I’ve had the displeasure of knowing Alex since grade 1 and he’s always been snakey and back stabbing and we always went to the same school together so I always heard about stuff going on with him and apparently its been a pretty consistent trend throughout his life. I’ve heard of him trying to steal his friends girlfriends and lying about members of his friend group to try get them to be disliked. Alex went through a lot of different friend groups and when we all graduated he had none. 

I found out sometime after graduation that Alex went to a party one night, was trying to get with this girl and got hard rejected all night so he encouraged her to drink a lot and at the end of the night when she was passed out, Alex apparently took advantage of her and raped her and members of his friend group that started the gossip about the event said they straight up caught him doing it. So Alex was seen as a rapist because nobody doubted it and had no friends and then immediately swooped on the notion of becoming friends with my best pal (who alex had previously bullied and ruined the reputation of in the past) 

They’ve been friends for a few years and from the stories my friend tells me Alex seems just as manipulative and snakey as always and apparently hard denied any association with the girl and said he 100% did not rape her and it was just people pulling a prank on him. 

I asked my friend what he thinks of this and he said he definitely didn’t do it and that even if he did find out he raped the girl and lied about it, that he’d just be “disappointed in him and wouldn’t take it too seriously”

This really bothers me, my friend already views this slimey scumbag as the best guy ever even though he’s clearly done some seriously bad shit and still does do some bad shit and now he’s saying even if he raped someone he’d be cool with it? I’m not sure I can tolerate such ignorance. I know its not my business because its not my friendship but I sure as fuck wouldn’t tolerate any of my friends if they raped someone and especially if they didn’t even come clean about it.

588,"Like the title says: I went to work this morning at a family owned Toyota dealership here in North Atlanta and all was normal.   I had been on a little weekend vacay since me first two day weekend since February was this Wednesday and Thursday.  I was working from home due to covid and just got back a week ago, and myself and several others were horribly mistreated over the month of forced quarantine by the store owner.  I discussed with my team the issue and our one verbally abusive (like actually swearing and insults) manager and made the head manager aware it was becoming a serious problem.  And things looked like there would be some improvements in the workplace.

I get called to the manager room/area where they all work, separate from the rest of us.  The kindest of the managers is pissed off and asks why I've been complaining and mentioned to my team about looking for another job.  I told him there were serious issues and that I couldn't work here for a long time if we were treated this way, but there has been a lot of improvement and I haven't been job searching for awhile. I told him I do enjoy my job and my team, it was just one manager (not him).

He says he accepts my resignation.  
""No, I'm not leaving, I just wanted to be treated like a person. ""

""Then I'll make it easier, you're fired. Get out""

I go back to my desk and begin packing, other (bad) manager comes up and tells me to get out.  The other staff are comforting me.  I walk out to the side lot and breathe, my coworkers are talking with me.  Manager that fired me tells me to leave immediately or he will call the police for trespassing, demands coworkers get inside.  One stays out, he continues to yell at me and him.  Hug coworker, I start walking off.  I have no car, wife is on other side of town, manager knows this, doesn't care.

I walk home for 30 minutes, I'm still not locked out of anything and I was never able to clock out.  


They deserved to be shut down for several reasons before they fired me, now I want to make sure they pay for the way they treat their employees and their customers.  Don't work there, don't buy there.  I will not be surprised if more staff are fired over this.",14Aug2020,1
589,"Here’s the problem, my cat Momo is scared and traumatised of another cat in our neighbourhood that has been terrorising him this past few weeks. Initially, we let Momo sleep outside because my mom is allergic to cats. At that time the threat is not that bad. The bad cat just come to steal food and leave. 

But lately the bad cat has been fighting with Momo nearly everyday. Note that my Momo is a teen cat, of course he’s scared to take on an adult cat. Oh did i mention that the bad cat also fcked Momo’s mom?

Eventually we let Momo to sleep inside the house. But it doesn’t end there. The bad cat still come to find him and even get into our house just to mess with Momo! One time they fight in the house and Momo peed himself out of fear. Like literally on the floor where they fight. 

He’s too scared now even a sudden movement, sudden touch or a loud sound will scare him. He’s no longer free now, just hiding in the house and only comes out if anyone is around. I feel bad for Momo and I don’t know what to do with that bad cat. I don’t wanna get rid of him by poison, that’s too cruel. Can anyone suggest me a best way to get rid of the bad cat?

So I’m just wondering if that’s true? because now I’m thinking like does my boyfriend(we have been together since I was 19 I’m now 21 almost 22)  not respect or view me different because of how I am in bed?  I am self conscious about being sexually free with him. I am a sexual person and want to be myself in bed but fear of judgement from him or being viewed as a wh*re makes me hold back sometimes. because we tried anal last month and I really enjoyed it. 

I felt too dirty to let him know that I want to do it more often because I am more vulgar in bed than I am in real life so I have a hard time being comfortable letting that out without being self conscious or that my boyfriend would see me as a wh*re.   I also had a friend say letting a man ejaculate on your face is degrading and any man who respects you wouldn’t  ejaculate on your face. I feel like that’s true because in p*rn the men ejaculate on the women’s face that they’re humiliating. I’m not into humiliation but I do like when my boyfriend finishes on my face but I’ve been feeling bad ever since my friend said that.

So now I’ve been thinking “should I have more boundaries and limits in the bedroom because it might taint the way my boyfriend views me“ I also started to think about the time we would have sex in public away from people of course,on my porch etc  and I would think will he think I don’t respect myself for doing that in public? Is it true that certain things done in the bedroom will make your man lose respect for you or see you different?

599,"I went to university relatively far from where I lived with family. Whilst there because of my severe lack of commitment and concentration, plus the anxiety that I gained, I quit, just before corona. 

I did not actually leave the uni though. 

The university in my home city is open for clearing right now. I have no job, I have no prospects, no money and no idea what I want to do. 

Everyone I’ve spoke to said it was a mistake to leave uni, but, even tho it’s a bad excuse, I cannot even fathom going back to the uni I was originally at. 

If I go to the uni in my home city via transfer, I could either live at home or with a long time friend at the house he is renting for uni. My anxiety would be way better, I’d get a student loan to live off of, and I would be able to try and focus on a career with a degree at the end of it. It’s not an incredible uni, but it also ain’t bad. 

Do I go back to uni? What do you guys think? I’d have to choose a course and I reckon I’d go into business and economics, even tho at college/sixth form I didn’t do any of that sorta thing, but i still like logical subjects and I also got good grades in what I did at A-level, that subject would also give me an easy way into some sort of business position earning a decent wage.

My results have come back a total of 5 grades lower than what I expected to get. I am blindsided.

I had put down my second choice university and miraculously got in but I'm not in love with it at all and hadn't ever expected to go there. I suspect they only let me in for the extra funds. I wouldn't be able to get into another one if I tried and I'm too devastated to like this one, especially as it's quite low on the league tables. I'd be embarrassed to say I went there.

However, I also have an insane fear of being left behind a year, which will happen if I eventually decide to sit my exams, as well as the fact it will be incredibly more difficult to get into university next year (a much larger cohort). My dad has suggested to me that there is no shame in my heart not being into university, and we could sit down and sort out an apprenticeship but it's something I've never considered before and I'd love to be university educated in this degree, just not in this place.

601,"Hey y'all, not sure what to do about this situation so I'm hoping someone has an idea. I recently moved into a new apartment - it's really a townhouse, so we got to know our neighbors pretty quick. At some point, I had to give my door code to my next door neighbors (3 college-age dudes) so they could bring something in for me while I was away.

I didn't think much of it - I talk to them often and they seem like good guys. However, I was just getting ready to go backpacking this weekend and can't find my new 60L backpack. I never even used it; I bought it a few months ago but hadn't had a chance to go yet, so I know it never left my bedroom closet. 

The only thing I can think of was that it was stolen. At this point I've checked every inch of my apartment. Ive never given my door code to anyone else except my sister, so I assume it must have been them. 

I'm not sure how to approach this - if I directly ask, there's a chance they just hide it/sell it. If i involve police and am somehow wrong or they already got rid of it, it could get messy.

603,"This might be long, because I am pretty sure it’s about taking some weight off my soul. Thanks in advance if u sticked through it to the end.

We came to Canada about 3-4 years ago. My family (I was 12)was very optimistic about this because of the “Dream” that everyone has when going to a new country. The new perspective they say.

First year we struggled so hard, I could say I was surviving and kept living the days without accomplishing anything. My family was sad, regretting we came here because we never had it that hard. We were living a fairly good life, but now there were things we lacked. French sucks man, it made our lives hard and it represented the beginning of my family falling apart. 

Second and third year we got better but french was still a problem. I was at school like a good boy, never asking anything of my parents because I was afraid that I would demand too much, knowing that we lack in things. I was always worried about our situation whether we talk about happiness or financial stuff.

At this point I am emotionally unstable. Crying in my room as I think about this, about this shitty situation. Trust me, no matter the wealth u have, the worst thing that could happen would be to witness your family crumble to ashes from beginning to the end. (And not doing anything) Unfortunately I think I am midway. 

All of this happened because of this language they call french. I am quite smart and I learned it in one year, grammar and oral and everything, but my parents had a hard time with this. My mother kept learning and my father did not. My mother is mad with my father because of an interview my dad had, furing the COVID pandemic.

My dad sais that he failed because there were more better than him, but I honestly think it is because of his french. My mother knows it and gets pissed at him.

2 weeks later I adresa the problem because I can no longer stand it, I said that I would teach french to my father if needed just please, can we behave more like a family? At which my father answered that we got to the point where we behave like strangers.

My mother refuses to speak nor talk about this. I am deeply hurt, and I am crying as I write this and I need advice. 

People that want to help, or people that had come across similar situations, enlighten me so I can change this because I cannot stand it.

A song from my country said:”If you want to have better days, be the change you want to see in the world”. I am inspired therefore doing everyhing in my capabilities to change this s**t.

604,"This is going to be a longer post about how I feel, but I'd like to hear your advices and thoughts.

I always used to be shy kid and spent a lot of my childhood alone with PC. I remember crying in kindergarten, at the end of kindergarten ceremony etc. It was very embarrassing and  I don't know why I used to be like that. When I turned 11 or 12  I started playing with friends, wasn't shy at all and just was a regular kid playing football outside and stuff. Then, at age 13 or 14, my acne started to appear. At first those were normal acne but then at age 16 turned to deep, ugly, yellow, bloody cystic papulopustular acne. I still didn't have any female company and used to watch porn a lot. Acne killed my confidence and I couldn't talk to girls and I never really did a lot before. I'm on acne meds for a year and acne are gone, but I'm left with a lot of ugly acne scars on face and it looks even worse when you go shopping and those lights on the roof light you up, having a disaster effect on your face.

I don't have problem talking to girls from my class, but I just don't think there is any way I could talk to other girls that I like. I'm also insecure about my height (5'6"") although I look fairly attractive, I'm in shape and was hitted on by few girls of which one of them is pretty attractive and kinda popular. I forgot to mention that while growing up (and still sometimes) my parents were fighting a lot, I heard a lot of bad things I shouldn't and don't wish anyone to hear and maybe that affected my self-image too. I don't want to sound like an egoist, but I am caring person and don't mock anyone.

I have few close friends but they are also kinda shy and introverted even though we had lot of fun, but feel like we are drifting apart. I feel like I'm inferior to those girls because they are very pretty and there's just a lot of couples out there... ALSO, my acne scars are very, very visible and wherever I go I feel like people are watching me.

I'm also feeling confused about how I feel, maybe it's acne meds, maybe it's the stuff I've been through. Not really sure anymore even though I can talk to anyone properly and don't feel anxious as I used to be. Thanks everyone for reading!

TL;DR - Insecure about my acne scars, somewhat anxiety? although I know it's all in my head and that people don't actually hate me.",14Aug2020,1
605,"TLDR at the bottom.

I (57M) have always had a great relationship with me (62) brother, but now I’m discovering some truly bad shit and I need some advice.

He’s been through some stuff in his life, and his pattern is always falling in with groups or organizations that require blind loyalty and lots of money. 

Multi Level marketing (Amway) took hold of his soul in his 20’s and it helped destroy his first marriage. Luckily there were no children. He’s also been through a self-help phase with a scam of a company called PSI (People Synergistically Involved) that sucked every dollar from his wallet. There were a few others, but those two were the worst of it. 

My family has always understood that he has this personality quirk, but by the time he was in his early 30’s, he seemed to be finding a more solid understanding of who he was. He took a job selling life insurance and was crazy good at it. He met a much older women from CA at an insurance seminar and suddenly, he was going to make a new go of it in CA with her. Our family is on the east coast. 

His new girlfriend was also divorced, but had to teen ages kids. My brother moved right in and did an amazing job of navigating all of these potential mine fields. Eventually they married and they raised two great daughters. I knew that he had started attending a rather fundamentalist Christian church, but didn’t worry much about it until the announced that they’d be home schooling their kids. This was around 1992. 

I have NOTHING against home schooling, but I could tell that this wasn’t a decision my brother had made, but instead, he was being told to home school by the leadership in his church. He wasn’t able to explain or defend his position except to spout pre-rehearsed statements about public schools. I’d seen this behavior from him before, but now the behavior was religion-based. 

As the years went by, I found out that this wasn’t your average home schooling curriculum, but a extreme Christian Fundamentalist curriculum. He could tell that we (the family) had concerns, but he always played the religious thing way down and told us he was doing this for educational purposes. 

Picture the Duggars (19 Kids and Counting) and you wouldn’t be very far off. Evolution is a lie. The earth is 6,000 years old. The Bible is inerrant. Non-Christian (and many Christian) religions are products of the devil. The devil wants your kids. There is a battle between heaven and hell going on right now and your children are at risk. Constant OCD style prayer. His kids were being brought up without any science beyond Creationist Science. My brother want honest about this, and it really bothered me that he could be so manipulated.

So, after I (politely) raising a few concerns, my brother and I began an email debate on all of these topics and more. The debate lasted 7 years, and during this time I’ve discovered that he is beyond brain washed. The problem is that he’s carried this forward and his (now) adult children are spreading this to their children. And I’m going to say up front that I’m sure I don’t know the half of it. 

Recently, my brother has become more transparent in his beliefs and this has caused him to praise all of the horrible things that the Bible claims. Genocide, sexism, slavery, racism, and violence. Basically, his attitude is that if God ordered it, it’s good. It’s not my business what he does, but I just can’t take hearing it thrown in my face any longer. He’s also antivaxx which is disturbing. 

After now 10 years of this shit show, I’m seriously considering (mostly) severing my ties with this guy. The stuff that comes out of his mouth is simply inexcusable and extremely callous and, frankly, evil. I’m concerned for those grandkids, and I feel like I need to extricate myself. 

TLDR Over the last 20 years, my older brother has become brainwashed by a Christian Fundamentalist church and has also brainwashed his family. I’m considering cutting ties and need advice,",14Aug2020,1

So I was groomed and molested when I was 5/6 by my 14 year old neighbor(B). Our families were extremely close. My mom was close with B’s mom, my brother was best friends with B, and I was inseparable from B’s younger sister. I always looked at B as a big brother and felt he would always protect me as much as my actual brother would.

I’ll spare you all the gross details but essentially he ended up taking me out of our neighborhood to some bushes where he proceeded to attack me and hold me hostage for an hour or two till my brother found me.

Cops are called when blood is found and confirms what happened.

He gets sent to Alaska, his mom and sister ( and new born baby sister) move across town. I start years of therapy. Never tell another soul. I thought I was safe. 

Till recently I ran into my old friend from high school, she has a little girl (5) and she’s really close now with family mentioned before. She lets it slip that B is back in the area and they spend a lot of time with him. She says oh yeah my daughter loves “uncle B”. I tell her I have always been fond of the family, but always hated B. I left it at that. 

Now I’m seeing her post incessantly about “killing all child predators” on Facebook and I feel like I should warn her. I’m scared that she will blast me for “accusing” him.

Then there are the group chats... I get pulled into these group chats where he'll send Facebook and YouTube videos incessantly. Countless times I have left the group chats (which I believe show a message saying that I left) but I still get roped back in. Of course, I don't watch any of it, but it's driving me insane.

I only have a year left before I move out when I finish my degree. But I still feel bad because I know it drives my mother crazy as well.

I think the biggest problem is that talking to him about it doesn't seem to make too much of a difference. Some nights he'll concede that it's too much and shut the TV off. But the behavior continues the next day. It's as if he is on some kind of crusade to make sure we all (including whoever is in that group chat) understand whatever issue it is.

I've been spending the last year trying to figure out why and how my depression has gotten so bad. It got to the point where I just had to stop blaming myself for it, and really try to search for why I feel the way that I feel. I dont think I'll ever find the right answers but I know I have it in me to heal . But I need some help right now, and I dont know which sub to actually post this in.

But I've been going through some experiences of a person who is constantly demanding affection from me. Always being forced to hug, and constantly trying to kiss me. Even when I hide under my cover they would just kiss my hair at the back. Calling me sexy even though I have expressed so many times that it makes me uncomfortable. This person will come into my room, and stand right in front of me, and watch me while they take an item of clothing off (they don't get completely naked). They also watch me while I'm trying to sleep sometime and just stare in a way that makes me uncomfortable. I'm so confused as to why this is happening, they have also commented multiple times about my body. This person is my parent/carer. And if I dont reciprocate the affection then they get so angry and make me feel like I'm not a good person. They make me feel like they have a right over my body. I dont know if this is assault or if I'm being too sensitive but when this person comes too close to me my body does cringe. 

I dont know what to think about this, but I'm overthinking and it's really causing my depression to come back. A part of me doesnt feel safe but I'm not sure if I'm overreacting. Idk if I just need someone to validate my fears, or to dismiss it so I can move on.

616,"I don't get it. I'm practicing gratitude. I'm exercising. I make myself tasty food with spices to make them exciting. I have a great relationship with my parents. I moved to a nice apartment recently. I have a few friends who are great to me. I have perfect grades at school. I listen to self development podcasts every day. Etc, it seems like I'm doing everything I can to have a high quality of life.

 Yet, I still feel this lingering darkness in me. Even when I'm having a good time, there's just this lingering melanchony and sadness. Almost every day, I cry for at least half an hour. And that's on days when I'm doing better. Sometimes I cry for hours and just can't seem to stop. I just look out the window and think how nice it would be to just jump, but then I get scared of myself for coming up with that. I don't get it, I have so many dreams and I'm really ambitious. But why am I always fantasizing about dying as a way to escape the misery? Sometimes, I'm having a great time with my friends, and then I have to go to a toilet because the I'm on the verge of tears. Then I cry in toilet and try my hardest to stop, dry my eyes and come back like nothing happened. It's happening more and more. And it's been like this for more than a year now. I'm also hella fatigued, nauseated and lethargic all the time. Could it be that I'm having a thyroid problem that's causing all these symptoms?

617,"So, I am going into middle school next week and I’m really worried- A tornado hit just before quarantine and destroyed the school I was supposed to go to. This made it so I will not be in the same school as my friends, and I’m really bad at making friends and conversations.

Just give him the slightest reason to order something and he’ll order it. At first I was ecstatic because I can ask him to order anything I want but then it started getting worse. One time my mom suggested that we have a lamp in my room. So, my dad bought one. The thing is, I wanted to choose my lamp myself.

He also bought an automatic trash can when we had enough trash cans already so I don’t know where we’re gonna keep it. He also buys additional things to meet the target price so that a coupon could be used. This leaves us with so many useless things around the house.

625,"(A little bit of a background story) I was dating my bestfriend and I love him I always will but I had break up with him because I wasn’t in the best mental state and I had to fix myself. He couldn’t understand that my reason for breaking things off was the same as why people usually break up (for example falling for someone else or because the relationship was toxic) i couldn’t explain why because I’m not usually able to access the root of what causes my feelings. I thought that we were still friends, I still do but his behavior just now is making me think that I misjudged.

The conversation went as followed: 

He posted a quote on his snapchat story, it said “Somebody dating your ex right now thinking they found somebody special 😂”

I slid up and said “I- uhmmmmmmmm” because I’m his ex and people usually only post quotes when they apply to something going on in their life. So I was confused because that post makes it seem like I’m dating someone else, which I’m not. And other people might see that and think that I’m dating someone else.

EX: “wait what” (then called me.)

The call was supper awkward in general because he wasn’t talking at all and it was really making me feel uncomfortable. 

ME(on call): “people are gonna think that I’m dating someone” then he was dead silent.

EX(on call): “so you slid up for no reason?” (With a serious voice.)

ME: “yeah I guess” 

Then he let out a combination of a huff and a chuckle then hung up.

He messaged me after and that went as followed: 

EX: that hurt for a sec ngl 
       thought you were dating someone 
       Realize that your words hurt ppl emmy 

ME: ?

EX: yea k
       Think before u say something next time
       U literally haven’t txt me in 3 days and that What u 
       wanna say.
       Yeah your f**king hilarious.

He then removed me as a friend

**END**

I can’t tell if what I said deserved his responses. What he said made me feel bad about myself though as I have always been super cautious with what I say because I know that no one really cares about what I say and since I have adhd I’m prone to impulsively saying random things so I usually always think before I say something to avoid getting looked at like a nuisance.
I hate it when I say something and someone misunderstands or purposely tries to find nonexistent things my words were ‘implying’. 

I don’t know how to respond to him.

628,"I made a previous post where I needed advice about how to get motivation to work out. Taking that advice, I tried disciplining myself to do a workout every day. I've been doing it for about a week.

On Mondays I do a workout that focuses on everything, but mainly arms, Tuesday I run for a bit. Wednesday's workout is similar to Monday's, but focuses more on legs. Friday I do the arm workout again.

My parents never really said anything about how much I had to do, just as long as I did it. But now they want me to do more. I already struggle to do 10 push-ups in a row without collapsing. I sometimes can't even find the motivation to finish a workout I started. But they've been telling me to increase the amounts of sets and the number of exercises in a set.

They keep telling me I'll end up fat or die at age 30 if I can't be active. But that's the thing. I have absolutely no reason to be active. I hate going outside because our yard is boring and we live in Texas, I can't go out with friends or do anything because of COVID, and they don't let me go around town.

635,"I have to decide on whether I go back to college soon. I had a very, very poor experience my freshman year. It was definitely one of the worst experiences of my life. In addition to that, I didn't like what I was learning and I didn't enjoy the town I was in. I was able to make friends and passed with a 3.5+ GPA, but I overall would consider it to be a pretty awful first year, at least in comparison to my other friends. Luckily, it did get better before we had to evacuate due to COVID-19, but not by much.

I know that this seems simple; if I don't like it there, I shouldn't go back, especially since I'm paying so much money for this education. However, I'm attending art school. The first year has nothing to do with the major you choose; my curriculum this year is going to be totally different from my freshman year's for this reason. The school also pushes us very, very hard, and is famous for that reason: if I graduate from here, I will definitely have improved enough as an artist to be considered skilled, and be able to go into my career with confidence. I am also incredibly lucky to have gotten into my school in the first place.

But at the same time, I'm tired of the art education I have received thusfar. I deeply miss traditional learning. Even though much of my passion lies within commercial art and I want to make it a career, I also want to explore other things that I can't at my current school. 

I have a few options.

1. Attend school on campus 
2. Take a leave of absence and attend another school remotely in the meantime
3. Apply for remote learning

\#1 is straightforward so I won't explain that. But #2 and #3 are complicated. 

If I take a leave of absence I can't take it for only a semester, it must be the entire academic year. So I would be missing out on my entire sophomore year and be a year behind my peers. However, I would have a year of time to figure out what I want to do by attending another school. And if I decide to go back to my art school, I have that option. 

If I apply for remote learning there's a high likelihood I won't receive it. But I'm considering it because I wouldn't fall a year behind and I'd be in an environment I'm more comfortable in (I really dislike the town of my college). 

I won't go into detail but, unfortunately my experience at my school was awful enough to give me panic attacks at the thought of returning. But I don't want this to solely determine whether or not I go back. The logical side of me is saying to return to campus, but I know that I am an inexperienced, young person. I don't know everything and do not want to be hasty. Getting as much input as possible will only help me, so that is why I'm asking for advice.",14Aug2020,1
636,"What is up with me?

And sometimes i do overnight practice for days just desperately trying to surpass them.

Just the thought of people being better than me at something i have been know to be very good at eats up at me and i won't feel calmed of satisfied until i have surpassed them.

640,"I think watching my parents relationship when I was young before they got divorced kinda soured me to the idea, that and up the point I moved out of my moms she actively tried to discourage any relationship with a female even if I was just friends, like if a girl came over my mom would take the opportunity to say things like (and this was when I was in highschool) “when are you gonna get a job you need to be working” “you need to go cut the grass now you haven’t done it all week” “your rooms a wreck you need to go clean it” 

And without fail would be on my ass anytime a female was over, and usually it would be a lot of my friends over not just a girl, because I just wouldn’t bring a girl over like that I felt to embarrassed. 

Now I live on my own my mom always says how she wants grandkids and stuff but she used to literally tell me not to have a gf shit like that when I was like 7 lol. So I never really put forth any effort into trying to look. I mean if a chick is like super aggressive and puts in all the effort I might have a one night stand or whatever but even then it’s like I don’t want to even try at all because I feel like it’s wrong or something. And I feel like if I try to engage with a female like that she’ll just get “offended” or I just feel like I’m doing something wrong, I’m not disrespectful or anything like that I just have zero idea how to function in that aspect of life, I’ve always had a lot of friends was decently popular on highschool but always just never had that aspect to life at all really

We also both admitted that we don't know what we are looking for exactly.

So 2 days ago, I post a story of a painting I drew (I posted it at like 11pm). He replies to my story a bit after 1AM and asks like an interpretation of the painting. I answer the next morning at 9am. He replies back at 11am and then changes subject and asks when im free for the burger thing. He asked if i wanted to have a drink too after and i said of course. So we decided on Monday evening to meet up for the burger then have drinks.

However recently (with his knowledge) I had followed him on tiktok and today saw that he had posted a text thing that read something along the lines of “george floyds death was sad but the cops have a life and family too, and probably feel bad, he looks so sad in the court footage. And if only black lives matter then they have the power and imagine what will happen then. Also pls stop posting ‘blm blm’ or if can’t breathe’ on roblox it’s causing the downfall of the game”. Of course I’m absolutely appalled and have sat him down and explained to him, to the extent of my education on the topic,  how all lives can matter until black lives do, and that no one is fighting for world domination or hatred but it’s been too long without significant change and things are seeming to come to a head (although it’s always happened, and to say it’s only getting bad now would be a little ignorant) and people just want equality and justice.

646,"So back in October I had a crush on this guy and we started talking and and going out like 3 times. I wasn’t sure if he liked me tho he was always giving me mixed signals but I was crushing so hard. On valentines they tho I asked him what he was doing and he said nothing and the asked if I wanted to hang out and I said sure and ofc I was really excited. 

The next day tho after that he cancelled and said that he didn’t want to go anymore and that he didn’t want to do something that he didn’t want to do even tho he asked me to hang out. Going on and on about how he feels bad cause I’m a great girl blah blah blah. As you can imagine I was upset and I didn’t talk to him for months. Back in May he would text me on snap once in a while but nothing serious and I thought I was completely over him at that point. 

So this past summer is where everything changed we started talking more and more and I wanted to get some answers. He explains why he cancelled the Valentine’s Day thing and he said he was in a bad place last year and that “ how can I love someone else if I can’t love myself” which I completely understood. He also said that he had a crush on me too and the he likes me currently and always had which I really had no idea. He said that he doesn’t expect me to forgive me but he really wants to make it up to me. Like now he seems more apparent about his feelings like always saying he misses me and stuff like that. 

Now I just don’t know how to feel we’ve hung out one this past summer and it was nice of talking. It’s just that I don’t know how to feel about him, I don’t fe l crazy about him like I once was. I don’t even really get butterflies when I see him now. I believe that I want to like him and go somewhere but something is just not there and I don’t know why. Every time I think about him I just always get this confusing thoughts. Bottom line is that I don’t know if I like him anymore but I think I want to?

652,"My friend has been a pretty awful person to me over the years but it would all be wrapped up in her being a “lovely” person &amp; combined with her doing completely fine &amp; “nice” things too so I could never take hold of the situation &amp; it always felt out of my control. People that don’t know her very closely think she’s a really gentle &amp; lovely person as that’s the persona she has. Made worse by the fact that she completely entwined with my other close friends &amp; relationships so she is never not going to be in my life. 

Most of her bad behaviour revolves around blatantly using me (&amp; others) with no manners, consideration for our time or finances, &amp; not even a thanks. It would take too long to list the examples, but whatever you’re thinking it’s worse than that, she is literally selfish to the core &amp; doesn’t register other people’s time, feelings or finances. 

One quick example she’s dumped her kids at my house without asking or even letting me know beforehand &amp; walked off. Literally got out of car with them, told them to go into the house &amp; walked off saying they’ll be fine &amp; gone out for childfree time - I don’t even have kids myself so you can imagine how insane this is. And I was in the middle of an already incredibly stressful day as I was hosting a dinner party that night. I had a hundred jobs to do including cooking, showering &amp; leaving the house to shop. The kitchen was a mess with hot, dangerous &amp; sharp things everywhere &amp; the children got bored instantly &amp; coming up to me for attention. 

Whenever she’s doing something awful to me or others she’s always turned on the waterworks, says she’s such a good hearted person, used her illness to gain sympathety &amp; her golden get out of jail free card - she gets pregnant &amp; has a baby. Which means noone could really be too harsh on someone who’s pregnant &amp; then ofcourse you have to visit when she has the baby &amp; be nice &amp; everything has to be forgotten &amp; “resets”. 

Well this time I’m saying no more. 

I went through the biggest, most life changing traumatic event in the last year. One of the worst things any of us could go through. Friend was there initially for me but as part of the mass gatherings that our culture has &amp; is custom. Eventually she disappeared whilst all my other close friends &amp; family continued to be there for me. I found out she’s pregnant but I knew regardless of that she would have done this based on past behaviour. 

Then came a huge milestone day for me where all my friends &amp; family were there for me in person &amp; if anyone couldn’t be there called or text, or atleast came by a day or two later. It’s literally a day that if you don’t visit or make contact it’s akin to not turning up to a funeral or wedding if you’re close to someone &amp; you can’t make up for. I never heard a thing from friend, it was as if I ceased to exist months ago for her &amp; even on this day it made no difference to her. 

To make matters worse I could see she was hosting BBQs for her family (&amp; did many over the proceeding weeks) so it’s not like she was completely laid up &amp; ill, but I know if she was challenged about this she would use her usual lines from the past “I’m not well &amp; I’m pregnant” &amp; carry on acting like she’s completely fine with me &amp; did nothing wrong. 

She’s had the baby now still without making any contact but I had to text a congratulations message. She replied acting like everything’s fine &amp; obviously now everything’s “reset” again in her eyes, she’s the one with a new born, it’s about her again, whatever she did before doesn’t matter anymore as she was pregnant &amp; had a baby. 

But I’ve truly had enough now. I don’t care that she had a baby (I care in general ofcourse like I do for any friend having a baby, but I mean in the context that it doesn’t change my feelings in this specific situation), it doesn’t excuse her behaviour &amp; treatment of me this time, it’s not a get out of jail free card. I have made no further contact though she replied to my last text, I’ve made no effort to visit (it would be from outside to see her baby through window - pretty awkward &amp; a lot of effort for someone who forgot all about me) &amp; I really just want to have nothing to do with her one on one anymore. Seeing her for the rest of my life within events &amp; groups will be unavoidable. 

I feel really harsh but when I think about it anyone else doing this I wouldn’t feel harsh or guilty about, it’s literally because she was pregnant &amp; had a baby that I’m made to feel like a harsh person. And made worse by the fact that I have no children so I feel like anyone else would be like “Well you don’t know what it’s like, it’s easy for you to judge harshly”.",14Aug2020,1

Hey guys!

So I’ve been starting to go to the gym regularly for about a year now and it has helped me a lot mentally (getting that adrenaline out and feeling my body). That’s why I recommended it to a friend of mine who has been struggling with her mental health. And she really enjoyed it and we keep going together sometimes. However, now that she’s getting confident, she’s also becoming a bit insensitive towards our bodies and comparing them. Things like “you might have less body fat than me but your arms muscles are tiny” to constantly texting me when she reached a higher weight at a machine (“look I’m lifting xx now, double of what you lift”). It’s making me sad, because I’d never use one of her body characteristics against her/as comparison to lift myself up. 

How can I approach talking to her about this? 
Do some of you guys have been in that situation? 

Thank you!

Edit: gym was a safe space for me and now she gave it a competitive aspect",14Aug2020,1
656,"This is a bit of a unique one, but here goes. A few friends and I decided that we would take our first semester of college from home and online, there are many different reasons for this such as in person classes being cancelled at our respective schools, fear of catching corona, etc. However, my friend Wendell and I have less than ideal living situations at home. For me, my parents are divorced but my mom keeps trying to sue my dad for god knows what reason, she’s unstable and living with her is a mess. However, she has a bigger place and there’s more privacy there (big for me because I vape). I also have a shed there where I do most of my work. My dads place is smaller but living there is a shit ton better. My friend wendell on the other hand lives with his mom and his brother and their place is about the size of a standard living room. Wendell doesn’t even have his own bed because there’s no space and he often sleeps over at my place or sleeps on his couch. 

This has led us to decide that we should rent a place by ourselves for the next 2 months of first semester. It’d be a lot of fun and we wouldn’t have to worry about our parents / living situations. But logistically, things aren’t the greatest either. We live in New York, which as you know is crazy expensive and we wouldn’t want to live too far away from home. We thought maybe getting an apartment in Connecticut or New Jersey would be a good idea, but even those are a little expensive and a lot of them (actually most apartments in general) require you to stay for a year. We’d only be staying for 3 months though.. Is there a way we’d be able to find a place through something like airbnb but for a longer term than a night by night basis? Is this even a good idea?

661,"This is my first time posting on reddit so I'm sorry if I do something wrong. But here it goes. I'm a 16 year old, and I have struggles for years with depression and really bad anxiety, I have talked with my mom 2 times about the anxiety and that  I'm having enough of it because I'm stressed out 24/7 and I don't even have a reason to stress out, I can easily have a panic attack just by overthinking or talking to a person and it doesn't even have to be in real life but with an internet person, or also without a reason, I told my mom that and that I get really bad stomach aches with the panic attacks and that I want it to stop. My mom litterly answered with: 'Go outside, scream all your stress out, or take a walk or a deep breath, going outside could help.' that ofcourse wasn't the answer I was searching for, the weird thing is everytime I go to her with a problem she blames it on me not going outside enough, but yeah just going outside and walking won't help my anxiety. If I would have a fight with someone my panic attack will only stop when I know the fight is over and everything is okay between that person and me. But then the thing is my sister also has anxiety and when my sister told my mom about it she went to the doctor with her and gave her something she has to do in water, drink the water and it apparently will calm her down. Why does my mom only do that with my sister and not with me? The same with my depression I have been struggling with it for atleast 5 years, last year it was at its worst, my parents my sister and I went on a holiday and my parents got so mad at me because I wasn't smiling, it was impossible for me to smile I was very unhappy and had no reason to smile, then on that holiday my dad asked me in front of some friends and other family that were there 'you aren't happy aren't you?' I was too ashamed to say that I wasn't happy so I just looked away, but that means my dad has noticed, why didn't they help me? But then again my sister also had struggles with depression they brought her to a doctor and a therapist to talk about it, and she's doing great now. But why didn't they do that for me? And then the last thing, because my parents don't help and I already am very unhappy I have been starting to starve myself, I have been too stressed out and with stress I can't eat and I just don't want to eat anymore, I noticed that my skin was getting thinner and bones started showing, and I told my mother, her litteral answer was 'yeah you aren't as fat as you used to be, I have noticed you were eating alot less, maybe go outside that will definally help' there again, she did notice it and again blamed it on me not going outside enough. I'm just having enough with my parents that they notice it all but won't help me, and do help my sister but not me. Do any of you maybe have some advice for me?

662,"I've been with a leading pharmaceutical company for two years and I really love my job and my coworkers. It's a high stress job with really crazy hours, but I've done really well here. I originally started as a pharmacy technician and I've already been promoted twice. Right now I have two titles one being a QC/Production role and the other being the facility administrator that handles . Our  manager is great most of the time. Key words 'most of the time'. The only problem I have is that she is seemingly delusional and toxic. 


What I mean by that is that last year we had one person leave, one person transfer to another facility, and one was promoted to another department. At this point I already had a lot on my plate, but when these people were no longer working no effort was made on her part to distribute the work evenly between employees. All of their work fell on me. The two titles I took on were only given to me to compensate the fact that I was doing the work of two people, but right now I can't even take a vacation because I am the only person that can make two drugs and we would have to cancel patient doses if I were to leave for a full week. 


Now here's the thing that really gets me- we have two staff pharmacists and every new person we hire is trained to do more of their work. Right now, the pharmacists do the bare minimum and some of them even leave hours early even though there is so much work they could be doing. Recently, because of the pandemic our overtime hours were cut. I was working no less than 10 hours days prior to the pandemic to get all of my work done. During the height of the pandemic, production was slower so things weren't so bad, but recently she told us that she plans on keeping the no overtime rule in effect because she sees no reason any of us should be working overtime, but with things going back to normal it is crazy busy and it is impossible for any of us to complete all our work in 8 hours! Now I am overwhelmed because my work keeps piling up and I can never get anything done on time. It's impossible to get help from anyone because she has convinced everyone that my job responsibilities are mine only even though they are in the job descriptions of everyone and she doesn't enforce training. Recently she has also decided to make me perform the responsibilities of a pharmacy technician on top of my regular tasks I already don't have time to do. I also had a chance to take on a corporate title and when the manager of that department called her to discuss the possibility she told them that I didn't want the position when I never said that to her. 


I have brought my frustrations with my workload to her attention multiple times and every time all she does is make me feel like I am being overdramatic and promises me that things are only like this temporarily and will get better but they never do. I've even spoken to her about the pharmacists not pulling their weight and she told me that she doesn't think its true even though all of my coworkers see it. I've also gone above her, but because she is my manager they are required to speak to her as well and nothing ever comes from it, which leads me to believe that she is telling them that there is nothing to worry about.  I really don't know what to do at this point. I don't want to leave, as it would unload a lot of work onto my coworkers. They've already told me that if I were to leave it would be a domino effect. I also still love the company, but other offers have been presented to me that are tempting.

Am I wrong for being frustrated? Does anyone have any advice for me?",14Aug2020,1

It’s a work from home position so I didn’t mind that. My question is is I have not told her about the two days off I need in October.

666,"Me and my girlfriend have been together just over a year now. its been a pretty rocky road tbh and theres so much fighting and problems. theres been a lot of good too and i love her to death but we cant keep any consistency. ill have to start with some backstory to tell how the trust issues started. i believe she had trust issues before i met her, but basically the first thing that happened was i met her, and we hit things off right away but i also had this other friend that was a girl who i would basically take my dog places with her and whatnot but it was never romantic or anything she was just a friend. a few days after i met my now girlfriend i went and hung out with other friend at the lake to take our dogs swimming. now, i had no idea this would cause a problem and i hadn't been in a relationship for 4 years prior, so i wasnt used to any of this anyways but GF was absolutely not okay with that and she was basically ready to never talk to me again even tho i had only known her for a few days. i eventually talked to her and told her the friend had a boyfriend anyways and that they could be friends and everything was gunna be good. except it was a lie that she had a boyfriend and after i told her that i eventually knew that it was a slippery path going down that lie and felt bad about it and came clean. she wanted to never talk to me again but after a bit we got past that part. so basically our relationship started off with a lie and some stupid drama. but that wasnt the last thing that happened.

im gunna explain my part and what ive done that she's lost trust with and then im gunna tell how she handles it. so i used to watch a youtube named bradley martyn. if you don't know him he's a fitness youtuber. one video i watched had a couple working out with him and there was something that happened that i went to talk to GF about the video i forget what but then once she knew there was a girl in it she was not okay with it. she made a huge deal about it and took my phone to see my youtube history. now, my history should be fairly innocent. i don't watch weird shit lol, but the one thing she did find was another bradley martyn video titled ""how to pick up girls at the gym"". she obviously was very mad about this and pretty sure it almost ended our relationship. in my defense, i didn't watch it to learn how to pick up girls, i had a girl and was very happy with her and wouldnt every cheat. so it wasnt about that, i just like his videos and ive watched some of those videos of his in the past before i met her and just found them interesting for whatever reason. in her defense, probably shouldnt have watched that while im in a relationship. there was girls in the thumbnail showing their ass and the title kind of says it all. i can see how upset that might make her. i dont remember exactly what happened but obviously we stayed together. there was another video later on that bothered her which was a prank type video where this girl answers the door naked to a pizza delivery guy (she is censored) i know it sounds stupid but i was watching a bunch of the nelk boy videos and this just happened to be one of them. she happened to stumble across my history of this video while i was sleeping and basically claimed i cheated on her by watching that and walked out of my house saying ""your son likes to look at other naked women"" to my dad. again, i can see how the video might upset her, but i didnt mean to hurt her by watching that and dont think her reaction was justified. we eventually settled down from that fight too.

theres been 1 instance where she caught me checking out this other girls ass where she basically instantly wanted to break up with me for. i admit it was not cool to do that right in front of her, i dont know if its break up worthy tho. and there was one other instance at walmart where she came out of the bathroom and i was looking at this girl at the cash register, again not cool by me and she has every right to be upset. i forget what happened but basically those are the things that have spiralled us into this huge trust issue thing and kind of ruins us. theres been other things that have happened during our break ups that she thinks im just obssessed with other girls too but this is already long enough. she doesnt have an ounce of trust in me now. idk if its justified or not i mean she thinks i cheated on her because one time after we broke up i had gotten on tinder or whatever and once me and GF started talking again and getting back together i was still talking to girls on tinder apparently. in my head, we werent back together yet and i didnt trust getting back with her was a 100% thing yet so i wasnt trying to cheat on her or anything but she considers it that because we were talking like we were back together and making plans and whatnot. so that adds to the trust issues as well.

now, i cant even go to the mall by myself because she thinks ill just go to check out women. i cant go to certain restauraunts without her becasuse she thinks ill check out the waitresses. she used to make me give her my google password for my youtube so she can monnitor what im watching. she accuses me left and right of looking at other girls even though after those instances i made sure not to do that to her again. shes broken up with me countless times over these accusations that werent true. shes slapped me before for watching certain movie scenes. i cant have any social medias either. last night i was helping my dad and his work partner move some furniture. so when i told GF i was going to do this she made a problem out of it that im helping another woman and im just gunna be checking her out and that i cant go unless she goes or something like that. i eventually told her that wouldnt be happening, tried reassuring her and so after i get there to help last night im texting GF and she literally wants me to take a picture of everyone around me to make sure im not looking at her and she wanted me to take a video too. i didnt feel comfortable doing that but i just took a quick picture of whatever was in front of me and sent it to her and a few minutes later she spams me with video calls so she can see and im getting really anxious at this point because im literaly not doing shit and im in front of people (the woman was actually not in front of me or visible to me so this was all for nothing anyways) and then she calls me and starts arguing but i just didnt respond to her on the phone because i didnt want to argue in front of everyone. once i got back in the car she called again and was going off on me and she even said over text how she was gunna go out with another guy because of this and said she would take pictures and whatnot. so over the phone she said fuck you so i said the same back and hung up. after this, she hasnt talked to me since. she wont answer my calls, ignores my texts. i felt her actions were not okay. she thinks she can just do whatever she wants because of the things thats happened in the past. i dont know what to do especially since she wont even talk to me. are her trust issues justified to the point of this?

672,"Hey guys, 

Some background here: 

I’m up in Wisconsin to attend my mom’s wedding and my “stepdad’s” first cousin brother’s daughter is here too (I.e. my step siblings’ second cousin). 

I’ve been rather fond of her since I’ve met her a couple of days ago, and we get along quite well too, mostly cause she’s a really sweet girl. Her parents and I have really hit it off too. Now, I’m attracted to her, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say I like her/have a crush on her. 

Her mom is seemingly keen to set us up. She’s been talking me up whenever we’re around her and keeps saying things like, “he’s so mature for 22 (I’m 22. She’s 20 turning 21).” Additionally, when when some of the wedding guests were going to some casino nearby, and I declined to tag along, her mom said, “I can invite her(the girl) if that makes any difference.” So it would seem like the mom’s cool with us dating. However, the girl is so immensely polite in general that I’m quite clueless as to whether she likes me or not. 

So my question is, is this girl my relative? Can I or should I do something about it? The drawback is that if I’m off in my assumptions, it would make things very awkward between us.",14Aug2020,1

And he slurps a lot. He glugs soda down his throat when he watches TV, and every time my mom cooks soup, he just lifts up the bowl and drinks straight from it. He drinks sweet tea, milk, soda, and juice straight from the carton, and it's so disgusting I don't even touch those cartons, much less drink from them. This also explains why my dad has bad breath and is chubby.

He stomps super loud on the stairs. Every time I hear loud stomping, I know it's him, and I try to hide because I can't stand to see his ugly face and hear him slurp water. He sings super loud. He sings stupid stuff like country music, Disney songs, and even worship music. He tries to start a rap battle with other people by saying stuff like ""yo yo yo, let's rap"". I swear he will be arrested for this one day. If he thinks the fine arts are worth dying for, he should just get a set of headphones and listen to music he likes instead of singing is so loud.

He has a really squeaky butt as well. I can hear him fart from several meters away, and it's disgusting when he farts. They sound like a mix between a trumpet, a mosquito buzz, and an airhorn. He would be right in front of someone at the grocery store and he rips out a giant squeaky fart. We would be at church and he just lets out a massive rip.

675,"Buckle up. This might. Be a long one. (TLDR at bottom)

So, my landlord is an adult I know from high school. She kind of took me and my best friend in and gave us a place to be ourselves, and I love her for that but the more I mature the more I realize how toxic she is... in way more than just one way. Well call her Sam.  Sam has charged me 200 a month for rent in a small house on her property. She is divorced and has two kids who I absolutely adore. A daughter and a son. They are my favorite thing about living here. We (my fiance and I) have game nights and campfires weekly with the kiddos. They are great kids, but their mother constantly pins them in guilt against me and other adults in their life.  The place has been great getting me out of a toxic home life, getting me through college, and giving my new family a nice start in life (just because of how cheap it is to stay here)... side note my bestfriend has somewhat cut ties with sam. The only time she comes over is to visit with me and my fiance. 

We have been here for approximately 3 1/2 years. We put put along okay together for the most part with Sam. That was until Sam got a girlfriend. We'll call her D. So, sam and D get together, we all help D move in. I LOVE D. She becomes on e of the best friends I have ever had (shes a lot younger than Sam). I look at her like my sister. I feel like I've known her my whole life, and I LOVE her for who she is and how she treats me as a person and a friend.

 D has been around for the last 12ish months, and has been miserable almost the whole time... that is except for meeting me, my fiance and Sam's kids... D has come to  me crying numerous times because Sam is unfaithful and continues to text/ talk to her on again off again ex she has had for the last 10 years. D has talked to me about how controlling and manipulative Sam is to her and the kids, and she is just not happy. 

Sam does not allow D to do anything with any of her friends, accuses D of sleeping with ME (I am a cisgender heterosexual woman who has been with the loml for 4+years now). Sam is manipulative and puts the kids against D. The whole situation really makes me wonder how well I knew Sam before she got into this relationship... 

 (fyi they got engaged last december). D told me the only reason she has stayed this long is because she is worried about the kids (they are 14 a d 12 btw).

THEIR problem is now sam has told D to get out of her house (because D has not been interested in sex with Sam), and to explain it to the kids why SHE has decided to leave. 

*side note about 6 months ago, I asked D to be a bridesmaid... Sam's daughter is ALSO a bridesmaid. 
I dont have many great girlfriends, so it was important to me to pick the people I am closest to. 

MY current problem is that sam text me last night and told me to kick D out of my wedding party because D was leaving her. 

I have told them the whole time to not involve me with their issues because I dont want to be a middle man. I offer advice to both of them, but I do not EVER take sides. 

I have NOT responded to the text message because I know Sam does not handle any kind of conflict well. She is very unstable, she has threatened suicide before for ""people not choosing her""... bottom line, I just do not want to be made to choose between the two of them... but If Sam makes me, her feelings are going to be hurt. 

BUT at the same time, after reflecting... I really feel like the only reason sam is still part of my life is because I live on her property. Idk where I stand. I have SO bad anxiety over this because I am 100% a people pleaser. All I want to text her is that I want to talk face to face... but that I will not allow her to control who is and who isnt a part of my life.... BUT I am also worried that she'll kick ME out. My fiance and I COULD figure something out, but we really dont have the means to do so before october. 

I'm just beside myself that this is happening, and I dont want to deal with it in the first place because I know there isnt really a great outcome either way. I dont know what I want to say or do... but I do know that Im not okay with the predicament I have found myself in. 

TLDR: I've become friends with my landlord's (who is a personal family friend I've known since highschool) new girlfriend and I've realized how toxic my landlord is in ALL of her relationships. NOW, she is expecting me to cut her girlfriend out of my life- which I'm not comfortable doing.",14Aug2020,1

679,"We've had a wonderful lab/shepherd mutt for twelve years now, as well as another dog we've had for four years. The older is severely ill and has been for some time. He's had arthritis in his back legs for the last couple years, and last year we thought it was the end when the vet found a seven pound tumor near his kidney, which luckily was not cancerous. She successfully removed it and he was much more active for the next few months, but lately his condition has only gone downhill.

We recently found out that he has lime's disease and lymphoma, and while he's been taking medicine for it, I haven't seen an improvement; the medicine make him desperately dehydrated and he pants constantly like he just ran a marathon. He seems to have lost control of his bowels as well, and does his business inside without seeming to notice. His arthritis is only getting worse, his back legs can barely support him and he spends most of his time lying down. We also suspect he's gone deaf.

My mom absolutely adores him, she calls him the son she never had, and he's been attached to her since he was a puppy. They have a true bond, which makes it even harder to see him deteriorate. This year has been insanely hard for my mom; she's an ICU nurse and has been on the front lines of the epidemic for months, and her dad passed away in March. I'm especially worried now because my sister and I both leave for college soon. 

My mom insists that he still has quality of life and hasn't completely deteriorated, but I beg to differ. Last November we put down my cat, with whom I had a similar bond, and I was the one to make the decision when I saw how sick she was. I can't bear to see him like this, and I know it grates on her too. If he goes on his own, it will wreck my mother even more, as I'll be away and she'll be alone(granted we have another dog but my mom honestly doesn't care much for her). How can I help her put her feelings aside to ease him on his way?",14Aug2020,1

688,"Essentially, I (18M) was texting with a girl (18F) last night and she was being like playfully sassy and I said something along the lines of ""you're gonna get in trouble if you keep acting like that,"" and she said ""how r u gonna do that?"" So I responded with ""that's for me to know and you to find out."" My intentions behind that text were supposed to be sexual, but I didn't have the balls to say that because I was worried I would make her uncomfortable. Now she wants me to actually tell her what I meant, I made her wait so she said I have to tell her today, but I'm not going to be texting with her until tonight. 

Some background on this: she was my girlfriend for about a month but she broke up with me because of mental health stuff, just didn't want a serious relationship pretty much. I decided I still wanted to be friends with her because I still like talking to her and she's fun to be around and it doesn't hurt too much, etc. I'm pretty sure she's been dropping hints that are very sexual, like she wants to have a sexual relationship, but I'm not sure if it is because she is just a very sexual person, no idea. For example, she sent me the bdsm test the other day and we looked at each other's test results, and her top one was ""brat"" and mine was ""brat tamer,"" so that was definitely interesting. Honestly, I wasn't sure what those meant but I've looked into them since. I would not mind having a sexual relationship with her, but I'm pretty much just worried I'll make her uncomfortable if I try moving it along. And I would rather have a normal friendship with her if turning it sexual would ruin the normal friendship I have with her. 

Anyways, how do I tell her? I would rather not lie about it, like I want to tell the truth, but how? Should I just try and talk to her about the whole me not being sure if she is dropping hints and I'm struggling to act because I don't want her to be uncomfortable or should I just straight up tell her I was horny when I said that and forgot to use my filter?

690,"Hi everyone.

I (30F) was born and raised in one of the most unaffordable cities in the world. As I entered adulthood and wanted to move out, it became clear to me that I couldn’t afford to live there on my own. I’ve been living somewhere that’s about a 4 hour drive away, and I’ve never gotten used to being so far away from my mum.

We casually text almost every day, and I’ll visit her every few months when my work schedule allows. We’ve always been close but I was never super dependent on her when I was younger, but I find that lately I miss her so much. I don’t believe this is normal as a full-grown, independent adult. Every time I have to say goodbye to her after I visit I get incredibly emotional, which is really unlike me.

I do suffer from depression and anxiety which I feel have both gotten worse in the last few years, so I’m not sure if these are connected.

I’m just looking for advice on how to cope with or even overcome these feelings. I know that people live continents apart from their mum/parents and seem to be completely fine despite not seeing them for 1+ years, so I’m frustrated and annoyed that I’m so affected by this when I could hop in a car and see her within a few hours.

692,"What's up guys ? This is my first time ever posting on Reddit. I created this account just to get your thoughts on this situation I've been dealing with. I'm hoping that something good will come out of it.

I started having sex my junior year of high school. Around the age of 16 or 17. And by the time I turned 23 I had already contracted 3 sexually transmitted diseases. I contracted chlamydia once and gonorrhea twice. You would think I would have smartened up after the first or second STD but obviously that wasn't the case. It took catching 3 of them for me to finally understand that I needed to stop allowing my hunger for pleasure to dictate my actions.

Luckily, every time I caught a std it was one that was curable. So I don't have to live permanently with the mistakes that I've made. (At least not in the physical sense.) And I'm happy about that specifically but overall I'm not happy and I haven't been happy for a while now because it seems that I can't get over the fact that there are people out there in the world who weren't as lucky as I was. There are people out there who made the same mistake that I did but didn't receive the same consequences. And that bothers me so much because I don't feel that I'm any different from anybody else. So why was my outcome so different ? Why was I lucky enough to only contract STD's that were curable when others weren't ?

I should feel overjoyed about the good fortune that I received but I don't. I feel extremely guilty and I feel extremely underserving of it. To the point where I'm depressed most of the time because I feel like its wrong for me to be happy while so many others are suffering. I feel a large amount of survivor's guilt and something is telling me that the only way I will be able to stop feeling this way is if I help those who weren't as fortunate as I.

And this is where you guys come in because I have no idea how to help those people. ""those people""  meaning the people who have to live with incurable sexually transmitted diseases. How do I help those people ? Do I go back to school and then dedicate my entire life to finding cures for these diseases ? Do I start a support group for these people ? How do I help them ? Or how do I stop feeling so guilty for being so lucky ?",14Aug2020,1

709,"
Doing this on a throwaway cause this is pretty embarrassing but here goes (this will probably turn out quite long, sorry in advance :/)

I’ve put on a reasonable amount of weight recently. I don’t weigh myself these days as I’ve spent a long time trying to distance worth from the value on a scale, but it’s noticeable. I’ve struggled with the way I look in the past, despite being at a reasonable bmi. I’ve done my level best to accept my body for what it is and to stop judging it, and for some time that wasn’t going too badly. However, having put on weight I’m finding that harder and harder as I notice reductions in my fitness and energy levels. For example, I practise Taekwondo and find that I’m less agile and slower than I used to be. 

I’ve decided I’d like to lose some weight, as I can’t stand this feeling of being heavier and slower, and I’m conscious of the effect that it might have on my knees if the weight gain continues, as they already have problems. I think this weight gain has come about from eating more than I need to, as I frequently grab a quick snack here or there when I’m bored. So then, it would seem that trying to reduce my food intake is the way to achieve my goal. However, back when I was having my worst struggles with my body image, I used to regularly restrict my food intake to the point where I lost quite a lot of weight. At some point, the pendulum swung the other way and I went into eating overdrive. The point of telling you this is that ever since then, any attempt to eat less food eventually leads to a breaking point where I binge hugely. Unfortunately, private therapy is out of the question as there’s no way I can afford it, and the public health system in my country is quite overstretched so the one time I did reach out and pour my heart out to the lady over the phone, I was told that unfortunately as my life wasn’t at risk I couldn’t get access to an actual therapist and was sent some leaflets with pretty basic info on them. So, my question is, is there a way of eating less but in a way that doesn’t take a toll on your mental health and without it leading to a constant cycle of bingeing and purging?",14Aug2020,1
711,"I won't get to move to my BF for another 8 months because of work. Currently living at home with my parents. My friend completely screwed me over by moving out of our apartment at the start of lockdown because she could WFH at her parents. She tried to fix me with all the rent and bills so I had to move back to my parents. I had to pay 2 months rent and wasn't able to actually live in the apartment while the landlord looked for someone to replace us. This girl is friends with a work colleague and I'm pretty sure she's turned her against me.

My work colleagues won't talk to me and it's gotten to the stage that I get upset at how mean they can be at social events so I just don't go anymore. If I try to go and be social, they'll exclude me and make it obvious they don't want me there. Lunchtime at work is crap because I've to eat at my desk alone. 

The friends I have are busy with their lives and boyfriends. I see them once every few weeks and I feel like I'm a burden to them at this point. We don't have a 'group' to hang out with so hangouts aren't as fun as they were. We've grown apart re interests but we still get on. 

My parents are a bit like why are you here every weekend. They wouldnt care if I moved to my boyfriend and only saw them once a year.

I used to see my boyfriend every few weeks but now because of quarantine rules we will only be able to see each other twice during the next 8 months. People in my city are so against travel that Im scared to ask for time off to see him and I know people will say I'm putting them all at risk by seeing him (planning to meet in a place we're both allowed go to without quarantining then not be back in work 14 days after first seeing him so if he gave me anything I wouldn't be contagious by then). 

I dont even know if I want to move to be with my boyfriend. His city has more job opportunities but isn't as fun during Covid times. I prefer my city and the people here but, as is fairly obvious, I've no friends I regularly hang out with here and my work don't like me. When I lived in his city I got on really well with all my bosses. I had friends but definitely spent too much time with my boyfriend. My boyfriend isn't as social as I was in my teens/early twenties so part of me feels like he held me back making friends. The hard thing about not having friends now is that I did have them right up to my mid twenties. I regularly went out to parties and social events so it's hard now to deal with people thinking I've never had friends. 

Now I'm so bored and lonely that I'm considering breaking up with him so I can go on dates to actually have something to do. But I don't want to stay here and, let's be real, most guys probably wouldn't date me because they wouldn't want to be associated with someone with no friends. I do love and do want to be with him but sometimes he can be rude and critical. Some people including his family are also more right wing in his city which I'm not crazy about. 

My BF could have come to me for a month to WFH because his work definitely wouldn't be opening the office for August. We could have rented an apartment for a month together here. He wouldn't come because he wouldnt be able to bring his extra computer screens.

Throughout our relationship, its always been the case that I would live in his city and he wouldn't move to mine. I first met him there and lived there for three years. He promised he'd move in with me but wouldn't. Now that he wouldn't make the sacrifice to move here with me to WFH makes me question our relationship. It's always me making sacrifices and never him. 

We've now been long distance for 2 years and I partly feel like I've wasted that time. Apart from loving him, something that held me back from breaking up was that I knew I didn't want to stay here and wanted the option to move back to his city. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have found someone here. But then I also feel like the relationship held me back because people think it's really weird to be in a long distance relationship for so long. 

Another option to help with the boredem is move out. I'm on a lower salary but can afford it but it would mean no savings. I'll be looking for a job in 8 months so need to save as much as possible. But I'm very isolated where I live and my parents always make me feel bad at the weekend that I'm not out socialising. But I also don't want to move in with someone who knows people I know who then asks why I'm at home every weekend.

TLDR: because I'm living at home and have a long distance boyfriend, I have nothing to do at the weekends and I'm extremely bored and lonely. I'm considering breaking up with my boyfriend so I can go on dates and try to meet someone here. But I do love him and would prefer to be living in his city when my job finishes in 8 months. Another option is to move out but I'll be out of a job in 8 months and need to have enough savings to look for a new one. What should I do?",14Aug2020,1

713,"Im a college student and i frequent my campus alot I skateboard and theres this one individual cop on my campus who constantly tragets and harrasses the skaters.

I run the skateboarding club on my campus and have grown it exponentially since i began running it. This officer has threatened me on numerous occasions and flat out lies about what he's allowed to do i even caught him turning his body cam off and trying provoke physical confrontations with me.

7 months back i was skating around campus it was the end of the month and this same officer followed me then stopped me i asked him why he stated i was committing criminal mischief which i clearly wasnt so i told him id stay at the scene and allow him to investigate what exactly i had damaged.

When I did that he called for back up and stated i was behaving disorderly when his partner came he began behaving in a similar manner threatening me and threatening to arrest me for not IDing myself. Ive never had police officers behave that way especially campus officers i began having a panic attack and told him i would ID myself and he simply responded ""too late"" and arrested me anyways.

They then began handcuffing me and i wasnt resisting in anyway whatsoever the officer who was the one who originally stopped me then took his pepper spray out and shoved it in my face solely to scare and intimidate me i asked him why he was doing this and that im not resisting. Then he started telling me all these orders which i couldnt understand so he then talked to me like i was an idiot and that if i didnt obey him he'd ""smash my face into the pavement""

I had to drop out of school after that due to all the legal fees i needed to pay in order to get my charges dropped as well as go to therapy as i relive that interaction everyday since it happened.

How do i deal with the PTSD?

P.s. i already filed a complaint with the university and the officer got reprimanded for his behavior. After i filed the complant i requested the body cam footage of the other officer in order to prove to the university what this officer did and when i got it the video cuts off immediately after the officers start handcuffing me the other officer left his body cam off the entire time which i already knew before even requesting the footage. The officer then lied to local media and claimed that I turned his camera off (how could i have done that if i was being handcuffed?)",14Aug2020,1

The kicker is they want to throw me out BECAUSE I don't know how to do any of this shit. I have a job but barely any money so I can't afford a place or anything like that. I've reached out to them multiple times asking them to help me learn things but it's always ""I'll do it later"" later turns into years and it never happens, then I'm yelled at and threatened for persisting. Don't really have other family nor friends (not really allowed to leave house) so I can't ask them or their parents. Every time I try to do things on my own I'm yelled at, told I'm not doing it right with no explanation, and dismissed. I just need help learning all the basic things about being an adult before I'm forced out there with no resources.",14Aug2020,1
716,"Me and my boyfriend are in a LDR, and I am three hours ahead of him. We are both pretty busy during the day, and although we text eachother, we normally can't call eachother or videochat until late at night, around 11-12 his time. A lot of nights I'll stay up late to talk to him. I always sleep better after getting to hear his voice or see him, and I enjoy just talking to him for hours until we both fall asleep. It's honestly my favorite part of the day. 

Last night, he brought up that he feels bad that I stay up late to talk to him. I told him it's fine, because I have problems sleeping anyways and I'd be staying up that late whether or not we were able to talk, and that I sleep in pretty late, so it's not like I'm missing any sleep. He then said that I'm being clingy by staying up late to talk to him. 

He's called me clingy a few times before, and I can admit that I have been. This is my first serious relationship, and I'm still learning how to show that I love him without going overboard. I never try to force him to spend time with me, or stop him from spending time with others, I'm just very sappy and overly affectionate sometimes. I take everything he says to heart, and try to change any bad behaviors that he points out, because I don't want him to feel like being with me is a chore, and I want him to know that I'm listening when he tells me I'm doing something that makes him upset. 

I know that I should just stop staying up late to talk to him, so that I'm not bothering him and unintentionally pushing him away, but most days, the only time we get to talk is late at night. I worry that if I stop staying up to talk to him, that we'll barely talk over the phone any more. What should I do?",14Aug2020,1
717,"What's up guys ? This is my first time ever posting on Reddit. I created this account just to get your thoughts on this situation I've been dealing with. I'm hoping that something good will come out of it.

I started having sex my junior year of high school. Around the age of 16 or 17. And by the time I turned 23 I had already contracted 3 sexually transmitted diseases. I contracted chlamydia once and gonorrhea twice. You would think I would have smartened up after the first or second STD but obviously that wasn't the case. It took catching 3 of them for me to finally understand that I needed to stop allowing my hunger for pleasure to dictate my actions.

Luckily, every time I caught a std it was one that was curable. So I don't have to live permanently with the mistakes that I've made. (At least not in the physical sense.) And I'm happy about that specifically but overall I'm not happy and I haven't been happy for a while now because it seems that I can't get over the fact that there are people out there in the world who weren't as lucky as I was. There are people out there who made the same mistake that I did but didn't receive the same consequences. And that bothers me so much because I don't feel that I'm any different from anybody else. So why was my outcome so different ? Why was I lucky enough to only contract STD's that were curable when others weren't ?

I should feel overjoyed about the good fortune that I received but I don't. I feel extremely guilty and I feel extremely underserving of it. To the point where I'm depressed most of the time because I feel like its wrong for me to be happy while so many others are suffering. I feel a large amount of survivor's guilt and something is telling me that the only way I will be able to stop feeling this way is if I help those who weren't as fortunate as I.

And this is where you guys come in because I have no idea how to help those people. ""those people""  meaning the people who have to live with incurable sexually transmitted diseases. How do I help those people ? Do I go back to school and then dedicate my entire life to finding cures for these diseases ? Do I start a support group for these people ? How do I help them ? Or how do I stop feeling so guilty for being so lucky ?",14Aug2020,1
718,"For context, he isn't an evil person, but is naive and full of tall tails. He's worked here for two decades and has friends who know the baby he speaks of is something new he's come up with. 

The issue I have is that I survived a miscarriage almost a year ago. I also have PCOS that makes having a baby really hard. I'm over the moon to be told by the doctors that both me and my son are healthy. 

I find myself avoiding my coworker to avoid his story. Only two people in my building know I was hospitalized for my miscarriage and I don't want him to know.

719,"I can't recall if I've ever posted in this sub before but it seems like a god-send, so really hoping for some advice.  


A lot of what I'm going to write probably doesn't paint me or him in the best light but he has been a good friend to me when I've needed him and vice versa, so it's a friendship I want to find a way to maintain. I struggle with feeling lonely often, and so I try to keep hold of people in my life.

I \[29F\] have been friends with R \[49M\] for a couple of years now. When we first met, R suggested seeing a movie in town. I hadn't really understood that to be a date, so when after the movie he grabbed my hand to hold as we walked to the train station, I was shocked and pulled away (making an excuse as I did), as I didn't want to hurt his feelings but had no interest in him at all. I bought a drink on our way to the station so that I could prevent him trying to kiss me when we parted ways, and he joked that it was a ""clever trick"". I really struggle to affirm boundaries when I feel people, (particularly men) are beginning to push them. I have a history of physical and sexual abuse, and it's something I'm working on getting better with.  


I avoided him for a couple of months after that. I didn't respond to messages or calls and neither of us discussed what happened that night. Then, a friend suggested a group of us go for dinner and I figured that, as we were in a group, it would be safe. The dinner was fine but at the end of the night, R ended up walking to the same station as me and pulled me close to him trying to kiss me. I pulled away but he was still holding me and he said, ""just give me one kiss."" I was freaking out internally and wanted to be let go, so I put my cheek to his (I guess as a European kiss) and managed to pull away completely. I was shaken and called a friend to discuss what had happened on the train home.   


R then messaged me asking how I felt about him. It felt safer to do whilst messaging, and so I told him that I wasn't interested in him romantically at all and just saw him as a friend. He read the message but didn't respond. We ended up in a group of mutual friends at a pub a couple of weeks later and R pulled me aside. He asked, ""why not me?"", which was odd since it was out of the blue. I told him I just wasn't interested in anyone, (he knew, as did all my friends, that I have/had been struggling with the breakup of a 6 year relationship). He just shook his head and walked away. A little while after, I heard he was having a difficult time at work, so I messaged him asking if he'd want to talk about it. He responded, ""No. I already spoke to \[a different friend\] about it - she has a lot more empathy than you."" I don't understand where that came from.  


Things died down a bit after that but R still makes comments that make me uncomfortable. For example, if he tries to video call, I hate video calling, so I often just say, ""I look a hot mess this morning, so I only talk on the phone"" and he'll say, ""I gave you the option to let me see you first thing in the morning and you turned me down."" He could just be making light of it, so I haven't brought it up as an issue.  


This is probably a rambling mess but essentially, he's overstepped the line quite a bit but he's my friend and I want to figure out a way to establish a safe, appropriate friendship.",14Aug2020,1

However, I feel like I haven't learned the smallest thing from college. I was supposed to start an internship last year, but then I had a wreck. I was so scared about it too becuase I felt like they would hate me because I didn't know anything. It didn't matter though since I was in a wreck insight before I was supposed to start and couldn't work. I was enrolled for this semester, but I had to get a new job to get out of the walmart I transfered to after my wreck which was a nightmare compared to the one I worked at before. So I'm working full time now which made me decide to drop the classes anyways. I was tired of school and am ready to just work and live my life because I'm not learning anything there anyways. Everything was going good, the other day a customer I helped actually offered me an assistant manager position at his furniture store making double what I make now starting out, and even more after a few months.

729," I am M(20) and my brother is 25. So I live with my parents and brother,I am in 2nd year of engineering and he is doing post graduation.
*Since last few years I have observed this pattern and I would like to know from you guy.

*So he has always had a behaviour to call me by shit names.From last 1 year he had a habit of calling me an idiot/stupid/dumb from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep, without a reason,if I confronted him he did it more, and it kind of demotivates me as no one wants to hear these things first time you wake up...(I had a very big argument with him last month so he has stopped)

*One more habit,he has a habit of always insulting me in front of relatives and friends,I mean he goes to another level and constantly mocks me, even kids laugh at me when he does this,and when I confronted him once..we had a fight in front of all relatives and he beat me up last year.. which was only because I confronted him for insulating me,the kids laughed again ofcourse...my mom ofcourse never sees this..

*Every time I want to buy something,he lashes out and has a problem with every damn thing,from a t-shirt to a watch to the freaking food I ORDER. Its kinda disheartening to be badmouthed for even the food I order which is quite rare, although he has bought 5 phones, laptop,bike from dad's money...he was against buying me a phone(a very economical one) and still,I can't even buy a nice headphone because he won't allow

*Every time I am doing something that is not studying he has a habit of literally poisoning to my parents that I never study and all I do is waste time, which is unreasonable,this happens soo frequently that he has kindoff made me look like sucker, and honestly I've stopped resisting this now


*My mom has always kindoff ignored this kind of stuff he does until recently,I made her realise his patterns, though she still doesn't confront her for his unreasonable behaviour.

Don't get me wrong he doesn't hate me or something,he guides me with my career and stuff and has some fun too..but at the end I've started disliking that guy these days,I can't help but get extremely angry, Every time I try to forget,there is a new snap at me,I never start a fight,never will,and if I a argue well he doesn't shy away from trying raise a hand on me at this age...

730,"I'll try to keep this short, but I really want to you all background on my life. 

I graduated in the spring and haven't had any luck on landing a job. At the moment, I live in a crummy apartment working a retail job that I hate.  

I'm too poor to go after any real hobbies that I have interest in, and my current work schedule is never consistent. I'd love to pursue welding, wood working, playing the guitar, and focus on my health by getting a personal trainer.   
I've started working out at home, but human interaction really motivates me (which COVID isn't really helping). I feel like a blank person, missing something, because I don't have a passion/hobby to work on. 

The job search is seriously making me feel like a failure and burning me out. I know, I know it's a pandemic and I shouldn't be too hard on myself... but there are tons of jobs I've applied to, to never even get a confirmation email back. They exist, but apparently I'm not worthy, despite my previous experiences that I worked hard to get while in school.

I'm also depressed and personally believe that I have ADHD, but I can't get medical help because I don't have health insurance.

I honestly feel like having a job would just magically solve many of my problems. Expendable income, health insurance, regular schedule etc. So now I'm just kind of hating life because I'm not there yet. All I can do to cope is just fantasize about a life I don't have. 

I've felt this way for a very long time. I was a ""late bloomer"" and graduated at the ripe age of 27. I wasted my early 20's piddling life away. In school, I was always focused on just graduating and getting a job. I never appreciated the present. I've wasted so much of my life hoping for something better. I don't know how to be happy for what I have. 

I consciously know I'm lucky to have a roof on my head, a job, and my health. But it's not an internalized feeling.",14Aug2020,1
731," Hi Team,

I was having an argument with a coworker about autism and vaccine correlation that stemmed from a ""COVID...Mask or no Mask"" conversation. From what I understand, they haven't even established a correlation because we don't know if autism has increased, or our diagnosis of autism has increased with better testing and medical coverage.

At any rate, when talking about studies conducted about vaccines causing autism, he mentioned he doesn't trust studies coming from the CDC because they have a vested interest in lying about the facts. I understand not trusting one study for that reason, but people really like to use this as an excuse to dismiss evidence or lack of evidence presented across multiple studies. Part of it is ignorance, but a part of it is a desire to believe what they already believe.

How do you handle these conversations? How do you educate people on how scientific studies work? (ie., you're supposed to have repeatable studies that get similar results, etc.)",14Aug2020,1

737,"So, to start off, I (male) was friends with this girl back in college. We would go to dinner at the school cafeteria most nights with some of our other friends; we never hung out alone and we're not necessarily the best of friends, but we definitely got along. We didn't talk very much until second semester, and then a few months later covid happened and we all went home, haven't seen her since.  Well, before covid, I did kind of like her and when we went home, I realized I missed her (I missed all of my friends of course, but her especially). Now I don't know if it's just because I'm lonely in quarantine or what, but over these past few months I've been liking her more and more. We would talk in a group chat every once in a while after school was closed, but eventually everybody stopped texting there. I have messaged her on instagram a few times about stuff we talked about in the past, and here's the thing: She took a few hours to respond (sometimes took until the next day), but she would always eventually respond and make jokes/ask questions to keep the conversation going for a bit. She also complimented me sometimes, but she's normally a really positive person so I don't think that means too much. The conversations don't last too long, however, so I can't tell if she even somewhat likes me or was just being friendly (because after all, we're friends).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the thing: thankfully, I'm pretty mentally stable and would be completely okay if she told me she doesn't like me. It might be awkward when we go back to school for a bit, but not a huge deal I don't think. I'm just afraid she'll be uncomfortable around me and I still genuinely want to be friends with her. On the other hand, if she responds and also has feelings for me (honestly I am not expecting this but I just want to get it off my chest) , I don't know what we'd do about it. Next semester school is still closed, and we both take the virus seriously and live hours away from each other, so we couldn't even do anything about it for the next \~6 months, also than text and call (and honestly, I've only been in one relationship and it was pretty weak so not sure if starting off long distance is a good idea ever, especially since I'm not very good at relationships lol).

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I'm leaning towards just waiting until we go back to school to spend more time with her (hopefully) and see if I like her more or if it fizzles away, but honestly I don't want to wait 6 months thinking about her a lot if she's gonna end up not liking me, or if she gets into a relationship or something. Should I tell her, just text her occasionally like I have been doing until she shows more clues, wait until school starts to make sure I really like her (I can't imagine I won't like her tbh lol), or what?!

Best case scenario, I wait 6 months and then we end up really liking each other; worst case scenario, I embarrass myself and wait 6 months only to realize that we're uncomfortable around each other and will never be friends again, not to mention how it might affect our friend group.

739,"tl;dr at bottom for people who don’t want all the extra info

A bit of quick info about myself: 18m, 5’9, weak non-masculine and unattractive features (such as weak chin, weak jaw, bulbous/non defined nose) basically what you’d imagine your average incel looks like. Also a year or two in relative isolation from people around my age (due to family reasons) has made me very unsociable and awkward. 

Honestly this isn’t a post complaining about how I don’t have or can’t find a girlfriend or a bunch of friends. I’m not going to say I don’t care, I do, but I figure that if I can sort myself out and be more comfortable with myself first I may have much more success in that regard. 

Anyways, I’ve been making an effort in the past year to go out more and hangout with friends (although that’s hard for various reasons) and I even tried putting myself out there to get a job. However most of my effort has been useless and has made my self-confidence even lower. The only thing keeping me going is the fact that I managed to lose 40lbs after a lot of hard work. Although I now have smaller biceps than my my 3 year old baby cousin I’m just glad to not be obese and feel unhealthy anymore. 

I’m tired of walking in a room and feeling like I’m inferior, like I don’t belong, like I’m the most unattractive, the weakest, etc. and shaking and choking up when I have to talk to people. I just want to look good and be confident with myself. How can I go about bulking up, improving my physical attractiveness (if that’s possible at this point), and making friendships?

740,"Recently I’ve been feeling burned out, negative and hating my job. I’m a “manager” at a job that has way too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Two of the assistant managers that work there literally do just about everything there. They run shifts, they do orders, they talk to vendors. I’ve been a “manager” for a year but haven’t truly been assigned to do any manager duties till recently when our owners father felt sick and they drove to Texas. I ran two shifts at first and now it's one shift at night which is alright. I feel like I’m babysitting more often than not because 14 year olds work there as well. There have been a few things that have come up that made me question whether I was truly valuable at this job.First thing: A coworker who I got hired there ended up getting another job offer and accepted it. It requires him to move and he wanted to move anyways, so it was all bonuses to him. He told my boss about the offer and my boss is so desperate for people that he counter offered him with a $2.50 raise. As a “manager” I’m still at my starting wage of 13.50 and it's been a year. I was annoyed about that because I literally have been slave at my job, if someone calls out I’m always the first person to agree to come in and or switch shifts. This guy wasn’t, he called  in all the time, he was late plenty of times, and he was still apparently more valuable than I was.Second thing: Once this coworker left, he had his friend hired on a few weeks prior to leaving. His friend got offered a “manager” position. Which doesn’t make sense due to the fact that there are already six managers. Now he makes seven managers. Our boss doesn’t treat him like a manager either though.Third thing: In june I hit an animal crossing the road and totaled my car. My sister works at the same place of work and I asked for the same schedule as her so that I could make it to work and without having to pay for extra gas going back and forth. Well a few weeks that worked out and then suddenly I worked different hours then my sister and had to drive her to work, go back home for an hour, drive to work to go to work, then have her drive home and later on that night come pick me up. Her car is a gas guzzler and our bosses said “Well its her fault for choosing that car, she could of got something cheaper on gas” Okay, thats besides the point, your making us go literally out of our way to have to drive this car more times to this place then anywhere else. Instead of us just being at the same place at the same time. Well that went on for a few weeks till I found a car, I went out of town on my one day off and went to the dealership to get the car, well the dealership isn't working with my bank, blaming my bank for not responding which it was the other way around. Anywho, I had a friend live in that town and I asked to spend the night there and tomorrow Ill head back home with the car. I called my boss and told him Im not making it for my shift the next day. He told me to ask the dealership for a overnight test drive, bring it back home (I'm 3 hours away) and I can drive it back the next day after my shift. I worked from 1130am to 830pm. I would of been back at the dealership at 1am. This is the stuff that my boss expects from me and he told me how much it was a burden that I had to leave town to go find a car. He didn’t give me enough days off to even look for a car, I’ve been working one day off for months now. I finally just put a request in for two days off so that I can start shadowing this job next door.

Once it's time to clock out, I literally wanna run. I dread going into work and once at work, I get thinking about how much I hate being there and how young I am. Why am I tying myself down to a food industry job that I hate? There aren't any good perks about it. One of my old coworkers got a job next door and seems to really love her job. I went over there to hang out when I got a chance and the bosses overheard me hating my life and just being extremely depressed about having to go into work. They offered me a job there, I would lose $1.50 in pay, and lose PTO. Which I rarely even get to use anyways because I’m always working.

The new job isn't in the food industry at all, my bosses understand that life happens and I honestly feel like I can talk to them about anything, I don't feel like I need to hold back on what I’m about to ask or say. I appreciate that a lot because I’m rubber, I bend very easily at other peoples wishes and I tend to put them first before myself. This job will give me weekends off, I’ll work 9 to 5 M-F, an hour lunch. I won't be dealing with rude customers either. I personally cannot see anything wrong with this and believe that this job will make me very happy, but I don't feel secure making a decision like this and I don't know why, I always feel like I need others input on situations like this because they can be life changing.

Every fucking dream is about him. And it’s eating me up inside. We haven’t really spoken other than a few exchanges of words like I miss you &amp; I love you. I wait for him to see my posts on social media everyday.... why? Because I can’t help but still want him to notice that I’m still here. I hate how bad this has affected me. I really do miss him. I spend most nights crying because I don’t want to see him in my dreams.... because the second I wake up he’s gone. Why is it hitting me so hard now that it’s been a few weeks. I don’t like pretending like I’m happy every single day. Most days I hate even waking up just because I know I’ll have another uneventful day. Idk I just hate where I am in life right now.",14Aug2020,1

744,"My sister and I are only a couple years apart in age and we’ve always been pretty close. But now that we’ve grown up and we’re both adults I find myself dreading interaction with her. 

She does this thing where she weaponises her kindness. If I ask what she wants to eat, what movie she wants to watch, what music she wants to listen to, it’s always “whatever you want.” Which is not inherently bad. I do the same thing a lot because I’m genuinely not fussed and don’t have a preference. 

But the thing is she does have a preference. She has something she wants but will never say it no matter how much prompting I try to give her. 

And whenever we get into a disagreement, she’ll use this against me to prove a point that I’m selfish and mean and she’s /so/ nice and accommodating to me. We never do what she wants and always do what I want because she’s /so/ kind. 

If I was the only person she did this to, I’d be somewhat okay with it. But she does this to everyone. She genuinely believes that’s she is the most empathetic, accommodating person who does everything for everyone else and that other people are just awful and terrible for not extending the same courtesy to her. 

I want to be able to talk to her about this and tell her how it hurts me. She has more than once used her “kindness” as a way to tell me she thinks I’m a bad person. But any time I try to say anything critical of her she shuts down. 

It’s probably worth mentioning that she does suffer from mental health issues and I know that’s a big part of why she does this. But I also believe that to an extent mental illness is not an excuse to act shitty to those around you. 

I guess I just want advice on how to approach her about this or how to do things on my end to mitigate it.",14Aug2020,1

747,"Hey all,

I hope this is the right sub to ask this question and I would appreciate if you could advice or share your experience/thoughts. 

I was thinking about asking my father for financial support to buy a house. I have some savings but some help would be very helpful. Now the thing is I grew up without him, I was raised by my mom only. He has other family and other kids that Ive never met. We never received any child support or anything like that. We never showed up at his door and demanded anything. As I always remember he always been lets say ""financially stable"". He still owns one of the biggest oil transportation companies and has several houses and condos. But Im not trying to count somebody else's money.

He never tried to see me or contact me whatsoever until when I moved to US when I was 25. He found my phone number and called me saying he would like to meet me and help me to find a job and help me with housing. But later something happened and he just stopped answering my phone calls. I thought maybe his family was against him meeting me or whatever. 

Im 31 now and started thinking settling down and getting a house. And I thought about trying to contact him again and sent him Facebook friend request which he accepted and we exchanged phone number there was back and forth messages going on. 

Do you think it is appropriate to ask him for support? Honestly I don't know how to start that convo or if I should ask him at all. Please advice me. 

Thank you!",14Aug2020,1

750,"I (19F) have been living with my parents to go community college, finish my first two years of college and be some what financially stable. Being a first born child of two immigrants has taken a great toll on my mental, emotional and even physical health and I no longer can draw out my financial dependency on my parents. 

With the pandemic going on I’ve been in out of almost three jobs at this point and I’m scrambling to save as much money for the time being. I’m not exactly sure when I’m going to be moving out: I’m planning for the earliest October/November and at the latest December/January. I currently have a little more than 3K saved up. I hopefully plan to have around 5K/6K at very least when I finally leave. This is so I would have at least 3 months worth of rent plus some for extra expenses.

What are somethings I should be considering beforehand that most people don’t know/think about before a big change like this? When I move what are some of the challenges I’m going to deal with?

So I'm doing Software Development in College and my results are fine all the way through the years even up until my final year all my results are good. 

The problem is, is that in 4th year we have research phase and an implementation phase and due to a number of reasons, some of which is my fault some of which were not led to the entire project being completely fucked and now I'm going to fail. I got a job based on the fact I would be getting my degree and I told them that I hadn't gotten my degree yet and they still wanted me to start but I can't enjoy the job because I know I'm going to fail.

At the moment I'm so unbelievably stressed out to the point that I can't sleep, can't eat and I'm physically pulling my hair out. My gf knows the situation but my family think because I got the job it's all good and won't here much else, I just kind of wish this was a bad dream I could wake up form but it's not, it's reality and I'm having a really hard time coping with it. 

I really don't want to repeat but I know I'm have to have to. I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose the job and I to be honest I just feel like crying my eyes out and sleeping for 2 weeks

Has anyone been in a similar situation to this if so any advice on how to deal with it because my mental health is starting

752,"This is my first Reddit post so I apologize if I do anything wrong. Also, this will be quite lengthy, so I apologize for that as well.

Backstory: I (16f) was dating my ex-boyfriend, we'll call him B1, for nearly three years. After a certain point, I had really started to lose feelings for him, and I saw him as more of a close friend. He was very controlling, manipulative, was a serial gaslighter, and he had a lot of communication issues. I really wanted to break up with him for a while, but I had a lot of friendship issues in the past that left me with a lot of anxiety about being alone, he was the only person that was consistently in my life, and he quite frequently would manipulate me into thinking I was the bad guy. I didn't want to leave him and then have nothing.

During the last year of our relationship, I became very close to a couple of his good friends, and we developed a small but close friend group. One of his friends, in particular, I got very close to, we'll call him B2. I eventually developed feelings for B2, as he was always there for me and helped me with a lot of boyfriend-related and personal issues. My feelings for B2 got so strong during the quarantine that I was thinking about him constantly, and whenever we hung out in our friend group (socially distanced), I felt like the feelings kept getting stronger. After a stupid fight that my boyfriend instigated, I realized that I really could not stand to be with him for much longer, which made me question my feelings for B2 even more. I eventually decided to let B2 know how I felt about him, and I told B1 that I wanted a break.

Turns out, B2 had some feelings for me as well, and had been flirting with me for a while without me really noticing. Finding out that he liked me back made me happier than B1 had made me in almost a year. I decided that I was finally going to break up with B1 so that I could further explore things with B2. Once I did break up with B1, I didn't feel sad at all really, I was just excited to be able to get with B2. 

Neither one of us wanted a relationship, we were just exploring a friend with benefits type thing. We hung out alone for the first time after single, and it was weird, but also great. He was surprisingly affectionate. He held my hand everywhere we walked, was super cuddly if we sat down anywhere, and kissed me a lot. I was super comfortable around him and for the first time in years, I felt truly happy. After that day we hung out a couple more times and eventually hooked up a few times as well. My feelings for him only got stronger, and that worried me especially because he made it clear that he didn't want a relationship. He was very confusing to me, he was so affectionate while we were alone together, but over text, he didn't really flirt, compliment me, or talk to me much at all. I tend to over-romanticize and daydream a lot, to the point where doing so made my feelings for him even stronger. The feelings eventually became overwhelming, but I developed a lot of anxiety over the fact that I probably wasn't the only girl. I decided to talk to him about my feelings and worries, and it went horribly.

He was consistently talking to other girls, and claimed to not mean to be so affectionate while we were together. This really hurt me, because as someone with a lot of previous self-confidence issues and a lot of anxiety, I kept telling myself that all of the other girls that he was still talking to were all prettier than me and had better bodies than I did and it really took a toll on my mental health. Eventually, he stopped asking to hang out/hook up and was kind of cold towards me, it was like he was emotionally ghosting me, while still being my friend. It was driving me crazy because he never said anything to me about losing feelings, and I couldn't tell if I was just overthinking or if I was right. I ended up asking him if he had lost feelings for me and he basically said that he had and he was too scared to say anything. This really took a huge toll on my mental health. I was already depressed, and this made me feel like I was unlovable, that if he didn't want me, no one ever would, and this made me incredibly self-conscious. Slowly I started to feel better, and I tried to put my feelings for him aside and move on. 

B2, a close friend of mine, and I have developed a small friend group, we hang out constantly and talk to each other on discord pretty much every night. I thought that my efforts to get over him were working, but I was sorely mistaken. Some days, I feel fine, I feel like I'm getting over him. But occasionally when I am having a really rough day, and he talks about another girl, I get incredibly jealous and self-conscious for no reason. I overthink everything and end up hurting my own feelings about everything that he does and it sucks. I have tried to move on, and I have other available options to move on, but a part of me feels weird for doing so because (this sounds dumb) I don't want to hurt B2's feelings. I haven't told him any of this because I really don't know how he'd react and I feel so stupid for liking him so much. But he's still my best guy friend and I really just want my emotions to stop getting in the way of our friendship. 

I know it probably sounds like I am greatly overreacting, I definitely feel like I am. I really just need to find a way to get over him, while maintaining our close friendship. I am open to any suggestions.

PS: I am not just throwing around the words anxiety and depression, I have been diagnosed with both by a medical professional. I just thought I should clarify.",14Aug2020,1

C really likes to be at work and works really hard in addition to taking on extra responsibilities and learning beyond her current role. Naturally she became one of my core people and started working many hours. For more context she is clearly malnourished and for the first few weeks I didnt see her eat at all while at work even though its very commonplace among all employees.

One night after close we are all getting ready to leave and I notice that C is intending to walk home. Its dark and she's young and what would be a 60 minute walk for her is a 5 minute drive for me. I offered her a ride home and on the way to her house I noticed she was crying. I calmly asked her if everything was okay to which she responded, she was scared to go home as her mom is mad at her and that means she's going to hit her when she gets home.

I had suspicions of some form of abuse up to this point but after being told that I probed a bit further without pushing and did my best to console her. Over the next month or so I took her home often, picked her up etc. We had many more conversations like that increasingly in depth. This girl sustains abuse like I could never imagine in so many ways and to top it off, her step dad will regularly come in her room at night and rape her.

761,So I was bored one day and decided to open up the dark web because why not. I opened up one of those directories and was looking at all the crazy shit like drugs and gore. And I really enjoy gore for some reason but that’s a whole different story. Basically I saw this site all about free child porn and I just decided to click it. At first it was just girls in swimsuits around 15. Whatever. I’m 14 so that stuff didn’t really phase me since those girls are around my age. But I clicked on a section. The darker section.

Sometimes it’s so bad I stick my fingers down my throat and throw up and it makes me feel better. I just can’t. I hate this world it makes me angry.

I feel nothing. Good and bad things happen and it doesn't matter. Never have. Maybe when I was a kid I'd care, but at some point for some reason I stopped caring. I didn't actually care about class or friends or family. I do things because I'm supposed to. 

I have empathy issues but I don't act on that. I have to pretend a lot. I used to lie to people for fun when I was a teenager, but I stopped because it caused problems. Obviously I don't do it anymore. I know what's right and what's wrong. 

I really don't feel things. 

But I feel EVERYTHING with one person. At every point in my life there has been at least one person that I feel everything with. All the emotions you can imagine, very strong and very fast. Change from the most intense joy to the most intense disgust in 1 minute. I'm older now so I've learned not to react based on those emotions because making decisions then will mean I will regret it. 

I feel nothing. I don't care. My father almost dies and I just keep playing candy crush. But then the one person tells me something I don't like and I'm crying hopelessly or fantasizing about murder (which I'd never do). 

Both states are exhausting. I hate not feeling anything. I hate having to do crazy shit to feel ANYTHING. But I hate being obsessed with one person and having my everything depend on one person. 

I've been friends with this guy for over 4 years. He became THE person 2 years ago. We started dating last year. I care about him. I don't want to hurt him. 

It's exhausting. He's really patient and considerate but this isn't fair. I don't know if I love him. I've told him I do but I don't know if it's true. I don't know if I've felt love? I want to be with him all the time and I want him to want to be with me. But there's been problems because I'm selfish (and many things with my empathy problem. Sometimes I forget to pretend around him. He knows the truth though). 

What's wrong with me? I'm desperate at this point. I'm so exhausted. I keep picking fights with him and he's going to leave eventually. I'm not suicidal so there's no danger of that but I think I really need to understand what is wrong with my head and my emotions",14Aug2020,1
764,"Hey. 21/Male here.

I tried posting this on r/letsnotmeet but they take a long time accepting any post and i'm panicking to be honest. No, I am not making this up. I'm genuinely scared. 

I just recently moved out from my foster father's home, and as you can guess, this is my first time living alone so maybe I'm just paranoid? Idk.

It all started at my workplace. I work at some low-life gas station store at like the outskirts of the town. I got a nightshift because it was the only spot open, and the place is only a ten minute drive from my place. Besides, they barely get any costumers at night, so it's usually just me chilling in there alone, restocking some shelves, and that's it. The costumers that come in are all cool and they all just get what they want and leave, but then there was his one guy.

He's around 47-50 I think. Pretty jacked, and he's got a creepy face. I can't explain it, he just does. So he came in, and he was taking so damn long picking what he wanted. He was taking forever. He kept walking around slowly, and he kept looking back at me. My first thought was that he was trying to steal without me seeing it, but then when he was looking at me he looked like he was daring me? Just looking so intently for some seconds, then just resumed looking. He kept walking around, and the whole thing just felt so off. He didn't say anything, so after a few minutes I asked if I could help him, and he just gave another one of those looks, and stayed silent. After like fifteen minutes of him just slowly walking around, he grabbed a beer and paid for it. He paid with cash, and when I handed him back the change, he just f*cking stared at me. Mind you, he still didn't say one word. And I just stood there, holding out his change, and I had such a bad feeling about him. He was looking at me like he was studying me, he was even squinting a little bit. After like ten seconds he silently took the change and just left without a word.

I was pretty freaked out. I was just so glad that he left, and I thought that maybe he could see that I was gay? I'm not shoving it in anyone's face. I don't think I look gay, but that was the only thing that made sense, that he was perhaps silently judging me for being gay, although I did nothing to give that away. 

That was the beginning. Next thing I know, I'm sitting in the park, I had some grocery bags with me and I was finishing up my ice cream on the bench, and that guy was sitting on a nearby bench, doing the same thing where he pretended to look at other things, then just stared at me for some seconds. Obviously, he creeped me out so I got up with my stuff and went home.

Around like two days later, I was at the thrift shop, just looking through some stuff, and at some point I looked up and he was across the small shop, looking at me. And obviously I'm like what the f*ck. It seemed like it would be way too much of a coincidence, so he followed me here. The town I live in is not very big, so I'm still hoping that he keeps bumping into my by accident. Anyways, I just ignored him, paid for some clothings that I picked and then left. I got in my car, locked the door immediately, and out of curiousity I waited a litte bit to see if he would follow me outside. Ten seconds after I got in my car, the guy walked out, leaned against the tree near my car with his arms crossed, and just f*cking stared at me. Like he was daring me. Again.

Once again, I panicked. I stared back at him for a few seconds, then I just pulled out of the parking spot and drove home. That was two days ago. I had a day off yesterday, but tonight, I gotta go back to work. And honestly, I'm worried. I'm gonna be all alone again.

I'm not even sure why I'm making this post. Anyone got some advice perhaps? I'm so fed up. I don't think the cops would take me seriously.",14Aug2020,1

I was walking my dog around the park near my home when he got adamant about sniffing another dog. I don’t know what breed it was but it was bigger than him, he’s a miniature schnauzer and I’d guess the other dog was the size of a border collie. Now, for some reason my dog isn’t one to wag his tail when meeting others so I tend to pay attention to how the other dog is reacting more. If my dog doesn’t like something he’ll growl but he has never bitten anyone. He sometimes can be a bit pushy even when I can tell that the other dog is not liking it so I tend to pull him away, but this time the other dog seemed happy. He had tried to sniff my dog first and he was wagging his tail when out of the blue he bit him. 

He wouldn’t let him go. His owner pulled him away but that only dragged my dog with him and I tried to pull but immediately got scared that I was gonna hurt my dog more. His owner was yelling at his dog and kind of hitting his head to get him to let go but he wasn’t reacting. My dog was crying, I was yelling too and I didn’t know what to do because everything that I could think of could end badly. Eventually he let go and immediately I picked my dog up and took him to the other side of the street, without crossing the road. The owner stood there, holding his dog while I calmed myself and my dog down enough to check how hurt he was. 

To be honest I was mostly in shock I think. There were a lot of people around and a man tried to help me check but my dog didn’t like that. I checked him as best as I could but I couldn’t find anything. I was bleeding and I didn’t know why (from how the wound looks it’s most likely it was from the retractable leash but I didn’t notice until I started checking my dog and thought the blood was his first). I have passed out from seeing my own blood before so I wanted to get home quickly. I told the owner we were fine and I left. I didn’t even think about asking for his info, I wasn’t sure if I was gonna pass out or not and I was only one block from home. 

My dad took my dog to the vet and he only had one small teeth mark that I missed. It didn’t even need stitches. He’s fine and doesn’t even care about getting close to other dogs, even bigger ones than him. He doesn’t like if they get close to his neck but that’s understandable really. I’m the one that’s scared of letting him sniff other dogs and he loves socialising, it’s just that I feel guilty and I don’t want him to get hurt again. 

Honestly I don’t know what to do. Sometimes I let him get close but I feel awful the whole time. I’m ready to pick him up and run, or I’m jumpy even. It’s just awful.",14Aug2020,1
769,"I’m struggling deciding what to get my wife for our 20th wedding anniversary.

I could upgrade her diamond stud earrings to simply larger diamonds, which I can pay out of pocket for (should be less than a thousand).

OR, I could upgrade her wedding ring, but for that I will need probably 2x or 3x more funds for. I have a really nice watch my father gave to me for my 40th, but I don’t wear very often because it’s a little flashy and not very comfortable to wear. A local jeweler near me buys/resells watches, and could give me enough store credit to get my wife’s ring upgraded (bigger diamond), and also allow me to buy another watch that would still be very nice, and would be more my style. I’m just worried that my father would be hurt that I got rid of the watch he gave me...

Which route should I go? I think the wife would prefer to have her ring upgraded because the diamond in it is pretty modest, from 20 years ago...but she does wear those earrings every single day.",14Aug2020,1
770,"Hi Reddit, I’m 17 years old going into my senior year of high school. I am extremely stressed out with how everything is going, I know it’s out of my control but I can’t help it. I’m so stressed I started crying about it so I decided to ask if anyone had advice. 

I know it’s very selfish of me to be upset about not being able to have a normal senior year because I know this virus is very serious and some people have it a lot harder, I’m just down that I’ve been looking forward to this year to have nothing and be online. I don’t even have choices of elective classes this semester. I currently received my PCA certification and was looking forward to my CNA class this year so I can graduate as a CNA but that class isn’t being offered right now. I’m stressed because it’s free in high school and now that will be another year after high school. 

I feel like my goals and things I looked forward to are gone right now and I feel like a failure and that i’m not accomplishing anything. I had to reschedule my senior pictures just because I feel so down, I’m not excited about anything just upset. Does anyone know what I can do to feel more positive about this year?",14Aug2020,1

My dad admittedly went through her phone because she kept lying to him about HUGE things I won't go into detail about, so he needed to see if there was anything else she was hiding.

He found out she had Snapchat (which she lied admire not having) so he went into her messages. One friend. His name was Patrick. We saw two meesages:

Step mom: ""Do whatever u want 2 me. Make me ur bitch.""

Patrick: ""Sounds good to me. When do they leave?""

His message was from only an hour ago. We're missing some messages between those two because they showed they were deleted, but these back and forth texts apparently spanned about four months of time.

This lead us to dig deeper and we found a text message chain between her and her ex boyfriend Moe talking about how much they miss eachother and can't wait to fuck again.

My dad confronted her about it and she fessed up. She said ""it was only 1 time, it was a mistake."" We have proof that it was NOT a one time thing. She's STILL lying, clearly not remorseful and only mad that she was caught.

How do me and my siblings get past this? My 11 year old step sibling specifically is extremely depressed. She hid it for a long time but finally opened up to me about how she feels like she'd be better off having never lived in the first place because the abuse and lies from her mom are unbearable and unforgivable.

I just started a new job and..well, as the title said, my trainer is an absolute bully. She condescendingly bitches me out nearly every day and every day she finds something new to critique, things that are not issues if anyone else does them, or things that never were an issue for the two months I have been there, but suddenly are now. Its like she has a handbook of things to be nasty about lol. She speaks to me like I am stupid, like I am a piece of garbage on the road. I explain that i am sorry but when she isn't here I just ask my co-workers (who are cross-trained to work in my position as well) what to do, or that i really do try and do everything she asks me to do, and do it how she shows me..because its the truth, I do. And when I get one thing down, she finds something else to be nasty about. Even yesterday this happened. She bitched me out and then, right after, was sweet as pie to my co-worker when she asked ""did you tell Eiliidh to do this?""

I’m now not so sure if the Masters is worth it.

The current program I’m enrolled in is pretty niche and I am not sure if the ROI will be there. The debt accrued would be somewhere around ~$50k and I’m not sure a job relevant to the Masters will see the increase in salary that would deem it worthy but could mean I’m happier with the job.

782,"I live in a city near Boston, MA in a relatively densely-packed residential neighborhood.  I'm lucky in that I have off-street parking in a small lot (about four vehicles worth, of which I have one spot) just off the relatively major street to the side of the apartment building. Trash and recycling go out once a week, generally on the curb at the front of the apartment building.

Lately, the neighbors in the other half of the building (it's a duplex house that was converted into six apartments across two addresses) have been placing their trash on the curb at the side of the building instead, which is fine, but about half the time they place their bins directly behind my car. This wasn't a huge issue pre-COVID, but when I'm about to get in my vehicle, the last thing I want to do at this point is move their garbage around. Even on the weeks that they don't leave the bins behind me, the garbage and recycling workers inevitably put them down in that spot.

If there were ambiguity, I'd get it. Some people park their vehicles on the curb in places that aren't actually lots or driveways. But this lot is designated by a very clear fence, a slant to the street rather than a raised curb, and a telephone pole pretty much just at the end of the lot (far enough from the edge that I don't risk hitting it when I back out).

Putting the bins on the opposite side of the pole (a move of a couple of feet) would solve the issue; there's no drive anywhere near there and the sidewalk is just as wide as the slant to the street from the lot, so it wouldn't interfere with anyone walking. I'm a bit confused as to why this doesn't occur to them.

That said, I don't want to assume the worst of either my neighbors or the garbage and recycling workers, so I'd like to go about this congenially. I don't know exactly who's doing it, or when, and was wondering what the best option for addressing this peacefully might be? I've considered putting a sign on the telephone pole asking them to leave the bins on the other side, but that seems like it might come off as passive aggressive.

783,"TW: sexual abuse , csa 

tl;dr : should I tell my bf that my cousin molested me? my cousin faced no consequences for what he has done. my parents know and did nothing. we’re practically normal cousins on the outside view and also have many mutual ties. my bf knows of him but haven’t met him and don’t know what he has done. 

This is a long one... 
I was molested by my cousin (let’s call him Jack, M27) on my dad’s side from the age of about 8 to 12. So he started doing this to me when he was 12 and he stopped when he was about 17. I didn’t realize it was wrong until I started hitting 12 and getting aggravated when he’d try so he’d stop.The crazy thing, he admitted what he did to me to my mom. 

I guess he had a guilty conscious and confessed to what he had been doing. She told my dad who scolded me. Idk if he told them how long or what he’d do but I’m sure he just told them enough because my mom took me to the OBGYN to make sure I was good. All I really remember was the doctors asking if we actually had sex bc in being so young it could mess w/ me having children in the future. We didn’t. After that? Everything went back to “normal”.  No one talked about it, the trip to the doctor, nothing. Almost as if it never happened. Being young once again I just went with the flow. I thought it was something we never talked about. Now, 10 years passed and I still talk to that same cousin. I’d bury what he did to me deep in the back of my mind and act like nothing happened , that was my normal. 

I’m 22 now and I cant hold them back in anymore. It haunts me. I was so young, I didnt know any better. My parents? Why didn’t they do more? Im disgusted with myself. I still see Jack now and then at family functions &amp;amp; we talk casually. He’d hug me when it’s time to go &amp;amp; id get awkward. Try to dodge them smoothly, but other than that you’d think we were normal cousins. This don’t even take the cake. Get this. 

I’m a gamer &amp;amp; play w my other cousin on my mom’s side (let’s call him Phil) who’s 6mo older than me and like a brother to me. He knows Jack through family parties &amp;amp; met him around 8yo, he’s turning 23. Through playing games and hanging out, I’ve met Phil’s rl friends and we’ve both made mutual friends through gaming. Guess who also know them through gaming w us and hanging out? Jack. He plays online with us too. I also went to the same school w Jack meaning it was a Middle School and High School, so I met his friends who all also know my mom bc we’d have parties  and they’d come. I know it’s a bit confusing but I’m just letting you understand through 10 years, Jack and I live life like normal family do &amp;amp; have many many mutual ties. Through family on both sides, to friends online and off. 

Now this comes into relationship advice bc I’m dating my bf who’s amazing to me and I want to spend my life with and he’s speaking on us moving in together.He met Phil and Phil has asked me when am I going to introduce my bf to Jack. Jack even asks me when he’s going to meet him and acts as if he’ll do the big brother rough him up bit. I get silent every single time. My boyfriend cannot meet my molester. That’s sick. I want to tell him so bad about that part of me but I feel like he’d snap or not want to be around my family(which would be reasonable). He’d want to do something and if he sees Phil- who hangs out with &amp;amp; respects Jack-he may tell him and that will start a domino effect of “Did you know?” 

Trust me I want to tell my bf and Phil so bad. But so many people are attached to this and they don’t even know it. In building our future I dont think it’s fair to hide what Jack has done and who he is bc if I have a baby w my bf, I know he wouldn’t want him around our child. He won’t want him in our home. He wouldn’t want me in contact with him. Which is ALL fair. It’s just that it would throw so many ppl off and to explain why will throw them off even more. 

Sometimes I wish I could just disappear. I tried hiding from this horrid experience and it’s tearing into my reality. Should I tell my bf before we decide to move forward in moving in with each other and building a life with one another?",14Aug2020,1

785,"I’ve basically been playing baseball since I was 6-7 years old and have grown to keep playing and have gained more interest in it as time when on. Now, as a 16 year old. I’m approaching my junior year of high school and have played high school baseball, travel, and all sorts of variations of the sports. I am a pretty above average pitcher and would say I’m elite for my age but am honestly not having as much fun as I was a few years ago and beforehand. When I did have fun, I remember playing and just having a good time with my teammates and when I wasn’t taking it extremely seriously I would just do good naturally. However, now I feel like it’s getting too competitive and extremely seriously to the point where it’s burning me out and I almost feel as if I’m just playing by a small thread to not disappoint my father/parents, and even some friends. I essentially now force myself to play the sport when’s it’s not even in my best interest anymore. My parents are supportive with it and have been but most notably my father, he has spent so much money with tournaments, club team fees, assessments, lessons, and almost everything you can think of in the sport world to make me a better athlete. I have learned to appreciate what he has done for me, but am still doubtful it’s worth it because at this point I no longer feel like I have the temptation and best interest of playing. I don’t wasn’t to disappoint him at all and feel like there’s a massive burden held on my back because of all the money he’s spent because of this sport I’m playing. I’ve thought about training hard and working endlessly to prove people wrong to see if I could be in a position when I’m able to at least get some sort of scholarship signing or grant to play on a team in a college or even possible play professionally in the future. Unfortunately, having dreamed of that from when I was younger to now I just feel like at this point in time it’s not that I don’t want to work hard to get there, it’s that my motivation aspirations of doing this are dwindling because I just no longer have as much fun as I did in the beginning. I am still unsure of quitting the sport or not, I really just don’t want to completely disappoint my dad and make him feel like I’m just a quitter who doesn’t want to put the work in the become successful, and hate the fact he’s spent so much money and time to make me better and I don’t want to just throw that away. At this point in time currently, I just feel like I’m playing because I’m forced too rather than actually really wanting to play myself. I know if I told my father I wanted to quit he would be fine with it, the problem is I feel like I’ve came to far and would just be Fucking  my father over at this point. I’ve went through all the bullshit of bad coaching, any adversity you go through while playing a sport and have learned to overcome it so a bad coach or something did or has not been the reason in my final decision. The fact of the matter is, I really am just not having the fun I was in the past playing that I am now. If anybody can respond or provide some sort of feedback it would be greatly appreciated.

I don't exactly know if I'm normal and if people will accept me so I'm looking how to change or advice on if I should even change.

I'm a white guy and I like women of color, I know that much is normal. The thing that makes me question myself is that fact that the majority of women I feel attracted to are women of color. Out of all the girls I've crushed on and felt attracted to throughout my life there have been only about 5 white women that I've been attracted to and the majority are black women. Is any other guy in the same boat as me? 

I know that all of my friends like white women and I always see white men with white women so I think I'm supposed to be attracted to white equally to other races if not more. Is there something wrong with me since I'm basically the opposite or is it like some kind of normal quirk? 

I don't intentionally look for non-white girl to be attracted to, it's just most of the time I catch feelings for a girl she happens to be black or another race. I don't know why I'm usually attracted to non white women, it's never something that I can put my finger on, I just feel in love when I meet the right girl. What would make me feel attracted to more woc than white women? 

Should I consider getting a therapist or something to discover why I'm like this and how I can make myself like everyone else? I don't know why I'm basically only attracted to women of color, I didn't grow up around many POC and but the first girl I ever really liked was Indian so maybe that's why? 

I feel like changing myself into liking all women equally is going to be good for me in the long run because I'm afraid I'll turn into one of those weird guys who only goes for black women and has an obsession with all the stereotypes of black women. And my friends make fun of me sometimes because the last few girls I've liked and told them about have been non white so I want to be more like them to avoid the teasing. 

I don't want people to think I'm like those weird guys but I'm getting close to this one black girl and I really like her more than anyone else before. Can I even avoid people thinking I'm like those weird guys other than purposely not dating women or color?",14Aug2020,1

I am going to uni next year and I will be leaving my family and I haven't spend a lot of time with my younger brothers. Mainly because they look a lot like me and it reminds of my past. It makes envious that they have such a nice childhood compared to mine.


 I feel like I am disappointing them by not spending time with them, but at the same time I think if I spend time with them I would mentally hurt myself. I am not even really sure how to explain this to my therapist. 

I am struggling between disappointing them or hurting myself to be with them. Should choose myself or them?

I have done a lot for them, but those things are invicible to them, because they don't understand it yet...

795,"I have been close friends with this girl since my freshman year of high school. We have some awesome memories, have taken many trips together, and she has been there for me in some really tough moments. She is also close with my two best friends, so we often all hung out together.  However, I’ve realized (especially recently) that she is toxic to be around. She is constantly making rude comments about me or my other friends. She is the queen of micro aggressions and passive aggressive-ness. I slowly distanced myself from her, and although I miss her, I felt like it was better for my own good. What’s difficult was that when my two best friends were with her, I always had to come up with an excuse of why I couldn’t come. It has led to me seeing my (positive-influence) best friends less, and I feel distanced from them and lonely. I saw her a few days ago for the first time in a couple of months, and the entire time she commented on the fact that I don’t “come around” anymore. The awkward part is we were with our two other friends who I have still been hanging out with separately from her. I know I probably should let go of her, but I honestly don’t know how without isolating myself even more.",14Aug2020,1

802,"First time redditer here hopefully some of you guys can give me some advice,

So this year I took a gap year from school, because I wasn't really sure what I wanted to take in university. I'm really interested in film, so I decided to apply to UBC for a bachelor of fine arts in film production. Stupidly, I only applied to one university, and didn't get in to UBC, because I wasn't competitive enough, and they said that I should apply again next year. Again, stupidly, I got really caught up in not getting in, because I had told all my friends, and family where I had applied, and they were all really excited to know that I might get in, but I didn't. 

Since It was already so late in the year, by the time I found out I didn't get in there wasn't really any universities, i was interested in going to, but again I was so caught up in not getting in, and having my family and friends be disappointed that I wasn't going to a university, that I decided that I should just apply to one of my home town universities. I got into a program sort of like general studies that lets students take classes for their desired program, but also lets students upgrade their high school grades, so that they can remain competitive, because they still have to apply again for the actual degree they want for the following year. This university, does not offer, any sort of film production program, or film studies program, so I figured I would apply for a bachelor in business for next year, but I'm having second thoughts, and really don't know if I want to spend the next five years in my home town studying something I'm really not that interested in.

I still have three days now before my tuition is due (around 2500 bucks). My dad is happy to pay for it, but again I don't even know if I really want to take these super generic general studies classes, just so I can apply again to a degree, I'm not even that interested in. 

I still have time to back out, but not a lot of time so some advice would be really helpful. Thanks",14Aug2020,1

Note: Because of the violence (punches) this cannot go on AmITheAsshole.

I know the title sounds bad but hear me out.

I(34M) have a brother(40M) and a SIL(38F) they have a daughter(17F.) Their daughter a spoiled brat and is used to getting whatever she wants. Me and my wife (35F) had a gathering at our house last Friday, it is quite big so we have enough room to social distance, we had not met up since the start of lockdown so we thought it would be nice to them and my sister (42F) and her kids. I recently bought a fairly expensive watch, I have a good job so I splashed out 5K on a good and reliable one. Niece saw my watch and immediately asked how much it was and I said the price, she went to my brother and she just asked him if he could buy her one, he said no but was still willing to buy a watch for her for £200! She got upset and said she wanted the one I had. My brother then came to me and said if I could give my one to her, I could not believe my ears and just started laughing. Then he said, ""you can buy here one then."" That made me laugh even more. He got a bit annoyed and then left. Niece was in threw a strop for the rest of the gathering and still believed she was entitled to the watch.

2 Nights later I am woken up by my wife saying she heard footsteps coming from downstairs, she was freaking out our kids (1 boy and 1 girl) were sleeping and she did not want to wake them up. I heard footsteps coming up the stairs, in our house the stairs curve while going up and there was a railing behind the railing at the top of the stairs. As the robber was coming around the last few steps I jumped and swung a punch which knocked the robber down the stairs. I rushed down the stairs to see another robber, I ended up getting into a fight with the other robber. I ended up pinning him to the floor, my wife came rushing down to see what was going on, she had phoned the police and ripped off the mask of the other robber, it was my niece she was knocked out, the other guy claimed to be her boyfriend(18M). I kept him in a pin until the police arrived they then handcuffed him. An ambulance arrived for my niece a few minutes later as well. Our son (9) and daughter (7) both had seen this, there were standing on the stairs. After the police left the house we all went to bed. My son was relatively calm through all of this and quickly went back to bed. He had a football match earlier that day so he might have been tired, my daughter was really scared so she spent the rest of the night in my and my wife's bed. She had gymnastics practice but she did not sleep much so she did not go. My wife and I comforted her most of the night.

My niece is in hospital and suffered some minor head injuries. My brother and his wife are threatening to sue me. I am worried because she is a minor and these sort of assault charges might be taken very seriously. My sister is on my side, but My brother's ILs are furious with me.

I have arranged for both kids to see a therapist because even though our son did not worry like our daughter did, it might have not really hit him that some people tried to burgle us. the next day I went to replace the locks that were broken, (the broken locks are with the police for evidence.)

So I have two questions reddit, one: Could I face charges for assault? I have a lawyer who will fight for my case already, but I would also like to seek some advice here as well, any is appreciated. This can be advice for anything such as relationship with my family going forward etc.

Also I would like to add in my opinion if you break into my and my wife's house, you pose a threat, to my wife and my children. So I don't think punching someone who I thought was a burglar was a wrong move, my brother and SIL said I was the asshole for not getting my niece the watch because, ""I had the money to."" I do have the money to but I don't think I should have to spend 5k on a kid that is not even mine. Anyway reddit, AITA?",14Aug2020,1
804,"I’ve been contemplating on whether to completely get rid of all distractions in my life to focus on college. The biggest distractions is gaming. 

I’ve been gaming on average somewhere between 6-12 hours a day over the summer, and college is now in a week. I have countless online friends that I’ve known for YEARS and it’s hard for me to say goodbye. However, I have found myself emotionlessly playing games for hours on end; but I feel like I can stop myself from doing that. 

At this point, I just need to know if college is something that requires full attention 8 hours a day, or it’s not as bad as everyone makes it out too be.

805,"Backstory:  
I am a 26M who is reasonably close to my cousin but over years it seems distance has grown  but there are some behaviours that still seem odd with her though.

Let's just call her M.

Like , very occassionally I hear from her.I have ""hungout"" with her but it feels weird because in those instances I have had someone else with me and it feels like she said yes because there was other person involved.When there is no other person with me,I don't get any personal messages from her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is she has moved reasonably close to my house and is in dentist school.She asked me to be her ""client"" for the school in the last few month and I said ok[.](https://semester.It) It was fine the first few times around but last time around a month ago I went something strange happened.

She messaged me and asked me if I can come for the appt next day?I said yes.She asked me for the ride and I said it's fine I can come in.

The next day when I reach the clinic,something weird happens.I go in and I tell the front desk that I have appointment with x at this time,she tells me did you get an email about covid.I politely declined and then they say if you have gotten appointment,you should have gotten it.Then she asks me who do I have appt with and I tell I am her from M.She asks me my name and I tell her that.Meanwhile,the person sitting at covid check desk goes in and comes [back.As](https://back.As) she comes back,she asks me ""Are you M's cousin?.I nod and say yes.She says ""She told you to go home.sorry."" I was shocked but I gather courage and tell her ok and leave.

After few minutes I reply to her. ""What happened? At least tell me if the plans have changed.""

In few hours,she replies back to me. ""bro,I couldn't finish my first few clients in time.I would have gotten in trouble.I'm so sorry.I was there since early morning and in clinic They won't let you touch your phone because of COVID.""

At this point,I am not sure what to say so I just reply ""ok"".

A few days later,her older brother was in town and we met up at her place because she was at cottagefor her birthday.That same day,I tried to call her to wish her happy birthday(and talk about the appt incident)and as usual she did not pick up.A couple of days later she messages saying ""sorry I did not get signal,I was at cottage,why did you call?' and I just say hbd and she replied saying ""thank you"".

Today,I get message from her again.""Hey would you be able to come tommorow for appt .Yes or no is fine please just let me know!"". I replied back ""I am sorry I waon't be able to"".Right of the bat,I am hit with couple of messages in a row.Essentially,she said ""Are you going to be able to come at all For me In the next week?I have slot open for \[insert day of the week\] [morning.It](https://morning.It)'s end of my sem and I have to finish [everyone.So](https://everyone.So) if ur not coming I have to find someone to hopefully replace idk"".

Now this was really off [putting.It](https://putting.It) feels like she is trying to guilt trip me.Just wanna throw that out there,she practically begged me to be her client after I initially said no to her.

There was another instance.A long time ago,when they were going to cottage,they invited me but she told me that ""if possible bring $x with you but if you can't then it's [ok](https://ok.You),you are fam I understand"".

806,"Dear people of Reddit,

I am a white christian girl living in a house with other white christian girls. I'm from a predominantly white country, and my landlord is also white, christian and an older man. I am moving out and thus had to find a new roommate/renter for my room, and after meeting with several potential girls, we as a house decided on this amazing girl. She's very sweet and kind and extraverted, and a great fit for the house. She's also a black girl and non-christian. None of us here have any problem with that. 

I did warn her that the landlord may inquire into her faith so she could be prepared. When she left, I also remembered that my landlord has spoken out against immigration and foreigners in general, and although this girl is from our country, I'm afraid my landlord will say something racist to or about her. I know my landlord to be a sweet gentle guy, but then again I don't know how he feels about POC and what he might say. I really like this girl and want to protect her, should I warn her? Should I say anything about my landlord and if so, what/how?

I'm from a quite sheltered environment and don't really know any POC and really don't know what's okay or not okay to say or do, or how I should handle this, or if I'm overreacting. Please help me, I just want to do the best thing.",14Aug2020,1

811,"I am a 20 year-old girl looking for some direction. For some background... I grew up with a narcissist mom and enabler dad and endured sexual abuse at the hands of a nanny at a very young age until my parents finally fired her for stealing toilet paper from our pantry. I can’t remember a time where I didn’t feel sad, anxious, and isolated from everyone else. I was constantly trying to ‘escape’ reality by burying myself in books, video games, television, anything immersive enough to make me forget about existing. My parents were neglectful at their best and emotionally and physically abusive at their worst. My mom used to tell me that she wished I was never born, that I was a psychopath and she was afraid that I’d burn the house down and kill my sister and our dogs. I was the ‘selfish, lazy, ungrateful bitch’ and constantly was told that I should be kissing her ass for her putting a roof over my head and paying for basic things like food and doctor’s appointments. My dad would lock me in a dog cage in the dark basement, spit on me and hit me when he became enraged, especially when my mom egged him on. 

Starting in middle school they began to crack down on me and make sure I got nothing but straight As and excelled at extracurriculars. There was always immense pressure to perform. If I didn’t achieve well academically, I was worthless. I skated by without much effort in high school but had zero friends and played video games constantly whenever I wasn’t at school. I went to driver’s ed and practiced driving but never got my driver’s license. I got into an abusive three year-long relationship with a man online who was eleven years older than me, developed an eating disorder, and basically regressed into a miserable, jaded, apathetic person with zero direction and no healthy coping mechanisms. 

Senior year of high school, I got accepted into the prestigious college that my parents always dreamed I’d attend and felt…  absolutely nothing. I was burned out, and I still feel burned out much of the time. I feel like I have no dreams or ambitions of my own. Up until this point I have only done things because my parents told me to do them. Because the alternative was getting screamed at and berated and punished for not living up to my potential. Now I am nearly 21. I have changed my major a couple times and until last semester, I was too depressed and anxious to show up to class and keep up with the coursework. I would inevitably fall into a depressive rut halfway through the semester… and thanks to those repeated failures I tanked my gpa and was put on academic probation twice. Monthly ketamine infusions (which I have been doing for the past year) have helped me remain relatively stable and keep routines like basic self-hygiene, daily exercise, and showing up to class everyday regardless of my anxiety levels. I am also about to start talk therapy and begin working through the trauma I experienced. 

I am passionate about architecture. When I’m not in a depressive state, I love creating buildings and interior spaces in modeling programs. The problem is, I hated nearly every architecture class I took due to their competitive nature. I took one class where the teacher was a complete hard-ass, played favorites, and criticized my work no matter how much effort I put into it. I took it personally and had a mental breakdown. I felt like a failure compared to my classmates. I hated having to work in the studio for hours upon hours every day away from my dog and the safety of my apartment. I failed to fit into the studio dynamic. In my studio classes there were about ten people give or take and my poor social skills kept me from fitting in and collaborating with my peers, which is an integral part of succeeding in those classes. I’d love to be an architect some day, but no firm would want me because I don’t know how to be a team player. Nor do I even want to work in an environment like that. Furthermore, I was rejected from the undergraduate architecture program at my school. If I were to graduate from this school, I’d have to get a generic arts degree. I feel so lost and have no idea what to even pursue now… Every day I fantasize about living on a farm or somewhere more rural, just me and my dog. I’m not afraid of hard work- I like working with my hands and being outdoors. Being surrounded by nature makes me feel at peace and totally grounded. I'm not a competitive person and the simple things like cooking, cleaning, going for walks, tending to plants, playing with the dog, etc. makes me feel happy and accomplished. Perhaps because they're tasks that can't be failed.

Currently I live in the city, on campus. I hate hate hate it here. I hate the people that I encounter. I hate the litter and graffiti and frat parties… Everything about this city makes me feel hopeless. A few months ago, I saw some kid jump off the parking garage across the street and as of late imagine doing it myself (but I won’t kill myself at least until my dog eventually gets old and passes away). I was happy to live alone in my little apartment, but soon I will have to share it with three other girls. One of the girls moved in early, and within a couple weeks of living here she had already had her boyfriend, parents, and two or three friends over multiple times… These girls are strangers to me and I'm not in a position to demand that they don’t have people over. Plus, it doesn’t even matter because they’ll still be going to classes in-person and hanging out with friends outside the apartment so if they get covid,  i’m pretty much guaranteed to get it too. I am terrified of catching covid and suffering long term organ damage. I don’t have a great immune system and have no support system to lean on if I do get sick. I recently went no contact with my parents but am seriously considering asking my dad for enough money to get my own place where I can live alone, and finding someone to take over my lease.

I don’t need much to be happy. I just want to live in peace with my dog, my own space and my own garden, away from other people. I don’t know how to proceed with school (although I wouldn’t be comfortable attending class in-person, only online), and I don’t know how I can move off campus without a driver's license and any car to practice with. My parents are well-off and I still rely on them financially for everything. I just don't know what to do. I haven’t made any big decisions for myself and I don’t have anyone I can go to for advice. These are things I have been putting off thinking about for many months now but the clock is ticking and I must confront these things at some point, I just don’t trust myself to make the right decision.  It would mean the absolute world to me if someone could give me advice or recommend some course of action.",14Aug2020,1

814,"This is a long one, sorry in advance. 

I don’t have the greatest relationship with my parents, more specifically my father, but to try to explain this whole story as much as I can simply my father is a huge narcissist. He berated me my entire life and while my mother and I get along much better, she has never stepped in to defend me or stick up for me in any situation, rather she tells me to suck it up and deal with things so I can build character. 

Fast forward to now, I’m a single parent and have been separated from my child’s dad for well over 7 years. We’ve had quite a few bumps along the way as far as him understanding his place in my life but for the most part our relationship has been pretty civil and he plays a big role in our kid’s life. 

Since COVID and quarantine started my ex had been trying to be a “family”. He called me up when the shutdowns started and said we could quarantine with our child together at my house. I’m not comfortable with this at all and flat out told him no. He got upset and stopped talking to me as he does from time to time when I say something he doesn’t particularly like hearing. 

My father’s birthday was in May. As I said, I don’t get along with my parents particularly well but my kid hadn’t seen his grandparents and after being stuck in the house so long we went to celebrate with them. My father pulled me aside and told me that my ex had contacted him and asked if he could take our son (on the days he has him) to my parents house to play in their yard because my ex lives in an apartment and with everything closed he had a limited space to play with our son. Keep in mind my ex has family here that he could go visit with a yard and a nearby park. 

Now, I didn’t even know my ex and my dad had each other’s phone numbers. He hardly ever spoke to my parents in the past so I’m not sure what’s been going on all this time without my knowing. My dad actually got upset with me and said that my ex is scared of me and that he didn’t want to cause problems and make me mad. My dad scolded me for treating my ex so poorly and told me my ex is a great guy and a great dad  and got mad at me for not making him feel welcome and like part of the family. He said he told my ex he was more than welcome to take our son to my parent’s house anytime he wanted because at the end of the day it’s my dad’s house and whatever I say doesn’t matter.

I felt so upset that my feelings weren’t taken into consideration. I don’t hate my ex but I would prefer to keep my interaction with him to a minimum. I have my personal reasons for this decision but my parents have never really cared to ask or know what happened and why our relationship fell apart and with my dad and ex on such good speaking terms I can already see my dad has chosen to believe whatever story my ex has told him. 

So since May my ex has taken our son to my parents house every single day that he has off. My mom buys them food and my parents even gave my ex a key to the house so he has free reign to come and go whenever he likes.  My son has an inflatable pool there that I know is raising the water bill and I also know my ex is not offering to chip in to help with any of it. I spoke to my mom as well I could about this and told her my feelings and said this isn’t right. She’s very complacent because my dad already gave the order that this was okay so she just told me they’re doing it for our son. Which to me is all just bullshit. 

There’s no way I can talk to my dad, if I even attempt to tell him how I feel he’ll turn the conversation around into what an ungrateful and snotty nosed bitch I am and I am done with hearing that bullshit. I have just stopped talking or seeing my parents and have gone even more out of the way to purposefully avoid my ex. However with school starting my ex called me yesterday about how we’ll be handling the upcoming school year. I swear I was as civil and as polite as I could be but he accused me of blowing him off and speaking to him in a very rude tone and he asked if I treat everyone in my life as poorly as I treat him. I feel like I can’t win and I know he was baiting me because he knows very well why I’m upset. I know he’s waiting for me to explode because as soon as I do he’ll say I proved his point and will probably go run to my dad and tell him what a scary monster I am. 

I’ve been very stressed and depressed, it’s always on my mind and it hurts so much that my parents can’t seem to understand how I feel. I haven’t contacted them and they haven’t even tried to get in touch with me and I feel even more isolated than when COVID first hit. My ex had the whole week off last week and asked to take our son which I agreed so I could work but all they did was spend the entire time at my parent’s. I’m at my wit’s end. What do I do?",14Aug2020,1
815,"Hi! I’m asking for advice on how to focus less on my neighbors during Covid and to keep the existing peace/let go of being irked with a few neighbors.

I live in an apt with four units (including mine). I am friends with the women in two other units and have lived with them in a blissful existence until the empty unit got filled with two college students who are a couple (and who also seem to have a friend over all the time? Nothing seems to indicate it’s a throuple). Anyways back to the main point. I get so irked by them almost daily. 

Since they have moved in:
They have smoked weed daily in their unit. We’re a non smoking building and I’ve called the leasing office on them twice when the smell became present in my unit. Before Covid this was a huge issue since I’m a working professional and my work clothes were smelling like weed.

I have witnessed what looks like a drug deal (very short conversation and never got in the car) however I can’t be certain.

They always take up the street parking in front of the unit - it was worse before Covid when they had friends over often. And one day, one of the neighbors (I’m familiar with their cars &amp; noticed it was parked behind me earlier)- had scraped my vehicle so metal was exposed on the rear. I’ve had this brand new car for less than a month and they scraped it. I can’t even file a police report bc the car was moved and I don’t have definite proof. 

The only thing they haven’t done yet is steal my mail so they aren’t completely awful. But I want to move so badly because I get annoyed every time I see them or when I walk into the hallway and it smells. 

Does anyone have advice like meditation or something else that can help me move past this? I feel like it’s worse when I’m working remotely and I would like to have a better way of processing how I feel.",14Aug2020,1
816,"So my family recently got a lake house. My best friend has been wanting to come and we planned for her and her mom to come next weekend. She text me a couple days ago saying someone she works with was tested positive for Covid. She isn’t getting tested and isn’t isolating. 

I’m basically at a point where I feel most comfortable with her either getting tested or not coming. My mom has pre-existing conditions that have made her extra scared so I don’t really know what else to do. Both my mom and sister expressed they would also feel more comfortable if she got tested. I would even be willing to pay for it. 

We planned this over a month in advance and I know she will be bummed and hurt and maybe even mad at me... but Covid is Covid and I feel like precaution is necessary.  Am I overreacting?",14Aug2020,1

Anyways, afterwards they had no idea I knew my shit basically 😂. One of them even got a little quiet when I correct him, in a totally chill way. I know they just as smart, most people are, they just get distracted easily or don't know how to study.

819,"So I have this thing called Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (check it out). It has been linked to stress and misfires of the autonomic nervous system which controls some hormones. It begins with frequent migraines as a kid (which can be a sign of misfiring hormones), and left untreated can turn into CVS. Because of the link to misfiring hormones, those with CVS are at higher risk for other symptoms of unbalances hormones such as anxiety and depression (both of which I also have).

I've always been depressed, but could never pinpoint anything to be depressed about. Quite honestly, my life is great and I'm extremely blessed and love living on this planet. But when the depression sets in, I say things that I don't mean, and feel ways I don't actually feel. When depressed, I make complaints about a childhood that I actually loved, and claim a hatred of a life filled with a supportive, loving family, and very little stress. I don't actually hate my life. I love it and I have high self-esteem. But when I'm depressed, as soon as the words ""My life sucks and I hate myself"" leaves my mouth, my mind goes ""Why did I say that? That's not true.""

A few weeks ago, I had a suicide attempt, got help, and started anti-depressants. Now that serotonin levels have normalized, I do not know why I decided to attempt suicide. But now, my family is insisting that I must be upset about something and that I must be lying to myself, because depression doesn't happen without environmental triggers and there's no way I could be happy with my life. I have found myself now lying to my family. Pretending to be angry about things in my childhood and my life, because it's the only answer they will accept. When I tell them that I'm only angry WHEN I'm depressed and that I'm not depressed BECAUSE I'm angry, they minimize my input and claim that I must be in denial.

On the same note, they know I'm taking hormones to stop the vomiting, but wont consider the idea that the vomiting and depression are related. I know I can't change their minds, because the common belief about depression is that it is always the result of some trauma or dissatisfaction with ones life. But I also don't feel that it's fair that I have to lie to them, because it can't be healthy to pretend to be angry and to pretend to have feelings about things that I honestly do care about. It's put me in a super weird position, and I guess I'm just wondering what other people would do in this situation.",14Aug2020,1

827,"Tl;dr we (3 teens, parents) live with our grandma. She follows us around everywhere and we don't know how to deal with her being on our heels 24/7.

I live with my parents, two siblings and grandma. Everything worked perfectly until my grandpa sadly passed a few years ago. For context, I'm 15, my parents both around 50 and I'm the oldest, my siblings are both tween/teens. The house we live in is technically a mansion, detached house is the applicable term here I believe. We have more than enough physical space. Side note, in this post I will be referring to grandma as 'she' and my parents siblings and me as 'us'

Our home arrangement is basically the ground floor is her space (used to be for her and grandpa), it's got a living, dining, guest bedroom, kitchen, bathrooms etc. 2nd floor (1st in us?) is ours. We too have everything on our floor including all the bedrooms. We're all allowed everywhere this is just where we hang out the most. This is my grandma's home but I don't know exactly what part of it my parents own etc. Also, she has her bedroom upstairs. This has actually caused lots of problems as well including me not sleeping in my own bedroom, long story. She loves her room and it's the best room in the house with the balcony and everything. So in the evening she's upstairs too.

We all really struggle with her these days. Some examples include;  
\- She comes upstairs during the day an unreasonable amount of times for no reason, today she literally came upstairs seven times to ask my brother stuff like if he knew where I was, if he knew where my parents were, telling him that it was hot outside, etc

\- When she hears a noise at the door she instantly 'runs' there like she's a pet dog and then says, consistently every time, 'oh, I thought I heard something already'. Then watches you put on your shoes and coat and just stands there watching you or saying something meaningless small talky

\- She came in while I was changing, she just stood there in the door watching me while I wasn't wearing any clothes, I said 'I'm changing!' and she was like 'yeah I'll wait till you're done' then proceeded to ask me if I knew if she needed to drop off my sister at her friend's or something

The list goes on and on. We don't know what to do.

We're becoming teenagers and we need space, she doesn't understand that. We feel watched all the time. We know she's constantly recording what we're doing and where we are in her head and when she isn't she's at our bedroom door to be able to. I don't bring my friends home because she involves herself, don't even get me started on boys. My brother has been so sweet and he's the only one who still manages to play along convincingly though he and all of us feel the same way.

The worst part is that we just don't want to be around her anymore, all of us just permanently feel like we need a break. We love her, we really do, but putting up with her as an activity (going somewhere with her etc) has become a chore. I have such great memories of going downstairs and asking if she'd have time to make soup with me. If we didn't live in the same household and we'd only see her like once a week I'm sure we'd all be stoked to tell her all about school and everything. She doesn't have a life anymore and in that regard, thank god we live with her because I don't wanna know how fast she'd lose her mind if she didn't have us to bother.

I have to say this; I'm not great at wording these things. We are not being unreasonable, even if we are we feel like our rights like privacy etc are being violated. I'm saying 'feel like', this is all just about us feeling so invaded and overwhelmed with her, 24/7. My parents are so considerate and always teach me to be grateful and so far that's the mindset they've put upon us: being grateful we're with her and savouring her last years. This has just gone too far and we simply cannot any longer. We don't enjoy her company anymore, on the contrary, all we want is a breath of fresh air away from her. Oh also of course the quarantaine has made all of this a million times worse but a year ago I was almost posting something like this here too so it's not just started showing up since corona.

Some things we tried;

\- Giving her hints. She's blind to them. Same goes for subtly bringing it up. She is very easily offended and scoffs 'Jesus' or 'God' which, in any context, all of us dislike. She doesn't take it seriously at all.

\- Being blunt about it. Often I tell her I'm doing my thing, she can talk to me any time if she can just be straight to the point about it but I feel bothered by her behaviour which doesn't do anything. I've tried countless times. Usually same reaction as described above. My mom too, she is even blunter about it without trying to be nice which makes my grandma 'look down on' my mom (can't think of a more eloquent term), also same reaction and she acts very disturbed.

\- Talking. I never participated in these talks and neither have my siblings but my mother tried explaining it and conversing about it with her. My grandma acts different every time but consistently not taking it seriously, then when they end talking for a while she plays along but it feels incredibly strained and forced serving for a very weird and awkward atmosphere because you know she knows you're thinking about it and she knows you know she's purposely refraining herself from following you and doing all that stuff which doesn't make it any better because you can feel it.

We can't move out. I thought a possible solution would be enforcing the upstairs downstairs principle more but seeing as she has her bedroom upstairs we'd have to take it. This would in theory be such a great solution but we just can't tell her she can't sleep there anymore. To me this seems like the only step we could take though.

I feel like I want to break up with her. That's what it feels like. One last thing, please, please don't tell me I'm a bad granddaughter, I really try my hardest to just do the right thing but I truly feel like I did that and more by just keeping my mouth shut for all this time and sucking it up, trying to live by the grateful mindset etc.

Thanks for reading this post, I'm really sorry it's not well formatted and all over the place. It all feels complicated and outside of complaining about it with my siblings I purposely avoid thinking about this.",14Aug2020,1
828,"So, Long story short, I was 340 pounds, and I now hover at about 200 pounds. 

I have a LOT of loose skin. I’ve never really felt too insecure about it, really. I’ve worn my loose skin with pride and found myself okay with it. 

But yesterday, I was with my girlfriend, and we were meant to go swimming. I, of course, was getting all goo goo over her beautiful body, and I felt a feeling that I hadn’t really felt in a long time, insecurity over my body image. 

I looked at myself, how all my skin hangs down, how I still look fat from the back despite being 6’ 0” and 200 pounds, and I just got self conscious. I didn’t do it too much, but was definitely doing little things to cover up.

834,"For as long as I can remember, my dad has always been emotionally immature. I can count on one hand how many times I’ve heard him apologize in my entire life. Nothing is EVER his fault, even when it is. There have been many times where he’s yelled and gotten angry at me and my mother for mistakes that he’s made. And he’s the type to give you the silent treatment when you’re mad at him for something he did. I remember a few months ago, I was so down thinking about how my dad was never really that affectionate growing up and how he spent most of his time criticizing me and my mother. I asked him out of the blue, while in tears, why he was never nice to us and he looked so confused. The next thing he said was “....well what about all the stuff that I do right?”. Once again, he did not want to admit to any of his mistakes.


Well, he said something today that I will always remember. So yesterday, my dad was suppose to put money into my bank account since we have a linked bank account. Instead of transferring the money into my account, he withdraws the money from my account causing my account to overdraft. I texted him and let him know that my account was overdraft because of this. Not once did I get angry or say anything rude to him, I just let him know the issue so that he could fix it. He decides to call me and yells about it wasn’t his fault and how he got mixed up doing something else which caused him to make the mistake. I remained calm and kept my composure while telling him that it was okay and that I wasn’t mad at him and I rushed him off the phone because I could tell everything was about to escalate. He wanted me to know it wasn’t his fault (even though it was). I brushed it off and thought nothing of it after that, as long as the money was transferred to my account, I was fine. My mother calls me 5 minutes later to tell me that my dad called her, angry about the situation. She told me she had to listen to him yell and curse on the phone about the situation and the entire time they were on the phone...he blamed me. Go figure. She then tells me that he said something to the effect of “these people be having masters degrees but don’t know what they’re doing”., he was referring to me. This boiled my blood. Not only are you mad at me for a mistake that you made but you also tried to insult me by insinuating that you don’t see how I have a masters degree because of this? I believe this really bothered me because I never heard my dad tell me that I was smart growing up, but I’ve definitely heard him use the “stupid” word more times than I can count (and sometimes even motherf*****). I can’t lie, this did hurt my feelings so I texted him to let him know that I know what he said and that it was wrong. Of course, he takes no blame for his actions and says that he just got frustrated with the bank taking the money from my account. (Like duh, that’s what YOU did). 

I’m really at the point where I want to go away from my dad. I do not like him, I simply tolerate him. I still live with both of my parents and wanted to stay for at leSt 2 more years to stack up but I want to move out so I don’t have to see his face everyday. I really hate the kind of person my dad is sometimes because there is no getting through to him. My mom feels the same way but she enables him most of the time. I just wish I had a father like a lot of girls have..someone who treats them with love and respect. I even find myself being jealous of people who have good fathers. I know my dad isn’t the worst but he falls short in a lot of ways. The most redeemable quality that my dad has is that he is a good provider (just like his dad). That’s it.

I’m sorry for the long post but I just really needed to vent. I feel so sad right now and could use some kind words.",14Aug2020,1

836,"I have a tendency to be very skeptical whenever people give me advice. This sounds like a good thing, but it leads me to never knowing which advice to actually follow. I will usually find a way in which my experience is different to the advice giver's and will see that as a reason to probably not trust someone's advice. For example, when I take advice from people (college advisor, friends, family, etc.) about whether or not to graduate early, I will almost always be unsure about their advice for whatever reason (did not take out loans for college, did not have to go to college during a pandemic, they lean whichever direction politically so they are more likely to choose ""*x""* option). Another example is that I have trouble taking advice from my mom often because she is religious while I am not, and I can often see religious views within her advice even if it's not outright religious advice.

Is this a normal amount of skepticism or is it too much? It has gotten to the point where I do not trust most people's advice and generally do not know where to go for advice. This is apart from a few obvious stuff like eat healthy, exercise, try new things, etc. Does anyone else have this kind of skepticism?",14Aug2020,1
837,"I have history with this friend. 3 years together, broke up, and made up 2 years after. They left 1st and I chose to make up with them 1st. So 1 month into this new friendship you would think it must be a lucky chance to start over. Maybe we both became better people because I know I've been trying to change and be healthier. Backstory we were in a toxic friendship bounded by trauma bonding and you would think that would have been a good enough warning to back off and never call again but apparently I'm dumb as I've said. So what's the problem you may ask. 

Well I've been trying to bring up the past and talk about boundaries with this friend. I think it's important to talk about the past so we don't repeat it again in this new friendship. Whenever I bring it up my friend keeps making up excuses and changing topics. Calls me to only play mobile games. Eventually leading up to a petty arguement about my overtalking only cause I interrupted them about something we were discussing. Completely unrelated. We made up after 4 days of being ignored which turned out to be because of they're phone being so old that it is unable to receive calls or texts. 

Something my friend expected me to know and they're schedule when I had no information prior to this arguement. I cried, was overthinking things that they must hate me even after I apologized. After all didn't get a reply until the 4th day. They're was indifference in they're tone when I told them of the sleepless nights, stress I underwent because of them. Like I should have known better. We made up tho and you would think I would be happy but something doesn't sit well with me about this friend. We promise to better communicate but I've brought up again the importance of boundaries but I feel it still gets blown off. Like I have to remind them every time to even care about it.

I feel I put enough effort into this friendship. Sometimes I feel my expectations are too high or maybe I ask for too much but all they have done is want to play mobile games with me. Maybe I'm hurt by the fact they assumed I was a selfish and self centered person just cause I interrupted them without meaning to in that arguement. The fact that they perceive me like that when they were angry says a lot. I'm willing to improve that aspect of me. Heck I was willing to change but it always feels like I'm doing something wrong and they think I don't care enough. So hopefully I can get some advice from someone out there.

She changed completely...she treats me lile a stangers eversince.

841,"I've (22F) been living with my parents and younger siblings again for the past year, having taken a break from university for two semesters. Ever since I got back home, I have found that my parents are frequently getting into loud, physical fights (sometimes up to 2-3 times a week). The conflicts are not new per say, my parents have always had a very uh ""passionate"" relationship, but their fights have gotten a lot more frequent and violent since the time I was in high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although my dad does his fair share in escalating/instigating these conflicts verbally, their violent nature is entirely attributable to my mom: she is a very emotional, irrational, passionate, high-strung person who easily works herself up into mad furies and can get extremelly agressive as a result. My parents have been together for 25 years and she has always been convinced that my dad is cheating on her --he's not, she's just very needy, paranoid and has trust/betrayal issues stemming from childhood (we all love her anyways and her sensitive personality is wonderful otherwise). For the past two years, her suspected ""other woman"" of choice has been my dad's marketing team leader, Isabella. My mom will fly off the handle for as little as him talking on the phone/emailing/video-conferencing with Isabella for work, so social distancing has definitely been a factor in things getting worse.

Their fights basically consist of my mom getting all worked up because of my father's dismissive and sometimes mocking responses about Isabella (among other things), and then her eventually attacking my dad at his desk when he's trying to work from home --hitting, scratching, pulling his clothes, throwing things at him-- he tries pushing/shoving her away in response, more and more forcefully the longer the conflict lasts. It can get pretty scary: I've seen a chair thrown at someone, fighting at the wheel, my dad once pushed my mom down a flight of stairs because she was scratching his face, my mom often draws blood and bruises my dad and he sometimes bruises her too when defending himself... I'm pretty sure we would have called the police a long time ago for domestic abuse had their sexes been reversed.

  
Instead, my siblings and I (mostly me, as I had left home for college and am not used to the fights getting this bad -the rest are more jaded) have been interposing ourselves in these situations to try and break them up, which mostly consists of us trying to prevent our mom from charging at our father and standing between them as we try to reason with her to calm down. We sometimes get attacked too when trying to restrain her. My mom is apparently completely incapable of controlling herself, isolating herself in another room or going for a walk to calm down like her therapist suggests she does (she says it is because she's worried we will lock her out of the appartment... yeah) and my dad refuses to leave because he says he has work to do.

  
When my siblings and I complain about having to live in this high-stress environment and beg my mom to show some restraint, she says their fights are none of our business and that it is our fault for interfering in the first place. We're apparently in the wrong for not minding our own business and don't know our place as children (although 3/5 of us are over 18).

  
My siblings and I interfering is a major point of contention: my mom understands this as us taking our father's side... it doesn't help that none of us believe her infidelity accusations or that we say hurtful, dismissive things to her out of frustration when we intervene in their fights for the 100th time that month. My relationship with my mom in particular has gotten extremelly bad, as I resent her immensely for creating (in my view) this irrational drama and making it the toxic center of our family life, whereas she thinks I want to get rid of her by convincing everybody that she is crazy and should be divorced/arrested/medicated (not true, but stems from me leading/instigating these ""interventions"")... so I'll admit her feeling like we're gaining up on her when we join their fights doesn't come from nowhere.

  
Should we (me and my siblings to a lesser extent) be interfering in their fights, effectively ""picking a side"" and exposing ourselves to/participating in our parents' marital problems? Is my mom right when she says we should be ignoring the fights and minding our own business, despite the physical and loud nature of the conflicts?   
I will be leaving for college in two weeks and am worried about the situation I will be leaving behind. The second and third eldest siblings will also be leaving, meaning only my twin 17 year old siblings will be staying home deal with the parents. What should I advise them to do?",14Aug2020,1
842,"Just like the title says, I have a female cousin who is a few months shy of 19 years old. I'll refer to her as K in this post. If you read through this whole thing thank you!
A little back story here..K's mom (my aunt) died in child birth leaving my grandparents to adopt and raise her. Shortly after the adoption my grandfather passed away from a heart attack. My grandma decided she would move to the most unknown parts of the country to get away from the memories and to live peacefully. Throughout K's life she went from public school to being home schooled and eventually not doing any sort of schooling at all. My grandma was never smart when it came to electronics so when she bought K a laptop to homeschool she never bothered to check up on her work and eventually never bothered her to do it. 

Fast forward to now. My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimers 2 years ago and needed a live in care giver. I rented a house for her myself, my 6 yo and my cousin to live in. While taking care of my grandmother, my daughter, finishing med school and keeping up with the house cleaning, my cousin has barely lifted a finger. She sits in her room and plays mine craft on her laptop all hours of the night and sleeps all day. She will cook food and never clean up her messes. She will go without showering for over 2 weeks. Her room is located in the same hallway as mine so when she opens her bedroom door the whole hallway will smell like dirty clothes and BO. I have a hunch that she might be depressed but also maybe slow. I've tried to teach her how to drive so she can get her liscense but she doesn't want to learn. At this point she is living off me.

I turned changed the password to the internet so she will get up and do something with herself. It back fired on me! I found out last week all her young internet friends paid for some type of internet plan for her so shes able to keep playing and because she wanted to keep talking to some guy she really liked. She told me earlier this week that they are in a relationship and I casually asked to see a picture of the cutie. Yesterday this 'guy' finally sent her a face picture and when she showed me I was stunned. This 'guy' had the face of a 14 year old. I asked her how old he was and she said ""16 almost 17"". Its highly unlikely this kid is close to 17.
I told her she had to break up with him because it's illegal and I dont want her to get in trouble along with myself for not stopping this. She said she'll think about it. 
Today rolls around and I ask her if she broke it off and unfortunately she said no. I explained it all to her again and this time I added that she won't be welcome into our home if she doesn't break it off with him today.

How will I know if she truly did it? If she doesn't break it off how do I go about kicking her out as she has no other family. Also, how can I get this girl to straighten up!? I feel that shes mooching off me but I would feel bad kicking her out because the slowness, lack of education and a place to stay.",14Aug2020,1
843,"I just moved into my first apartment with a girl I was close with in middle school. We wound up at the same university and she had needed 2 more roommates and reached out to me. Only she had moved in until yesterday.

I moved in yesterday, and we were bantering and making plans to go to places like Target together, to collaborate on decorating the living room, etc. We got along pretty well when we saw each other intermittently last school year, so this was business as usual. Then we started talking about politics because I said I disliked Pewdiepie, and I learned that she believes police brutality and looting are equally concerning, “both sides” are to blame, that kind of thing. I’m really open to political discussion so I showed her sources saying that, no, ANTIFA hasn’t killed anyone, and yes, black people do get lynched in 2020—but she’d cherry-pick and bend info so that it suited her both sides stance (Antifa has killed people, it just wasn’t reported on. There’s no evidence those lynchings aren’t suicides...even though she only knows that from what is being reported...and has to ignore what the local community and experts say about the dead person and suicide rates among black people). At the same time, if I recommended some readings or documentaries she’d turn them down because “politics don’t concern her.”

Honestly, I’d be fine with her saying politics don’t concern her, even if I disagree. I can live with that. But it does frustrate me that she has false information and refuses to accept facts about the groups she has such strong convictions on. She thinks police brutality can be chalked up to poor training, but also won’t look any further to confirm or disprove that. She’s willfully ignorant. I was raised to approach political discussions as a way to learn about the other side, but I honestly don’t learn much at all from her. I already am familiar with enlightened centrism, just not so literally close to home. She also doesn’t indicate that she processes much that I say, so nothing is learned for either of us.

I feel like this can go two ways—I either continue being buddy with her (she initiates conversation every time I see her in our own home and comes to my room if we haven’t spoken in a bit) but always (gently) challenge her on her misinformation, and provide accurate sources and fill her in on what she doesn’t know (she asked me what the PIC was which is when I offered sources, but maybe I just have to learn how to tell her concisely). Otherwise, I’d feel like a massive hypocrite if I stayed quiet (spent a good chunk of my summer at BLM marches). Or I can distance myself, but I don’t know how I’d do that. Am I being annoying about this? I just don’t know how to reconcile my beliefs with this friendship and living situation.",14Aug2020,1

845,"So I currently work nights at a fast food restaurant making minimum 13.00 an hour. Its embarrassing. I used to have another job and the night job was part time, but the other job, an office job, let me go due to obvious reasons. They only kept on a skeleton staff of like 4 people. 

I took on a night job because back then, we didnt know my mom was pregnant and she would take care of the dogs in the morning and I in the evening. well, since we found out, and the virus happened, I have only been able to work nights, as she was a high risk pregnancy, so she stayed inside the house all day and I worked nights full time and took care of the dogs during the day. 

Well, the little sister (yay) is going to be born in a week or two, and once my mom is back on her feet, she plans to continue her active lifestyle, going to the gym and going for walks and eventually runs with the dogs. I've talked to her about this and she is fine once she is back on her feet and a new rhythm is  in place. 

All to say, there have been a few jobs that I have been keeping my eye on, only they are all full time and during the day. Many are hiring immediately and are the type of job that I would love to have. Should I just apply now and if I'm hired or interviewed, explain that I cant start for at least a month because of the home schedules, or should I just wait a few weeks before applying?

Even though I never left the porch and had a knife in my pocket the entire time.

She also doesn't let me leave the yard ever. About a week ago, she said I could take walks up and down the street, but she almost got a panic attack thinking about it, and changed her mind. Now I just pace around the house for like an hour whenever I need to.

I kind of feel like I'm being unreasonable, though. She really just wants to protect me, and I feel bad about not wanting to do what I'm told. It's been like this my entire life, and I don't even think she's gonna let me move out. Like I said before, just the thought giver her a panic attack. I don't want to be responsible for that.

850,"I'm a 23 year old gay man with bipolar disorder and a myriad of other severe mental health disorders. These illnesses are actually fairly well managed, and I'm going back to school this fall (online classes, of course).

However, my sexual orientation has brought me nothing but pain in my life. I grew up in a homophobic family, internalized many of their teachings, and was in denial for well over a decade. I'm now quarantining with them (although I move out in a week), and that hasn't been fun.

I finally accepted that I liked men at 18 (while in college) when the guy who would become my first boyfriend asked me out (I lost my virginity to him when he sexually assaulted me). I openly identified as bisexual for a while, although it was obvious to everyone but me that I had no interest in women.

Over the next 5 years, I had 2 more miserable (but mercifully short) relationships, \~2 dozen first dates, some manic one-night-stands, and was in love for years with a gay man (a close friend) who did not feel the same way towards me.

This post was prompted because I just found out the guy I really liked is straight - I was let down very gently but it still hurt a lot.

I have plenty of friends, mostly straight males but a good number of women (both straight and queer) and gay men as well, and I consider myself to be high-functioning when it comes to social interaction, but I am completely incapable of forming romantic bonds with people, and I have no idea why.

I've looked into conversion therapy, but research just confirmed what I already thought: that it's ineffective and just used as an excuse to abuse LGBT people.

I can't change my sexual orientation unfortunately, but I am hoping that I can at least accept it for what it is. If I'm able to learn how to not be a total loser when it comes to my love life, that'd be even better. I doubt one reddit post will fix these problems - it'll probably take years of therapy (I've been in therapy for 4 years and take medication daily), but anything would be appreciated.

851,When I was 17 (6 years ago) I was sexually assaulted and I fell down a deep depression. I never reported my attacker to the police as I was scared and terrified. I recently looked them up and I saw they were arrested on a sexual assault of a child. I feel tremendous guilt that if I had just said something this wouldn’t have happened to someone else. I can’t shake the feeling that it was my fault this happened to someone else. I’m not sure how I should deal with this.,14Aug2020,1
852,"So this happend years ago during middle school. I know it's natural to be more ignorant when you're much younger but I still feel guilty about it and I wish I could've been a better person. It's kind of a complicated story but basically my best friend back then had a crush on me. I didn't really know for a while and I genuinely thought she was very fun to be around with. We would talk about alot of things together and I would often visit her house. I knew she was bi but I didn't really expect that she would have a crush on me. I feel so much worse because back then when she would often buy me food from the school cafeteria when im hungry because I used to be broke as hell and the pocket money I had wouldn't even last a day lol. I really appreciated what she did for me and I honestly don't think I showed it enough and I wish I could've been able to repay her more. I blame myself alot because It looked like I was just friends with her because of her money but noo I really really liked hanging out with her for real even if she was broke too I wouldn't care I'd still hang out with her lol. So fast forward to when she confessed to me and that's when things kinda got awkward. At the moment I heard it, I really didn't know what to feel. This was the first time something like this happened to me so I didn't know what to do. 
For a few days, I kinda avoided her during lunch and now that I think about it THAT WAS THE STUPIDEST TRASHIEST THING IVE EVER DONE. And I really wish I could've dealt with the situation better but I guess I was kinda scared at the time? Idk idk i was a jerk smh. I eventually hung out with her again because I still liked being friends with her. I can't just abandon her simply because she had feelings and maybe eventually she'll just lose the feelings, right? I was wrong. Later on I got close to this guy friend I had and the three of us would hang out and I thought all three of us would be good friends together but she would sometimes get mad or moody when me and my guy friend would joke around together and I wasn't really sure why. I thought it was just because we were annoying but eventually I figured out it was because she was jealous. And wow I feel like a big jerk. This entire time I ended up neglecting her feelings because I thought she would've eventually just lost those feelings but no. And there were other things she did that made me really worried and guilty. There's much more other stuff that happened but I'm afraid this would be too long to read lol but basically that's the story. We're not really friends anymore or don't really talk anymore. We didn't really have a big fight or anything she just started avoiding me maybe because I hurt her but she seems to be doing well now so I'm glad she's moved on and has new good friends. But still to this day I feel guilty and I felt like I was a really bad friend to her. She did alot for me and I felt like I really owed her. I thought that the least I could do was maybe like her back but I just really don't feel that way. Can I please maybe get some advice or thoughts on this situation?

856,"My colleague at work is the prime example for someone with strong feelings of inferiority and pushing themselves in the position of being superior. As an example: If something good happens to me, she needs to keep nagging about it (daily!) and tries to turn it into something negative. Like when I come to work the first thing I hear is „Ohhh here comes our new promoted superstar“ or „Do you feel better in your new position now?“ in a really sarcastic tone. She is extremely flirty with the customers and spreading lies about how they are asking her out - also keeps talking about this on a daily. Making comments about my hair or hair color (how bad my hairstylist is but then she asked me for the stylist number a week later...). Or talking bad about our boss and actively trying to drag me in the conversations. Keep in mind, this is only happening to me - She doesn’t behave in this manner to any of my other colleagues.

I work with her daily and it‘s draining my energy because I can‘t ignore it anymore. My latest promotion really put the cherry on top so I straight up told her that she seems like she wanted my position more than me and that she starts to get on my nerves now. She backed up and tried to be friendly again after 10mins, coming up with the newest gossip about my boss... yep.

I‘m someone that doesn‘t fear confrontation and has a low tolerance for someone that openly tries to undermine people, but being at work makes this situation quite difficult. I can‘t cut her off like a bad friend, neither can I confront her (I tried and this ended bad bc she was never wrong). I’ve never met someone like her and this really boils my blood at this point. I genuinely feel like she sees me as a threat or my presence somehow makes her feel less superior, otherwise I cannot put a finger on why she would behave like that towards me.

857,"Like most, my university will be doing online classes this fall. I've been having a very difficult time deciding between returning to school, given that I already have a lease for a 1 bedroom or staying home with parents who are driving me a bit crazy. Curious to hear other thoughts/perspectives since I've gone back and forth on my decision multiple times and need to decide ASAP.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros of staying home:**

\- Good food and a kitchen that makes cooking easy

\- Larger space

\- Save time on errands 

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons of staying home:**

\- Mom's mental health affects the family

\- Parents don't understand privacy so I don't feel very comfortable calling friends from home since they listen

\- Parents are fairly controlling (e.g. times I can leave for walks, bedtime, etc)

\- Parents argue/yell quite a bit which makes it harder to focus

\- Cannot see friends except virtually

\- Parents want me to spend time with them and get upset if I need to study instead

\- Would need to find someone to sublease ASAP

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros of going to school**

\- Freedom (calling friends, bedtime, etc)

\- Can see friends from a distance w/ masks outside

\- Senior year means this is my second to last semester to live on campus/ see people

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons of going** 

\- Higher COVID risk on campus given that I would be doing all my own errands 

\- Would mostly be isolated in my 1 bedroom apartment which would probably get lonely

\- Very small kitchen with almost no counter space so cooking would be difficult (which is what I'd primarily want to do if I went in order to minimize risk of infection)

\- Paying for being on campus (lease, food) despite none of the usual benefits of campus

\- Added time to shop for groceries and clean

858,"so I've been dealing with this client for about two months, he's been very specific with how he wanted the drawing but didn't approach it very well. 
to make sure my clients are happy with what im going to be drawing for them, I send them a preview of the sketch beforehand to check if they like it, so I did it to this dude as well. except every time I sent him a sketch, he kept on adding what changes he wanted after every preview I sent him, when he could of just told me all in one go, it seemed like he just wasn't happy with anything I drew and sometimes the changes he wanted wouldn't work with what I already sketched so sometimes I had to alter everything else in the drawing, and some changes he wanted were just so small that they barely made a difference to the overall picture. 
also he wasn't specific about what he wanted at all, no reference images or anything, just very vague descriptions so it honestly was like trial and error:')

It took me about 4 or 5 sketches for him to be happy with the overall drawing, so after a couple of weeks i finished it, posted it to my deviantart account and sent it to him, and even then he asked for more changes, told me to change some of the colours when he didn't specify the colours in the first place, and even mentioned that he wanted the character in the drawing to be shaped differently even though I sent him sketches and he said they were fine. so at this point I'm basically fed up with him and I told him that if he wants any more changes to it he's gonna have to pay cause that's a bit too much lmao

and so yesterday I changed the colours around, posted it to my account again, only for him to ask for me to post it privately, so it's not on my page, but he wants to post it to his account and credit me. as an artist I feel kind of disrespected seeing as he was hard to deal with and constantly asked for changes, like why should I not post *my* work on my page but he can ? im considering telling him he doesn't have permission to re-post my art on his account as that kind of makes me suspicious, but then again he did pay for it so I feel like he should be able to post it? idk, never had a client who didn't want me to upload my own work online :/",14Aug2020,1
859,"I'm not going to kill myself, but I am not happy with the person I am, and I doubt I can improve myself. The best way to describe this is using the title: I should be killed, executed to make this world a little better, but I'm not the one who should do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 20, and looking back at the last 20 years has me wondering why I should be here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a good person. I judge people swiftly and harshly. I don't take interest in what my friends and family do like a good person should with his friends and family. I have stolen before. I have treated people rudely and without compassion. And what scares me the most is that I might be a pervert.

&amp;#x200B;

These things begin in the mind. I personally believe it's just as bad to have these thoughts as to do actions themselves (what did Emerson say about thoughts becoming destiny, and what did Jesus say about looking at someone with lust?).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ashamed of myself. In my senior year of high school I became much more religious (my parents are Catholic but they kind of treat religion like a social club). I don't like being the bad person I am or the bad things I've done in the past, because there's no real way to cleanse myself of them--no way to make up for them.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said before, I don't plan on killing myself. I had in the past, but then I became more religious and realized that suicide would make things much worse for me and, more importantly, for my family (my parents love me a ton). Despite this, I do participate in self harm. I hit myself in the thigh dozens of times a day when I'm alone. It's the least harmful pain I can inflict on myself without leaving permanent or visible damage, and I get to feel like I am actually beating myself up.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to feel better about myself, but I know I can't. I fall far too short of what God and I expect from myself. I can't fix what I did in the past. I can't control my thoughts.

My parents don’t give me money for chores because they feel like it should be a right for me to do my chores regardless lol. I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how a 15 year old could make some money?",14Aug2020,1

866,"So I've been seeing my current psychiatrist for about a year and she has me on several meds, which she is still adjusting. Well my friend let me try (adderall) and I actually felt like a normal, functioning person. 

Anyway, it was really nice to be able to function and I'd like to continue doing it legally. I obviously dont expect to be given it by asking nicely since it is heavily regulated, but if she disagrees, can I just move on to another psychiatrist? Is she able to flag me as a drug seeker or something?",14Aug2020,1

868,"I used to be so into gaming but then I realised it’s sort of a waste of time and I’ve grown out of it. It’s a Friday night and not a single one of my friends out of the 20 or so close friends I have want to do anything.

They’re not socially awkward or anything they’re great people but they just want to stay home and relax. I can’t do that, no matter the situation, no matter the tiredness I need to be outside doing something. The other day I did a cross country drive and after 8 hours or driving I still needed to be out.

It’s more than just the weekends, it’s so hard to convince them to do anything! I love being spontaneous and going on trips but my friends always put it off and go on trips like once a year or twice a year. I accept people have responsibilities and can’t just quit their work and do anything and everything, however I’m not crazy rich, if I didn’t have my job I’d be dead broke. 

I’m not asking my friends to quit their job and go across the world, I’m just asking them for a two hour drive on a weekend then return the following day or sometimes it’s just to be out on the weekend. 

How can I convince my friends to be more ‘fun’? Should I just go do shit on my own?",14Aug2020,1
869,"So I used to work with a guy who enjoyed his drink always has done. About three years ago we stopped working together but semi kept in contact, we used to be much closer but now it’s rare to speak but when we do it’s just like old times. 

He however has a rather serious drinking problem, he’s almost always drunk and last year whist he was working abroad he drunkenly attempted a backflip, cracked his head open an was in a coma for a month or so, since then he’s been home and I’ve seen him a few times (he doesn’t live close to me) and he’s still been drinking, even through lockdown he’s been drinking daily. 

It’s clearly something that effects his physical and mental health, me and my friends who also know him well want to do something to help but we don’t know how to approach it. Every time we I’ve spoken to him about it he’s either brushed it off (when he’s sober) or we’ve had a deep discussion about it but he is to drunk to remember the next day.

We used to think he just enjoyed a drink and was fun at parties but it’s clearly evolved into something else. I know his parents and they love him a lot but even they can’t seem to get through to him. 

I lives quite remote from where all his old work friends live and I don’t think he probably socialises that much other than going to the pub. 

What should we be doing to help, I’m really not sure what’s the best way to handle this, none of us are. But we want to do something because it feels like it’s at a point where if we don’t do something, I don’t know what will happen to him. 

Any help would be appreciated!!

We shut down the office immediately.  We are going to have it professionally steamed and sanitized this weekend.  I immediately went to go get retested again yesterday just in case.  With this monster, you can test negative one day and then positive the next.

But here's the thing, we are considered ""essential workers.""  We are medical supply distributors who have customers coming in and out of our office/store every day to purchase essentials (masks, hand sanitizers, face shields, antimicrobial sprays, gloves, etc).

We are diligent in enforcing the protocol that is being practiced all over the world at this point.  We make sure to maintain social distancing, we wear our masks throughout the day, we wash our hands like a hundred times a day.  My business partner, my office manager and I have been testing every four weeks to make sure that we don't pass this on to our clients if we are positive.  We have all tested negative each time.  Until now.

What I want and need to know is what is my/our next step?  Do I, as the co-owner of the company, need  to call everyone that's come into the store/office within the past 14 days?  I don't know every single customer that has walked into my store so I'm not even sure how that would be a possibility.

873,"It's currently me and one other person employed by the company. We do office work I won't be too specific but we each have clients we deal with.

He has told me that he keeps getting job offers and is also applying. But he is excited about one in particular and he's waiting to hear back from one and he would definitely leave (closer to home and way higher pay so can't blame him). He's been at the company less than 3 months and I have as well if that matters. 


My issue is that I am already worked at full capacity, this company has already been interviewing for a 3rd person with no success. Now if my coworker leaves I will literally not be able to to do all the work.

TL;DR/Issue: it's not a certainty my coworker will leave but a possibility. Do I warn my employer because I really don't want this work load to fall to me or just let things happen as they happen?

874,"Hi,

Me and my friends have a groupchat (A) for various things. I'm basically the type of guy you forget about, I rarely send texts or anything I just enjoy feeling included and I find comfort in the fact that I can always join them when they're making plans. 2 months ago they went on vacation and made a groupchat (B) to plan that. They asked me but I already had other plans so they made groupchat B without me understandably. 

During that vacation there were some troubles with 1 person and they're still angry with him. They try to have as less contact with him as possible. 

When a friend sent me a screenshot I saw a chat open with all my friends and even the same nicknames. My guess is that they made a groupchat without the ""bad"" friend but forgot to add me because I pretty forgetable and because they probably got everyone from groupchat B (which is basically everyone except me).

I feel really lonely especially during these times and that groupchat was the only thing that connected me to my friends.

880,"My fiancé and I recently moved into our first home - a first floor condo. It's in a very safe neighborhood and we love it. Our only complaint is that our upstairs neighbors have kids who run around a lot and the footsteps are very loud in our place. At times, we can even hear the glasses in our cabinets rattle a bit. Luckily we don't hear much yelling or screaming - only if we're in the bathrooms or laundry room - I guess through the pipes?

Anyway, I've been working from home a lot and it's very distracting. I understand that with COVID restrictions, the kids are probably stir crazy - we all are lol. But last weekend (our first weekend sleeping here), I didn't get to sleep in after a really tough week because I could hear the running through the ceiling. It was well before 9AM and I was a bit irked. I would like to be able to sleep until 10 peacefully on a Saturday or Sunday. 

When we first closed and started moving stuff in about a month ago, the father knocked on our door to say hello and welcome and told us if his kids were ever noisy, to let him know. After he left, my fiancé and I looked at each other and agreed that either he is very nice and wants his kids to behave - or he's warning us he's got the loudest kids ever. I would like to speak to the dad (or have my fiancé speak to him), but I also don't want to immediately have any sort of conflict with our neighbors.

I have considered getting a white noise machine, but to be honest, I don't think it'll help that much.

What should we do? Is there a tactful and respectful way to speak to the dad or should I just get some noise cancelling headphones for when I need to focus?

Thanks in advance!",14Aug2020,1

882,"I've never used reddit advice before, but I figured it might be worth a shot because I'm not entirely sure what to do here. 

**TL;DR: My suitemates have been ignoring the covid guidelines set in place by my university and have been bringing in 4+ people at a time into our suite, unmasked. There have been reports of multiple covid clusters on campus already but it doesn't seem to stop them from having their friends cram together into their room. I have barely talked to these people (they show no interest in me), but the small interactions I have had with them have not been good ones. Should I try talking to them? What should I say? Or should I report them?**

\------------------

Anyways, I'll try to keep this as brief but detailed as possible:

I'm living in an eight person suite in one of the dorms on my college campus. Originally I wasn't sure if I would move in at all because of covid but at the time at least two of my classes were in person (they have since been moved online so I have no in person classes anymore).

My college has put out a lot guidelines to try and stop the spread of covid around campus. One of these is that nobody is allowed in your room except for you and your roommate (which I do not have, my roommate's classes all got moved online before she moved in, so she decided to stay home). 

But a couple of my suitemates are ignoring this rule entirely. They keep bringing in people almost every night and they all cram into one room. Last night, one of them posted a video on their snapchat story of them and six other people who definitely do not live in our suite having a movie night, all sitting directly next to each other together, unmasked. 

I have barely talked to these people. I have tried to initiate a conversation many times, but every time they just seemed uninterested so I gave up. They seem to think my presence in the suite is annoying more than anything. One of them literally got annoyed when I went to use the bathroom. She immediately came out of her room and knocked on the door as soon as I had gotten in there and asked if she could use the bathroom because, ""I was already thinking about going before you went in there"". So something tells me having a civil conversation about this topic would not go well. 

I know that living on campus has its risks and I guess I technically signed up for this by choosing to move in. And I know that its going to be literally impossible to keep this virus from spreading across campus, especially since there are already cases in dorms nearby. But I would like to avoid getting it if possible, especially because both of my parents are slightly more at risk and I would feel incredibly bad if I gave it to them. 

\----

Anyways. I just feel kind of stuck because I know if I report them to the RA they will hate me and could easily try to report me for being too loud or something when I practice flute in my room (I'm a music minor and there is literally nowhere else on campus to practice because I have to take off my mask to play, practice rooms are closed too. And I've messaged all of them and told them they can tell me to stop if I am bothering them). 

So, any ideas on how to handle this situation? Should I try talking to them or report them?",14Aug2020,1

893,"My little brother keeps trying to guilt trip me over how I treated him in the past. He says I bullied him maliciously on a daily never ending basis. the thing is I dont remember doing that and he never gives specific instances. I do remember a few times we rough housed and a few instances of being a jerk when we were younger and I fully accept responsibility for that. I also recognize that if what he was saying is true that I wouldn't remember as much as he does because he is the victim meaning I understand there will be some stuff he remembers that I do not.  

Here is the problem though. 

1. Im really trying not to take away from his experience but this is important and why it is messing with my head so much; he is a known liar. He has lied time and time again to to protect his ego or absolve himself of responsibility. We often remember stories differently from the same night and he often retells stories by putting words in my mouth. It's so bad that I have no idea about anything in his life and if anything he says is true. So I'm sitting here wondering what hes even talking about when we were younger and wondering if I am being gaslight. 

2. This happened when I was younger than 10. Anything I do remember are flashes and fuzzy. Also at 10 years old I wasn't even aware of much. 

I've done my best to treat him right for as long as I can remember and I'm so confused right now. 

Basically my question is 2 parts
1. how guilty should I still feel about stuff I did when I was younger than 10. 

2. Is it possible I'm being gaslit. I dont doubt I did stuff I dont remember but I dont know how much I can even believe is true.

900,"I've been wanting to play dnd for years but could never work up the nerve. My friends invited me to play with them and I really wanted to try. I ended up listening to their current campaign over the skype call and got more comfortable with the idea of playing. I made a character and got pretty invested in the idea and was honestly excited to try. However, a few days ago my friend gave me the ""good news"": that they planned on recording it and uploading it as a podcast. I told them all I didn't really feel comfortable with it and they just don't seem to get why after I said I think i'd lose my nerve. 

What I didn't tell them is that while they're having fun and I think it's fun to hear knowing them, I don't think it'd make good radio by any means. The person running the game is friendly and knows how to keep it going but isn't doing any sort of big story, my friends clearly care about their characters but aren't any sort of masters of comedy/improv/acting. Their characters are pretty basic and don't have conflicts or development with each other. They often talk over each other, interrupt big moments and roleplay, their lines often break up, people talk in the background because they don't have quiet places to play. It's all fine for a personal game but again not good radio.  
Typically I'd just want to leave them alone and let them record it if they wanted but I feel like I should point this out because they honestly want to know why I don't want to do the podcast (I think they can tell i have more apprehensions than just my anxiety). I just don't think the quality they would put out is worth how much it would sour the experience for me, but I don't know how to say it in a way that doesn't come off as smug and mean! I really want to play, would feel significantly less anxious with friends, and worked hard on coming up with a character I like, so I don't just want to ditch the group. I feel stuck here, what should I say to them?",14Aug2020,1

902,"July 4th of last year I was handling a very tough situation with my mother. Because of this I had to leave to Indiana and try to start a new life there. I arrived in October to FT. Wayne. 2 months after I wanted to go back to Florida where I used to live with my mother. I told to this friend of mine  that we are going to call Chris if I can go back to Florida, stay a couple of months in his little department and after that rent a bigger apartment. He agreed. I was extremely grateful with him and I went back to Florida in December. Back to Florida we could find a extremely wealthy job and I could recover the money I lose. After numerous problems to get the lease of the new apartment we finally got it.  Just a little discussions was the problems I can remember about our relationship as roommates. Until he slap me meanwhile he was drunk, since then the relationship felt weird. Quarantine came and from talk every day now we just stayed in our rooms doing our things.   
Yesterday I arrived home and noticed that he took his things and he left without prior noticing me. He doesnt want to answer my messages but I'm talking with his sister to see what can we do next. I dont know why he hates me now but I'm not overthinking it anyways.   
We still have the lease contract until February of 2021 and of course he would not pay another month rent for it.   


What should I do ?  
I'm afraid that he goes to the apartment to steal my things, he kept the keys.   
I talked with my uncle he is a lawyer and maybe we can do something about it.

904,"Hello all,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Looking for a little advice from other human beings. I won't impulsively follow advice, just looking for others 2 cents. I will try to not go into extreme detail but here we go.

22 M, about to graduate with a 4 year degree. Currently in a relationship of 6 years that has had its ups and downs of varying extremes. At the start of this relationship before being a legal adult several years ago, I made some blunders. I watched porn and smoked black and milds against the wishes of my partner. I gave up these habits pretty quickly on, but this caused trust issues.  At this current moment, the terms of the relationship dictate that I have mostly supervised use of electronics (my phone, television, music, etc.). I cannot watch any unapproved television ( I miss the office), I can't listen to any rap ( I miss you 2pac), and I can't use my phone outside of the house unless there is an emergency. This didn't happen overnight, but I aim to diffuse bad situations and over the years I feel like I have auctioned off my life for the safety of my relationship. There have been some improvements, but not of any real size. 

Do I stay in this relationship and accept this and make the best out of it? Get a job locally doing what I can with a degree and hope for the best? Or do I cut ties with my current life and join the Peace Corp? I have yearned to do this for years and I could definitely not accomplish this with my current circumstances obviously. Nothing guarantees that the latter choice will end up better, but having the ability to control my future sounds pretty all right and I wouldn't mind spending two years in Guatemala...

TIA",14Aug2020,1

I've come to my parents three seperate times asking to go to the doctors because I think there is something wrong with me. coincidentally cancer. Everytime. Cancer is a huge part of my life even though im only 14. I've lost so many people to it. my best friend when I was 7, my grandma and grandpa, and cousin. I make the mistake of searching google endlessly. I've been like this all my life. The first time I went to my parents thinking I had cancer was when I was 11. I noticed a bump on my back. I did end up going to the doctors. I had scoliosis and I got a back brace for 2 years. Once my cousin died of brain cancer at the young age of 7. I know something shifted inside me. Second time my foot looked strange. I had a panic attack for 10 minuetes straight. I was shaking, I couldn't breathe. I had a panic attack over nothing. Literally nothing. That's just the way your foot is supposed to look. Third time was today. I know i'm starting to cross a line here. Everytime I notice something off I freak out. I'm not saying get scared, sleep it off. I mean I haven't slept in days. I'm googling symptoms nonstop. Crying. panic attacks. I don't know why this keeps happening. I feel like im going to die over stupid things. I'm exhausted. I've been freaking out non stop over a stupid injury. I literally don't no what to do.

908,"My girlfriend (20) and I have been dating for a while now. I bought an engagement ring because I know we both want to get married, I had saved the money (over many, many months) and, I found something perfect so I jumped on it. 

We have talked extensively about marriage and asking for a blessing. She is relatively indifferent about me telling them or asking for a blessing, but has specifically said not to ask for permission. 

She (as well as I, although differing ethnicities) has ethnic parents who are quite conservative in belief and quite overbearing in their parenting (according to my girlfriend) hence her desire for me to not place them in a position of authority over our marriage by asking for explicit permission instead of just telling them ahead of time. I’ve met them a few times, but we don’t know each other extremely well. 

I know that my girlfriend has no expectation of me even having a conversation with them at all, but a small part of me feels like it may be appreciated by them. At the same time, I’m worried for a host of reasons (us not being extremely close even though they’ve approved of me dating her thus far, my youth, or as a control mechanism over their only daughter) that they’ll say no or won’t take me seriously. 

I’m not exactly losing sleep over it. I know I will marry my girlfriend regardless and we will always be happy with one another regardless of her parents, but that doesn’t make them any less my in-laws who love their daughter dearly (and whom she loves dearly). Should I tell them in advance? Are my apprehensions normal given this situation?",14Aug2020,1
909,"Okay, so I work at a convenience store and I’m currently traveling and told my boss I would be back way earlier than I will be. I forgot to tell her I wasn’t going to be back at the original date until like a week before. 100% my fault. She was pissed because she now had almost 40 hours she needed covered. 
Once I’m back I’ll be in the dog house and fully accept whatever punishments she dishes out. 

I work there part time and the job isn’t part of my career path. 
However, I’m starting a new job in a month or so and now have to tell her I will only be able to work on the weekends. 

Obviously she’s still pretty mad and rightfully so. But at some point in the near future I’m going to have to tell her I need my hours cut down. 

Obviously I don’t want to get fired and leave on bad terms, but I’m far more concerned about getting experience in my field. 

Do I bite the bullet or is there a way around this that will work out to everyone’s benefit? 

I have until August 26th to let her know.",14Aug2020,1

911,"I am a 21 M who just discovered a passion for electronics which led me to a passion of physics in general. Considering my personality traits, I am the type who has to go over the basics step-by-step in order to reach a goal otherwise I get lost and give up on everything because it feels not organised for me. Another thing is, as a child I did not have time to enjoy science experiments at all (chemistry, physics...) which makes me feel that this child part of me stayed oppressed and ignored for too long that it wanted to manifest itself at multiple occasions during different periods of time. Neither have I ever had experiences for crafting things or manual made projects. This resulted in a lack of creativity that I am aware of at this age. 

I believe it is something incorporated in all human genes and feels extremely lacking when not being attempted. If  you built something as a child and still proud of making it please share you memory as well (even if its a replica).

That being said, the idea behind asking this question is to learn from projects you already made and experiment them.

I know sometimes people need to just vent and that I should keep my advice to myself unless people actively ask for it, but when I say the typical “yeah I hear ya” or “I’m sorry you’re going thru that” - I feel like it sounds so insincere!!

914,"The title is a bit odd, but I really don’t know how to word it better. Throwaway because I use my main to look at cats.  The extensive story is... vague to me, I have to admit. Most of my memories of the specifics are blocked off, most and specifics being the keywords.

So to start off, I suppose I should list the family that are involved here, and give some context. For the immediate family, my parents are ‘divorced’ (in my country divorce doesn’t exist, but there is a process similar to it that unlike divorce, makes it so legally, the marriage never happened, oh and I have no idea why they’re ‘divorced’, no one ever told me.) Mom lives alone, and dad has a gf and my half-brother; I’m not really aware of my custody arrangement but right now I’m staying with my mom due to me visiting her at the start of COVID and not wanting to bother my dad financially by coming over to his place. And I’m a minor who’s currently in junior high. I’m mostly going to talk about mom, and her side of the family.

A few years back, I was living with my mom, right? Well, she wasn’t exactly around at all. She had work and I almost never had a full conversation with her so I was usually isolated in my room; she hired a caretaker/house cleaner to make meals and tell me to take a bath of course, but my ‘lazy nature’ always caused them to quit and she’d have to hire someone else (I’m not exactly sure if my lazy nature was really being lazy, or just being depressed,) and since there was virtually no supervision, things sometimes got... bad. Like “one of the caretakers even hit my bum repeatedly if I couldn’t sleep before 7pm” bad. Then well, pass by a few years and I’m at middle school, at this point I’m older and she’s around more, but that’s kind of a bad thing. She would call me fat as a joke constantly, like, I admit I am chubby, but I’m not fat. I just have a bit of a stomach! Her family (my aunts usually) did the same, I think it was in a humorous tone like ‘OP you’re so fat!’ while trying to touch my stomach, and they even came up with a nickname around it, which was just belly spelled with an ie instead of the y. And at the time, I was being bullied, hard. One girl told me to jump off... well, you know. When the kids were only starting out, only calling me ugly and dumb outside of earshot, I tried to tell the family, but they just told me to ignore them. I stopped trying by the time that one girl said that thing to me, I cried about it, but tbh I’m not so sure if I was overreacting or not since she just said it, it’s not like she tried to push me off something or anything.  

 I think one of the worst things is my mom’s anger issues. She used to shout at me for minor things if she was in a really bad mood. I can list a few things that are stuck in my mind that she said that hurt, a lot. Once she told me I was a bitch for not being comfortable and not wanting to hug my at the time 4 yr cousin for a picture (I’m not really comfortable with hugs for the most part), then she tried to give me a 20 (converted to $) so I would forgive her, one of my aunts was there but she didn’t say anything. Another time she called me an asshole while we were shopping for school supplies, because I told her I wanted to reuse my pencil case from last year. Then got more upset when I chose a pencil case for [insert opposite gender], threatened to not get me a school bag, and only stopped when she started to attract attention to us. And something I remember vividly, her cursing me out because my graduation ceremony for middle school required students/me to be there at 8:15am, and I tried to tell her that, but she thought that we were supposed to be there by 9 (that was just the parent’s time to be there). All three times I ended up tearing  up and silently trying not to make a noise. I admit that’s probably a cry baby move.

That was all in the past, now, well... it’s sort of tamer? I go to a therapist now, since I ended up getting anxiety and depression, which made me distance myself from my mother and her family because of the things they said being hurtful even if they’re just jokes or just outbursts because of stress (my dad is the better parent, though he’s not the best parent, I don’t think he made me worse mentally at the very least). I don’t talk to my mom’s side much anymore, I like going on my phone and reading much more, but recently that’s led to them not only calling me fat, but snobbish as well, still in a jokey joke manner. They’re very physically affectionate, I’m sure you can tell by the hug thing I mentioned, but I’m... not, so usually I had to force myself to hug them and kiss them on the cheek. I‘m more comfortable with subtle motions like hand holding or leaning on each other. It’s honestly hard to even see them now, and I somewhat feel a bad fear every time my mom makes me join a video call with them and face the camera and say hello.

Now for the advice thing: my therapist has told me that I have experienced childhood trauma because of my mom and the things I have seen in my youth. They haven’t asked/advised me to confront anyone about this yet. But... I’ve kinda been telling my dad via video call about how my mom wasn’t really the best parent to me? And earlier this week my mom overheard once and started crying to me and saying that she was trying to change and I’m the one stuck in the past and not actually letting her back into my life and that’s it’s a choice to be positive and that there’s a way to cure depression. I don’t really know how to feel about what she said and I tried to tell her that I’m slowly dealing with what she did but I don’t think she really heard it. 

At this point I’ve been thinking about it a fair bit (been having a bad last 2 weeks, these kinda thoughts just come up) and I’m honestly not sure what to do. I have noticed now that I’m in high school my mom has been around more, but now she’s constantly pestering me and I can’t talk about my interests because I know she’ll restrict me from them. I don’t think she’s horrible, I still love her and I’m polite with her, and she pays for my therapy and my therapist is actually hers as well, but I’m really unsure how to approach our relationship, the same goes to her family, since I’ve been feeling some physical effects from it (hard to breathe when I have to face them, the thought of crying somewhere in my head.)

Should I forgive my mom (and her family) and try to get over my issues from the past? Should I call her out and try to talk with out? Should I try to consult my therapist about this next time we meet? Or do I do something else? I don’t know if I can cut them off, to be honest.

Honestly not sure, writing this at 5 in the morning on a bit of an impulse, haha... so, any advice?",14Aug2020,1

917,"Don't get me wrong, I've known this girl for 3 years now and we're in the same friend circle and we've talked many times about w/e. The first year I met her it was quite apparent that she didn't like me. Like at all. She had even kinda said that right to my face (like jokingly, but still). I was cool with that, I didn't really care because, well, I didn't really expect anything to happen between us, and we weren't even that close as friends. We were just acquainted. 

Fast forward to this day, I've noticed a ""weird?"" behavior from her side. It's like she's actually trying to flirt with me and her best friend is constantly telling me to go sit with her, wrap my arm around her, takes pictures of us and things like that. And he says these things out loud. Like in front of everyone in my friend group. And she doesn't seem to mind, like at all. Hell, she's even gotten more talkative towards me. 

So...my close friends are saying that given the circumstances , I should give it a go, ask her out and see what happens. Which is also what I've been thinking to do. 

But there's just something that's bothering me. I'm actually not really attracted to her. I'm flattered by her behavior and she's really cool but that's pretty much all I feel about her. Now I do believe that love isn't something instant, and that it is something created when we get to spend time and know someone. But in the end I don't wanna hurt her. I don't want to start dating her and then just tell her that I'm not physically attracted to her ( and she's objectively quite good looking).

Am I over thinking this? I think I should also state that I'm not really experienced when it comes to relationships. What do you people think about this?",14Aug2020,1

As the title suggests, I'm moving from one state to another. I've never done this before though so I could really use advice on what needs to be done for this move.

I already have a job and place lined up. Could I get advice on things that need to be updated/switched over and when? For example, I assume I'll need to update my license to the new state. Do I need to do that right away? Does registration need to be updated right away as well?  

Will my car insurance be completely different once I move? Is there a good order to change this stuff? I'll be driving to WA with my NY registered vehicle so I know I can't turn my plates in immediately. 

Any other big things you know of that I will have to update/change? I'll be shutting off my utility bills and things related to my present apartment. 

Any and all advice is really appreciated here. Thank you!

921,"With COVID, none of that is possible. At home I have a tiny room. 8ft x 8 ft. where I have my bed and study desk with desktop. My laptop got slow and useless last year so I've been using the desktop for everything.

I feel like part of my inability to be productive is that I don't have my laptop. Normally I'd take it outside somewhere to work but even at home I'd at least have the option to work somewhere else. At my dinner table, in another room, etc.

I feel like I should buy a laptop now so I can be productive. But part of me is saying ""you're making up excuses"". My desktop is good and fast, but it's where I waste my time most days. If I had a laptop I'd be able to move somewhere dedicated to working instead of working where I sleep, relax and passtime.

What do you think? How can I be more productive working in my bedroom? Or, do you think that might be too hard and buying a laptop could be worth it?

Thanks.",14Aug2020,1

923,"Ive been refraining from doing a reddit post about this but all I need is one person to give me some strong advice because I have hit a crossroads.

Im a 20 y/o F who's been living with my grandparents (they're in their 60s) for the past year. They smoke inside their house, have had rat, mice, ant, spider and bug problems year round which they just brush off. They have even gone as far to say they saw a rat in their living room while they were watching Tv and laughed about how close it got to them calling it their pet. I knew I needed to help them. So far Ive been able to get their mice and bug problem under control by going around the house by patching up holes. They are both retired. Their only hobbies seem to be smoking, watching CNN and running to the store to buy beer. Their house is nice, nice big front yard with privacy trees, big back yard with a pool, a lot of areas for gardening, but its all over grown. They don't hoard, they just haven't organized or really cleaned in years.

I would bleach and deep clean their kitchen for them, clean out and bleach their fridge, hospital clean the bathroom once a week, I dusted their living room for them. (which got covered in dust a week later). They don't do any cleaning to keep up. No family comes over anymore because they've lost all motivation in life. My grandparents both smoke constantly, they've stopped showering regularly, they haven't deep cleaned their bedroom in years, my grandpa blames my grandma and my grandma blames my grandpa. Before my grandpa retired he would work on ships for 6 months at a time. My grandma only smokes in her bedroom so the house never smelt like how it does now. Family started moving away and they stopped caring. My mom moved across the country to be with her boyfriend, my aunt moved 40 minutes away and my other aunt lives down the street. No one else in my family live like my grandparents. Ive tried asking my mom and aunt for advice but they all say the same thing, ""They won't change, stop wasting your time"". That hurts me because I feel like everyones lost hope in them. My aunt that lives 40 minutes away has two younger children. The reason she doesn't visit is because of the cigarette smoke. They could go swimming but the backyard looks terrible.

Now bare with me, I don't want this to be me listing all the reasons why they are terrible people, they aren't. My grandma is 65 and my grandpa is 67. My grandma got a divorce when my mom was a child and then met her current husband and got married. My grandma is the sweetest person but I can tell a part of her is missing.

They've done things like repaint the inside of their house to quit smoking, which didn't work. They keep up with their pool, they just got it resurfaced, they painted the outside of their house and now they have a new kitchen(there was a leak that created mold so insurance covered it) and are about to do the flooring in their house as well to match the kitchen.  I always tell my grandma that I will help her clean her room and her bathroom and whatever she needs help with but she wants to wait until the kitchen is done.

I want nothing more than for them to enjoy their life and take advantage of all they have and bring my family back together.

Heres the issue as well, I did some research on how to redo a grass lawn, because theirs is mostly dead and just grows weeds. I even went outside and felt the soil and figured out the texture....yes... I was that invested. I learned that their yard is currently a contributing factor to the insect problem and decided to talk to my grandpa about it. I told him I wanted to repair the yard and help him fix it up. He instantly told me he's tried that and nothing works and didn't want to hear anything else about the yard. Another issue is is that I WANT to spend all my money to just go out of the way and hire someone or spend money in the supplies to do it myself, but being 20 years old, its crucial I maintain being financially stable since I don't have any family who would be able to help me out. I know, it already sounds like a mess but I came up with a backup plan.

Next to the pool is a raised garden area. Its extremely overgrown with dead weeds but super easy to get rid of if I just go out there with a weed wacker. (refer to pictures)  I remember as a kid my grandma had a hummingbird feeder that she put next to the orange tree and hummingbirds always came around. I was thinking of emptying out that whole area, placing a stone path, and planting some simple flowers that would attract butterflies, and insects that are good. We have this old bench I can refurbish to put out there. Just so they have a small space to enjoy. My grandparents aren't super old, but their health an other problems don't allow them to do a lot of heavy labour.

They also have a black lab who's full of energy. I think a good activity for them would be to take him for a walk near the beach and go grab lunch somewhere. Meanwhile I can be at the house helping them clean up. (I don't know about anyone else but I clean faster by myself.)

Every single day I think of ideas but Im constantly stuck thinking ""what if they don't appreciate it?"" ""what if they don't keep up with it when I move out?"". My mom says its not worth it but I feel like im the only one who wants what's best for them.

I feel like I can't help too much since they think im helping them for selfish reasons (so that I get the house when they die) when in reality I want them to enjoy the house and have dinners and have family come over.

And at the end of the day I feel like I can't say much because they're adults and its their house. But they don't understand how badly its affecting their family.",14Aug2020,1
924,"Extreme trigger warning below, guys.

Throwaway account because my cousins follow my reddit, and they don't know.

First off, this is going to sound random as hell, but please, please, PLEASE give me the benefit of the doubt. I honestly don't know what to do, because incest is wrong as hell, but being with my sister makes me feel better than any man or woman.

Note that this all happens in the span of around 3 months.

So, my sister and I (F-21, F-18 respectively) live together in some cheap apartment, and she often works to support both of us, since she's older, and wants to anyway. Its been real hard ever our dad died in 2016, and I guess my mom couldn't handle it. She committed suicide in 2017. 

They left us an inheritance, but it didn't even last 2 years, what with our living standards at the time. 

So anyway, one day, she comes home completely exhausted, she hasn't had an off day in months. Every time I offer to get a job myself, she refuses, apparently to shield me from all the back pain? I guess it make sense, since I'm still in school, and I can't get anything other than a minimum wage job, but still. it would help i think, but she doesn't let.

That night, i'm giving her a back rub, because you know. But she asks me to go lower, which would mean squeezing her ass. So im like ""wtf? you sure?"" and she wants me to. Im kind of on edge at this point, because obviously massaging your older sister's buttcheeks is gonna have some negative connotations, but sure. I feel something wet on my palms, and what do you know, she's leaking.

Not pee, but *lady-part-juices*.

I guess in the hard time we were having, emotions just took over our better judgement, and soon enough, we're fingering eachother. It pains me to even write this, since incest is so wrong, but she's so adorable under me, i don't know what to feel anymore. We continue this spiel almost every night, and its still going on today. We've recently started incorporating...erm... using our mouths. 

Its our only way to feel something nice in the hard times, especially with the pandemic raging on. luckily its not as bad as where im from, but if we were in america... yeah, we'd probably be on the streets by now. 

Am I wrong for liking this? I know for a fact my parents are rolling in their graves right now, since they were extremely religious. luckily, they never forced it on us kids, but still. I dont want to stop making love to her, but both of us know its bad. We don't know what to do. She still works to support both of us, and its been really tough. This whole ""incest"" thing isnt helping either, at least not in the way we want it to.",14Aug2020,1

Then I was left with no left overs which I thought was the plan since I wouldn’t be able to cook for a while for my 3 kids and husband. 
My SIL and her cousin decided to go to my laundry room even though I said no and mixed my clean clothes and dirty clothes thinking they were helping. 
Oh and the cousins husband was constantly blowing his nose into a tissue and his shirt and not washing his hands. Disgusting, I know. 
So when I got too annoyed I went downstairs and said there was too many people, that’s when they started packing up and left. 
After they left I had to disinfect everything they touched which made me feel horrible after since I should’ve been in bed. 
I knew they were coming to town and I told my husband not to invite them over because I don’t need help and if I want help I would ask my own family ( I didn’t). I like my space and to add in a surgery I really really wanted to be on my own to heal. 
My husband says I’m selfish and I just don’t like his family And that they didn’t bother me because I was upstairs and they were downstairs. 

What can I do to make him understand my side?

931,"Hi everyone, this is a long one,

The situation is this: I have a cousin who's been sitting inside of his house for the last 7 years. No major medical issues or injuries, crimes or anything like that.

He has a degree in economics that he got at 23 from a top college on our country (not an easy thing to finish a career in 5 years on that college). In 2013 he got his degree and worked at a bank, doing an intership. Was doing well, dating a girl and all the regular stuff.

His intership ended kind of badly, because there was an issue with the bank and they didn't renew the contracts. So he was laid off from one day to the other. No worries, though, he had some savings and decided to take some time off. After all he had been studying hard for the last few yers. So far so good. 

The issue is that once he decided to take some time off, he never got back in and has been stuck for years now. He spends the day at his house on the PC, just going out for grocery shopping or on very special occasions. He doesn't see friends or family. I stay in touch with him because we play online every once in a while, but I often don't have time.

I offered him a job in the Marketing company that I work for multiple times. It's a pretty standard office job, not specialized. Maybe not a dream job, but it's an easy gig, the office is fun and it's something to do + an influx of cash. And he can do that while he applies to other jobs that he's interested in. But he tells me he is interested in banking and administration. I tell him that there's an administrative spot open on the company that he should apply for, but he told me that it is too much on the marketing brand and he's interested in banking.

His brother offered him a job at the factory he works in, basically, you show up when you feel like it and work. If you show up, you get paid, if not, you don't but it's ok. No contract, no major paperwork. He didn't want that either.

The thing is that when you speak to him, he's a regular perfectly functioning person, he doesn't sound depressed or anything like that. If you'd have never met him you wouldn't assume he spent the last 7 years basically sitting in front of a PC.

I'm not sure what he does to get an income. But the thing is that talking about him getting a job, asking about cash, etc are kind of touchy subjects and he always finishes those conversations immediately. I don't want to push it either, because if he's defensive about it I don't want to risk severing that connection (that's why I didn't mention seeking professional help either).

He does seem content enough, and maybe he is. I'm not one to meddle in someone else's business or tell them how to live their lives. But I also know that depression has many faces and doesn't necessarily mean that you sit and cry wrapped in a blanket. I fear he's throwing away his youth and I'd like to help if I can. If he's perfectly content then I guess that's fine, but I fear that one day he'll realize what he's done and regret losing all that time.

TLDR: The guy is smart and had a promising future at 23, but has been sitting at home for 7 years. And I don't know how to help kickstart him.

If you read until here, thank you!! I appreciate you taking the time even if you may not have a solution for this.

933,"This is probably too specific to post here, but maybe someone can help?  I am in a private graduate program (non-STEM) that wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I actually want to be in a STEM program (my school doesn't have any grad STEM programs). I have completed 1 of 4 semesters and the program doesn't have any scientific learning it's mostly just project creation. I should have known that would happen, and yes it is my fault. I feel like I am a much more scientific person and want to learn more about it.

My dilemma is that, I have already completed 1 semester, and, I feel like having ANY piece of paper is better than nothing. Yet, I feel like the work is pointless. It's not that it's not fun, it is! It's just pointless, and I don't feel like I am learning the things I want to. Here are my problems:

1. I am afraid to tell my advisor this, because I don't know what will happen.  Will I get kicked out?
2. I am afraid to drop this semester because I don't have any other options. I don't want to be doing nothing. I want to study a STEM program at some point. That is where my talents are.

School starts in 2 weeks and I'm panicking as I haven't paid tuition. I haven't been able to get into another school.

937,"It all started 6 months ago. 

there was someone harassing/bullying people through account/s. Not sure if it was just one person or multiple as apparently it was like 5 different accounts or so. It was blamed on me, not sure why as when I mean I don't know these people and their situations I really mean that. 

I'll go over the things I've been blamed for, for perspective. 

the account over a year ago dmed someone that I didn't even know existed a year ago, telling  something about his then gf that left her child. This was linked to me as I knew the father of that child, I didn't know the situation or her though.

the account dmed a bartender that I also don't know informing her of her boyfriend + manager and her co worker + best friend that they used to casually hookup. This was linked to me as I used to work there for a year. I didn't know of the bartender though.

5 months ago the account dmed some guy making fun of suicide and his mums death or something, don't know why this was linked to me as i don;t know this person or that his mother was dead.

the account dmed some girl that i don't know being really mean to her calling her names and laughing at her. I don't know why this would be linked to me also.

As well as some other things that no one would tell me about. I don't understand why this had to be all tossed on me. I don't know if it's actually some person close to these people blaming it on me as it's convenient or what. Or maybe blaming this on me because I'm foreign and stereo typically foreigner's are 'crazy' and 'weird'.

It's been 6 months and still people are talking about me, calling me all sorts of things, I got rid of my social media as I really had enough but still it hasn't stopped. I know that no matter what I say it'll be blamed on me as I can see that these people are adamant of it being me. Now in my town I'm labelled as some freak that has nothing better to do than to stalk these people, making fun of them, or make fun of awful things like suicide. It's really frustrating as it's not me, how am I even suppose to go anywhere anymore. I barely got out the house since then, ghosted my friends too.

I was also sexually abused 6 months ago, I only told a few friends that did believe it BUT it somehow got out so on top of everything I'm also being called a liar that cried wolf.

My life has been nothing but pain since 2020. Reading what these people have to say about me, (which btw ITS ALOT OF PEOPLE)  it slowly makes me believe that I am a horrible person even though I didn't do anything wrong. Sometimes I just feel like killing myself just to prove to these people that it's not me, cause if I'm dead and this person is still doing this then it clearly wouldn't be me if I'm dead.

So this is really embarrassing, but I need some serious help. I'm a huge book geek and sometimes I get sad and annoyed if someone in book community doesn't like the book I love. I know, it's stupid, and I never argue with people with different opinions, but that's just how I feel and it had never been a big problem before. But since the quarantine started, I haven't been able to enjoy any book properly because I'm always worried about pandemic and everything else going on in this world. But I got so worried and everything was effecting my mental health so much. I revisited a childhood favorite book series of mine, and luckily enough I was still able to enjoy it like I did when I was a kid. So then I decided to join it's fandom on twitter, Instagram, reddit and I discovered that one of the main character in the book, who is my favorite, is really hated in the fandom. And it made me so sad and mad because that character was my role model growing up. So I read everyone's opinion on that said character on the internet and I'm literally obsessed by the fact that everyone hate my favorite character. I read all the posts related to that character and then read all the comments under the posts and then even a simple comment like 'god I hated that character' make me so mad. I've been doing this for like 3 weeks now. My behavior is wrong and I know this but I just can't stop. And like before I was just worried about state of my country and state of world, and now I'm just obsessed about the fact someone doesn't like a fictional character and that make it even worse. Also, I've tried to distract myself with reading other books and tried other activities, but nothing seems to hold my interest.

Does anyone else feel this way? I feel like I'm just being extremely stupid and I cannot stop. And how do I fix this?",14Aug2020,1

954,"My cousins treats me like shit. Sometimes I feel like just never picking up her calls or texts.

It’s got to the point I feel I am her punching bag.

So me and her went to a wedding right. She wanted to get some cake for her, me and her brothers. 

I told her I feel embarrassed doing that because people were there and watching. And she isn’t embarrassed about anything, she is confident. 

She told me to just get, they don’t care because I’m young. I’m 20, and she’s 25. What’s the difference. She got annoyed with me so I just went and got it.

I put away the ones I got and she told me she wanted one she can eat, I told her I got these ones the least she can do is get the other herself she said no, and got annoyed. So I did it for her again.

Then later when we were leaving, and they were cutting the cake, she wanted to taste it and insisted I get it for her. But when I wanted it, she said get it yourself.


Before we left the house to go to this wedding, she and her brother got into an argument in the car. Like always she bought me in, this time she record her self and she was saying “this bitch also gets on my nerves like he does, they are so annoying etc” she thought i didn’t believe her so she showed me the video. 

I told her she’s not okay, she’s like what do you mean I’m not okay then I ignored her and she continue to talk to her brother.

The thing is that she uses her brother, so when he stands up for himself, she shuts it down. She thinks he is her personal Uber. She didn’t even ask or tell him  if he would drive us to the wedding. Instead she waited the last minute to ask him, they got into a big argument at the end he said okay.

Today I told her to send me all the videos and pictures we took. Instead she sent me only 10. You guys don’t understand during those two events we went to, I took for her about all together 50 or more videos and pictures.

Before the bridal party or the wedding, she decided we were going to get a dress made for us. 

She told me we would wake up lets say, 9am, the place is 30 to 40 minutes away. So the thing about me is that if someone says that the time we’re waking up, I already have the alarm set, so I woke up, and she is still asleep. Instead we ended leaving at 1pm that day. So I woke up for nothing, I wanted to go back to sleep so bad.

She did this like three or four days in the same week.  Because we had to go and find the person who was going to make the dress, then measure us, then come back and try it, then if it didn’t fit or wanted something loosen up we would have to come back and fix that. I told her I was sleep, but that didn’t stop her from telling me a completely different time to wake up.

Yet she had the guts to tell me I’m hard to wake up, and that nothing can wake me up. 

Another thing is that, for the wedding she insisted I wear this dress she bought and wanted to return to the wedding.

So she brought this cute dress, it was too tight on her so she said wear this, it shows your curves. She’s older than me so I listen to her right, I wore it to the wedding. I thought her I already had something to wear and I’m fine wearing that, she wouldn’t stop saying wear this you look amazing. 

Her and her brother had to go back to their houses, so I can pick up my stuff and take me to my house.

I didn’t have time to get undress and change, I change out of her shoes, then one item she gave me, and her bag she gave me. 

She never told me to get changed, I thought and felt bad for her brother always driving us when he’s tired and just wants to stay home so I changed out of whether I can and got bAkc in the car.

You wouldn’t believe what she said to me.

She asked if I got out of the dress, I told her no, I didn’t know if you guys wanted to wait long time until I got changed.

She said well now that you already wore it, pay me 25 for the dress and you can keep it.

I told her no thank you, I will bring it bZck to you

She said no it’s fine, just ask your mother.

I told her, I’m not doing that, you know I don’t have money, I don’t have job.

She said well you wore it so we can’t return it. 

The thing is that she already tried it before I did, which means she wore it before I did, otherwise she wouldn’t know it was right on her.

So why am I the one paying for it?

I don’t know what to, do you guys think I’m just overreacting?",14Aug2020,1
955,"I have two cats, a boy (2) and a girl (3). Normally every morning I feed them wet food and if i forget or one is asleep ill gently wake them so the other doesn't eat their share. Today I forgot so I went to wake up my boy cat about two hours later than their normal feeding time. He was sleeping in a cube on their cat tree so I gently touched his paw to wake him up like I always do.

Nornally when I wake him up this way he just meows at me and waits for food. However today once I touched him he hissed and lunged at me like he was going to claw my face up before launching off of my chest across the room and staring at me. This happened over the space of a few seconds. Obviously this scared the ever loving poop out of me and I started screaming. I dont know why he did this. Luckily my shirt and sweater absorbed his claws because I saw they were out. 

Why did he attack me like this? He is normally a hyper cat but he doesn't attack people, he is super friendly. Did I just wake him up from a dream or something? I'm kind of afraid of him now and everytime I close my eyes I see him flinging himself towards me with an angry face and it is terrifying.

960,"Before anything, I'm going to say that I'm a 17 year old Junior in High School. Now, onto the problem..

   I've failed many classes in the past, and it made so many people disappointed in me. Up until recently, we didn't know that I had a lot of mental problems, and ADHD was one of the causes for my behavior. I started seeing a Therapist for everything, and she's been wonderful, helping me through everything, but when all this Covid-19 shit started happening and students had to learn at home, it pretty much all went South.

   Once we figured out all of my problems, I was put on Adderall to help focus, and was even accepted into a program at a College nearby. I've been doing my learning there. The College looked at my grades and test scores, and I had great grades and test scores in Elementary and Middle School, so I was let in. Only problem is, now that I work from home, I haven't been able to focus or think straight, even with Adderall. I failed a couple classes, even though when I was at the College, I passed all of my classes and never missed any assignments. Around Spring break, I was admitted into the hospital for suicidal tendencies, and after a week, was ready to go back home. However, school was now working from home. As I said, I failed multiple classes while working from home, and I was a big disappointment to my mother. We got into multiple fights over this, and I even threatened to run away, while she threatened to get rid of all our rescue animals.

   Don't get me wrong, my mother is a great person, but was already stressed from work, and took it out on me. After the fight, school was pretty much over, so I didn't have to work anymore. Now, I have school from home starting this Monday, and am feeling that I should just drop out. I haven't talked to anyone about this but my brother, but I don't want to disappoint anyone. If I stay in school, I know that I'm bound to fail even more, and that would disappoint them even more. I get that I'm being selfish, but I really can't take anymore of the feeling, knowing that I'm disappointing my whole family by failing even more than I already have. At the same time, I don't really want to drop out. I want to finish school, but I just can't. I've cried over this multiple times, (please do not make fun of my, I'm a very emotional person,) and have kind of just acted as though everything is fine. I'm torn between these decisions, but I feel like if I drop out, then they won't be disappointed as much as me failing them yet again. I'm sorry if this seems narcissistic or anything, but I'm genuinely scared and worried that I won't be everything they want me to be. I can't stop thinking about it. Any advice would be great",14Aug2020,1
961,"I apologize if this is long but it is a breakdown of who I am and my situation. I posted a few months back and received no responses. I have been married for nearly 8 years, before that I was a bit of a wanderer. Due to a screwed up situation I never graduated from high school (I got a GED). I eventually joined the Navy and planned on being a lifer. I unfortunately got injured after a very short time and was med out. I fell hard into a bottle and was completely lost. My mom helped me out of that funk and shortly after I was homeless for 5 years traveling 48 states and 3 countries a few years before I settled down. Eventually I felt beyond alone so I stumbled into a marriage. I started working in security but due to the low pay and lack of advancements in my area I never stuck with one company too long. I eventually got up to decent pay and great hours but my wife broke her leg and I was forced to quit since we had to move. She wasn't able to work so we lost a lot of financial stability. When we got back to our hometown I was back to low pay jobs due to the cities economy. I went from 16.00 an hour to 9.00 an hour. After months of barely surviving I made the decision with my wife to quit and move to Chicago. I was going to be moving alone and once I had a job/apartment she would come out with our kids (We have 2 young children) I put my 2 weeks notice in and bought a ticket. Everything was looking up until I got to the airport. I was experiencing severe stomach pain and I blacked out. When I came too, I was at the hospital. They had diagnosed me with food poisoning and advised that I rest and not fly right away. I was than released. Unfortunately I had to purchase a Greyhound ticket back to my small town which was more expensive than the flight. After a couple weeks at home and still in severe pain, my symptoms got worse. I was having difficulty breathing and was mildly jaundice. My wife rushed me to the ER. I was than told my gallbladder was severely infected and I had multiple stones. I was than drove back to the big city by ambulance. I had my gallbladder surgery but it was worse than the doctor expected . Normally its a quick recovery but for me it took weeks. I eventually recovered and was a little distressed on what to do next. I was not wanting to do security because in my small town it is high risk with low pay and options were highly limited. I was about to go back to my former boss and request my job back when this Covid crisis happened. Now my city is suffering in this shutdown. We lost one major employer and a few are on partly staffed opening.  I have a lot of time to think and feel like this city is dying fast. My wife refuses to move and I cant blame her. We have an apartment and all bills are paid. However after nearly a year of looking for work with little response, I feel hopeless. I never learned any skills growing up, I am unable to do a lot of heavy labor due to arthritis and a bad back, and I am not highly educated. I have considered going to college but have been burned by a college before so I am highly nervous. I just know I need to find a career and a direction ASAP due to me being 33 and having a family to take care of. Sorry for the long post and thank you for your any advice.",14Aug2020,1

Now the situation between my brother and my mother is very tense. My mother is fed up with my brother constantly firing up against everything she says, his vocabulary, his attitude. My brother has been feeling unsupported by her for years, and has been hurt by some of her deeds and she won't aknowledge it. He has some serious anger issues he worked hard to manage, but I'm still afraid the situation will escalate. 

He has just graduated high school and found a flat he could move into next year, but for that, he needs someone that can vouch for him financially.

I guess smoking is not in our family's values and I myself have never felt the desire to do so. I do think smoking weed can have negative consequences, but at the end of the day I believe it's his own choice, and I don't think this measure will change anything beyond further pitting him against her. However since he's not an adult and doesn't earn money, i feel like it's also my mother's right to decide she doesn't want him to spend her money that way, and that technically he has to comply with her rules.

972,"My dad has disgusting habits at home. He never shaves his face, and he has really bulgy hair and disgusting whiskers growing everywhere. Every time my dad watches TV, he has really scary habits. He reclines all the way back on the couch, puts a large bowl of chips and Oreos on his lap, and eats them while smacking his lips, and he watches really loud TV shows where people talk about politics and stuff. I can't stand listening to the TV because I can't even think clearly when the TV is on. And holy cow, he goes through several dozen cans of soda each week, which makes him really gassy. He also eats too much M and M's and Pringles and Doritos each day. His behavior is just rude and vulgar. 

My dad uses too much toilet paper. We put a roll in a shared bathroom and it's gone after just one day. And my dad probably uses about 80% of the toilet paper, despite that he only accounts for one-seventh of the family population. I can hear him have massive diarrhea the whole time (because he is lactose intolerant and he drinks milk and eats chocolate cookies). He wads up the toilet paper and throws them in the toilet and then he doesn't even flush all the way. There is always feces lingering in the toilet bowl.

During the summer, my dad also walks around the house shirtless. He is shirtless at the dining table, when he does the yardwork or gets the mail, or when he is in the backyard. He has tons of chest hair, and the most embarrassing thing is that he has three breasts. He doesn't bother to cover it up with a T-shirt, and the neighbors just laugh their heads off every time they see him.

The worst part is that my dad farts non-stop. It's probably all the snacks he eats, as well his lactose intolerance problems. I avoid him for this very reason. When he is doing the laundry, he farts like 20 times in the laundry room and it smells like hell each time I go in there. I always keep an outfit out of the laundry room that I wear in case I have no clean clothes left and the laundry room reeks with my dad's farts.

976,"Hi, English isn't not my first language, so I will apologize upfront from any mistakes. 

I am a brazilian whose currently in the process of immigrant to Canada, because of my family. They need me to take a decision (whether to stay, to go back, what college to do, etc) and it has been causing arguments and worsening my family situation. I hope I can get some useful advices to have a more clear mind in those discussions.

I have experienced depression since young age (10-11), along with suicidal thoughts. I lived my entire life thinking that, eventually, I would die and never, actually, made plans for the future, since I thought I wouldn't have any. I have lied a million times that I want to be a doctor or a psychiatrist, just to soothe my mom, but honestly I don't know. 

It's been 2-3 years since my last attempt and, with proper help and some lying in the way, I don't think I'll try again. I have the mindset of ""living until having a motive to live"" and ""too afraid that dying isn't the actual end"", both of which seem enough to make me stick around a little longer.

I am 18 now, almost 19. I just finished high school last year (December 2019), although the virus situation is delaying my student visa, I will start college this year, or the next one. I have no idea what to do, I don't know what I want to be. I have no dreams, no hopes and just thinking about the future makes me so anxious and upset. 

Before I wanted to be a teacher, in Brazil, at least. Because I like studying and learning new things and I wanted an stable government job, so I won't worried about money as much. I don't mind living a simpler, less expensive lifestyle nor do I want kids or bigger monetary responsibilities. However I do not go well in frequent social situations with strangers. So teaching seemed like a good option, (between chemistry and arts, history) but at the same time I know how teenagers suck and they are mean, and teaching in Canada is not what I wanted, so I would need to go back to Brazil... I guess?

Things like hobbies could turn into a job, so I thought I could be an artist (i am relatively good at it?) but the money is the primarily issue in this case, being a freelancer worries me and I have enough anxiety as it is. Also, I am really good at learning languages, hence me being a polyglot (Japanese, Portuguese, English, Spanish, Korean, French). But how learning a language can be a job? Translation is just overwork and underpay, but governmental translation requires so much. Maybe teaching? God.

I know is asking too much to someone tell me what to do with my life, since it is mine. But I don't know anymore. Right now I can't think about the future and if I don't, I know it is gonna be worse later on. The pressure to make a decision is making me regress in the progress I did with my mental state. I can't decide my whole life in my teens, but I have to go to university or else I will have to go back to Brazil. I just want to work minimum wage and have a daily routine that is set and I don't have to worry about.

Can someone help me? Telling jobs that are secure, government issued, without much human contact that does (or maybe not) require a college, without much math (I have ADHD, math is my mortal enemy) and is just... boring. I like boring stuff. Or maybe if teaching in Canada is a good area, so just do chemistry or art. Or if I should do minimum wage jobs for the rest of my life and not to worry about it. Or anything.

977,"I'm going off to college tomorrow. All my family members are happy for me, wishing me good luck and best wishes. Except my younger brother. All he cares about is moving into my room. That's it.

At the last house, my little brother got the larger of the two rooms. It was more of a transition home between our first home and this one, so we only stayed there for two years. His room was larger, and had nice windows. My parents, me, and my brother agreed that I would get the larger room this time.

In our current house, my room is pretty big. It's got three windows, a decently sized closet, and enough space to have all my furniture with lots of open room.
My brothers room is the opposite. It's very tiny, with very little room for him to maneuver around. Part of it is because he keeps it an absolute mess most of the time. Some of his stuff is stored downsairs- mostly junk he never uses like old toys and pictures and stuff.

I am fully understanding why he would want my room. It is more than twice the size of my room, and we had talked about the possibility of switching long ago, years before I went to college. But now, things are very different. I can more clearly see the situation,  and considering I will be back in four months, it really doesn't seem worth it. Covid doesn't make it any better- what if I come back in one month instead?

My brother has grown increasingly frustrated with this, and is basically refusing to talk to me. He keeps saying that he'll move everything himself, and that's highly impractical. Besides- I'm letting him use my car, which I pay for with my own money, even through college. Yet his argument is ""You told me to use it!"" The reason I told him to use it is so he could save up his money and buy his own car. Instead of spending in on a new gaming computer. Like he just did.

I have really gotten to a point where I have just been firm and saying No, but I really want to make it right with him. It isn't practical to do this, and I will be back in 4 months, living for a little longer than 2, back to school again, and then living here for the summer.

Tl;dr My brother wants to move into my larger room, but he can't see why it's impractical due to the circumstances.",14Aug2020,1
978,"Throw away account

Before me and my girlfriend where together she was talking to a guy on tinder. She had a broken leg wrapped in a cast at the time, using crutches to walk. The guy messaged her in the middle of the night and said he thinks he is near her house (he was round his friends) and asked if they wanted to go on a walk together.

They met up near the end of a housing estate and they walked over a bridge into a more wooded area. This is where he began trying to touch her and she kept saying no. When my girlfriend said ""I just wanna talk"" he moaned at her for ""wasting his time, making a worthless trip"". He then threw away her crutches and pulled her into the woods where he forced himself on her.

My girlfriend is the really quite shy girl that doesn't have many friends. Would rather sit quietly in her room painting then going out clubbing. I was with her for 3 years before she confessed this to me. I have no doubt that she is telling the truth as I can see the affects of this event first hand and she is not the type of girl to lie about this kind of thing at all.

She has never told anyone apart from me this and I've tried to convince her to go to the police. But she says without evidence it's pointless. I've tried to convince her to try counselling or theorpy but the first counseller she had told her that she was wasting her time.

I know the guy's name and look at his Facebook everyone and again and I hate it. I love her so much and to see her still in such pain while he looks so happy breaks me so much. She saw him while we where driving the other day and it made her super depressed for a few weeks.

What do I do in this situation? I want people to know what this guy did and what kind of person he is, but I don't know the right way of doing it.

982,"Hi, Advisers of Reddit, 

I will stress this is happening in Spain and UK.

TLDR: working a terrible job with a terrible boss. Friend asks me to join new amazing company but I have to be self-employed.  


The full story, minus names.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a conundrum. 

So I work in a job that is *very* mundane with little chance of excelling. I joined the company just under 2 years ago with prospects climbing high, it was basically a start-up, 20 years in the making. However, I was soon pinned under the sorting hat of an asshole manager, who made sure that I wouldn't get any further than her talons could grasp. (There's no way I can escape without sullying the company as a whole if I complain, it's that small.) 

Fast forward almost 2 years. I have no training (other than what I have picked up myself) no real evidence that I am a better worker than I started out as (although I have been taking as many online classes as possible on the sly) my manager is her same asshole self and has a new asshole in training to be her dept. 

In the interim, before COVID unleashed itself on the world, I started a side gig for a mate. He needed someone to help with his bosses' ""new website"" and paid me 400 a month to write news for this website and make sure all the grammar was legit, yadda yadda. Great! I love money. Money pays bills.

This week a got a coffee with said mate where he said ""Boss is thinking we'll need you full time."" Well, thank fucking pringles! I told him sounds great, let me know the details. 

Today he calls me on the phone, obv while driving. He says ""Hey, the boss wants you to be 'self-employed' under contract to the company."" He then prattles along saying ""this way you have more flexible hours, you can take holiday without a problem"", etc.

So now I feel like I've gone from a frying pan into a non-disclosure agreement.

My mate even said, ""give us how much you want to be paid so we can discuss."" 

So **WE** can discuss it? I feel like I'm walking into an MLM! Do you want me to work for you or sell fucking soap?

I won't lie, the past 8 months the people in this side company (with the exception of one, fuck you anon) have been amazing. I love being creative and it's really been a big boost for me. 

But I got off the phone with my friend/coworker today and feel very curtailed. Why didn't he say this shit on Monday when we met? He was pushing contract mode like it's the best thing ever, but I KNOW that means companies can drop you on a dime when they see fit.

Am I going to be a means to an end? I give 6 months and I'm done? I was told on Monday that after 3 months I would ""need to recruit"" and ""lead a team."" Now on Friday, I'm being told I new to be self-employed to join the company?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice, seriously. I hate my present job and this news seemed like a dream on Monday. But the Friday call just left me feeling sick and I need internet advice.",14Aug2020,1
983,"I’m finally going to upgrade from my little 2002 Mazda to my first real “grown up” car! I need help narrowing down my options. 

Some background: I love cars, I always have. My mom said both my brother and I could indentify the makes and models of cars from the time we were very young. But when I say I love cars, I mostly mean the way they look and their functionality. I know how to jack a car up, change/rotate tires, change the oil, etc., but that’s not the appeal to me. I’ve always dreamed of having a luxury car, but that’s just not in my budget right now lol. 

I would love an SUV. But I’m open to sedans as well. No matter what car I get, I’m not going with the base model. I know what I like and I would prefer a higher trim (premium, touring, etc.). I am drawn towards the new safety features such as blind spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, lane departure alert, etc.

So the story is, we have a cat. She's the cutest little thing ever and we all love her to bits. She's treated like a queen at all times. We give her treats before breakfast and treats whenever she begs for them.

A few months ago, a lot of other cats have started coming to our house. And we have noticed one is looking very thin and constantly has cuts all over him. So we've decided to start feeding him. He's been building up strength and some of his cuts healed. But then other cats started coming and we are a very loving family so we give them all food. 

Now lately I've noticed our own cat is becoming less eager to eat her food and more so the food we leave out for other cats. Am I over thinking this or is there something wrong with her? Are we mentally abusing her by making her jealous? Is she simply full from the treats we give her (she eats a lot of treats.... whenever she begs we always give in and give her a handful of treats)? Is it even jealousy?? Like i know that she knows she's a queen.

It feels comfortable, but also concerns me for some reason.

I also find myself getting frustrated with the ""negative"" traits of my partner more and more, though I hate to admit that I never brought that up with him. He would worry about that too much, and I don't want him to feel worse than honestly necessary.

995,"So me (17) and my ex (17) recently broke up and while we were dating her mum was a huge issue. My ex’s mum left her with her nanny when she was 5 to 14. During that time her dad left as well to go to a different country so she has huge abandonment issues especially with parental figures.

Her mum knows this clearly and is manipulating her. Her mum won’t show my ex any love at all for months and then if I was to make a mistake and hurt my ex she’d finally swoop in and act like a caring mother and then a week later she’d go back to not caring.

My ex had mental breakdowns over this, she’d cry to me saying things like “I’m not appreciated at all at home, my mum doesn’t care about me, my siblings hit me, yell at me and treat me like shit. I just want a loving family” I always told her it’s not a good situation and that she needs to get out and she always said she would do that the second she could bc she genuinely hated it there.

I was good for her bc I was able to take all the mental baggage and She said to me after we broke up: “thank you for teaching me how to love and trust someone again” she’s had major trust issues and it took a year for her to begin to trust me. She kept thinking I had a ulterior motive bc I was being nice. It kind of broke me.

So with the break up I kind of hurt my ex a little over the time we were dating and so did my mum apparently. She tried to take her own life after the break up and so the mum came abusing me and talking about looking after her little baby and everything. I knew this wouldn’t last and I was beyond livid.

So when we broke up I did try talking to her and we finished on better terms but she still wanted away from me for a while. We talked for a while and I learnt more about the situation, her mum was putting ideas in her head about me wanting to break up with her, that I was a vile boy who was trying to hurt her, a boy who she couldn’t trust bc I kept pointing out health issues with her.

I desperately want to help her get out bc that disgusting woman doesn’t care about my ex, I expect her to come back to me in like a month saying that her mum is being a bitch again and I want to help her realise she’s being manipulated. My parents are against it bc they don’t want to see me get hurt again and that it’s not my responsibility but I can’t just sit back and know that someone is going through that, where they’re friend or foe no one deserves it.

My sister said I should definitely help her bc she went through something similar when going through foster homes and if she stays in it she’s going to go through so much more hell. I know how I need to help her I’m just worried if I can’t help her and was wondering what I can do if I can’t help her myself. I also don’t want to get with a guy in the future bc she has so many issues I don’t think many other people could deal with so many issues in a girl and he’ll end up hurting her and she sadly always went for the wrong kind of guys before me.

She doesn’t deserve more pain bc deep down she’s a sweet girl who grew up in a fucked up situation and just wants real love.

I guess I want to know what people on here recommend and if any of you know the best way to help her.",14Aug2020,1
996,"TLDR - I don't like any of the people I call my friend, how do I go about dropping them?

I understand the title is really arrogant, and I'm sure I'm going to say some things that sound arrogant, but I can assure you that I do not mean to sound that way, nobody I know would describe me as arrogant.

First thing I'll say about this whole situation, it's always seemed since like middle school (I'm 20 at the moment) that my life is a porno, and I'm the camera man. I'm always seeing people having the time of their life while I just watch.

My phone stays 100% dry until one of my friends (but if I'm being honest, calling them friends is quite generous) needs a ride home from work, or until one of my friends needs me to dogsit for them, or until one of my friends needs to get a package shipped to my place so their mom doesn't yell at them for spending all their money on useless crap.

I scroll through my Snapchat and I see all my friends out and about, at parties or whatever. I've never been invited to any of those. The closest I've come is the drunken 2am calls where they ask me to come pick them up from the party they didn't invite me to because they know I'm sober because I don't drink. Whenenver they have any sort of relationship troubles, any problems with their family, whatever else, I'm always the first person they go to. I don't know why. All my friends have just appointed me as their therapist. I hate it. I never get to see these people in a positive state, and I suspect that nobody does. I'm inclined to believe from what I'm seeing from them that they are never in a good mood unless they're drunk or high.

Furthermore, it's a trend with all these people to bitch about results that they're not getting from the work that they didn't do. They will all complain about not having any money, but they're always spending it on weed and other useless bullshit. They will complain about their fitness, but then I never see them in the gym. They will complain about their job, but I see them making zero steps towards a job that they would want. I'm not trying to act perfect here - I've certainly done my fair share of this in the past, but I don't do it anymore and I don't want to be around it.

I'm sure we've all heard that you will become like the people you surround yourself with. I'm very worried that surrounding myself with these people is dragging me down. I'm not socially gifted by any means, meeting new people is terrifying to me. While I really don't like any of these people, it's very hard for me to just drop them, as they're probably the closest thing to friends that I have.

997,"My parents got divorced 8 years ago and a few months ago they started working together.Last night my father got drunk and in the morning my dad told my mom that the presentation they were going to was cancelled by him then my mom told him that she can do the presentation with one of his workers but he still said no.
Then their costumer stoped working with them so my dad fired my mom.So my mom got angry told me that she cant trust my dad(because he always changes his decisions and doing that usually goe).

Also last year my mom said that if I can enter the school I wanted to go we could  stay in a different place(The place we stayed at had a lot of drug users)
and I did enter that school but my  mom said we cant move there because he is afraid that my dad wouldnt pay the rent at some point. Like I said he always changes his decisions.

if we stay here me and my sister wont be safe but my sister will go to a better school

if we move out we will be safer but my sister will go to a really bad school and there is the risk of my father not paying the rent at some point

998,"For the longest time I've wished I was a guy. I want a dick and I feel like there is something missing where my vagina is. Like I have this really strong sense that there should be a penis there?



I'm into masculine clothing (always have been) but present myself both in a male and female way. I hate my breasts and I want a chest binder to see what I'd look like flat chested and so I can wear it under clothes. Initially I wanted this because I was insecure of my breast size as a woman, but now it's more because I wanna look like a guy.



I feel like I don't have enough 'male' clothes but I enjoy big clothes to make me look less feminine. I like wearing my boyfriend's clothes. I wish I had a male wig to see what I'd look like as a guy, not sure where I can get one cheap (under £10)



Im into some stereotypically masculine things (guitar, rock music, gaming, action/violent films) and I feel like I could express myself more with these if I were a guy.



When I was a kid I overheard my Mum talking about a celebrity who had a transgender kid (didn't say the word trans, but mention that they'd had a 'sex change' and I assumed this meant genital replacement, but I didn't know what bottom surgery was at the time, I was like 7) and I thought I had been born a boy and 'turned into a girl' because I thought I looked like a boy in my baby photos. My friend and I saw each others vaginas once when we were like 7 (lmao) and she said mine looked like a penis (I'll leave that to your imagination).



However, I do like feminine outfits and makeup, and I have thought about being trans but I don't believe I am, I would be too worried to change my voice due to it having a lasting effect and I know I want biological kids. I think also I'd feel I was letting my boyfriend down. I theoretically asked him if he'd date me if I was a guy with a vagina and he said it would be different but maybe.



Sorry about the terrible grammar and stuff, I kinda rush typed this as I need a place to get it all out. I'm confused but I think I'm just mistaking this urge to be a man for wanting a more masculine gender expression. Typically I do wear more feminine clothing but I'm becoming increasingly aware of my lack of manliness and lack of male genitals and it's becoming difficult in a way? ¿",14Aug2020,1

This is my first reddit post and I’m looking for some advice. When I was 18 (I’m 25 now) A family member was blamed for something I did. I took a shower and was on my period. I used a washcloth and thought I got all the blood off so I put it on top of the washing machine since it was still wet to wash later. I guess I didn’t get all the blood off and my mom asked me if the washcloth was mine and I said no. My cousin who was living with us got blamed for it. She was asked to stop living with us and she moved back to her home state. 

My mom is a big gossiper so she told several relatives what happened. A little white lie turned into a big mess. I was a stupid 18 year old and don’t know why I lied about something so insignificant. I have always been closed off and embarrassed when it comes to things like periods and sex. When I first got my period I didn’t tell my mom and used toilet paper in my underwear. I’m still embarrassed about it and tell her I’m taking aspirin for a headache instead of cramps. I don’t know why I feel this way I just do. 

I didn’t mean for all this to happen and really didn’t mean to hurt my cousin. We were always close when we were younger and she was always nothing but nice to me. My cousin still talks to our relatives, comes to family events, and talks to my mom a little but they have always felt like the black sheep of the family and this kinda reinforced it. 

I know I’m being selfish but I’m scared to tell the truth. I’m really introverted and my family are the only people I talk to. I still live with my mom and she is the type to never let you live down your mistakes (and she can get really angry).

They just announced this yesterday, and today, without even asking or telling me, my mom sent an email to the school telling them that I’m not going to be going in this year. 

I am so pissed off that she did this. It’s my senior year, and I wanted to have the couple days of the week to go to school. I understand her concern for the virus, but my school is taking PLENTY of steps in keeping us safe and being cautious. These include only having 10 kids per class, sitting 6 feet apart, wearing masks, having hand sanitizer dispensers in every room, AND having plexiglass between us when we eat lunch.

It is so unfair that she made the decision for me and I’ve been sobbing all day because one: I find remote learning to be super difficult and I can’t really focus when I’m working at home. And two: I wanted to actually see people who I haven’t seen in months. I’ve been stuck in my house (as everyone else), and just having TWO days of the week to be somewhere would be perfectly fine.

1007,"I'm an adult with a good income and own my own home. Years ago now, I was having some health issues and my parents moved in with me to ""help"" - although I didn't need help. During that time I continued to work full time and was fully capable of handling my house even if I would have had to hire some things out. They've always been fairly controlling and opinionated but they wanted to ""help"" and I wasn't feeling up to standing up to them at the time so I let them move in.

Fast forward 7 years down the road and they haven't left. I want to sell my current home and purchase something smaller for just me. Quite frankly, I don't care what they do. If they want this house, I'd sell it to them at no profit.  I'm fine with starting over from what I have in savings. If they want to go somewhere else too...whatever...but I don't want to live together anymore. I'm weighed down and unmotivated day to day because I am limiting my time in the common areas of the house to get some alone time. When I do have the house to myself for a few hours, I am so productive and feel so much more relaxed and lighter.

The problem comes in that I have a dog that I had before they moved in. Then 5 years ago they got a dog. Now the two have grown up together essentially. I also work long shifts and they say it would be wrong of me to have a dog and then be gone at work for 14 hours. I would make sure a dog had a way to get outside, a fenced in yard, and had food/water while I was gone, but they say that if I lived alone I couldn't have a dog and they would take my dog. I don't want them to take my dog. I don't want to separate the dogs. So I'm basically here until my dog passes. He's a 9.5 year old lab so he has probably 1-3 years left. We've always had labs and we've never had one live past 12.

 much afford to purchase a second home right now depending on how picky I was with the property.  I just want to live by myself and I know that's not too much to ask as a self-sufficient 30-something. But I also know I should wait until my dog passes. I'm constantly feeling impatient with getting away on my own and I know I have to wait. So, that was the extremely long way to say, how do I feel less impatient? How do I better tolerate the current situation until I am able to change it? I'm sick of feeling impatient and longing for something so far down the road.",14Aug2020,1
1008,"Around 6 months ago I started dating a girl who had been my friend for a couple of months prior. I’ve noticed (especially since quarantine started and I see her less) that I somewhat panic or just get really nervous around her. Usually when I’m around her someone else is there because when im alone with her it usually gets a bit awkward because of my nervousness. My brain usually just turns into a jumbled mess and I struggle to pick something to say/ talk about. 

Dont get me wrong, I don’t dislike her and I’m not afraid of her, but I still panic when I’m alone with her. It’s also not her fault that I get nervous, she’s never done anything wrong and she’s incredibly sweet so I’m not sure why this happens. It also only happens in person, I can text her perfectly fine without getting nervous. 

I’ve decided to ask this subreddit because I feel guilty about the nervousness and I want it to stop or get better. I feel like if i werent nervous around her we could have an even better relationship so any advice on what I can do to be less nervous around her would be great. (Also, should I post this to r/relationship advice as well?)

I just realized how much of a mess this post is but I’m not sure how to structure this anymore.",14Aug2020,1
1009,"Me and my fiancé are currently planning on moving from CA to AZ in December. We are working till then to save up and have money to get a place out there. We do not live together at the moment, we both are living with our parents so I’m kinda clueless on how it works.

My job can transfer out there, and he can possibly get a job out there through his cousin (not 100% sure). Would it be best to crash in his grandparents living room? Or save up enough to afford the fees and deposit to get our own place, and try to get a job ASAP?",14Aug2020,1

1011,"I (21) live in the middle of PA, in the woods where everything is at least a half hour away. I happily went to a university in 2017 for a month when i was diagnosed with epilepsy and withdrew. After that I was in an extremely manipulative and toxic relationship with my boss/ boyfriend for 3 years, helping him open a business, and stuck at home or at work. Since i have epilepsy, I couldnt (still cant) drive, so I have been confined in my room, taking medications that make me depressed on top of not having any friends either. I was depressed and am just starting to pull myself above water. However with that pain, I also have lost the feeling of fear and although I love my parents, home feels like an absolute prison. Ive dumped that guy, dont work for his business, and feel like theres absolutely nothing here for me.

  
Anyway... I technically have a car which I cant use but have been paying for for 2 years. I have 13k saved up, enrolled in online school again, adopting a dog in a year, and want to move to Virginia. My parents are scared that I will hurt or die in my sleep because of my epilepsy so theyd want me to move in with someone (a stranger). Id consider myself depressed right now because of my circumstances, but im hoping this slump will improve if i get my life started on my own.

I'm (16F) going swimming tomorrow with my family and I'm fine with not wearing makeup around them, but there's lots of other people my age there.

I only wear mascara. My eyelashes are blonde so they're a bit tricky to see, and they're pretty thin so it makes me feel better to have them tinted or to just wear mascara.

I don't own any waterproof mascara right now, so I can't resort to that. And wearing my non-waterproof mascara might result in me looking like a raccoon.

1015,"Am I ripping off my roommate or am I doing what she deserves?

This is gonna be a long one. 
BACKSTORY: 
I don’t have a backbone at all, I will never be able to stand up for myself because I can’t stand conflict. So I move across the country with my ex boyfriend in July 1,2019. So we lived with his “best friend” of ten years and his mother and the “best friends” girlfriend. Then we had to move out of there because the mother ( she’s Mexican, which dont mean anything just some context.) She always hated me since we first met. Because I’m deaf and in the mornings she would say good morning but I cant hear her so therefore I wouldn’t say good morning back, automatically she thought I was a bitch. She also knew I was deaf.
My ex and I ended up getting kicked out and we moved into an apt together on December 1,2019 and then I realized I didn’t love him at all. ( I just started a new job when WE moved in to the new apt.) So I moved out after paying all of the bills while I lived there. 
I moved out to a different number apt but same complex. I’ve never been by myself like this, I grew up taking care of my siblings (3) because my mother wasn’t a good mother and then I took care of my ex’s “best friends “ family and girlfriend. Then I took care of just my ex, at this time I was completely alone. I’m definitely a caregiver and if there is no one to take care of I felt useless and paranoid. I was so upset at the fact that I wasn’t taking care of anyone and I couldn’t take care of myself because that was so pointless to me.
So I started going out with tinder guys and having people over and just being free, it helped me a lot but I wasn’t satisfied. So I decided to find an animal, I found this dog and I had to wait a few weeks to get her because she was still too young to take home, and I couldn’t wait long enough so I found a roommate. My current roommate works with me at my new job, I’ve been there since December 3,2019. Then she moved in and everything was great! I can take care of someone I automatically got so much happier and my dog finally could come home with me. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, around the beginning of the Rona virus, I noticed that she was being a little annoyed about me going out and just hanging out with guys. And she made me feel like I wasn’t giving her enough attention or anything, so I stopped going out to make her feel better, at this time I started to grow to hate myself because I wasn’t happy anymore. I was just stuck at home all the time. After a while she started to be more and more aggressive with me and my dog in the beginning was starting to like her more because I would Discipline the dog as I should have, if she potted somewhere she wasn’t allowed to or ripped up something, I would show her what I’m mad about tell her that is bad then put her in the cage until she calms down or I felt like it was time to come out. I would not beat her or anything it was just one slap on the butt. ( my ex and I used this Disciplinary skill on our Pittbull and he learned everything like potty trained, sit, shake, wait, and a lot more stuff within 2 months) but my roommate wouldn’t discipline the dog like I asked her to if I wasn’t home and so the dog liked her more because she was only feeding her treats when she would rip up the baseboards of my apt or rip up the tiles and she would praise her while I was gone. So it was counteracting my skills of showing her that’s not okay. So obviously the dog listened to her more. My roommate made me feel like I wasn’t able to train her at all or I was doing to wrong. So I gave her my dog, and now it’s her dog. 
Now for the story. My roommate would call me stupid or ugly. She always puts me down any chance she can. She controls who and when I go out. We have a lot of unspoken rules, like I’m not allowed to go out ever, whether she is home or not, or she would be so angry with me. I can’t even hang out with people I chilled with wayyy before she moved in. She belittles all of my ideas and thoughts about everything. Example: I have extra masks in my locker at work so if anyone needs one I have some. My roommate comes up to me and says she cleaned out “our” locker because it was “gross.” I said thank you I appreciate that. But then I was thinking that my locker was fairly clean it only had extra masks, users hairnets, extra hats, extra pads and tampons and also pain meds, just in case anyone needs it. So I said you mean the hairnets? She said yes and the masks in the locker, I said oh those are clean we can put them back because they are extra for anyone else, she gave me the dirtiest look and said that she don’t care about anyone else at work and that’s there too bad that they don’t have a mask. And then she stormed off. I’ve told her I don’t like her attitude towards me when she belittles me or gets sassy, she’s gotten in my face at work and said that she don’t care and that I should just get used to it. Then she walked away. 
So the bills. I have full control over the bills because it’s my place and everything is under my name, nothing with hers.
This is exactly what I paid last month with her here 
Rent: 887$ 
Electric: 124$
WiFi: 72$ 
So roughly 1,100 a month. 
But I told her
Rent: 900$ 
Electric:200$
WiFi:75$
Renters insurance:20$ ( paid off completely, she don’t know that obviously) 
Food: 200$ 
So roughly 1,400$ monthly
And we recently split the bills in half because of COVID and my hours getting cut. So 700$ each. 
But I’m only paying 400$ monthly. 
I feel awful about it but if she wouldn’t treat me like absolute garbage I wouldn’t do it. But if I kick her out I would only save 200$ monthly but with her I can save 1,000$ monthly.",14Aug2020,1

1019,"okay so my mom intrdouced me to my stepdad's friend's son the other day and, bc my mom + brother are asian, they assumed i'd have a crush on them before i could even meet them. consequently, they teased me in front of them despite me showing no signs of liking them. 

. my main priority is wanting to get to know him and become his friend bc he seems really cool and really sweet, but i'm just worried? like, what if he heard the teasing and thinks im crushing on him/feels awkward around me? or like what if im just bothering him?? now im worried i have a placebo crush on top of it bc i get the crush-y anxiety. 

i ended up messaging him as he was on a drive back to his hometown but then it ended in a way where he just heart reacted my last message and that was like a day ago. 

idk if i should continue talking to him or not? like i really want to talk to him, but i don't want him to feel obligated to talk to me + i dont want to bother him + i don't want hiim to see a message from me and think ""ugh its this b\*\*\* again"" or ""ugh it's this person again"" and just respond out of politeness. 

some other context is that his first language isn't the same as mine, which ik can make it difficult to respond sometimes, and that we met up 2x in person with family. we also won't be in the same country in a month because i'm going back to my uni country. the short conversation we had before seemed to have equal effort, except for one or two sentences which were just like ""yeah that must be it"" or ""yeah my favorite  by him is this"" (i responded in a similar way because i was tired and worried to bother, and thats where it ended) 

some other context is i have social anxiety and that i was raised in an emotional abusive household, so i constantly hate myself and have a hard time feeling like im not bothering...

should i message him? and would it be weird if i message him randomly in like x days? or would it just be like ""ugh my dad's friend's stepdaughter is being annoying"". 

another thing that im worried abt is that bc of the teasing my mom and bro did, if i sent him a photo of like ""yo look at this"" of something we were talking abt or asking him to play the online version of a game he taught us, it may look like im crushing?? 

i dont know if i make sense but i'd be happy to clarify anything. i guess i dont know if i should continue to pursue this friendship or if i should just idk",14Aug2020,1
1020,"so i want to move out. i am currently a high school student in my final year, working 2 jobs, one at $15/hour and one for around $450 a month. the minimum wage in my province is $14.60. most of the money i make goes towards helping pay bills in my family. i want to move as far away as i can in order to be me, but im scared if i move too far, i won't be able to come home quickly (my mother's weak and easily gets ill). i don't want to feel like i am abandoning them, but i just can't take it anymore, and i need to meet people who will accept me for me. it not like i am leaving them alone forever, i will still send money back home when i can, and my brother (hes almost 30) and my dad both work. i don't want to rely on them anymore.

my questions are:

1. approximately how much would i need to save up if i wanted to move into a dorm or something (canada's average tuition for one year is around $6500 a year) alone?
2. should i rent an studio or something, or stick with a dorm?

4. should i start off at a cheaper school, and then attend a higher ranked school?
5. what type of things would i need to know how to do if i moved out alone?
6. should i move out even? or just stay here?
7. should i stay in my province, or go to a cheaper province?
8. how many universities should i apply for?
9. is it okay to change majors in university or does it delay your graduation?
10. if i do get an apartment of something, how much would i need to make a month in order to survive without a roommate?
11. my family wants me to go into computer science. i want to go into architecture or forensic science, but there arent' many jobs in those fields. should i take the risk? or stick with computer science? what if i too many people go into computer science and there are no jobs left? what do i do then???????
12. if i have an average grade of 75%-80%ish, can i apply to good/mid-ranking schools or should i apply for all the backup schools that people apply to?
13. how hard is it to get into universities?
14. how should i come out to my homophobic family? i am bi and am out to a lot of people already. i am south asian, so my parents want me to get an arranged marriage to a man but idk if i will like the thought of that. my plan is to never tell them or only tell them if i want to marry a woman.",14Aug2020,1
1021,"So I'm just an ordinary 23yo university student living in the suburbs of Melbourne. I live in this one student apartment which has three floors, each floor with a common area, kitchen, bathroom and 10 individual rooms of about 10x15 ft2 each. The rona hit us hard and most tenants at my floor who are international students had gone back to their respective home countries, so now there's only 4 of us left on my floor. 

One of them lives just next to my room. I'll call her G. G is a white woman who's undertaking a graduate degree in the nearby university (where I'm also currently studying). From her phone conversations that I more often than not inadvertently overheard because walls between rooms are way too thin, she seems to be the same age as my own mum. Everything about her is sweet and all, except for one problem that keeps bugging me to this day: she would not do her own dishes. 

Before you start pre-empting that she's an arsehole and this post belongs in r/EntitledBitch, I should first mention that G is actually suffering from depression due to her own financial difficulties. She barely scrapes by on her own, having to live off government support funds and also to regularly rely on food charity donations from a nearby parish. In addition, she also suffers from obesity and diabetes, which she keeps claiming causes serious fatigue from time to time; she gets dizzy spells and gets tired very easily as well. 

So anyway, it started early this year after G moved in (I had been living there for a year by then). Whenever I walked past the sink, there would always be a pile of dishes waiting to be washed. The first few times it happened, I just passed it off assuming someone had forgotten to do the dishes and they would be washed and returned to the dish rack sometime soon. We don't have a dishwasher so all washing has to be done by hand. But then days went by and not only did the dishes not get washed, more piled up and on top of that there would be mess just lying here and there in the kitchen. Sometimes dirty bowls and utensils would end up on the dish rack (not even in the sink), sometimes butter-stained knives would end up on the kitchen counter. As the first few weeks went by I started to get annoyed by the sight of unwashed dishes, but at that time I was living with a new set of housemates so the culprit could be anyone, not just G. 

And so I started a subtle investigation: if I hear that someone is cooking, I would wait until he/she has finished and get out of my room, pretending to get a snack from the fridge or to go to the toilet, but in reality checking to see if they'd wash the dishes after their meals. Eventually my investigation narrowed down to just one possible culprit: G. But given how recently she just moved in and given how I would have small chats with G more often than with other housemates, I still wasn't exactly sure if it was her and wasn't ready to just confront her about it. 

So I wanted to let G admit to this herself. One day while I was cooking and G walked past, I started the conversation by subtly bringing this up, 

""Not sure who keeps refusing to do these dishes, they're all just piling up here."" 

G got slightly startled, and sounded visibly uncomfortable when she said, ""Oh that might have been me. I have diabetes and so I suffer from fatigue every now and then. I could wash the dishes if you want me to.""

""Ahh then, I'd be glad if you could do that."" I replied, and then she went ahead and washed the dishes. Finally.

After she washed, she just approached me. ""Sorry about that, I hope you're not angry at me for this.""

""Oh nah, it's all well and good."" It's not. But still I smiled and replied and just went on cooking. 

Some months went by and one day as I finished cooking my meal and was about to plate my food, I found that some plates and bowls have gone missing. Same goes for the usual spoons, forks and knives. At that time I had not suspected G and again, assumed that someone would return them the next day, cleaned and all. But they were just gone, and throughout the next few days dishes and utensils would disappear off the rack one by one. It got to the point that there were only two plastic plates left to use and no utensils so I had to buy my own. 

I was frustrated and one day as I was cooking and G walked past, I greeted her and while we were chatting, I tried hinting at her saying, 

""Ugh now there's just dishes and utensils disappearing from the rack. You'd think someone just nicked them off the rack and claim them for themselves or something..."" 

I think it hit G in some way, but in any case we just kept on chatting for a bit. Eventually she retired to her room and I resumed cooking. Some minutes later her door opened and she carried some of the missing plates out from her room saying, 

""I found some in my room, do you want me to wash them now?"" 

I almost had a Sherlock Holmes ""AHA!"" moment, but I only replied with the affirmative. She only brought out like 3 plates and I wanted to give her the benefit of doubt that it's someone else holding on to the rest of them. ""Bummer, now I have to find some way to get back the other missing ones,"" I thought to myself. 

Then there was this one day where she hired someone to help clean her room for her. And what do you know, the cleaners started carrying dozens of dishes and utensils from her room! All of the plates, bowls, spoons, forks, knives that have gone missing before were all accounted for **from her room alone**! And yes by the way, every single one of them looked like they had not been cleaned for months and there's just dried out grease and food scraps on all of them that looked absolutely nasty. G was in the common area while they were cleaning. At first I really wanted to storm at G and yell at her about the dishes, but I withheld myself and simply took the dishes to the kitchen sink and started washing them one by one until they were squeaky clean. The cleaners tried to tell me that the dishes and utensils belong to G so I had to explain to them that all of them actually belong to this apartment. They just nodded and kept on cleaning the room, and I kept washing the dishes and putting them back to where they rightfully belonged. 

After that, G and I just went on with our businesses like nothing happened at all, but deep down my feelings of uneasiness only grew. I started to find it absurd that one would succumb to diabetic dizzy spells when washing the dishes especially considering she would only need to wash one dish and perhaps a pair of utensils after each meal, and I'm seriously doubting whether or not she is merely using fatigue as an excuse to absolve herself from this responsibility. And given that in the recent weeks she actually started **cooking** her own meals instead of ordering in as she usually does, my doubts only grew even stronger. If cooking wouldn't cause fatigue, why would washing the dishes?

Even now, piles of dishes would still always end up unwashed in the sink and for my part, I would start washing them myself if they look like they'd spill over the brim of the sink. I really want to confront G about this, but at the same time I feel that I would be the arsehole for demanding her to do something beyond her capabilities if she is really telling the truth. After all, **she was diagnosed with diabetes and fatigue**. Anyone with any advice on how I should go with this? Should I confront G about this, and if yes how should I bring it to her?",14Aug2020,1
1022,"I'm staying at my aunt's house until the 22nd. It's a huge tradition where all of us cousins stay at her country house that's in the middle of nowehere and has a swimming pool (basically paradise) for +/- 10 days every summer. 

In the weeks before I got here I wasn't feeling it at all. I'm pretty sure I have seasonal depression or whatever and I could feel it coming. (I ""started the process"" of killing myself last year twice - didn't go through - and I don't want to go through all that again.) I remember a few days ago breaking down crying thinking I should be checking into a psych yard instead of going on vacation.

I'm just anxious 24/7 and don't feel comfortable at all. I came to bed 2 hours ago (everyone else is still very much awake) and have been crying since. I've only been in the house for 2 days and some of my cousins haven't even arrived yet.

When I was a kid I used to be scared of my older cousins and call my mom every day to come pick me up, after that I wasn't invited back for years. I don't want to do that again at the age of 20. 

I want to go away but I don't want to raise any questions, my cousins are gonna be really fucking mad at me if I leave, this is in the middle of nowehere it's really hard to get here, there are so many reasons for it to be too late for me to want to go back.

1023,"My mother and I have a long and complicated past. I feel no love for her and don’t want to communicate at all. She has abused me many different times in many different ways. She has bad mouthed me to our entire family. She has used me as a scapegoat in all her problems for years. 

So she has had a sad life, and fails at just about everything. She constantly plays the victim card even when it’s clearly her fault. She’s tried to use men to fill the hole in her life and fails miserably every time because she is utterly unbearable, and doesn’t understand why. It’s sad.

My problem is that she has been pushing a relationship with me for the past few months. She sends me messages all the time and I read them and never reply. It’s annoying because she doesn’t get the hint and I’m tired of getting messages.

Well anyways I finally replied to the messages and we have started a relationship again. She’s getting me all involved in her life and I just don’t want it. I’m way to nice of a person to just say, “ leave me alone”. And I feel bad for her. But just talking to her hurts me. Being around her hurts me. And I know that if I tell her so she is going to bad mouth me to all of the family and they will treat me even worse.

When I got the news I was so excited. I'll be the first in my immediate family to go to college. I'm like breaking generational addictions and choices right in front of my family's eyes.

Does anyone have advice on making friends, class work, etc?

How can I deal with this without deteriorating my mental health? How can I make it work so I can enjoy my free day? Classes start this month and end on December, so I know it's temporary, luckily!

1033,I don’t know why I get easily angered and irritated by other people and their habits. For example a person have seen my message but not respond or someone making stupid remarks I just can’t deal with stupid people. Sometimes I think other people are below me and don’t deserve my sympathy. Sometimes I don’t feel guilty for stepping on and using people because they can be easily used and disposed but I tend to get angry if I don’t get what I want or ignored I don’t know what to do.,14Aug2020,1
1034,"18m 167lbs, main reason I haven’t started working out sooner is that I have trouble putting together an exercise plan and sticking to it. Basically I’m not sure what workouts to prioritize or how many reps/sets of each I should be doing for the best results.

I’m looking to work really hard on my upper body as my legs are already decently developed. If someone could give me some advice on what to incorporate into a workout/lifting routine that would be much appreciated. Diet advice is welcome as well.

1035,"**TL;DR: Haven't talked to my friend/crush (who was in a relationship) in two months after confessing how I felt, should I text her again?**

Hi, \*all the people involved are 19-20\*

There was this girl I had a crush on but we were friends. Eventually, she started dating someone else because I didn't tell her that I liked her because of a personal reason that I will not get into.

anyway, I lashed out at her because she wasn't responding to my texts anymore (but some of the anger was because I was mad that she dated someone else) and when she explained that she was busy or she that didn't feel good I just told her that she was ghosting me and didn't text her for a month.

after that I started texting her again at first she was very distant but she came around after a while and I told her the truth about why I really didn't message her and in asked her if she ever had feelings for me and her response was ""I get confused with my feelings a lot, but I really like having you around""

anyway, she started ignoring me again after a while and then Instead of lashing out again I just told her the whole truth which was the fact that I liked here way before she started dating that guy and that I can't be friends with here because there were way too many feelings and she told me that for what it was worth she wasn't happy either and that time and distance will fix my issue.

its been 2 and a half months since that and I'm starting to miss her again. should I go ahead and text even though the last two times we fought I was the one who swallowed their pride and texted first! or should I just let it go and not text her ever again?

I kinda don't wanna swallow my pride because I'm the one who was hurt here and she hasn't even bothered to check up on me in two freaking months to see how I was but I still care about her and miss her!",14Aug2020,1
1036,"We put down money to buy a house, and signed a contract to have it built.  Our lease at our apt. is over in Sept.  Graciously, they allowed us to extend out our lease (at a higher rate, of course), but we only extended it out to Dec. Now the builder is saying we are looking at possibly as late as March, we are considering signing another year-lease (which would require 2 month notice, and a 2 month's rate breaking fee) to try and keep our cost down. 

My main question is for the home builder.  Do we have any type of recourse to help alleviate us financially? Either by lowering the cost of the house, or by helping us with our monthly rate of higher rent costs?  Is this something typical that we can use?  Is there something I'm not considering?

1038,I really did think he was the one for me but I fucked up real bad and didn’t ask him out in time and now he’s starting to date other girls. I asked him if he had a gf and he actually got defensive and said “why do u always say stuff I never said...show me where I said that” but I don’t get why he would even get defensive other than I said he doesn’t like me and stuff to other people so I guess that’s what he meant by why do u say stuff I never said. Anyways I know I fkd things up and now he never wants to chill with me anymore. He’s always busy going on dates with other girls. I’ve known this guy for 3 years and the whole time I’ve known him we’ve been talking everyday all day and chilling almost everyday he’s never acted like this before it’s like he doesn’t want me in his life anymore. It hurts sooo much to even realize that but I do need to get over him. What’s the best way to get over a guy in my situation?

1040,"I really don't know what to do or if I should do anything in this situation. I recently had an appointment with my psychiatrist over the phone and he kind of blew up on me because I told him that I wasn't taking my medications for a while because someone wasn't allowing me to take them and I've finally got that person out of my life after finally getting a legitimate excuse to get this person out of my life (thank goodness that the pandemic made it easy to get away from them). I told him that I was off my medications because I wanted to restart them but taper up from a low dose because I'm on a high dose of a few psychiatric medications and don't want to deal with side affects. I was also going to ask him for a referral to see a therapist. I don't know if there was a miscommunication on my part but after that appointment I felt really hurt and betrayed. 

Being off of the medication ultimately isn't good for me (I was having symptoms of my mental illness when off medication, basically severe depression and strange thoughts although I was coping alright before this incident). Now my mental health is getting a lot worse as time goes on. 

Ultimately my psychiatrist accused me of being on drugs and being a drug seeker (which I am not, I don't even drink or smoke tobacco or marijuana) and he ultimately decided to drop me as a patient. He said to go talk to my family doctor. I'm pretty sure that my psychiatrist is going to tell my family doctor that I'm drug seeking and/or on drugs. I'm scared that if he says that it will impede me getting treatment for a physical condition that I have been seeking help for (fibromyalgia) 

I had a breakdown after this and cried for a long time because I've been trying really hard to stay mentally well.

I ended up reaching out to people from a mental health agency that I go to (they are a drop in facility that does mental health promotion) but their clinical coordinator was out on vacation so they connected me with someone else who was filling in for her until she comes back on Monday. The person filling in said that she needed time to think about how to help (I'm assuming to read my case file) so she told me that she would call me the next morning and she did and told me that she probably cannot activate my file at the agency she works at to get me counseling and thought that it would be worth connecting me to a domestic violence outreach worker but they were on leave until the 24th (there was an alternative number which I called which I got no answer and went to voicemail and left my name and number). It was suggested that I also try and get in contact with my family doctor to get an appointment to restart my medications earlier than my next appointment (which I had booked for a different reason altogether which is still a bit away on the 24th). 

I still haven't heard back from the domestic violence outreach worker. (although I am safe right now). One of the peer supports from the agency that I connected with checked in on me today. 

I don't really feel safe right now though. My mental health is worsening and I'm getting really anxious and paranoid. I keep hearing and seeing things outside and it's making it so that I can't sleep which in turn is making my mental health worse. I don't know if there is actually anything or anyone outside at night (it could be that my mind is playing tricks on me). I keep having thoughts of self injury and strange thoughts that are worsening, and my mood is very low. I've tried positive coping skills that I do know and they have only helped minimally. 

 I was told to call the crisis line if I felt I need it but I've called it previously and had a bad experience. I've also had a bad experience being hospitalized previously. Now also would not be a good time to be hospitalized because I have a lot of work on the go right now (both paid and unpaid) and cannot afford to lose these opportunities. 

 I'm also starting to have second thoughts about going back on my medications because I'm scared that the psychiatrist didn't have good intentions behind how I was medicated (although the person who was filling in for the clinical coordinator st the agency I connected with is a nurse and said that the medication that I'm on was fairly normal to see in her experience, she's been a nurse for a long time because she did a mental health assessment on me a decade ago when I was a kid, I remembered her by name) 

I really don't know what to do or how to talk to my family doctor during my next appointment with him which will be an over the phone appointment.",14Aug2020,1

1044,"If the answer is because it needs a second parent to financially support it, why cannot the government pay half for it...just as it does for couples of two parents whom are already poor when they produce the kid?

Also, parents that put it up for adoption can still avoid paying for it before someone has adopted it, if they did not directly adopt it out to someone such as if it goes to an adoption agency or a foster group home.

Is this all heteronormative and monogamy-normative (different people have different salaries, so uniformly arguing that someone needs two parents instead of one is like arguing that someone needs three parents instead of two).",14Aug2020,1
1045,"On mobile. Am sorry for the lack of formatting. Ill try to explain this and a few other things in the best way possible. 

I should be clear that the reason I am asking for advice is not because anything is a huge issue, but that there are a lot of smaller issues that have been building up and despite many attempts to resolve them, my wife and I frequently discuss our concerns with eachother and address these concerns with my ex fairly often with little or no resolution.

My ex and I have been apart for quite some time now. For all intents and purposes we'll say 9 years. The exact time is a little blurry due to a few brief reunions while she was pregnant with our youngest. He was almost aborted actually. My ex's grandparents who she had lived with actually paid for it. We were semi back together at this time and I went with her on the 2 hour trip to the abortion center. I was completely against it, but i went with her anyway. I watched her pay the ~$350 at the first visit and sat there while they examined her and our baby.

I also want to make it clear that I am absolutely pro-choice. If people want an abortion, then that's fine. This isn't about abortion in general, this is about the abortion of my child which I had no say in.

You don't get an abortion the day you pay. You only get examined and scheduled for a few days or a week later.

I talked to her about it. Then I begged her. I even went as far as sending ultrasound videos of what baby's as far along as ours go through. They were as graphic as a video in an abortion clinic could be. Im not proud of it, but i was desperate and time was running out to save my child.

In the end, she chose not to go through with the abortion. (The money wasn't refundable) This was probably, for me, the end of our relationship emotionally.

For some backstory into my life, I was a victim involved in a pretty tragic situation and unfortunately it led me to committing a few misdemeanor thefts not out of need but out of desire and using drugs and alcohol. Another thing im not proud of. Anyway, I cleaned up my life since then. The vast bulk of this behavior was prior to the birth of our first child.

There were constant issues with seeing the kids after we split up. It got way worse when I (23) met my wife (19).

By this time my youngest was 1 and my oldest was 3. My (future) wife was okay with me having kids and actually enjoyed it, to my relief because I really had a connection with her and how she is with my kids means a lot to me.

Seeing the kids was spotty. Sometimes we wouldn't see them for weeks, other times she would ask us if we could watch them out of the blue. 

Prior to meeting my wife there was actually a solid two weeks where I had them when she went on some kind of bender with her new boyfriend. I only got to see them this time because her controlling grandparents wouldn't babysit for her because they didn't like her boyfriend just as much as they didn't like me.

Point is, despite asking to see them daily, i was only good enough when she had no one else to babysit.

Eventually I filed for custody pro se and without a lawyer representing me due to not having a few thousand dollars laying around.

My ex didn't either, but her grandparents did.

I went in and explained to the judge that my ex was on drugs, that she has a spotty relationship with her abusive boyfriend who smashed her windshield and exposing the kids to all of it. I explained how my (future) wife has been steadily around for years at this point. (kids were 4 and 6 at this point and we had been living together in a small rent-to-own home for 3 years at this point) I filed for 50/50 custody between my ex an I with shared physical/legal custody.

Well, without a lawyer and facing a decent lawyer in the field, I was ripped apart. I was given a few hours supervised visitation per week.

About a year later, for separate reasons, my ex's existing grandparents passed away. My ex never knew her father and her mother is a semi-homeless alcoholic who is in and out of jail. She quickly agreed to 50/50 with shared physical/legal custody. Custody wise, things have been great and fair ever since.

However...

For years my ex continued to go back with her abusive windshield smashing boyfriend. The kids on multiple occasions witnessed and heard verbal and physical abuse. Nothing bad enough for me to justify calling Children &amp; Youth, but something my wife and i would worry about getting worse. On a few occasions we would have to ask the kids if anyone was hurting them or hitting them. We even added a phone like and gave our oldest a cell phone because we were scared that they possibly weren't safe.

During one of their breakups, my ex had her windshield and bedroom window smashed. For a few months she let her mom sleep on her couch. After kicking her mom out, her mom broke in through a window and stole things. While the kids didn't directly see these things, they have come home with their mom to find them and have been exposed to these things.

My ex has moved four times in the past 5 years and changed jobs just as many times. One job she worked at was at Job Corps. Before leaving that job, she met a 17 year old student as a 29 year old employee. After graduation and after turning 18 he moved in with her and our children. She says they waited until he was 18 to have sex. 

Meanwhile, in this same timeframe my wife and i became married, purchased our home, purchased a small business, I volunteer with local non-profits and serve as a local municipal elected official. We both kinda sucked as people and parents, but over time I have moved on from that and I dont feel like my ex has. I will say that she absolutely loves the kids and they have never been beaten, abused, or neglected.

I'd be lying if I said my wife and i didn't talk about filing for more custody every few weeks when there would be another situation that concerned us. There was the time that in April during the rise of the pandemic she drove across the state to pick up her boyfriend's online gaming friend and brought him to their house and let him sleep in the living room with my 11 year old. There's also the time, also during this pandemic, that she took the kids to her cousin's house to stay the night while she went out. Her cousin was arrested for selling meth and having a gun a few months ago and I frequently make it clear that I'm more than willing to take them when she has plans. There was also the time that the kids told us that my ex and her boyfriend just stay in their bedroom with the door closed playing video games all day.

My wife and i bring most things up to my ex but things rarely change or only change for a short time. When we brought up the bedroom situation my ex said ""we started keeping the door open recently"".

Unfortunately, each individual thing is not a big enough issue to actually do anything about. But every few weeks there's another thing that happens or we find out about that raise concerns about safety, or morals, or mental health, etc. We are worried that things will continue like this or even worse.

So... I'd appreciate any advice...",14Aug2020,1
