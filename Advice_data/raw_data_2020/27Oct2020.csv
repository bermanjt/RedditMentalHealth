0,"Not because I can’t physically but because I don’t want to even though it would be in my best interest if i did. I feel like it is hindering my ability to be someone useful in this life. I feel so far behind my peers. I feel sad and lost. Maybe it has become my coping mechanism.

1,"Hey all, I’m really trying to decide if I should quit basketball. This year will be my junior year in highschool. I wouldn’t say I’m a great player I’ve transitioned into one of those 8 points off the bench guys who plays good defense. I’m somewhat undersized but I like to think I have an immense knowledge of the game. I love watching basketball and I like playing it. But just I don’t have fun with the coaches I have. Our varsity coach acts as if he cares about players but doesn’t. And we’re having these “open gyms” right now that are really like more mandatory and he’s like asking other players “what’s (my name)‘s story about why he’s not here.” Because I haven’t been going. I love basketball as a sport just everytime I step on the court for my school my stomach burns with hatred. My coach hasn’t done anything to me exactly personally, but I just know he’s not a good person, and doesn’t have a good heart. I don’t have fun playing for my school, I love playing outside of school like shooting by myself, playing 2k, I even have a like analytical sports page on Instagram. I watch basketball all the time, it’s just I can’t find myself in a situation where I have fun. Especially also because we won’t have fans this year (thanks covid). On the other hand I need to find something as a substitute like a hobby if I do not play this year Bc I struggle with my mental health in the winter months. I’m just very torn and i need some direction. Ik a lot of older guys will say “you’ll regret it if you don’t play” and I might, but what if I don’t play and better myself in the time I spend not in basketball, because of the opportunity/time that will be opened up. I’m between a rock and hard place and I’d like to discuss and have conversations with those who can help me.",27Oct2020,2

i’m 21f and my twin brother is 21m. him and i have drifted a lot lately and i know this definitely won’t help us get closer. so for a short backstory: i’m currently at my parents visiting temporarily for a couple of weeks. i was having a really rough day the other day with a lot of academic pressure because i’m doing terribly in my online classes and i have a lot of work stress for my job. 

my npd dad who yells at all of us a lot, snapped at me for dropping some food on the table. i kept saying he was overreacting to me and i had a bit of attitude when he kept telling me i didn’t do enough clean up and “forgot last night” even though i did it every night for the past two weeks. after getting angry at me, he all of a sudden remembered i only missed one night, so i gave him more attitude. 

my brother started rolling his eyes at me and speaking about my reaction under his breath mouthing “what the fuck” now, for some reason everyone being on my case is usually fine for me but that night i lashed out. I said to him to “stay out of it”, and he said he “found it so weird how much i was escalating the situation” he kept saying “if you don’t find yourself escalating, you’re delusional” and i had enough of it and told him “to get a life” and he got very angry at that and looked at me in the eye and yelled very loud “you’re a fucking bitch” now, this is where I messed up big time. 

I felt myself getting so angry because my dad called me this all my life, so I said within a matter of seconds “well you don’t have a personality”...he’s always been shy and introverted and people did make fun of him for this, i should have known better. i said it in the moment because i wanted him to leave me alone but i went way too far. he ended up crying and i felt so bad for what i said. i never really meant that as well; it was a heat of the moment thing. 

i apologized to him about 15 mins after, after i left the room to blow off steam and was panicking about how far i went. we hugged, and i said “i’m under a lot of pressure right now. i’ve been so stressed, i only slept for four hours last night and i didn’t mean what i said at all i just blew up out of anger from stress” and i told him repetitively i was sorry. he said he forgave me, but i felt so terrible for saying it. 

later that night i sent him a long text explaining again how i didn’t mean my words, and realized the depth of my words after they came out of my mouth. i have been helping with his chores and trying to be kinder. 

he says he forgave me, but i can’t shake the guilt and i still feel so bad. i am not sure what to do. i just feel like a terrible person for it, and if anyone else has messed up and said something that went too far with a sibling, how did you patch it up? i really am desperate to :( i feel so bad for saying that.",27Oct2020,1
4,Hello I have an issue about what to do about playing hs football and my job this week as I have recently started working. My training is at a time that interferes with practice but I need to go to this training for my job as work goes above sports. My coach’s are pretty anal about practice and likely would screw me over this week in the game and they’d 100% hold it against me.

(For easy sake we will name the kid k)

It started in P.E. me and a friend where having to walk in 87f with no shade only sun walking or running. Either way we could never sit down or even stand still so we devise a plan. She lived right beside the school as in less than a literal foot. Covering the school was a thin line of trees and small exits or opening to the neighborhood we saw 1 and ran in. “K” was right beside us as we ran in. The girl that lived there showed me a small spot that we technically still on school grounds and we sat there, it was very nice, shady, calm, and very peaceful. Not even a minute later P.E. teacher come walking in and we here our name being called “OP! GIRL!” so we both ran out. We saw “k” there. Later he told me if he didn’t tell the teacher where we went he would get in trouble. (I don’t believe)

It just feels like a gigantic black cloud is floating over me.",27Oct2020,1
33,"I understand I am still young, but from the way I see things, that's not an excuse for me not be doing anything in life. 

For most of my teenage years, I was stuck at home constantly watching youtube and stressing over my 4.0 GPA. That's the only ""accomplishment"" I have in life, but it isn't one to me. I don't care about school, in fact I have grown to despise it. Most of the information I learn in it I will never need again in life, at least for the impossible life I want.

I am looking at other peers and people on the internet who have been working towards their passions and building skills since they were teens to get them to nice lives in their 20s+, and I've come to realize I have no skills at all. I have no passion at all. Like I've previously said, I have a life that would make my happy, but it really sucks knowing I'll never be able to live it because of how I am. I am scared of failure, and that has held me back from doing many things. 

I want to start changing, but I am not sure at this point. Starting from 2 years ago, I have been SERIOUSLY debating whether or not I should go to college (I really don't want to, but I feel like I have no other choice in life), and if I didn't go, I'd have no talents/skills to help me make income in other ways.

All my friends can't help either, since they know they're going to college. Counselors here aren't helpful either. 

The only thing I have going for me is my dream life. It really just consists of me living in multiple countries (I'm from America, but I want to leave asap) and travelling while being able to stay for years in foreign countries. I also can't find a job that would interest me. I really was interested in becoming an entrepreneur, but then it required skills that I don't have. I then tried to build on those skills, and I ended up frustrating myself due to not being able to start or do anything. I gave up again. 

I love the thought of travelling and learning new languages. I have thought about becoming an English teacher abroad, but I would greatly dislike that job. I always see the redditors/people on the internet making livings from what they love doing, and they get to travel freely. I don't have anything I love that could make me money. 

At this point, I have just began to accept I'll probably work the rest of my life at a job that doesn't make me happy somewhere here in America. I've been telling myself I'll probably die unhappy. I think I am a perfectionist at this point. I have thought about taking my life again recently. If I can't life a life that I want, I might as well die, right? But I can't kill myself due to being a coward. 

I have tried to pick myself up and find something, but I just can't. I don't care if I am under 20, I just want to do SOMETHING to lead me to that life. I don't know how to get there, how I'll make money, etc. I have been crying myself to sleep and stressing about it. Add the pressure of maintaining my grades because it's the only thing I have. I don't want to go to college, yet I feel like it's my only choice. 

I feel pathetic, and I want to start doing and finding something out there. People tell me not to worry about it since I am only 16, but I can't. I appreciate the sentiment behind those who have told me that in life, but it doesn't help me. I need something that'll get me towards that life, because I need to work for something like that.

41,"Hey everyone, moved into an apartment and I am on the first floor. I have a big window that faces out onto a street with a lot of pedestrians. An issue I am having though is often times Ill catch people looking into my living room/where I sit and do work, and only the bottom row of windows opens up.

I really like opening the curtains so I can look outside but they come down from the top so I cant just obscure the bottom ones without covering up the whole thing. I love street gazing which is why I liked the place but its getting kind of annoying and feels a bit like an invasion of privacy. And the issue is really only the bottom parts that almost look up in a way, can't really see anything else from outside or across the street. Any creative ways I can deal with this issue?

43,"Hi folks. Buckle up because this could very well be a wild ride. If somehow said landlord sees this, I am quite sorry that your own actions have caused a tenant to feel uneasy in their own damn home! 

Please keep in mind that I am a single parent, and only twenty. My son is 2. 

I will separate the incidents that have caused me to want to break my lease based on when they occurred. I will also add that my landlord lives above me. 

I will also add that this is a basement apartment with no egress windows in either of the bedrooms. I frequently have nightmares that there is a fire and my son is unable to be rescued out of his room. The landlord actually insinuated that my son only cries when my boyfriend is at my apartment. Which is NOT true. My son could have the wrong colored fork and would cry until he gets the right one. 

1) Landlord told me that my boyfriend only comes over for a booty call. He implicated that he can hear me having sex. He told me not to waste myself, and to find a man that actually loves me.

2) About a week later the landlords (45M) son came over for a weeklong visit with his father. They installed a propane heater in the apartment. Later that night he knocked on my door to ask if I had a CO detector and if it was low to the ground. I did, and I thought informing him of this would end the conversation. Instead this man asked me if I liked memes. I told him I did, because I am naive. He began to show me perverted memes. The one I recall was about a woman farting while having sex. Then this man asked me how old I am, and proceeded to tell me that “age is just a number.” This made me very uncomfortable. 

3) Within a few days I confronted my landlord with my mother. He told me that he was just giving me fatherly advice. I forgave him and asked him not to give me unsolicited advice. He also told me he would speak to his son about his actions. 

4) Landlord began complaining about the door slamming at all hours. Which is NOT true. My son loves closing the door, and when he does that is the rare time it does slam. 

5) Landlord told me that the other tenant told him that I NEVER clean the lint trap on the dryer, which again is not true. Both of us have dogs and sometimes after he does laundry I notice it still stuck to the lint trap, or on the door. I don’t complain. I also apparently do laundry “all day long” which is true, because I do all of the laundry one day a week. This led him to then ask if I am doing laundry for my family, or my boyfriend. I still think this is rude, and that I should be able to do laundry without any accusations. For the last several weeks I have been bringing my laundry to my mothers house. She confirmed that I can infact clean the lint trap. 

5) My mom walked outside to talk to me while I was supervising my dog who was doing his business. The dog went inside, and as I was closing the door he jumped on it and this caused it to slam. I went inside after a minute, and the landlord went onto his porch and went on a rant about how the door just slammed. He did not say hi to her, or even look down to see who was standing there. He did not ask what happened. He just yelled down about the door slamming. 

6) Landlord is posting online about how gay marriage is shameful. “I have always admired the Catholic Church for taking a stand against abortion and gay marriage.” This makes me extremely uncomfortable because my elder brother is gay. 

What do I do? Do I bite the bullet and continue to pay $850.00 a month to not have any privacy? Are these situations actually bothersome? Would anybody else feel uncomfortable?",27Oct2020,1
44,"(I’ll try to keep this short)
So my friend likes to invite random people he thinks are nice on league of legends to my discord server to play and they are usually gamers within our age range just looking for people to play with.

He invited this guy who had an absolute god awful mic who we all thought was chill. He didn’t speak much so we all just kinda played with him and went on. Come to find out after about a week of playing with him he’s a 35yo. Part of me is convinced he might be slightly autistic which I inferred just based off of vocal inflection and tone (I know this isn’t a good thing to presume but it’s something to keep in consideration). I kinda want to ban him just for safety but I don’t want to be an asshole since my friends like him.

He’s a nice guy but I really feel like the age gap is wayyy to wide and I don’t want to piss of my friends by banning him for “no reason”.

TLDR: I don’t know if I should ban a guy from my discord server just for being 35yo when my 14-17yo friends kinda like him.

51,"TL;DR: My boyfriend’s parents put him into a behavior correction center when he’s perfectly mentally stable. His parents are the crazy ones. What do I do to help him?

Both my boyfriend and I are teenagers, I’m just starting to drive. His parents are insane. They yell at him for the smallest things, belittle him, gaslight him, and are overall abuse and horrible. 

We’ve told people about the abuse, but nothing gets done. And I don’t really know what to do. 

Now, his parents have taken him to a mental health clinical/behavior correction center/whatever it is, when he doesn’t need it. My boyfriend is depressed, however he doesn’t hurt himself or others. He has harmful thoughts, sometimes suicidal thoughts whenever his parents get too bad, but he doesn’t act on them very much, if at all (he at least doesn’t tell me). 

Even though this may sound bad, he’s an amazing kid. He knows how to make everyone smile, and he’s super talented. He loves to sing and act. He’s a huge theater nerd. He loves filming and editing videos, and he’s been trying to get his detailing business up and running (his business was doing great and he was making good money before his parents made him shut it down).

He’s just amazing. But his parents call him a narcissist, selfish, a liar, spiteful, and many other hurtful things. He’s not any of this, and I know he’s not two-faced. His parents have yelled at him in front of me for multiple things, one such as asking them if they had any paper clips. 

I know he’s not the issue here, but how do I deal with his parents? They constantly call him a liar, and belittle him for his grades, or for his “feminine” hobbies, or for whatever they feel like. It’s so upsetting to see this happen everyday, and no one do a single thing about it.

If there’s any advice, please give it to me. He currently can’t call me because he’s stuck in a stupid mental health center, whenever he’s not mentally unstable in the slightest. He has school work to attend to, but he’s going to get Fs because his parents didn’t care to tell him what was going on. I just want him to be okay, and for him to stay away from his abusive parents. I want him to love the life he deserves.

I’m sorry if this seems like a vent, it kind of is. But I just need to get him the help he truly needs. Could the people in the center help him? Could I somehow help him? Thank you so much if you read this. Any help is appreciated.",27Oct2020,1

The uni I want to join is great when it comes to academics but doesn't sit right with my parents' conservative views. To make matters worse, all our other relatives keep  encouraging them to get me to join the girls uni. 
I've been having a lot of issues with my parents lately. They're very controlling and have very traditional beliefs. 
I can join the girls university to get my parents off my back but Ill always feel like I could have joined a much better university of my choice. Plus I don't want my uni years to be boring and only confined to books. On the other If I somehow get into the uni I want to join (its tough to secure an admission in it), my parents will probably become 100x stricter and more controlling. Any advice is appreciated.

58,"My SO of 1 1/2 years and I graduated from university this summer and she just started at her new job, some 2 hours and 15 minutes of commuting from the city we live in at the moment. We recently moved into the apartment we live in now and so far have been able to make ends meet just barely thanks to the welfare system in the country we live in. After just a week of working at her new job her mood started to change because of her having to spend 4 1/2 hours of commuting each day. 

Today she suggested that we move to the city she works in. The thing is that I can neither see myself be happy there nor can I afford live there with my current financial situation, unless she acts as the financial provider until I find a job. This leaves me at a loss since I would feel bad to force her to commute so much every day but neither can I deny my own feelings for the prospect of moving there.

The financial aspect is a big factor because not only do I have student loans to pay off but the difference in prices for housing would leave me with approximately 500 USD/month after the bills are paid, in a country where a big mac costs 4USD (The good old Big Mac Index). On top of that I would have to take a loan to be able to afford my share of the deposit for the new apartment. She also has a lot of friends there while I don't know a soul.

So if I say no to the idea of moving I will feel like a bad boyfriend for wanting to stay in the town I live in. On the other hand if I say yes I will be without friends and not being able to visit the ones I have because I would be in much higher debt than I am now. Worst of all I will be feeling like I once again set my needs aside to appease hers.

So /r/advice, I don't expect you to give me a direct answer to my dilemma (since writing the full context would take way too much space) but I hope that you could give me some perspectives or new avenues of thought, so I can better make the decision for myself.",27Oct2020,1

60,"I’m not sure if I’m just being dramatic bc I’m stressed from uni applications so lemme know your guys opinions:

So, throughout all my high school years and some of jr high I’ve been hanging out with relatively the same people. I’ve always kinda knew we weren’t friends bc of anything we had in common and had we been from a big city with lots of people we probably would’ve gravitated towards other groups with more things in common with us. Still, I’ve never felt anything negative towards them until this year and I fear I am abt to snap at them which I am scared for. Even the smallest things are starting to annoy me. In particular one of my friends who I’ve probably spent the most time with I’ve felt the most betrayed by. She knows I’m bisexual, and she is currently dating an adult man and I’ve already told her numerous times that he’s taking advantage of her but she doesn’t care and I’m not mad at her for that it’s not her fault. However, this same man ended up making weird sexual comments about me as well asking if she would ever sleep with me and if we did he’d have to be able to watch. I was obviously extremely grossed out bc one, I’m a minor and 2 it’s just hurtful to have my dating preference be sexualized it made me feel like an object. However she kept defending his behaviour. She’s also defended his behaviour on sexualizing random clothing pieces that aren’t inherently sexual. I also have a problem when I speak I slur my words a lot and speak words in the wrong order and she called me stupid for it. Albeit as a joke, but she knows I’m already insecure about it and she has done the same thing about the way that I smile. She also just randomly will make jokes about my dad who abandoned me. Plus, recently I got one of my other friends to read one of my favourite books and I was super excited about it and wanted a day for the whole group to come over and watch the movie adaptation together, but we ended up having to cancel the original date bc my friend wanted to do something at church. So it was moved to next Friday, but I said I was working that day multiple times but she kept asking to have it on that day and then asked why they couldn’t just hangout without me. Idk, it just hurts my feelings bc I was super excited about that and she didn’t suggest that when our other friend just wanted to go to church. During quarantine she never made any effort to stay in touch either. Am I being dramatic..? And if I’m not, how would I stop hanging out with her..? She’s a part of my main friend group and I don’t wanna stop hanging out with all the people there, and I’m not the type of person to start drama. I’ve known her for a while and I know that if I just stop talking to her she’s going to start telling ppl I hate her bc she just does that for some reason. There’s other things too that have added up over time she just randomly blurts out things I told her not to tell ppl, although they were accidents laughs at me for being too smiley. That’s just how I am, I smile all the time for reason which I guess looks funny but idk. She also always makes me walk to lunch with her outside the school if she wants something no matter the conditions outside, but if my only option is to leave to buy lunch and she doesn’t have money but the conditions outside are fine she won’t come with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day I was telling him a story about a creepy guy and he asked me to stop because it was making him feel stressed. I said sure. But the conversation kind of died for a moment there. So I thought before we move on to a different topic, it would be a good opportunity to tell him also about a topic of conversation that made me upset - the local news related to my trauma. I expected him to also say sure thing but he started getting defensive and saying he would keep me in the loop about local news whether I want it or not for my own safety. I clarified that I was not criticizing what he did this morning, in fact I said I appreciate his concern, but rather I was asking him to avoid the topic in the future. He wasn't buying that I was just communicating this with him and treated it like I was taking a jab back at him for him shutting me up about the creepy guy story. At this point I was holding back tears and apologized for making the conversation stressful even though he asked to have a chill conversation. But I never anticipated his reaction and how it would escalate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since then he hasn't talked to me at all, it's been 3 months. I sent him a funny video one month into no speaking, he ignored it. I messaged him yesterday asking if he wanted to talk, but he hasn't responded yet. Should I apologize, even if I feel like what i did wasn't wrong?

I’m 22 now and everytime I go back to Philippines, he acts so normal around me (I don’t think he even remembers) I avoid him but what made me type this is that him and his wife are about to have a baby girl soon. I don’t really know what to do since i don’t want to cause a big family commotion &amp; most likely be isolated since people back home can sometimes be backwards and I’ll probably be blamed. I know it could seem obvious to say I should say something but I still feel very stuck as it could really cost me my relationship with my direct family but it’s weighing heavy on my chest.",27Oct2020,1
71,"Hi.

Like everyone, in the past I had relationships that kinda broke my ability/capacity to trust in words and behavior from others. Mostly the last one, where I was tricked a lot.

I feel like a ""self-defense"" mechanism that doesn't let me worry for others, even when I like the person. I feel cringe when being romantic and most of the times I feel pointless when I'm being expressive (In a romantic way, making clarifications, etc).
Also nowadays I found kinda easy to recognize the behaviors from others, like, when a girl keeps me kinda close a lot of times I recognize that behavior is because the other person likes attention and how it works to boost their self-esteem.

Mostly I would say that I developed a self-defense mechanism and like everyone in this life, I'm more aware due to past experiences, but anyways. I want to know if this behavior from my part has a name to read about it.

Thanks.",27Oct2020,1

76,"TLDR: my parents are separating and I don't know what to do: pick a side or move out. But if I move out, I have to grow up and deal with the real world and I'm terrified of that. I need advice. 

My parents' marriage has been rocky for at least 12 out of the 23 years that they've been married. My mom owns a small business that my dad ""works"" at (my mom pays him but other than that he doesn't make other money). My mom has been fed up for a long time but now she feels ready to leave him. She is actively apartment seeking to move out. 

I'm struggling with the fact that I either have to pick a side, or move out on my own. I love my parents both but I know firsthand that my dad doesn't do shit for the family and once my mom leaves, he's not gunna have a source of income unless he finds a real job. I obviously would like to stay with my mom but I don't want my dad to feel like I'm abandoning him too. 

Ideally, I would move out on my own but I'm a recent college grad with only a part time job, working 20 hrs a week. If I moved out all my income would go to rent. I've tried looking for roommates everywhere, on facebook, craigslist, you name it, but I'm paranoid of scammers and weirdos. 

I'm also terrified of being faced with the real world on my own. If I had to move out, I know that I would struggle a lot but I don't know if I can live with my mom and not feel guilty of leaving my dad.

78,"Essentially as stated. I have a couple tattoos and have always wanted more. I was very clear about this and expressed wanting *at least* a half sleeve on multiple occasions while we were dating.

I started saving for another once we were married. I was excited and asked if I could get it once I saved a certain % of each pay check until I had enough cash. He has never voiced hesitation, until now. He told me he doesn’t want me to get more tattoos, stating he doesn’t want me to “cover my skin”. 


It’s bothered me a lot the past few days. On one hand, I want to respect and honor his feelings and certainly regard them as more important than a tattoo. However, I think I’m more frustrated that he lead me to believe he supported my decisions in regards to what I was putting on my body, then changed his position once we were married. It’s made me feel trapped or controlled in a way, I guess.

87,"Hi, I am 19F, 20 in January. My depression has been the worst it has ever been this past year, and I am realizing a lot of it stems from the way I was treated by my BPD father during my childhood, and the learned helplessness that I acquired. My dad always used fear as a means of control (ie. Making threats, getting rageful (he's a big man so it's scary), breaking things, screaming, etc.). For this reason, I have always had to walk on eggshells around my dad, and I have always felt that I didn't have control over my life, because I know my father won't agree with the lifestyle that makes me happy.

I am about to move out next month, mostly for the freedom and independence from my family. I am in a taboo LDR relationship and frankly don't want my parents knowing all of the details. It will spare both of us. I also do sex work. All things that will severely trigger my father, but they make me happy. I am hoping to visit my BF this January. I don't want my parents meeting him due to our age difference, and the fact that we are poly. I know traditionally the boyfriend should meet the girlfriends parents, but we have a very untraditional dynamic and I don't think that would be helpful in my case. My dad insists on talking to his mom and eventually meeting him, two things which are definitely not going to happen. I need to figure out a way to get around these issues, and not have my parents involved in my personal life/relationships. Particularly my father, who I am still scared of. I try to limit contact as much as possible with him. 

So, how do I start to set boundaries with my parents with regard to my relationship, while also taking my dad's BPD/rage/abusive behaviour into consideration? I know they want what they think is best for me, but there is so much that they don't know, they can't even begin to say what is and isn't good for me. I am beginning to realize that I DO have control over my life, but I fear the consequences with my family",27Oct2020,1

105,"We recently moved into the upstairs apartment of 4-unit building. The building is definitely on the older side. One of the reasons we chose this apartment was because of how quiet the neighborhood and apartment was.

Shortly after we moved in, our landlord told us that they were going to convert the basement below us into a unit. The new tenant has been living there for about a month now, and we’re losing our minds.

He likes to produce music as a hobby. He’s converted half of the apartment into a ‘recording studio’, complete with instruments ranging from keyboards to guitars to a cajon drum.

Because the building is old, we can hear everything going on beneath us. When he plays music, we can hear it clearly and it vibrates our walls.

Here’s where things get tricky - he’s not playing music *that* loud. I’ve been down there while he plays at a reasonable volume, and my roommate said the walls still vibrate. The only way our walls wouldn’t vibrate is if he didn’t play music out loud.

He’s a nice guy and we have a good relationship. We’ve already had multiple conversations with him about the noise, and agreed that he would use headphones after 8pm so we could sleep. He also installed a lot of soundproofing panels to help reduce the noise (to no avail).

But now that we’ve set a noise curfew, he’s been playing music nonstop during the day. We all work from home right now, and there has not been a single moment during the daytime where we can be in silence. It’s starting to drive us crazy.

So good people of Reddit, we turn to you. On one hand we’d feel guilty escalating to the landlord, because it’s not entirely his fault (it’s the building). The lease does have a noise-complaint clause, which could result in him getting kicked out.

On the other hand, we’re going to be working from home for at least the next 6 months, and are only 1 month into a 12 month lease.

I have a dilemma and would love some feedback...

I've had a friend for the last three years. We've become so close that her family calls me their favorite daughter and used to be roommates. Now, she lives with her parents and I stay on campus, but we put effort into seeing each other. Her dad is a mechanic, and offered to help me with my car, as long as I pay for any parts. I needed new wheels and rotors, but he kept fixing things without talking to me about what is going on. Now, he wants me to pay him $800 for new tires, breaks, break pads.... the whole nine yards. As well, lately she has been talking down to me, and I have stood up for myself every time. She says that they're always helping me out and I'm ""unappreciative"". I have thanked them multiple times about how grateful I am for her and her family, and offered to even get them a gift card as a thank you for the work. Today, she belittled me about my financial situation because my family is suffering financially and I pay for everything myself. She told me I need to cut back on my spending and I only spend $20 on groceries and $160 a month on student loans. I told her it was insensitive of her to say that to me, and she gave me a hard time that I owe her dad $800 that he is suddenly angry about me owing him.

I'm still mildly terrified of the prospect of being with someone new and also the rejection that comes with ""dating"" since I never have done it before.... 

How do I address my mental health issues with a new partner? Do I even bring it up since I dont have symptoms? 

How do people generally percive massive weight loss? I will have lost 110lbs and while I don't have loose skin now I might later... 

Are there any better places to meet someone in person? I'm not overly fond of online dating... 

Any general advice would help!",27Oct2020,1
116,"Hello fellow Redditors,

I have been living in Portsmouth, NH for two years now, it is rather pleasant aside some minor issues; one of which being the local events and my social responsibility to go. Hence my incoming rant.

I am a public representative among friends and foe, including but not exclusive to, the International Esperanto community and local chess championships. There is a group I'm in (which I'm quite highly regarded) which attends regular events in the local area. I am a public official, I must go, but I don't enjoy a moment.

I hate the people, I hate the event and spending time with the drags of society causes my mind to boggle. The people I talk to are mindless and stupid, most disagreeing with my points about political matters (which I take firmly to heart). I find most attendees are obnoxious and will discreetly promote hate crime implied by their choice of words (A word of advice, some 'people' are not what they seem). Due to my hierarchical position in the communities I've mentioned before (which I can not sadly share the details), I am required to attend these events and not doing so could hurt my social status.

Overall, you can see my point. It's a waste of time and not going this year due to the virus has opened my eyes to a greater extent, I've realised how much I've hated them. What a waste of my time. Now someone tell me, what the hell I should do?",27Oct2020,1

118,"I have been married for a long time, we are in our 40s, and have 2 youngish kids.
There are a lot of aspects to my current situation, mental health issues, health, physical/emotional relationship problems, and others. I will do my best to answer any questions asked, if i can do so without revealing too much information.
I have been trying to make things work with my SO for several years, but I no longer have the energy. I have found myself coming up with excuses to not spend time with them anymore, playing video games to avoid them, ""necessary"" weekend work, pretending to be asleep when they come to bed, etc. The only polite discussions we can have is about the kids needs.
Our physical relationship has never been what i have wanted, but lately, I don't even want that. It actually gives me anxiety when they mention ""snuggle"" time. Infidelity is extremely unlikely. 
I have asked about counseling, and the answer was silence while staring at thier lap. I feel they believe that counseling won't help, but they believe there is a problem as well, but won't admit it. I feel it is too late to repair the damage done. They are seeing a counselor individually, but do not really discuss our relationship to my knowledge. When prodded they denied discussing it.
I would likely come to an easy answer if it was not for the kids. Neither one of us is equipped to raise them separately, but together we make a good team. 
I feel trapped in a situation that I cannot continue,  nor will it end in the near future.
I feel like i should be doing more, but I tried for so long and none of it did any good. I am running out of ideas and I am hoping there is someone who can help. An idea, a new perspective, anything. I feel as if counseling is the only option, but that was shot down once already.",27Oct2020,1

121,"This is my first post here. I normally browse and read and what not. However, this weekend I went out of town and my family and I were driving through the mountains with my wife and 2 kids. This poor dog came running out into the middle of the road and we hit her. (Keep in mind I am a huge animal lover. I have 4 dogs of my own and that I consider my kids. ) I was a wreck. I cried and cried. While driving and trying to make that decision on what to do to keep everyone save and not hurt the dog was the hardest thing to do.  Either Slam on the brakes and hope that helps or steer off the side into this deep embankment or swerve into the oncoming lane with cars. After we hit her we stopped the car I got running out and grabbed this poor baby and walked her over to the side of the highway. It didn’t look like bones were broke but I am no doctor. I called the owner and held the dog as flat as I could to not hurt her anymore. The owner lived 200 feet away. He came running and was crying and took her and sped off to the vet. He was not mad as he knew the road we were on is not for animals to be on. He called me an hour or so later telling me Charpia passed on her way to the vet. I cried some more. He told me it was her time. She was old and never leaves the property or his side. She was actually missing for a few minutes he explained. He thinks she was looking for a way... He thanked me for calling him and tending to her on the busy highway. I have had nightmares since. I see the little dog running down the highway over and over in my head. I see her eyes while laying on the pavement hurt after I hit her. This is why I am here. I love animals and would never do anything to hurt them.... this has killed me since.

123,"*** I've been off of my bipolar medication for two years and my psychiatrist thinks that I am still taking them

I am currently 26 (M). This is more of a confessional because there is too much to share to stick to one thing.  This will likely be very overwhelming for most people to read. I have made some TREMENDOUS mistakes recently that will haunt me for the rest of my life and I can't afford therapy so I want to share my story here to see what rational people have to say. If you can help me in any way I will be blessed to have the help. 

First off, I now have an established history of mental health problems and drug abuse. I take full responsibility for my actions but I still desperately wish I could go back in time and redo my life with better decisions even though that is not possible. 

(14-18) I spent my high-school years drinking a lot and smoking weed and never took my grades or classes very seriously and almost did not graduate. I always tested high on standardized tests and was regarded as very intelligent at that time but never cared enough about school to actually focus and learn anything beyond what would pass me in the class. I almost did not graduate due to lack of attendance and poor grades. I also worked fast food jobs during these years to pay for my weed addiction. I was prone to cutting myself frequently then and was in complete denial of having any mental health problems and when my parents would arrange for me to see a counselor I would refuse to admit there was anything wrong with me and never continue through with treatment. 

(19-21) After high school I took a job as a dishwasher. I worked my way up to be a line Cook after a year and had hopes of one day being a sous chef or supervisor. One day I had been having back and forth arguments with a newer employee who ended up threatening me with a knife because I wouldn't listen to his instructions on how to cook certain things. He said that if I did not stfu and do what he said he would see me outside after work and flashed me his kitchen knife which he had put in his pocket. Some of my coworkers saw what happened but denied knowing anything when I brought this to the attention of management. Management asked me if I was okay to finish the shift with the person threatening my life and I said that I didn't  think he would do anything in the restaurant so I could probably finish the shift and they said that I must not really be that scared then and refused to discipline the employee. I walked off the job right then and never came back. 

(21) After this was over I became very depressed and did not do much besides play video games for a year and sleep all of the time. At one point I had a severe manic episode where I parked and lost my car in the city in a very bad neighborhood and walked around for hours in the cold. My phone died and I wound up at a Walgreens that called the police and took me to a mental hospital in this bad neighborhood for three weeks. 

At this point I started treatment for anxiety and bipolar disorder. 

I burned through all of my savings not working during the year I spent at home and needed money so at this point so out of desperation I took up a position as a warehouse worker for a large company. 

(22-25) I quickly got promoted to be a supervisor here. I did this work for 3 years and was making about 30K a year. 

The workload became pretty overwhelming during COVID and I had a confrontation with an employee for simply asking him to do his job who ended up pushing me. I told my boss about it and wanted to file a security report and he said he would take care of it but no report was ever filed. I did not come in the next day to work and later that week the manager had me in to meet with him. He asked if I could work another area which I did for one day and then had me file the report with security and at the end of the night I clocked out and did not end up returning to work. 

(26) While I was jobless I frantically applied for jobs online and was willing to take almost any job but I lied on my resume and said that I had an associates degree when in fact I need to finish 4 more classes to receive my degree. I was offered and accepted a position doing customer service for a local business. They have been extremely nice and supportive but my lack of dictation skill and focus caught up to me and I am currently struggling and feel like the worst performer here and have missed a few days of work due to stress and anxiety clouding my ability to think. 

I have been to a primary care doctor only once in the last 8 years which was a few months ago but I did not follow up on with the blood work they asked of me to screen for diseases. 

I have not been to the dentist in two years and at this point have pretty bad breath and looks to be several cavities. 

This is a really bad one. 

I adopted a dog two years ago without any logical concept of how much money it would actually cost to be responsible for their wellbeing and life. My dog has always been cared for with food, water, and exercise and he is in good health. But when we went to the vet after the adoption he would try to bite the vet when they went to administer anything and they were unable to perform blood work. I went back in again with sedatives but he tried to bite them again. He is a large pitbulI. I failed to continue to follow up or seek the proper training. He is not current on vaccines or rabies. He is one year past due for rabies and vaccines and has not been treated for heartworm. 

Another really bad one. 

I recently bought a car at a dealership without discussing the terms. I believe I was manic from receiving the new customer service job and I withdrew all of my 401k money to pay the down payment on the car and am now upside down almost 15k on it because they ripped me off really bad. I did not negotiate and essentially blindly signed for a 35k loan. 

Right now I have been in bed for almost a week doing nothing but watching YouTube videos passively. I've been barely able to feed myself and take my dog out but it cripples me with fear thinking about him biting someone. I am already tremendously in debt due to the car purchase and can really no longer afford him but I am just not sure what to do anymore. 

I know laying in bed is really bad for your health too and I am already a really high risk for heart problems 

I feel like I've made some of the worst decisions of anyone ever. Thank you for reading my story.",27Oct2020,1

125,"Me (27F) is currently in a relationship for almost 2 years with BF (M30). For some side context, I don't live in the US or EU, where I'm from the culture is very different. Most individuals tend to live with their parents till they are married. That being said, we both live at home currently (this is important information).

For the last year my boyfriend, lets call him Bob, has been adamantly saying he wants to get married to me so we began having conversations about getting married and plans for the future.  He lives with his mother currently, as his parents are divorced (27 years). Bob is also set to inherit a property from his father whenever he wants it. Also side note, Bob has an older sister who is married and lives elsewhere.

First conversation. I told him I definitely don't want to live with in-laws because I have a really toxic family past regarding this. My family lived with my grandparents when I was younger because they couldn't afford anywhere and it was very bad. They treated my mother terribly and didn't really care for my sister and I. Even after we left, they didn't treat us very well. Bob knows this. He said his mother has to come live with him because its his mother. My suggestion was at least 1 year on our own so we can actually be a newly married couple without any influence and interference. No budge. She HAS to live with us right away once we get married and move into this new house. 

Second conversation. He suggested breaking down the the current house he'll be inheriting and rebuilding a new house. So again my suggestion: We can build a self contained area for your mother then. A studio apartment with everything she'll need so she won't be in our space all the time. That was shot down again. No budge. In fact he yelled and berated me for suggesting it. Money isn't that big of an issue either as he's from a well off family and has a well paying job. I will also contribute my share.

Now here I am posting this because I am at a loss. I know I will be unhappy living with in laws. Even though his mother is very nice to me and treats me well she's very manipulative. Whenever she is mad at Bob she comes to complain to me and asks me to talk to him. If she wants something she will tell me to tell him. She tells me his personal business that even he has never told me. And she gossips a lot. She yells and screams and insults her grandchildren, even though she thinks it isn't very serious. That's not something I will want for my own children. At this point, the lack of compromise is bothering me and I'm scared of what might happen in the future. I don't know how to approach the situation to reach a compromise. And I honestly don't think I'm being unfair in my suggestions.",27Oct2020,1
127,"TLDR; my dad is borderline abusive and I need help finding the next step to help it end...

I’m 19 and still living with my parents, which isn’t abnormal, but I don’t think I can do it anymore... my dad may not be as bad of a dad as some other people’s, but he’s not always a nice man and he never really has been. There are times where he is, but he can be super cruel. Lately it just seems like it’s been getting worse though. I work in customer service, and Saturday was one of the worst days I’ve ever experienced. I was so physically and mentally drained it poured over into Sunday (yesterday) and I had taken a nap to try to help, and as soon as I woke up and sat up, he instantly yelled at me to help him find his keys for the van so he could go to church. I hadn’t been awake since he had gotten home so I didn’t know where he had gone which made me useless, but I suggested he look in the van to which he replied by screaming at me saying they weren’t there cause he definitely locked it. We continued looking around the house to no avail and eventually he went outside to look and lo and behold, they were still in the ignition and the van was still running. He came back inside and rather than apologizing for being rude, he was still snippy. I tried to make light of the situation and remind him that I’ve done the same thing before and that it happens but he screamed at me again for it saying, “well we owned that car, and this is my work van so it’s not the same”. I just gave up and went downstairs to my room cause I couldn’t do it anymore. My mom apologized for him yelling at me, but he never did. Anyways, fast forward a couple of hours and we gave my dogs a couple of treats. A little backstory here, my dogs can’t be close when we do, or they’ll fight over it. Well, they were in separate rooms and a fight still ended up happening, so I tried suggesting that maybe we look into behavioral training for them to try to at least get it to calm down and he screamed at me saying, “she’s 3. It won’t work! She’s just an aggressive dog and nothing will change that!” And then told me not to suggest something like that again. I had absolutely given up so I went to my room again. I decided to try one last thing to make it a little better... dying my hair. Well, I covered every little surface to make sure it wouldn’t go anywhere, but somehow I still got a little spot, and then when I went to go wash it out, it got all over the shower and some on the wall too. I had no idea how, and I just began to absolutely panic. I couldn’t deal with getting yelled at again so I texted my mom the pictures and asked her what to do and she told me to use bleach and it would be fine. I sobbed while I cleaned it because it wasn’t looking as good as it needed to, and I knew he would yell about it if he saw it.

Fast forward to this morning, and I hadn’t fallen asleep. I just couldn’t. Well, I decided to come upstairs to see my dogs, and he was already in a bad mood at 6 am, and already yelling at my brother to get out of bed for work (he was already up btw). So I decided to go see my mom and talk to her, and we were talking about how he was angry and how we were tired of it, and then she told me the most heartbreaking thing. She told me she wasn’t gonna continue going back to school for her LPN to further her career because my dad (knowingly or unknowingly, I don’t know) continuously makes her feel bad for being in classes. She feels terrible for trying to better herself and when she told me this, I just broke. I tried to convince her not to quit and just keep going but she’s already given up and I don’t know how else to help her. What do I do to stop him and help her? How do I get out of here without leaving everyone else behind? Is it bad that I’m genuinely starting to hate my own dad..? Help me please...",27Oct2020,1
128,"I only really go out to walk the dogs of an immunicompromised woman. Frankly, chances are slim I could get cross-contamination from her (if anything, I'm more of a risk to her, considering I live in a denser household) but regardless I try to be careful.

I always wear a coat with long sleeves, so if I needed to adjust something or scratch an itch, I could try to do it through the fabric.

However, wearing glasses has been increasingly the hardest part, as the days have gotten colder and more humid. My breath steams them up quick, and my glasses don't even stay warm afterwards because they keep slipping down my nose.

129," 

I'll make my story short. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression that has prevented me from moving into a 'real' job, hurt my studies and motivation. It led me down a path of alcohol addiction and doing a lot of things I am not proud of. My family are supporting me on my path to recovery and I am planning to return to study. I was recently accepted in an Honours program for a psychology degree. Now that I'm getting treated I want to put my life back together and meet some great people. Guys and girls.

I've also never slept with anyone because of this anxiety and fear of judgement.

Hobbies include: Films and TV, heavy metal music, history, working out at the gym, psychology, US politics, art, trying different foods, occasional video games, atheism, writing, bushwalks, most things horror-related.

131,"I'm freaking out a bit and am hoping someone here can answer, I've also posted this on legaladvice but have yet to get an answer. 

The person was granted an EX Parte CLETS-TRO but the case was dismissed and Dissolved at the hearing this year. 

I had consulted a lawyer in California via a phone call after finding him on AVVO cause it was filed there and I'm no longer in California and he had told me this will cause me issues in the future because its in the following data bases and that these databases are available for any country:

*CLETS - He said even a TRO will be in the database  since the person who filed it filled out a CLETS form

*NCIC - He said even ex parte TRO's are placed here and never deleted. I'm being by others it's not. 

*Domestic Violence /CCAP - He said it will permanently be there 

*Worldwide and US Criminal Database - he said Because a restraining even temporary order could be violeted that's why its placed in the database even if no violation had yet occurred. 

I did not hire this lawyer because I don't know why I would be in the worldwide and US criminal database cause I never violated the CLETS-TRO (I did not even know it existed til recent) and a permanent restraining order was not granted, also I was never booked, arrested or fingerprinted for anything. 

He also said the following will happen :

*I will be deemed inadmissible ANYWHERE in the world even if that country doesn't require a visa 

*I will not be hired for jobs anywhere in the world cause it will come out in background checks all over the world 

*Any visa applications both for travel or work for any other country will be rejected  

After the filing (which I was unaware of) The only communication I had with the person who filed it was me texting them a few times telling them they could keep the stuff I had left and I hope that they reflect on what they had done which was cheating, nothing was threatening at all.
 
A cousin of theirs and texted me and blamed me for what happened and I just told them to leave me alone. 

*THIS LAWYER TOLD ME THIS WAS A VIOLATION AND I PROBABLY HAVE A CRIMINAL VIOLATION and warrant now (I checked the court website for criminal cases and my name did not come up) - This is weird because the case was dismissed recently so idk why I would have a criminal case for a simple non threatening text.

I feel so lonely- I have great anxiety with work, and just the world around me. I have had issues with masturbation getting the best of me, so I worked hard to stop for a while, but now have cracked. The porn, subscribing to girls on Snapchat, all this horrible stuff I know I should not do, but I crack in my weekends.

Work has been jerking me around. I’m two year in, and being thrown around to different groups at my company, no stability, and no one gives me answers to when I can settle down and work remote and move back home like I was promised.

I so so so badly want a sweet caring girlfriend. I dated a girl from an App here for a handful of months, she was gorgeous but really really mistreated me, and now half a year later it still burns, yet I feel this feeling of missing her, since she was the closest person I have had here. 

That said I feel like I’m going insane, making all the wrong choices, and unable to be happy and see the bright side of things. My dog I just got gas brought me the most joy and kept me somewhat busy. 

So, that all said... I need advice. How can I turn my life around? How can I steer away from bad choice, reduce anxiety, and just FEEL better and motivated?

136,"I'll give a little backstory to help the situation. 
I moved in to my mom's trailer a couple years ago because of my declining health and ever since we have been pretty severely targeted by our community, I had a serious illness take over after being kicked out of the place I shared with an ex. I had to find a place to stay immediately and my mom took me in, soon after, because I hadn't been approved to stay yet(we get 2 weeks to be a guest before you must be approved to stay but I had applied) I had to leave or my mom would face eviction so I left and lived very ill and staying in a friends freezing garage until I could be approved. Since being here we have recieved eviction notices for things that everyone else in the park gets away with (my family visiting, family unloading dogs once from the car to the house without a lead, having cats that go potty outside, having too many vehicles mom and I have a car and truck each and mom's boyfriend has one of his own, having delivered boxes on the porch all day while woking, having our seasonal decor up for ""too long"". Honestly the list goes on and on.) This time our eviction notice was because of one little thing, my cat went poop on our neighbors lawn. I'm happy to clean up after the cat and didn't know he even did it. Our neighbor never told us he had this happen. Im upset because our neighbors in the community let out their dogs without someone even with them letting them wander and poop throughout the neighborhood, this isn't allowed but they know the manager personally so nobody complains. Also there are many cats who roam the park and I've never heard of anyone complaining about anyone else's animals. I feel as though I'm being targeted in my community for being who I am, im a goth girl that doesn't hide my curvy body and I advertise on my vehicle and my personal effects that I am part of the LGBTQ+ community. This is a small, sheltered, mostly religious community and I see the looks I get from the neighbors who don't take the time to interact and realize im actually really sweet.

But I really want to pursue gaming ang improve, I absolutely love it. I know how to appreciate other things. It's not like I'm 1000% addicted and never do anything else. I still hang out with friends, do school, chores, babysit, and work occasional small jobs on the side to earn money. Mainly my mom is the issue, (my dad supported it and would even game with me but he's not really a part of my life anymore, at least I don't want him to be). She has never gamed before, so she doesn't understand what it's like. And she struggles to watch me game because she gets motion sick immediately. Things that seem supernatural or even edited photos creep her out. I'll show her a meme and she gives it a weird look and asks what it is with a hint of disgust in her tone. I find it hard to relate with her and talk about things. Any time I bring up a struggle relating to a phone, TV, or some technological device, she will always bring up her past and how those things didn't exist and she's doing fine, so I'll be fine too. But these things *do* exist right **now.** And I'm having an issue with it. So why can't she try to help me instead of brushing it off saying I'm fine. I can tell she tries to support me with gaming and things related, because I've expressed that I don't feel understood by her, but I can see that she just really doesn't understand and wishes I would do something else with my time. I'll ask her for  gaming headset or a new mouse, or a video game itself, and she'll suggest something not gaming related and change the subject. If I show the slightest hint of interest in something other than gaming, she opens the flood gates of opportunity to steer me away from gaming. I tried drawing an outfit design in boredom? Bam, I'm suddenly signed up for a fashion designing class as my elective. Press a few keys? Oh, now I'm taking piano classes. Build some Legos with my younger cousins? I almost got signed up for a robotics class. I drew the line there and instead asked if I could take a coding class and art class this year. Sounded reasonable to her, but I didn't tell her they were the first few steps to help me design my own game in the future. (Which I haven't started on yet obviously). And on top of all that, she absolutely despises the idea of me talking to strangers online. I just do not know what to do. I'm 15, I would like to get started with streaming ASAP and start a YouTube channel, but I can't afford the equipment, my family won't support me, and my room is right next to my moms, so its not like I can do it in secret. Any advice?",27Oct2020,1
138,"So I’m not sure if this is the right sub Reddit for my specific situation but here goes nothing. When I was in high school I fucked around all the time and I barely graduated with like a 2.3 GPA. I really don’t remember any of the content such as math science geometry etc. Ever since I graduated I’ve been working in a warehouse with good health benefits and I make 20 an hour so I never really left my comfort zone with that. However I suffered a major shoulder injury requiring surgery rendering me out of work. It made me realize that I can’t just work menial labor jobs that pay just enough for rent and weed my whole life. 

I’ve always wanted to go to college and get a higher education however Covid has put a wrench in that and even before the pandemic does the thought of being in debt to student loans for the rest of my life petrifies  me since I will be paying my way through by myself with no help from my parents at all. My biggest worry is ending up in the greed that I hate and end up bailing in the middle of it or the demand in whatever field will be bad when I graduate.

If I were to shoot for the stars and go for my dream job, I would be a commercial pilot. I know it’s a long and expensive road to get there (flight hours etc) But honestly, I have no clue on where to begin on that path. Like what college classes would I even start off with ? do I need to take like some general education course before I take aviation classes? And this is kind of a stretch, but I was born in the Philippines with the Filipino birth certificate. Is it possible that I could get dual citizenship, take all the required college courses, get all the flight hours required for my licenses, and fly with a Philippines based airline? That’s kind of a stretch, but dream big right? What one man can do, another man can do.

If the above seems unreasonably difficult to achieve, I could see myself going to trade school and learning a trade such as welding. People always talk about how great of a career it is, but welders I know tell me the nitty-gritty of the career. I feel like that would be a decent fit for me. Ever Since I was 16, I’ve been working manual labor jobs ranging from pushing carts at Walmart in the summer heat, freezing cold, or the humid rain storms we get here to working in a -10° freezer had a major grocery distribution center stacking boxes on pallets etc.

I don’t know who else to ask besides reddit. All my friends are either in the military or a different part of the world now and my parents ghosted me at 18. And don’t suggest military to me because I am banned from all branches due to a domestic assault charge and yes I checked with the recruiters. Obviously money is important to pay rent, but I don’t wanna live like this for my entire life, working a job that I hate, barely pays enough etc. I want to have a career that I can be proud of and also make enough money for me to live better than I do now.",27Oct2020,1

142,Everyone leaves early at work. I am scheduled 2-10 pm there is no boss there at that time. More than one coworker has encouraged me to leave early. It’s lot that they want me fired because my other coworkers leave a half hour early. They claim the boss encourages this to save on money for the company. I’m all for supporting a small business. But honestly I can’t afford to leave just because my job is completed. I am scheduled for full time and I want to be paid for full time. Especially when I’m already not getting the hours I need to live comfortably. I live paycheck to paycheck as it is. I don’t want to clock out and then lose that money. Is this wrong of me and will it cause my coworkers to dislike me or plot against me? I don’t want to see the place go under but I care more about my family and myself than this business. If they couldn’t afford to pay me they shouldn’t of hired me. I’m a workaholic and I’ve stated that in the interview. I’ve worked for companies who have given me 100 hours a week before and I’ve taken it like a champ. Should I feel bad for not clocking out early? Is staying the full time socially acceptable?

143,"  

I’m struggling to find words to even describe how I’m feeling. I am overwhelmed, it just feels like life keeps testing me. One event after another. I’m living in a domino effect, with what seems like no way out. What stressors do I begin with? The pandemic? Which has cost me all local friendships and brought my depression to a level it has not reached in a very long time.  Being trapped indoors, and being fearful of the outdoors. I finished my masters in this time, and to this moment have yet to celebrate or be celebrated. I flunked in my studies for the MCAT exam, which was another blow to my already wounded spirit. 

Then there’s the never-ending family drama. My narcissistic sister emotionally abusing my mother, crying wolf with the cops, and causing disorder and mayhem to fulfill her wounded ego. Now I am somehow involved in a family court trial despite not having lived at home for over four years. On top of this, my father’s health is deteriorating faster than his doctors can keep up with. Mind you this man has had two heart attacks, a stroke, and is now classified as disabled due to multiple prevailing health issues. 

Do not get me started on my failed job hunt, which has me doubting my capabilities and is causing insomnia and heightened anxiety. My finances are in ruins, my savings are running low and I’m starting to panic. 

But if that wasn’t enough, my friend/former roommate/land lady has decided to sporadically sell the house where I’ve been living for the past year and a half. So, with no job, sparce savings, and less than two weeks to move out, I am now forced to stay with my boyfriend and his cousin until I can get my shit together. 

You thought the story was headed towards a positive direction now since I found a temporary solution? So did I except this woman keeps popping up on his phone. A little back story, when we first met, we got into an argument because of his firm beliefs that men and women cannot be friends. Later on he gets really upset and jealous that I had hugged and cuddled my best friend with her boyfriend. He starts creating hypothetical scenarios where I should be okay with his actions because if I am “really open minded” then I shouldn’t be bothered. This hypothetical scenario involves his female friend (yes that’s correct he who does not believe in opposite sex friendships has two, that he met on a dating app, and he has slept with this particular girl  “only once”). Anyways in this scenario, I should be okay with them cuddling on the couch while hanging out (and I watch) because I cuddled my male friend in front of him. Mind you this male friend is my best friend’s boy friend and I was cuddling them both (at the same time) as they drove down from NY to Texas to visit me for my birthday which I was originally supposed to spend alone. A few months later it’s his birthday and this “friend” happens to try to facetime him at exactly midnight. We get into an argument over it, get passed it, then a few days later she is trying to facetime him again. This time I am upset!! He assures me she is just a friend and knows he is in a relationship yaddie yadda. I say if I look through your messages, I will not find any evidence of flirtation? Guess what? He had deleted all his messages from her supposedly stating that he cleared messages from his phone from multiple people including her because he did not intend to talk to her after I got mad during his b-day. 

So friends, am I in the wrong for assuming he is lying to me? Should I pack my bags and move back to NY to my parents (I absolutely hate the city life and I’d be back to the family drama I left behind) instead of sticking it out here with him while I try to get back on my feet?

148,"I bought focaccia rounds from a store. When I got home I realized there was mould all over the bread, which was odd because it had been in the freezer.  I threw up the piece of bread I had eaten and my boyfriend proceeded to call the store and advise them to check the other frozen products to ensure they weren’t mouldy. 

I ended up going back to the store and she said “sorry about that let me know if this batch is ok, if not I’ll order you another”. I got home and discovered that the replacement bread was mouldy too. I had already eaten half a piece and was livid. It’s an hour trip to get to the store so it’s not exactly convenient to exchange the bread for a second time. 

I emailed the office because I realize cashiers don’t really have the latitude in situations like this. I mentioned that I told the store to check the freezer the first time so no other customers would have the same experience. They emailed back and said I can come pick up more bread or get a refund for the bread I bought. 

Is it unreasonable to not be satisfied with this response? I’m not sure what I want from this situation. Perhaps a $50 gift card or more sympathy for this frustrating experience.

156,"So, I'm a pretty akward person around people I don't know. With friends, I'm talkative etc. When I'm around people I don't know or who I don't share common interests with I become really quiet. I've always been someone with few but really close friends I guess.

About a week ago, I started my first full-time job as tech support. I work with people much older than me and who all seem to be friends and have known each other for at least a few years.

Anyways, I feel really out of place. I'm quickly getting the reputation of being really quiet and that's bad for the team I'm sure is what people are thinking. Even though I know I'm doing the job well, I'm afraid this issue is affecting how my bosses see my performance. For example, in today's meeting the boss said, ""well here's your time to talk, (my name)"" kind of singling me out a bit. I wasn't offended really it's just confirming that they have this feeling about me. 

The weird thing is that when in a professional conversation I do fine. When customers call about a tech issue, I can professionally 'script' my way through it. But when it comes to speaking like a friend to someone especially a boss, I find it exceedingly difficult. I always have a fear when talking like a friend to a boss as I feel that I could easily offend them and make things worse if you know what I mean. However, talking like this, lightly cussing, etc. is commonplace with this group amongst themselves. 

I just don't know how to be both professional in front of my boss and 'friend-talk' with them, especially since they are so much older and we have very little in common. I am obviously friendly but im really shy so the most I muster is a good morning good bye.  you know basic stuff. 

There is one other person close to my age (1yr older) that I was shadowing. That got a bit akward when I read one of his emails while he was typing it (I was supposed to be watching him and had been standing there with his knowledge for like 30 mins). I said, 'theres a mistake there' and showed a typo he was about to send to a boss. He yells, ""I do not like it when people read over my shoulder! That is a serious pet peeve of mine. you do understand right"" And in my head I'm like uhhh wtf ok I'm literally supposed to do this and just mutter ""ok"".

Idk despite all these social akwardnesses it actually is a great job. Work is pretty easy and chill, pay is good. I'm just sick if myself and me being super akward.",27Oct2020,1

I told her how I completed the last question but prior to that i told her I am sure its wrong.

I freaked out and the girl ended up going to the teacher and explaining the situation and letter I went in to apologize for my actions. When I went to apologize my teacher told me how the girl explained the situation to her and that how even though I wasn’t the one who copied off the other person i still shared my answers and that was still considered cheating.

Hi. I’m currently a 10th grade student. And it’s virtual school. I’m currently crying over this assignment that has a lot of questions. I think almost 50. And a lot them require 10 bullet points and detail. 

I can’t be left alone with my thoughts. I overthink. And I’m always thinking about how dumb I am. My coach got mad at me today because I was having a hard time understanding simple instructions. And if I’m being real, I was being really dumb in that moment. Seeing that the instructions were just to turn “straight back”. I thought he meant to have a straight back, and then I was also the only one doing it. When the instructions were just for me then around. So it was pretty embarrassing to be in the center of attention in that moment but I honestly deserved it ngl. 

But that didn’t really bother me until now when I’m sitting at my desk, my social studies homework in front of me. I can’t stop thinking about moments I was dumb and/or immature. And it’s just overwhelming me. I try to control my thoughts but I can’t. 

Music helps distract these thoughts. But even songs with no words makes it impossible for me to focus on my work. I can’t do both at once

163,"This girl M and I used to be best friends in high school until we joined different colleges and drifted apart. However we chat sometimes. Now the thing is, she was a mess in school. She got terrible grades, failed, shit was bad at her house too. I tried tutoring her and helping her out however she used to give up very quickly so even I stopped trying to help.

However after high school things took a turn for her. She started working out, eating better and looking better. I was genuinely very proud of her for this. Then my college and classes started. I'm an engineering student and my classes were very difficult, I had to spend hours studying and attending classes and I was honestly miserable. My friend however chose a designing stream, while they did have assignments and classes, they were relatively easier and she had free time (she told me)

In that time she made a lot of friends, explored her passions and started her own business. Her business took off well and she was working, studying and socializing. Her life was incredibly balanced. 

I, on the other hand suffered a huge burn out that resulted in me procrastinating and my grades dropping lower. I was off social media and did not talk to any of my friends. 

Now that the pandemic is ongoing, I'm still at home; just studying and sleeping. And her life is going really well. She barely talks to me, is constantly busy with her business and college work, but is also making a lot of friends.

Now I am happy for her and do not wish for her to be doing badly at all, but I'm also extremely jealous. I'm very jealous that I worked so hard through school, high school and college and topped my classes, and yet I'm miserable right now, while she was so quickly able to discover something that is her passion.

Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy what I'm studying and I'm studying now for stability in the future, but I've got massive FOMO and everytime she texts me to ask me how I'm doing, I start feeling insecure and jealous.

I joined and then he just was being a dick to me. I didn't care much so I just kinda ignored him. This one day, we were in this duel server with a lot of people and our whole clan was rdming. Including Toxic. Then when I killed him after he killed me, he RECORDED it. He then said ""OP was rdming, I have evidence!!!"".  Then when our leader told Toxic, to make us line against a wall and tell us to calm down, Toxic decided the best way to get us to calm down was to hit us. If we hit him back, we would get scoulded.  He was being a overrall dick. He also said I wasn't listening to him because he was telling me to recruit. Yet, the description of his job clearly says, ""recruiters for the warband"".

""Toxic honestly doesn't deserve his role. He doesn't recruit/teach us the right way"". Lets call this other clan member, Pac. Pac was a pet of Toxic. Anytime I said something that Pac didn't think was  right, he would say ""NO, THATS WRONG"". Since I didn't know that at the time, Pac was defending Toxic.

I grew up isolated in my house, I had only a few friends , most of which were picked for me by my parents or teachers, and I rarely cared about them much. I stayed home with my dad all day my whole childhood, my mom and sister were out at school or work all day while my dad worked nights. He would always sleep during the day or stay in the basement to do work or just sit at his computer. I sat in front of the TV all day, playing videogames and watching shows I liked. I never once considered friends or my future important, I just focused on fun things placed in front of me. My parents fought all the time, but it was such a normal thing for me all my life I'd just turn up the volume on the TV; I just kind of assumed everyone's parents fought. And that was how the first twelve years of my life went, with little to no largely significant things happening- I didn't care about friends, I went through various edgy phases in my life and started to care less and less about my outside family, and overall I had no goals for my future, other than just going to school and getting a normal job, then that would be life.

Then late 2019, I came to a new school and realized this was my best chance to reconnect with people and make friends. And it worked. My self esteem built wayyyy up, I started talking with more and more people, both strangers and people I genuinely considered friends, and even though my grades started to really drop, I was really close with my teachers, even the ones who didn't like us that much seemed like the highlights of my day. Even when bad stuff happened, even when my anxiety really acted up and I started really falling behind in my classes, I was always so excited for the next day, and for the first time in my life, I genuinely felt alive and I was always optimistic. Then Covfefe 19 was announced, and my school evacuated everyone out of the building in March of this year. At first I didn't think anything of it, I just thought quarantine would end and this would be a footnote of my life I'd eventually forget. But we started having meetings online and homework was assigned virtually. I started to panic because this was something I'd never been through before, and before I knew it, I was knee-deep in assignments I hadn't finished, with more and more being posted every day. I had to spend the next few months staying up all day, from 7 in the morning till 2 at night working on late assignments, and it was never enough. The school year ended with me almost failing every class, I lost contact with all my friends, and I had lost pretty much any respect my parents had for me, especially my dad. He started yelling at me more and more, he started taking me less places and overall avoided me more. He got much more frustrated than usual when I made a mistake and I quickly got used to him just yelling at me for no reason as soon as I'd enter the same room as him. My mom still tried to care about me, but I was such a wreck and I never could motivate myself to do anything, it was like the whole house was filled with smoke making everyone upset and angry. I also had a hoarding problem, I had a very tough time cleaning anything up and even the most useless things like wrappers or old papers felt important and I couldn't get anything done, the junk on my bedroom floor literally went up a foot off the ground. Hoarding is normal in my family, I am definitely not the first person to get into something like this, but no one seemed to notice and everyone yelled at me to clean without offering any help at all. I was tired all the time, and before I knew it, the entire summer passed and I was all the way back at square one, way back to when I had no friends and just looked at a screen all day, except now I was sad 24/7 and for the first time in my life, my parents arguing and my sister getting mad at me really hurt for some reason. I felt so useless, I could never get anything done. And now the new school year has started, and I'm still unmotivated. The problem now though, is that I'm so abnormally sad for no reason and I can't get anything done. It's only a month into school and I feel like a disappointment to all my new teachers even though I barely got to know them, I have close to no friends, I have no family to turn to that will actually help me instead of scream at me, and all the goals I had in my mind last year when my life got better just seem like a feverdream now. I have zero plans for the future, at the moment it seems I have no chance of even graduating this one year of school, all my family seems to hate me, and even when I feel like I'm finally at the bottom, something manages to get worse. Even on good days, it's so hard to stay optimistic. I lost any interests I had last year, I have no important interests now, I feel like a corpse that can't even die. I have never had a way to get motivated before no matter how hard I try, and now it's really backfiring on me. 

Now, I'd quickly like to clarify, I am not suicidal, nor do I do any kinds of drugs or self harm, aside from all the lack of motivation. Some days are harder to get up than others, and lately most of those bad days have really been mixing in with what normally would be a good day, but I have no intention of killing myself, contrary to what you might think with how depressing everything about me is.

Regardless of that though, I still am hitting a new rock bottom every day and I don't know what to do anymore. I do have a therapist, but I only see her once a week and by the time we get to talk, I am too tired to do anything, despite having done nothing. I can never get motivated, no matter what I do, and I'm not sure I can do much more to stop all the terrible things. I don't want to hurt, but I don't want to be an inconvienience to anyone either. I'm sorry. I just don't know what to do anymore.

**tl;dr,** I have depression that is taking over my life and I have no one to turn to about it, and I have no way to motivate myself to even just get up and do one thing. I'm always so tired, and I have no way to stop it or talk about it aloud. I need help.",27Oct2020,1
168,"There is this guy I liked for a long time, (I'm a black American girl and he is a Asian American guy) I told him through text, that I thought he was cute, then we started talking a lot and flirting a bit, he even considered meeting up with me, on the last day of 8th grade I hugged him and told him to have a great summer (before I confessed) he didn't hug me back.., during that summer I confessed to early, he got freaked out and suggested we just be friends, after that he didn't put effort into our freindship he rarely texted me, and then eventually I had to start the convo, he never talked to me first... Then after a while we drifted. Then at school he ignores me and acts like I don't exist. I'm in 11th now and I still have feelings for him and I can't seem to let go of my feelings for him  no matter what I do. I really want to move on with my life, but I feel like my feelings for him  are dragging me back, I've learned from this experience and learned to not rush in a relationship and take things slow, but (before covid) everytime I saw him I got a chill or my body freezes to the point it was hard to walk and sometimes even breath (it is fucking scary..), It got to the point where I developed bad anxiety and tried to leave class early to avoid seeing him in the halls. I'm so tired of feeling this way..any advice?",27Oct2020,1
169,"Long story short, I feel stupid for asking people on the internet for advice but here the story- All my life I have wanted to go to this all prestigious girl school, I studied hard and now I have the chance to get in- BUt I have one problem. There is this girl...an i KNOW what you are thinking!!! ""Ohhhhh so she is doing this for a giiirl"", AND NO!!! I am not doing this for a girl...kinda? Well I kinda made a vow to protect her for as long as I can because of people who hurt her!!! She wants to go to a co-ed school that I never even considered as an opinion, its still a prestigious school but not AS prestigious as the other school! What should I do! Am I crazy to do this all for a girl?!",27Oct2020,1
170,"I’m just really stresed and tired of dealing with my depression. I’m exhausted of waking up and going to bed. Ifeel lonely even when I’m not alone and I’m annoyed with the daily end of my life:my father, my fucked up family in general I guess, my boyfriend and all of his mentally issues as well bc it’s just not fair. I’m just tired. Mentally and physically. 

 I had to get a second job meanwhile we still have no car and he still has no job while we’re still living under this crappy and suffocating house. I’m just at my wits end. And in my mind I could fix it but not it any type of good way. 
 I could end the relationship but it’s not fair to punish the both of us because of stuff we can’t help and medication isn’t available for. I would be heart broken and null myself to emotion and that probably will lead to sucicode.  It would also leave him homeless and most definitely towards murder/ suicide, so that’s a no go option, at least not unless I can secure us a car so he will at least be safe. My mom and I joke about killing my dad with alcohol ( he’s allergic) bc of how mentally abusive he is, and I can’t even blame most of on his mental disabilities, he’s been the same way since I can remember and has only gotten worse. Im sad I had to come to the decision to not have my father at any type of future wedding or meet any possible children before the talk of either has even happened.  The rest of them aren’t much better and I’m afraid of losing them to suicde or some medical disorde( stroke or seizure). I’m panicked and null at the same time. Content with the fact that I have no family really but mortified at how I’m going to feel 5 years down the line.  I don’t know what to do anymore or why and I don’t even know if I could continue doing it. I don’t feel like I need to or want to, and that leaving this world would be better than not. 
I know it’s not but my depressed self won’t stop screaming at me, not even when I’m asleep. I could ramble on and on about the bulls hit that’s happened and I’ve already almost made like 6 posts about different things that have really bothered me but I never felt they matter enough to post, and this one might not either. 




I guess I just needed to vent bc I’m not sure what advise I could really get. I didn’t go into much detail here to avoid length and save time( I just got off work and came home to my bf sleeping, which upsetting bc I left when we were still mad about a previous argument and I guess I just wanted to talk about how my first night shift went)  

I hope I’m not alone in feeling like everything is too much right now. Good night reddit ✌🏻",27Oct2020,1
172,"I’m in my mid 20’s. For me I would say I like contact once every 3 months or so. If it goes longer than that, I don’t see the point of being friends. I only ever hear from some of my friends if they have something going on that they could benefit from. I’m not ending the friendship, but I’m not trying anymore either. They don’t have to see me in person, but sometimes I would like a text or something. Is this reasonable?",27Oct2020,1

Before online school I was literally living my best life. I started college last year, and I had never dealt with mental health issues. I was exercising daily, hanging out with friends, staying on top of my school work and I was happier and healthier then ever. 

Then 2020 happened. 


Going home in the middle of the semester sucked anyways, but I was happy to be home. I didn’t realize how bad it was getting till recently. I moved out for the first time (not including the dorms) into a house where a few other girls are renting together. I’m working to make rent for the first time. The first few weeks were fine, and Over the past 3 months it had just gotten worse and worse. 

I think I’m getting depression? Or something I don’t really know about that stuff. But I’m not motivated to do anything anymore, and just the beginning of this year I was fine with being active and productive. I failed a test for the first time in 3 years. I’m cutting deadlines way to close. It’s so hard to get out of bed and I just feel tired all the time. And I work retail, which sucks for obvious reasons. And online school is so hard. 

I also realized how much my eating habits changed. I was eating 3 square meals a day plus more before moving out. Now I’ve realized I have a few cups a tea and MAYBE one meal a day. I started eating less since I don’t have time to work out and I don’t want to over eat. Now I’m just not hungry. I had to force myself to eat a single meal yesterday. I feel bad cause I’m not working out and I really don’t wanna gain quarantine pounds. 

All of the stress between assignments and school and covid is really getting to me. I’m guessing there’s at least a few people who can relate, so how do you guys cope??",27Oct2020,1
174,"Hey I'm sitting here with a shotgun in a hotel in Orlando FL. Everytime I try to do anything, everytime I've worked hard jobs, easy jobs, deal with anything I don't want to I feel like letting go of everything and just rotting or killing myself. I've already seen pyschs and tried to take meds for it, only made it worse. I left my family and I can't go back to them because it was too dysfunctional.  


I only have like 200$ to my name. I have a friend who is willing to let me use his shower and stuff like that. Idk how I'm going to find a job I don't have an address, my car is messed up idk if it's a flat tire or something worse so I have to get that fixed. Maybe I should get a bike or something idk.   


I'm also really worried I'll just start trying to fix my life and then spiral again but I remembered the fact that people with more close friends tend to not kill themselves so I assume if I can find some more close friends I'll be able to be happy. I remember being kind of happy even when I had a hard job because I met someone who was fun to talk to. Idk though it's really hard and there's lots of people who aren't happy out there.   


Also I'm right next to UCF so if anyone has any ideas for making money helping college students or something that's appreciated. I know I'm asking a lot but it's hard to do anything or think about anything when I feel like this.   


Hope all is well in your life people reading this, any help is appreciated ty.",27Oct2020,1
176,"Hey everyone, so two nights ago, I (21F) was driving back home at around 11:00PM. 2 minutes into driving, I noticed a big white truck RIGHT next to me. I tried to speed up then slow down to have him not so close to me, but he would speed up/slow down with me. The man driving the truck kept trying to look into my car, but since my car is very low to the ground and his was quite high, I wasn’t able to get a good look at him. He eventually got right behind me, and since the roads were pretty empty, I wasn’t able to get away from him. As a 5’6 female, I was pretty freaked out, especially that I was all on my own. After following me on the highway and taking all my exits with me, he decided to go next to me again (on my left) and because of that, I was able to I finally lose him: we were waiting at a set of lights, when the lights turned green, I waited for him to start driving, and I quickly took a right turn without my blinkers (by that time he wasn’t able to turn right because he was in the middle of the intersection), but as I was driving away, I looked in my rear view mirror and saw that he was looking at me as he was crossing the intersection. He basically followed me on nearly my whole 20 minute trip (I was 2 minutes away from my house when I lost him). I did manage to get a picture of his license plate and truck tho. I got lucky this time, but does anybody have any advice on how to deal with something like this if it happens again in the future? And what should I have done if I wasn’t able to lose him? Thank you.",27Oct2020,1
177,"Context:
Went to a mates birthday party and made out with the girl for probably like a minute total on the couch, everyone saw and it was all good. Been at the same high school as her for years but never really talked to her much, we are both pretty shy. She’s somewhat friends with my ex (she lead me on and dumped me 6 months ago) but that’s not really the issue at all. Sketchy bit is that last time I was at a party which was two weeks ago the same sorta thing happened but we just kinda cuddled for a bit (parties had about 30-40 people) but after last night one of her friends told one of my mates that she wasn’t too happy about what happened the first time but then went on to make out with me two weeks later.....so I’m just kind of stuck on what to say. I still haven’t talked to her outside of these parties. Everything was consensual and I made sure to check up on her heaps and kept asking if she was ok with what we were doing. 

I was thinking of sending a text along the lines of: hope you’re feeling all good after Saturday, sorry if I did anything that made you feel uncomfortable etc

Let me know what you guys think, thank you

178,"So I have this friend that I’ve known for a few years. I used to have a thing for him but I always respected the friendship, spent the night whooping ass on video games, never hit on him, always nice to his gfs, mom loves me, the whole Shabang. Never made it weird or known. He’s always acted very immature and goofy when we were around groups of people but when it was just us, it was a completely different vibe. He’s very calm, very sweet, charming, the complete opposite of a butt naked cowboy crab walking down a public road. He has done this before lmao. He has been a few states away for a while but we always keep in touch. I hate being on my phone and FaceTiming and just talking on the phone because of my anxiety, but if I care/ am interested I’ll do it and get lost for hours talking if it’s the right person. Anytime he called I always answered, always left the party to be alone just to talk to him. Listened to his problems, his ups, his downs, any random 1 minute phone call just to talk. Here’s another thing, When he gets drunk he calls me A LOT. At first it would be a cute little back to back call to tell me he thinks I’m really pretty and hang up lol. He would send me nudes(I never sent any back), asked me how he looked, how I liked his outfits, not phishing for compliments but always ending up with me telling him how cute and attractive he is, and can have anyone he wants because he deserves the best. Anyone wants that for their friends and loved ones. He’s constantly complaining about how all girls he talks to just want sex and not a relationship. I always said the right one will come and stop stressing it and it’ll come when it comes. We will be on FaceTime and randomly he will go on about a girl/ asks me what I think of them, or send me pictures of them or their nudes and kinda side eye me in the camera I guess to see how I’m gonna react or make a face and I never do. Complete poker face over here. I don’t really show my emotions. I like girls too and I believe we’re all beautiful and I’ll tell him that. I give that answer and he just sighs and asks again, i give the same answer and then he changes the subject. I never talk about other guys to him EVER and when I do he asks if he knows him/them, will flood my inbox with nudes, send a bunch of messages being sweet or just tell me I’m very pretty and how much he misses me. When he came home we made out a few times, he started it, I felt like it was my first kiss again and butterfly’s were in my stomach but I didn’t make it weird. Never went past that because I passed out. Lost contact for a few months a little while afterwards and when we started talking again he ignored me on and off for a few weeks, I was a little hurt. I am a whole recluse, I only answer my phone for my mom and my manager and I answered for him every time he called me. Always talked him through his problems, always was there for him and everything. What really got to me was he could never be bothered to at least talk to me about my depression or my problems, only his mattered, he constantly was bothered if I talked about a guy or girl I was interested in when I did it 3 times compared to his 1,264, it’s crazy. Now that we are back in contact and he calls, I don’t answer. I might send a message as a response but barely. I miss my friend, but idk how to handle the situation anymore. He’s a really caring person, but idk if he’s being really immature and trying to make me jealous and tell him my feelings, or trying to show me he’s not interested. If he’s not interested, he sure calls me a lot and is hurt when I dont fall for his usual flirtatious gimmick and is upset because I won’t answer. I’m fine if he doesn’t like me, but holy fuck if he isn’t confusing me. I can’t let him continue with this behavior but idk how to bring it up. Does anyone have any advice?",27Oct2020,1

i want to find something to look forward to in the future, because i’m not even a legal adult and i don’t want the next 60 or however long years to be miserable (even though i know they will be). the issue is that i can only find two things in the future that objectively aren’t shit, and both of them are stupid and/or illogical.

1. opera. i love opera with every inch of my being. it’s everything to me and i want to work as an opera director some day. the issue however is that opera is 1) an idiotic thing nobody gives a shit about and 2) dying out and will be dead by the time i am able to work in the industry.

2. there’s a book coming out next year about my favorite character in a book series. the issue is that the book series is incredibly childish and badly written and that this is a beyond stupid reason to stick around anyway.

One of those things might sound really cliche, but it was love. I wanted to be in love with a person that is in love with me. The type of love where it's like a beautiful dance where we just enjoy the moment and learn each others steps and even step on each other or fall that we can laugh it off. Where we can cry together and feel safe doing it.

I know I sound like a hopeless romantic, but I have improved a lot in my personal life and I am persistent to find someone that fits my discription. I have no other choice nor  do I want anything else.


But I have no idea where to find someone like that, especially in today climate. Online dating feels like an pay to win trap and you only ein if you are at the top 10% Goodlooking guys.



P. S. If my metaphor about the dabce was too vague here is a better version:I believe love to have three foundations:

 attraction:how physically attracted you are too a person and that person too you

Friendship:being able to become best friends with said person. 

Compassion:taking care of each other when their at their lowest. 

You can add other things like religion or mentality or wealth to it if you find that important, but I am find with the first three.

185,"i think im the cause of my brothers abuse

i think i’m the cause of my brother’s abuse and idk what to do

idek if this would be considered abuse, or if it’s just typical asian immigrant parent stuff 


my brother has a real big problem with playing on screens (he’s 8). to the point where it’s affecting his grades. every time my family has told him that he wasn’t allowed to play on the screen for x amount of days, he always finds a way to sneak onto the ipad, which just adds to his punishment. whenever i’m the one that catches him, i tell him to go put it up, remind him that he’s not supposed to be on it, and explain why. when it’s my dad on the other hand..


he usually yells at my brother, but today he took it too far. usually, it’s just me and my siblings at home, so i’m the one that gives him a little talk. whenever our parents are home, i tell them since i assume they would know how to handle the situation better. big fucking mistake. every time i tell our das, he yells and yells at my brother. i think it’s not only verbal abuse, but emotional abuse. and IM the one that’s causing it, aren’t i? IM the one that’s going to our dad, foolishly thinking he’d be different this time in his approach but he never is. it’s MY fault that my brother is getting abused. why the fuck do i have the need to tell our dad whenever he’s home? what the actual fuck is wrong with me? it’s not like i enjoy watching and hearing the screams. i hate it, but my body won’t let me do anything. i just watch and stare blankly, and do damage control and console my brother when our dad leaves. it’s terrible, because IM the one that caused this, and now i’m trying to play the good guy by consoling my brother. i fucking HATE myself for it, so why the FUCK do i keep telling our dad when he’s home? 


today, he absolutely tore into my brother. it was worse than usual. he was hitting the door out of anger and frustration, hitting his (not my brother) chest whenever he talked about how he as a dad is hurt whenever my brother is disobedient. and worst of all, while screaming at my brother he said “i want to beat you, but i don’t want to beat you because i love you. if you’re gonna act like a thug and criminal then get out of my house”, as he grabbed hold of my brothers arm and shoved him outside, where he continued to scream at him before pulling him back. 


and what was i doing during the entire thing? just watching in shock. i’m too fucking scared to stand up to my dad, because, selfishly, i don’t want to be treated the same. what kind of older sibling am i? why am i so fucked up? everyday i think about how messed up my brother is going to be, and it makes me want to rip my heart out. i told myself that i have to be there for him, but what the fuck? IM the one that caused him to experience this abuse. i think about killing myself, but then think these 2 things: a) if i kill myself, then he won’t have anyone to console him and b) if i kill myself, then he wouldn’t have to go through my dad since i won’t be there to snitch.


i have a sister (shes also 8), that witnessed the situation along with me. i don’t want her to be fucked up too. i don’t want my siblings to be scared of my dad, he’s a good guy when he isn’t like this i swear... if i reported him to cps or something, what’s gonna happen to us? i don’t wanna be separated. i’m so fucking scared and ashamed of myself",27Oct2020,1

187,Last year i went through a heartbreak and that shit had me depressed for months. I basically fell in love w some girl i lost my virginity to. We fucked around and then she said we can’t tuck anymore and ghosted me. After that happened i went on youtube to find videos on how to deal with it and i came as across these channels talking about the red and blue pill. Basically it’s about how taking the red pill shows you how the world really is and how female nature really is. I don’t know if anyone here knows about that but once i found those videos i started binging them and a lot of them spoke real facts and related to my situation. The thing is now i can’t deal with women the same anymore. It’s not fun to talk to girls it’s stressful. I haven’t had sex in 7 months and it’s like i don’t want to. watching those red pill videos also inspired me to work on myself because the point of taking the red pill is so that you can become a better man. I started to do that and it was working. i’m in my early 20s and i’ve always had a struggle with attracting girls. Now i attract them but i don’t have the confidence in myself to pursue anything with them. Everyday i have thoughts in my mind about fuck women this and i don’t need anyone that and it’s not healthy. I broke down and cried to myself yesterday because i realized that i’m not over what happened last year. Now any girl i try to talk to i can’t get anywhere because of my self doubts.

My friends tell me to because they say she looks like she wants me to but my self doubts come in. Not gonna lie she gotta baby and those red pill videos always say don’t mess with baby mothers. I’m doing what they tell me not to but i can’t help it. I’m starting to like her but i kills me in the inside because i feel like either imma get played or imma smash and catch feelings and go through the same shit. I can’t take it i really can’t.

189,"So my in laws(74f &amp; 75m)haven't seen us(me 35f, hubby 49m, kids 3 &amp; 5) since February.  I completely understand that they're scared and don't want to die but it seems like their paranoia only pertains to us.  My husband works at home, I stay at home with my kids who are not in school or daycare.  So we're all home all of the freaking time (oh joy).  I should mention that my mom (59f) lives with us and works outside the home.  So they do have us on that one.  However, they see friends, go to stores, see the neighbors (who work outside the home), go to Dr appointments, etc.  They definitely don't do anything that is nonessential, it's not like they're going out to eat or hitting up bars or anything like that. Also, I know they've really grabbed onto what the media said early on about children being asymptomatic carriers, so I know they feel like the kids are especially dangerous.  This just seems silly to me.  They're probably safer than most people to be around right now.   The most they do is play on our yard. 

I just can't believe they're willing to miss so much of their grandchildren, when it isn't really mitigating their risk in any significant way.  If it were me, I'd risk seeing my grandkids and just get groceries delivered.

Because of the wedding planning I have been spending a lot of time with my maid of honor and her family.

I have thought before that he was the one that got away for me. We were just too young.

Lately he’s been trying to loose weight and thinks the best way of doing that is to drink coffee and only eat fruit related things. He’ll have meals, but not all the time. 

He’s also been hurting himself. A couple weeks ago he got a gash in his leg when he lost control of the chain saw. It wasn’t horrible, but it was as long as my hand (I have small hands). I asked him if he cleaned it. He said he didn’t. Then later he comes back from the hunting shack to tell my Mom and I that he banged his head on a pole because he didn’t duck in time or see it. Now he has a big tump on his forehead. 

I’m really worried that he’s going crazy or losing his memory. 

But on top of that, he keeps wanting to be close to me, physically. He wants hugs, and when he hugs me, he will loudly smell my hair.

TW: suicide and sexual truama

Last January my boyfriend (17M) told me (18F) that he had suffered suicidal thoughts for the past couple of years and they recently started to intensify. Being in high school immediately knew that he needed help and refused less if he were to break up with me or not I reported it to our school. He took it well but his parents told him they won’t keep looking for a therapist as they have been for the last 3 or so months. This angered me because their child was suicidal and they didn’t want to do anything about it.

Now after about a month later in February I have a meltdown. I’m crying because I have gotten into a fight with my dad. It was also a particularly hard time for me because I was dealing with childhood SA trauma. I called my boyfriend to vent and I cry on the phone but I fall asleep. The next thing I know police are burning into my room my boyfriend had called the cops tell them I had attempted to harm myself. Now to this day, my boyfriend can admit that calling the cops was a cry for help I never mentioned self-harm. When the cops leave I call him back and talk to his father I demanded they take him to the emergency room for his depression and they complied.

Later that week I was calling my boy in the hospital and was happy to know he was getting the help he needed. I unexpectedly get a visit from his friend (20M) and he tells me that his parents believe that I was encouraging his suicidal behavior like in the case of [Michelle carter](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/23/us/michelle-carter-text-suicide-release/index.html) which took place only 20 miles from where we lived. This infuriated me that his parents would claim that I wanted someone I loved to end their own life. The next day was Valentine’s Day and I went to his house to drop off a present which was a stuffier animal and chocolate to bring to the facility. I confronted his dad about saying I wanted to see him hurt himself.

When I confronted his dad he claimed that I was the sole reason my boyfriend had problems. I told him that he suffered from depression since early adolescence as he told me. His father (54) began screaming at me (18) at the top of his lungs. This was at 7 am. But he told me the most hurt wrenching things like how I would was manipulative and abusive. How I distracted him from his work at school. And how I was overweighted saying the world would be generally better without me. Later that day he cut off all communication I had with my boyfriend. He also reported to the school that I was abused by my father. Opening up a painful can of worms. The next day I went on a scheduled trip to South Africa with my mother and I get a text from my boyfriend about him breaking up with me. This was weird because my mom is a nurse and knows that psychiatric hospitals in the US have a very strict no-phone rule. His parents had forced him to break up with me.

Later my boyfriend calls crying me In South Africa telling me he loves me and that he struggled to express his emotions because of his depression. He also told me the day after he went to the hospital was the day he planned to commit suicide a month prior. Once I got back home his father and I avoided being in the same room for three months.

His mother has expressed that she is thankful that I was a “whistleblower” in getting him mental health help. His father has continuously been cruel to me. He told me that my best friend should be flattered that her abusive boyfriend stocked her. The other day well I was on the phone with my boyfriend he needs to break up with me. He also expressed that he was uncomfortable with me spending time with my boyfriend at his sister's house (whom I adore) because it crossed family boundaries. He was also angry at the fact his niece invited me to his sister's birthday and a camping trip.

I don’t know what to do and how to deal with this man. I basically can’t talk to him because he treats me like to scum of the earth whenever I do. My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years in November I understand things may change but my family loves him and he’s been adopted as one of us. If his relationship is going to be last I need to be able to be around this man for longer than 10 minutes without him giving me the DIRTIEST looks. Do I confront him about his treatment of me? What do I do to make this situation better?",27Oct2020,1

back in December my parents, my brother, and I went to India for a marriage my parents arranged for my brother (we're all Indian, but we live in the States). everything seemed fine, until just today. my mom told me that when my brother and his ""wife"" stayed at a hotel for the first night, and even until we had to leave, she wouldn't even let my brother touch her for a hug. that sounded really bad. my parents were talking to him, saying that she's probably only marrying him for the U.S., but he wasn't listening, perhaps blinded by one-sided love. 


the thing is, because of covid-19, immigration services are closed in India for the time being. now, I'm extremely worried that this ""wife"" of his only wants to come to the U.S. and not for my brother. we're in a tough spot, as well. according to my mom, since we don't have evidence of any of this, as well as being non-India residents, we can't really file a divorce like this.

218,"Title. I live with three others. Roommate in question didn’t have a job when we all moved in to our new house (two months ago), but has recently gotten a new job. He only applied for jobs that were 2 hours away by public transport (he doesn’t drive), so after he got his job he started getting mad at the rest of us for “getting a house so far away.” Now he’s never here, only drops in once a fortnight (if that), and doesn’t really talk to anyone. We were really close friends before he got his job, so I think he’s just been caught up in all of that, but I’m uncomfortable with him around now because while he was gone, me and the other two roommates got really close. 

Our first routine inspection was today, and he was a no-show. He came home one night last week, vacuumed his room and bagged up some of his rubbish but left it on his bedroom floor. When I went up to check his room yesterday, he had toilet rolls on his shelf with used pads stuffed in them (his girlfriends I assume). I gagged and threw them in the rubbish bag before I took it to the outside bin. This isn’t the first time he’s done this, as we lived in another house together before this one. It was a lot more relaxed but we had an inspection there that he never showed up for. 

He still pays his share of the rent and bills, but I think he’s wasting his money and our space. When he comes back, he brings perishable groceries, then he leaves and they sit in the fridge and rot. We’ve had to throw out hundreds of dollars worth of vegetables, milk and cheese since we started living together in April. His room smells SO bad because he never washes his clothes, and the smell just keeps multiplying and attaching to the carpet and bedsheets. We can’t even walk past his room without feeling sick because it’s really smelly.

It’s not that I don’t like him, because like I mentioned, we were close before he got his new job. Like, the four of us cuddling on the lounge and watching awful movies after eating a “family meal” together at the dining table. But now things are really weird and uncomfortable and there’s a big rift between the 3 of us and him. It’s mainly because every time he comes home, he gives us all the guilt trip of how we moved so far away from the city. But it’s only a 25 minute drive, and he never needed to get to the other side of the city before, and he chose to only apply for jobs out that way. We all chose to apply, we all signed for the house, we all went in for it together. I feel like I’ve been wronged but I also feel like I have no leg to stand on because he still pays rent and bills.

219,"Bear with me. This might be a bit long. I’m a F in my early 20s. Okay, so... where do I start? 
I cut out my best friend of 12 years. She was literally my other half. We were the dynamic duo. But... up until a year ago, things started to fall apart. Some back story: her and I were roommates when we went to college, and we also decided to live w two other girls for our senior year. January came around and I ended up meeting a guy. The same month where her and boyfriend of four years broke up. I was there for her, I was, or I tried to be. But it seemed to me that the second that spot was open, someone else took it, our roommate. Which is fine, she won’t ever be the problem in this story. She became hip close with this new roomie. Began to forget all about me. We all lived together and all she would do was go to her room and hang out. The roomie would invite me to hang out, and my friend would say no, it’s personal. I mean I called her out on it right then and there. How personal can it be if you can’t share it with your friend of years but you can with a roommate? She began to then hang out w the roomie, and the Roomie’s bf, who is also in a frat. She became close w the guys and they all began to like each other. Fair. I was fine with all of this... I had my boyfriend and my other friends, but she was my best friend, and she didn’t even care once about including me in anything- that hurt. Two guys in the group DIDNT like me. And that was solely, and I mean solely, due to the fact that I am a feminist and don’t let them boss me around. She’s okay with it. She’s okay with abiding by their needs, etc, and that’s why they like her, and not me. That’s fine. But what wasn’t fine was how they once had a hang out and the guys said, you can invite anyone but ____(my name)____ and she said haha ok. It’s so rude. My own best friend didn’t stand up for me. Now we’re done with school, and we have graduated, and her new friend group are still pretty close. Close enough to the point where I hit her up a month ago to see what she was doing for halloween, and she said idk. If nothing we can hang out. I was like what?? If you don’t have plans set why can’t we do something? She was like the group might do something. 
That’s when it hit me. That I was the second choice. I was the person she would go to when everyone else in the group was busy. And it was true. I went to montana for a little a month ago (to visit my bf, he’s there for work) and when I came back, she said she didn’t wanna see me bc - covid. Okay, fair. Fair ONLY if she applied these same precautions to the group she was in. This group is more than 10 people, and they all went out to public places, to different states, Vegas, in a pandemic. So it hurt me A LOT when I knew that I was being safe, and she didn’t care... she just wanted to use that excuse to not see me. So I went and got tested. Messaged her and said “I’m getting tested, are you still going to be wishy washy with me?” And all she said was no. A week went by: nothing. Then she calls me, like two weeks ago. I don’t pick up. She calls again and I pick up. She said why are you ignoring my calls? I said because I’m tired of you only coming to me when everyone else is busy, and she said that’s not true, I wasn’t home when I called. And i said in general... you haven’t been there for my needs. But you expect me to be there for yours. She laughed. And hung up. That’s it. That was it. That was my last conversation with her. 
She has always been inconsistent w me, but this one is new. It’s like she is in a clique. She picks her group over other people. She once cancelled on our other friend (outside of the group) 30 minutes prior to going out bc she said the group had plans. It blows my mind that it can’t be balanced out. 
New girls joined the group- and she told them about me. They said they were all excited to see me, and she said to me later on FT “idk, if I introduced you guys I wouldn’t want you to go and become close with them and have you guys forget about me” it sounded insecure and jealous. And it blew my mind that she was restricting a mutual interest (me and the two new girls to meet each other) because of a fear that she instilled in herself. A fear that will never become reality. 
I don’t want to contact her. I’ve been the only one contacting her before I said I’m done. When I was in Montana, she called me EVERYDAY, and now that I’m back home, it’s radio silence. 

I also cut out my other best friend of five years. Her boyfriend insulted me. Said I have small lips and a non European like nose. It hurt. I told my best friend that that wasn’t okay. And then I realized he said that probably because she said something about me to him first. 
Not only that, but every time her and I went out... he would be on FaceTime. I told her please text him when we’re out, I don’t wanna hang with you and him, I just wanna hang out with you. She got mad. Really mad and started cussing me out. “Wtf it’s LDR. Our times are different” and it’s like okay, but you have never met him, and I’m right here. Not only that but she met this guy- four months ago. Before that we were really close, like we did everything together close. I love her a lot but she seems to value a guy over me. It sucks. I wish people could just balance it both out. But I guess it’s too much to ask for. 



Why am I people’s second choice? 
I care so much and it’s like... a slap to my face. 
I cut them out. Toxic people suck, especially when they’re the closest ones to you. 

Now I’m sad and feel alone. They were my closest and frankly the only ones I would hang out with in person. Now, I’m in the process of getting close to my other friends that I haven’t seen for a while, and am more so diverting my attention to people that actually care about me. But I want these two to care about me too. Is their pride too high to apologize? I always say I’m sorry when I know I’m in the wrong and don’t want to lose someone, but my friends of years seem to not care, and want to give all of their attention to this new jewel that they found. It sucks lol. 

Sorry for the rant. I just hope that I’m not all alone in this.",27Oct2020,1

222,"I found and rescued this kitten from the bushes near my work. He was skinny, ratty, and crying when I found him, and he was terrified of people. This was about two months ago, and after patience and vet visits, and a lot of food, he’s at a good weight and getting the things he needs. 

Well, most things. 

I have major depression, among quite a few other mental health issues, and while he’s helped keep me company (and actually stopped me from completely relapsing with self harm), I’m afraid I’m not providing what he needs in terms of attention and play time. I get him lots of toys, lots of treats, love, and playtime, but he always prefers to bite and scratch me, even if we’ve played all day long (save for naps and food). 

He gets into things I’ve tried disciplining him to stay out of (I’m not hitting him, just syk), he bites me on the face, hands, legs, really anything he can get his paws on. He gets angry if I don’t pay attention to him a lot and bites whatever he can attack, and has actually slammed himself against my back as hard as he could while we were playing. 

He shows his love by holding my face still while he grooms my face raw (I have a short beard and he does his best with it) and not letting me be out of sight for more than two minutes, save for when I’m vacuuming. 

I feel bad leaving him home alone, but obviously I can’t just get some other cat and bring it home to play with him so he can chill out. I can’t bring him with me everywhere, I can’t really focus on stuff without locking myself away so he doesn’t tear me up. 

Just writing this, he’s attacked my feet and arms because he’s wired at midnight and I need to sleep for work, but I’m too depressed to even sleep. 

Earlier, he bit me on the face pretty hard, and since it’s been a real shitty last couple weeks, it’s kinda sending me into a spiral of a pretty deep depression. He doesn’t deserve to be stuck with some guy who plays with him when it’s convenient and only wants to sit on the couch and do nothing other than stare at something else. He deserves someone who’s going to give him plenty of play time and other animals to keep him company. 

I’ve been thinking, should I keep him? I know he seems to love me a lot, but he can love someone else just as much, if not more. Honestly, I’m just a blip on a grander scheme of his life. What should I do?",27Oct2020,1

225,"      Things have been going pretty well at school, and I like most of my teachers. However, I recently noticed my English teacher making extremely uncomfortable and uninformed statements in class. Additionally, she has us do discussions in class that involve political content, but when we express our arguments and opinions based on facts, she will often shoot us down and make bad faith arguments about the topic. 
     That would be enough, except I stumbled across her Facebook page (I know I shouldn't have), and my fears were confirmed. She is a flaming Trump supporter on her very public Facebook profile. Her page is filled with xenophobic and racist comments. On top of that, she bases most of her opinions on false data and opinion articles. I find this funny considering she was just going off the other day about not believing everything you see on the internet and how the news is too partisan.

231,"Hi and thanks for getting in this thread, this is a throwaway account​, sorry for bad English I'm from Mexico bla bla​ bla bla...

I had a relationship with her around September 2018 up to November 2019, we used to work in the same place, she was a Jr manager and I am a senior manager (this is relevant in a bit) she left the workplace for a new job in July 2019 and we tried to make it work but after some differences in our personalities we broke up in really bad terms, we stopped contact and we both parted our ways, in February is my birthday and she contacted me and said if we could see each other, I agreed and after what you could say it was a ​really weird ​date ​one thing led to another and ​we slept together, the morning after I took her to work and she told me to never contact her again, that that night had nothing to do with anything and I should delete her number and everything, she blocked me and that's was it...

Fast forward to early October, ​COVID happened, and my general manager told me than she contacted him and asked for a personal ​meeting about job related stuff ASAP, it weird me out because I am HR at the moment and she avoided me 100%, the meeting happen and my boss told me that she asked if there is a way to take her back since she was not happy with her new job, he told her that sadly because COVID our corporate forced us to lay off a lot of people and the waiting list for a return to the place is quite large and he can’t skip it for her, the day after she shows up again and ask again for my general manager (I was not in the place) she asked him if there is any way to take her back, **\*\*\*EVEN WITHOYT PAY\*\*\*** either for her school practices or whatever but if we please take her back, once again my GM told her than he was going to ask but it was 99.999% a no, my GM told me hours later about this and at this point I've started to worry for her, because you don’t go to your previous job asking to come back without pay from a job that payed more.

I​ have friends who work at the other company and asked about her and if anyone knows what’s up, it turns out that she started to have proximity with a manager who is known in the workplace to harass female workers in exchange for you know what kind of stuff... After some months of her rejecting him COVID striked and she had a lot of risk of getting fired so apparently she gave in to his charms and 3 months later is pretty well known that he is all over her at the point of asking her to be like his shadow and he buys her dinner, clothes, takes her to her home and you can assume what is going on at this point...

Once I asked all 4 of my friends who work there and all 4 told me the same thing it was pretty obvious what was going on, I checked her WhatsApp to send her a message like a follow up to her meeting with the GM and surprise surprise, I’m no longer blocked from anywhere, I send her a WhatsApp asking if everything was OK and her response was ""I’m OK, I need nothing from you"" I insisted that if she asked for help at her former job maybe there is something I could to to help, once again she asked me to leave her alone since she doesn't need anything from me, the same day she shows up again at work and this time I see her and she says ""I’m looking for GM, need nothing from you"", I said that he wasn't there but if she at least let me see what was going on and if I could help in any way, after some back and forward she agreed to see at my house the next week.

Once at my house it was the most uncomfortable silence day that you could imagine, like 5 mins of talking and 55 mins of silence and staring to the wall for around 3 hours, I made dinner for her and we eat and stuff, I kept asking how has she, how was her family and the usual catch up questions and everything was answered with ""fine"", after hours of silence I kind of get impatient and went ahead and told her that if she was asking to go back without pay it was pretty obvious she was having some serious problems at the new job, that there was nothing either the GM or me could do to get her back atm but I could help her find a new job somewhere else, give her letters of recommendation from the 4 subsidiaries the company has, even give her letters saying that she had a better position, worked for longer in the company and had better pay so it was easier for her to get a new job, also if she was having financial issues I knew about banks that where giving weekly loans at a very very low interest rate or I could lend her money without interest and she could pay me even in years it dissent matter, as long as she can quit her current job a get a more safe one, once I was done she stared me with anger and told me she was a big woman, needed no help from anyone and especially from me, she didn’t needed any money and she was fine and I could take all my help and give it to someone else.

This is the critical part, after she rejected all the help I offered I asked about her job, she said ""The job is OK, is about marketing, I have no problems with the payments and is a safe position, everything started at a very basic level but after a while I had some opportunities and everything started to grow to levels I didn’t even imagine, but I’m fine and I need no help"", at mid-sentence a tear rolled from her eye, she started shaking and her voice started to tremble, I swear I am not making this up, she took a while to regain his posture and said once again she didn’t need anything from anyone, she could get all the things she needed done by herself and especially she doesn’t needs anything from me... After 2 more hours of small talk and silence she asked if I could take her home, at the door she took a while to get through the door and I offered a hug, she immediately went to my arms and we stayed there for like 10 minutes, after that she tried to kiss me, and one thing led to another.....

​The next morning she asked me to take her home, once we were ​there before she gets out of the car looks me dead into my eyes and says ""This didn’t mean anything, I don’t want anything from you, I don’t need anything from you, this doesn’t change the way I feel or think about you, erase my number and don’t contact me again"" as she blocks me from WhatsApp in front of me and leaves... Fast forward to yesterday and once again she is at work asking again for the GM, once again she avoided me and once again ask to the GM to come back, after being rejected once again I send her a message asking if everything was ok and she said she's ok and once again I offered my help, she said ""If you promise to stop asking me for help I can see you again at your place tomorrow (27 October)"" I didn't ask her to come to my place again, i didn't even mention it, she said that on there own, and I said OK....

So here is the question... Should I keep offering and insisting to help her until she lets me help her? Should I even see her or cancel her visit to my place? Should I just let her keep going with her life as she is asking? She doesn’t knows that I know what is going on, but even if I didn’t asked my friends at her workplace you don’t need to be a genius to know what is going on…

One key point is that I'm currently in a relationship with a former ex that I've dated before her for around 4 years (yes... I know and I'm deeply regretful about it) and I have NO PLANS to get back with her, as I said we broke up in really really bad terms, we just weren’t made for each other... Thank you for your answers and sorry for the long post!

TL; DR: Ex is being harassed hard at new job, I offered help, she agreed to see me to tell me she didn’t need anything from me and ended sleeping together, now tomorrow I’m going to see her again and I don’t know what to do",27Oct2020,1

233,"I am someone who had a very rough childhood. My mom drank... a lot. And it caused her to do all sorts of crazy things. Sometimes she was sad and threatened suicide. Sometimes she was angry and said I needed to get the fuck out. Sometimes it was dangerous and I didn't know if she'd kill herself accidentally. Along with this she was in many abusive relationships and I saw way too much that I wish I could unsee.

All this background to basically say, I don't drink at all at age 20 and it is something that has scarred me deeply. However, my girlfriend has decided that she wants to start drinking and I don't know what to make of it. Part of me says it will be too hard to watch and I dont know if I can handle it and part of me says I love this girl too much to let this ruin everything. It just sucks because I didn't ask for my childhood to be that way, and its really dragging down my life now. I am wondering if anyone has ever had a similar experience and if they ever became okay with it. 

I mean am I even justified in not wanting her to drink? For me it feels like pairing an ex alcoholic with a girl who wants to drink. Yeah I wasn't the one with the problem but I am the one with the emotional scars.",27Oct2020,1
234,"Here's some background and a summary of my life and problems

1) 29 year old guy, About to get married
2) Born to a middle class family that later got rich because of my father who is a self made man became a businessman, and slowly adapted to a new lifestyle.
3) Born a bit fat than usual kids of my age, retained the fatness throughout childhood. And since I was raised in an age where fat shaming was cool I was bullied beyond any limits, which gave me a sense of fear whenever I talk to people beyond my parents and brother
4) This fear eventually grew into anxiety through my later teen and young adult years.
5) Tried my best to lose weight, but it always came back due to the thyroid meds and anti anxiety meds I take
6) Subsequent bullying and anxiety made me drop out of two colleges in my lifetime.
7) Eventually I decided to take matters into my own hands and reduced as much weight as I can, enrolled for an MBA and got it as well from the best college in my state.
8) At the same time, my dad was struggling with his business, due to a hostile takeover attempt from his own partners his sales and the company's reputation declined. I was eager to take over the reins of the company with my sibling but that will never happen now.

9) Dad sadly had to sell of his dream to literally an evil corporate, we aren't left penniless but we are not as rich or happy or successful as we once thought we could be. Our life's trajectory took a sharp dip. At the same time Dad and mom had separate but serious health scares 

10) I just finished my MBA and since I don't have a business to run. I took a job in an ad agency, this was in 2016

11) In my time since starting my career I spent a year in an American start up, followed by GroupM and another in an equally large corporate. My life experience till now, along with my antagonistic attitude towards corporate made me a cynical worker. I knew that I was a resource they would easily dispose off using their own made up rules after they extracted every bit of value from me. Since I'm from India, the attitude towards workers is so bad that you would compare it to slavery.

12) Indian Management in ad agencies don't know anything beyond carrot and stick. And fear mongering. My work in Group M and the subsequent agency right now saw me treated like a slave who is constantly bullied as well, with work hours going beyond 16 hours and absolutely no appreciation, all for a pittance

13) Ever since covid struck I've been in more hell because even though I'm working from home, working times don't apply to my managers. They call beyond 10 pm and if I don't pick up the call, I get shouted at by the managers during the meeting next day. I'm not called a slave but I know my place in the organisation. I'm a glorified slave.

14) My health got so terrible in between this covid situation that I began vomiting blood, fainting and my mind getting hijacked always by a sense of imminent dread, I think it's my earlier anxiety issues finally evolved into something I couldn't live with.

15) My managers don't give a shit because work has to get done

16) I can't quit my job because in between all this tension I met a girl and my parents and myself being Indian need to get myself married before I'm 30 🙄 so a guy without a job is a bad groom basically...

After going through the above 16 points I hope you understood what my issues are. I have always been a bit suicidal, and I always think of doing it but I don't. But I cry almost every day due to stress and anxiety, I do wish death, natural death comes to me fast. But it hasn't yet.

239,"Hey all. I never really put my thoughts out like this but I guess this is the place to do it. So I’m a musician [M, 19], a (currently online) college student as well, and I’ve done some work for one semi-famous rapper - other than that, I work on my band and occasionally make beats, see my girlfriend, play World of Warcraft, occasionally hang out with friends, etc. - regular 19 year old male activities. This past year I’ve had spurts of creativity, and weeks of nothing at a time. I recently finished building a real, professional quality studio with my father and the past few weeks have been completely barren of productivity. I get up, go to my draining day job (where I’m constantly disrespected - I only stay because they’re the only local employer that can handle my schedule), work out, and play WoW to cool down. I try to make music and I just can’t make anything good no matter how much I manifest the good, how much I work, etc. I’ve tried working through it, taking time off, etc. but I can’t shake the feeling of uncertainty that comes with a career in music. My father walks the line of supportive and critical and doesn’t really operate with a filter - one minute I’m doing great and another I better figure out what I’m gonna do in life according to him. I have no siblings, so my mother is my closest friend. She knows how he can be, but her solution is to just let it roll off your back, which I can handle sometimes, but not all the time - it’s such a stressful life to balance a job, music, a girlfriend, etc. I barely use social media anymore, I very rarely see my friends, doubt and uneasiness about the future constantly plague me to the point where everything I do feels purely like a chore. The music industry showed me how completely fake and impure the people I work with can be, and I can’t bear to stoop to that level, it’s 100% not in me. I guess much like this post, my life seems chaotic and constantly bogs me down. My cousin has cancer AGAIN, my father won’t get off me to force myself to work when nothing good comes out of it (not to mention his incessant criticism of, not kidding, EVERYTHING else I do, etc.), any media I see just makes me feel terrible (especially because in America, the election is right around the corner and my parents are highly political so I hear about it all the time) and I feel like I’m barely moving forward despite scattered progress. On top of all that, I just lost a full ride scholarship to school and have defaulted to our state’s prepaid college option that my parents set aside for me when I was very young, and of course this has decreased morale and general disappoint me in me around the house as well. I know everything gets better with time, I’m just confused and would really appreciate anyone’s advice on how to handle any portion of this. I’m so sorry for the wall of text.

I live in Germany and I had to change schools recently in the middle of the school year, essentially I was in this new school for 2 days, then we had fall break, and yesterday was the first day after that and I believe I got sick again.

Due to the current health crisis our school has to keep all Windows open during the school day so it was ice cold yesterday, and we had PE which we also have to do outside even though it had rained, so the ground was very wet and my shoes and socks got soaked.

I have a compromised immune system and get sick very, very easily. I have common flu symptoms, headache muscle ache, running nose, throat ache, the whole package. Now I have to make the desicion wether to stay home or go anyways. So far no fever, just slightly higher temperature.

My problem is I just feel it would immediately make me look unreliable to miss some days after literally only being at this school for 3 days.

I only have about two hours until school starts to make the decision on what to do now. I am over 18 so I don't have to really ask my parents, but making these decisions is so hard for me, which is why I wanna ask for you guys advice and/or insight for this situation.",27Oct2020,1

249,"Hi! this is my first ever reddit post and throwaway account (?) so please excuse me if it seems odd and VERY VERY poorly written with poor grammar i’m in a rush.
I arrived at Incheon Airport in Seoul, South Korea on sunday around 5-5:30 Pm according to Korean time zone.( so like two days ago ish) There were several checkpoints after landing and at one of the check points there were like two guys I thought were cute. I learned they were all from the army helping out amongst COVID procedures right now. Anyways, I got stopped at every checkpoint and was exhausted and very very loopy from a 11 hour flight and had to drive down with a lot of luggage for another four to five hours but after landing, the protocols were taking forever too. I was stressed and anxious. There were seven tables and the two boys i thought were cute were sitting right next to each other but the one i was more interested in called me and my mom up to the table. Not a whole lot of personal conversation between us were exchanged but i just felt like we made a lot of eye contact while i was in line waiting. After we passed the checkpoint and went behind a screen to the next checkpoint i could faintly here my name ? and then someone saying that’s a lot of years between you guys or something? I didn’t think much of it until we got to the last checkpoint (at this point my mom and i were the last ones left for some unlucky reason) and we had to wait outside an office for an hour or so but 30 minutes in i decided, “ I have two weeks of quarantine anyways might as well just go and ask for his number while i’m out here sitting waiting.” I was about to go walk towards the table but then I saw all of them leaving! I walked and peeped behind the screen and saw one boy left sitting at the row of tables , i was about to just leave but he caught me before i left and asked if i needed something. l basically just said that I was wondering if all the boys left and how i thought one of them was cute. ( I was super anxious and in a rush because i didn’t know when the office would call us in and on top of me running on very low sleep at this point for like 20 hours i was super loopy and not thinking fast at ALL and my mom was very upset and stressed so i kept glancing to make sure she was okay). He started laughing a bit and kept asking which table it was but i was like uhh i’m not too sure tbh... ( i was so tired.) and i pointed in the general direction we were at , and he was like this table ? not this table? and i was so confused and just nodded to the table second to the end. I also asked how old they all were and he was like around 24 and i informed him,” oh i’m 20.” and he responded, “ yeah i know,” and I just gave him a weird look? He quickly told me like “ they told me you were 2000 something...” So at this point I just really feel like the guy that helped us out was also interested in me if his buddies were aware of the year i was born because the only way they would know is if he told them since he saw my passport. He whipped out his phone and showed me a picture and asked if it was the right guy... i told him that i’m honestly not 100 percent sure because they’re all wearing masks... and i was in a RUSH so i just ended up nodding and tellling the dude that I think it’s the right guy. He called the friend and all I could hear on the phone call was, “ ... she’s back... you know the girl... yeah her the small.... no i’m not joking... i’m being serious ... yes seriously i’m not joking... do you want to talk to her right now?....i’m not kidding.” He handed me the phone and the guy on the other end was super surprised, I asked if he had a gf and he basically told me he was super flattered but sorry he did have a gf and i told him everything’s fine thank you and thanked the guy that made the call for me and i rushed back to the office. THIS IS WHERE I FUCKED UP because my brain was SO SLOW after the flight. I slowly came to a realization as I was talking with my mom and leaving the floor that the guy i was interested in was actually sitting at the far END of the table and I called the WRONG GUY(The other cute guy that didn’t help me and my mom out). I was so devastated as stupid as it sounds. Now, my friends have been trying to give me advice on how I could ever track him down and there was some good ideas but none i have executed yet. The table check point where the army boys worked for had phones to call and make sure we had a relative or friend in korea to keep us accountable in quarantine. My friends told me to call back that number around the same evening time that i met the guy and try to reach out to him there but I found out since it’s a government phone it won’t take incoming calls. People are telling me to call the help center and leave my contact information for them to pass onto the guy, try finding someone that’s a worker at Incheon airport to relay the favor for me so it’ll be a bit more intimate request compared to a help center OR to try asking around if i know anyone in the army rn to try and ask if they know which unit that’s working at Incheon Airport rn and try to track him down to relay my message/ contact information. I really feel like he was also interested in me and I was super into him too ( cuz of me hearing my name, and his buddy knowing my birth year) and it’s been bothering me for the past two days I don’t know what to do. Please help with some realistic answers. I know it seems stupid but I don’t want to hear anyone bashing me. Thank you!",27Oct2020,1
250,"I am a new mom with a 10 month old, I have had many problems with my husband. Today he crossed the line. Let me just start by mentioning that he has never changed a single diaper, bathed, dressed, fed or ANYTHING for our baby. It is alway me. I am a stay at home mom and he is pretty much a stay at home man. (Our employees do the actual work). He sits in the couch all day while I cook, clean and take care of the baby all at the same time. I never stop until it’s bedtime. Today I was cleaning the kitchen and he asked for food so I cooked a full mean. It was delicious. For some reason he felt like humiliating me so he started pointing out everything he didn’t like about it. That killed me inside because I spent almost 2 hours preparing and cooking. I let it go. A few hours later the baby needed to be put to sleep so I picked her up and tried putting her to bed and he sat there smirking and saying “do this, do that, your don’t know what you’re doing, you’re doing it wrong” so I gave him the baby and said “here you go since you know it all” and handed him the baby and left to go fold laundry. This is where it went south .... 

He followed me and tried to give me the baby and I repeated he was gonna put her to bed so he snapped and handed her over, then I followed him saying I do it wrong here you go. 

He bit my ear and chocked me while I had the baby in my arms. Then walked away calling me all sorts of names. I went upstairs and put the baby in the crib and went after him. I told him he was a coward for doing that while I had my baby in my arms that I wasn’t defenseless anymore so try it now? .. he didn’t he kept laughing in my face. I snapped and charged at him. I hit him as much as I could. Then I told him if he’s gonna stay in the house watching YouTube channel that he was going to be responsible for the baby because I can’t clean, fold and take care of her all at once while he watched tv. I went to get her to bring her down for him and when I got back he kicked me in the back (while I had my baby in arms) again I put her down and we got into a full brawl. He tried to end it halfway though but at this point I was no longer in control. I can’t count how much punches to the face he got (I got them too). Lastly he went upstairs and I picked up the baby and from the top of the stairs he spit on me (it landed on my face and the baby’s). He walked away calling me fat, a whale, etc. I weight 130 lbs and I lost my confidence about 3 years ago when I would hear this on a daily bases. Not to mention the cheating. This is the first time we went at it this bad and now after 6 hours all I can do is look at my baby and apologize and tell her I will not raise her here to think this is ok. I’m going to pack my things now in the middle of the night while he sleeps and leave tomorrow before he realizes. I can’t go to my parents house because my face is all bruised and I’m embarrassed. He won’t fight for the baby’s custody because he doesn’t do anything for her anyway but my world is upside down right now I don’t know what to do.",27Oct2020,1
251,"(I don't live in America for the record). 

I visited the doctor last Thursday for medications and a checkup. Unfortunately, I forgot to ask for one usual medication I usually get a repeat prescription of. 

I emailed the doctor's reception, asking if the doctor could possibly add it for me. No big deal if she couldn't and that was me asking too much. I did state that I didn't want to pay for another prescription fee, so it was okay to leave it off if they'd have to charge me all over again. 

The receptionist said this would be fine. I would just need to wait until the next week (today). 

I waited, then emailed again just to double check that it could be added since I was about to pick up my prescriptions. 

I get an email from reception a few hours later stating another doctor (not my doctor) has added that medication to my script and charged me quite a lot of money for his time in adding it. 

After calling reception, they said they can't do anything unless I take it up with the reception manager. 

Would it be reasonable of me to tell the manager it's not fair since I originally stated it was fine to leave it off if I had to pay again? 

I don't know if I should just suck it up and pay. It's a little daunting when it comes to arguing with a doctor. Any advice would be appreciated.",27Oct2020,1

However I do stay up late, especially due to the quarantine and wake up late and I’m starting to notice a real trend of her telling me off for doing stuff that she “hears” me doing.

This happened tonight after she did catch me up late just looking at my laptop, she ordered me to turn everything off and I complied and apologised for waking her then tried to go to sleep. I’m guessing about 15 minutes pass and I hear my phone ringing, I don’t answer it because it’s on the other side of the room, then I hear a text, then my door opens and she tells me off again and says if she catches me again she’ll remove my stuff permanently. I respond that I’m doing nothing but trying to sleep and she goes “Well I could hear something” then she slams my door shut.

The joke of it is I checked my phone and SHE called and texted me, the text saying she can hear me and will remove my stuff. 

Maybe I’m just biased as I was in the wrong tonight, but there’s been times where she’s asked me to be quiet when talking to my mate and I have stopped talking to my mate only for her to let me know she can still hear me and to turn everything off.

I can’t argue with her because she calls me disrespectful for raising my voice, which also gets me into trouble.

It was really fun but recently I've been afraid that it might be difficult to build a romantic connection (as I'd initially wished) over a very long distance. The last time we met was a year ago, and the max that we can meet each other in the future would be 1-2 times a year (or less with the travel restrictions). Both of us live our own lives in two very different places, and sometimes I didn't know what to talk about beyond the typical small talk. Furthermore, as places are opening up, I've been feeling that she's very much preferring real-life than online interactions.

I understand that the distance is challenging, and that we won't be able to live closer to each other in the next few years. It's probably best to not start something now. However, I hope to keep a spark here, for an opportunity to arise if we happen to live closer in the future.

279,"My passion is cars. All I want to do is learn how to work on, modify, enhance, and drive all types of vehicles, (especially 90’s imports! nothing hits the spot quite like them). The problem I am facing is that I am currently in my last year of high school and am graduating soon. My entire life I’ve dreamed about buying a used but exciting car (currently have my eye on a 2003 Subaru Legacy B4 Rev D) and modifying it over the years so that by the time I am 20 then 30 even 40 I will still have a hobby I am very passionate about that I can work on whenever I want and will make me happy. I literally eat breathe and sleep cars it takes up 80% of what I do in a day. On the other hand though I still don’t know what I will be doing next year regarding University/ where I am going to be living ...etc. I’m torn between following my dream and buying my own car and being safe and saving that money just incase I may need it later on.

I saw him like 0.5 seconds before he saw us and we get to act normal but... He knew... He knew... He just walked away and stared at me... I feel like I disappointed him, I feel like trash and I don't know what to do... This just happened like 3hrs ago and he didn't told me anything yet... What should I do?

Anyway, in my late teens and early 20s, I wanted a girlfriend. I’ve never been interested in hook ups. But I thought it would be fun and exciting to have a girlfriend. And, as corny as it sounds, I wanted somebody to love. And I wanted to get married and probably have kids.

Now I’m 24 and I just don’t care much anymore. Yeah it would be kind of nice to find a girlfriend/wife. But now it’s sort of like winning the lottery. It’d be nice to win the lottery, but you know it probably isn’t going to ever happen so you’re ok with it.

286,"I’ve been struggling with my mental health for about 6 years and I’ve almost made some regrettable decisions. Thankfully I pulled through those dark times and survived. But depression doesn’t just go away I’m sure and anxiety doesn’t just leave. I still have depressive episodes and my anxiety is affecting me in different less obvious ways. As a result I cut a lot of people out my life, my logic on making  keeping and maintaining relationships is skewed and I’ve gotten to a point where even texting/calling someone is a daunting task that I avoid at all costs. Aside from school group chats, I archive everyone in my contacts and I’d forget about them until I happen to get a text or I feel the need to say hi, which is rare. I graduated high school last year and this semester is my first at uni. It’s online of course, but physical school is expected to start In January because our cases are decreasing. I’d like to finally take the step to get some help before the pressures of school and being around people takes its toll on me and I ‘crash’ again. Over the past few months I’ve been feeling myself slipping down into that dark pit again, and I don’t want to be there...I want to be able to make friends, work efficiently and overall cope better with various things and feel emotions again. 


My parents seem to be aware that I’m not too right upstairs and my mother would constantly say in a mocking tone “You okay? Do you need to see someone? Do you want a counselor? Because something not right with you”. Of course I wouldn’t answer because of her tone. I’ve been wanting to say yes for a few years now and I now have the courage to ask to see one. I noticed that a fairly new mental health clinic opened up near where I live and it looks nice. I love its atmosphere and it makes me feel cozy just looking at it. It looks safe. That’s one of my main reasons for wanting to go. (It looks like a cute cottage). My country has free healthcare and from what I read online the clinic is also free, another selling point. I don’t wanna burden my parents financially as my father is injured and my mom is the sole breadwinner for our family. It has decent reviews too. I’d really like to go but I have no idea how to approach my parents or what to say. A question that’s bound to come up is “Why do you need to see a stranger when you have us?” etc. Hell no lol.

289,"Seriously there are posters everywhere cause I got bored and put them up. I've given multiple briefings on how you shouldn't come in if you're sick or have recently been sick. It's all over the news and common sense would suggest coming to work when you had a fever during a pandemic is utterly stupid. They don't lose out on pay because we've told them they'd still be paid if they're sick or just not feeling well, since we didn't want any sick people coming in and infecting anyone else. You'd think by removing the financial incentive and lecturing everyone on how to behave would ensure everyone stayed at home if they're sick right?

I thought so too

Well, today an employee came in and then told someone she had a fever on Saturday but was feeling better now. Oh, and she lost her sense of taste. Despite not feeling well, she came in. I gave her a list of (free) COVID testing sites and sent her home, but now I'm hearing that she doesn't want to go get tested. She claims there's a problem with her car and she can't go? But then how can you drive to work and go grocery shopping when it's about the same distance?

I really can't see the logic here when we've already agreed to 1) pay her while she got tested or is in quarantine 2) retain her position if she needs to be in quarantine 3) provided her with free testing sites 4) offered to reimburse for fuel

She literally isn't losing anything. I think she's undocumented and doesn't really speak English though - maybe that's part of the reason why?

I'm really tempted to escalate this and have her terminated now because this is ridiculous. The blatant disregard for other people's health is selfish and irresponsible, especially when we've implemented policies where they have unlimited sick days now. It's like you're begging to be fired for intentionally risking other people's health for absolutely no reason.

All of our disinfecting, masks, air purifiers and fans, open windows, distancing, hand sanitizer, etc. don't freaking matter if we have idiots coming in sick against policy despite there not being ANY financial or any other penalties for staying home whatsoever.

We've mandated a COVID test before she can return, so I guess we'll proceed from there.

Would you terminate someone like this? We're an at-will employment state too",27Oct2020,1
290,"I'm going to start this post off by stating that I am a high school student who recently transitioned to an online school, I hope this doesn't invalidate my request for just general advice. 

I feel this odd need to learn a skill that I either find interesting or that might help me find a job in the future. I don't understand it in the slightest. It's this gnawing want to develop and become good at a skill that I may not even properly develop or make use of. Currently, it's a deep interest in 3D modeling. Sometimes I'll be lazying around and get mad at myself for not putting forth that time into developing a skill or learning something. I don't know where this anger comes from or the complete cause of it, but it causes a stress treadmill of sorts. This coupled with me being very hard on myself for not being good at things, another trait I can't explain and stems from god knows where causes me to feel very stressed and frankly not good enough. For who? I don't know. Just not good enough. Most of my stress is self-induced, but I have outside factors like my family acting like I'm some godly gifted child with the IQ of a supercomputer. I've just been really stressed out lately and sometimes when I'm taking a break by playing games or just lounging around I feel guilty for not using that time for something else.

The thing is, I'm sure almost 100% of my friends and family don't know I think like this or feel like this. I honestly don't know what kind of advice I'm asking for, I just need help. I don't know how to properly handle my stress or get rid of these toxic self-stemming feelings.",27Oct2020,1
291,"First all my high school friends disappeared into their adult lives. I get this is normal, but no one even checks in on me. After 8 years of me always being the one to reach out, I gave up.

I failed to make any friends in my 3 years at college. Got depressed and dropped out. Since then I've been bouncing through jobs. I always make some friendly aquaintences at these jobs, but nothing has stuck yet.

I notice that when I'm talking with people: I do not understand why anyone says 90% of the things they say, or what I'm supposed to say in return. 

They talk about anime. 
I dont remember any charecters' names. 

They talk about sports. 
I really do not like sports. They're a circus of distraction where people go to develop tribal mindsets, conformation bias, a misunderstanding of statistics and CTE. 

They talk about celebrities.
I hate this. Person = person = person Just cause you have more information about a person does not make that person or that information more valuable. For fucks sake why do we make people public figures for reasons other than being good people. Now kids have degenerates and opportunists for heros.

They talk about politics.
Frankly I, and most others, are simply too ignorant to discus most of these matters with any substance. It all ends up boiling down to ""The guy I listen to said..."" Vs. ""Well the guy I listen to said..."" But very few people even admit that they arent saying somthing they've thought about, they're saying something they heard or felt. This kind of discourse is the interference pattern amping up people into radical ideas.

They talk about media
This one hurts. Cause I spend all my time watching tv and movies, but when the rubber hits the road it always seems like I havent seen the thing people want to talk about today, or i saw it years ago, and don't remeber it right. 

They talk about music
I have tried so hard to appreciate new types of music. This is like a really annoying puzzle. The people i get a long with best tend to be metal heads, and I just cant with most metal. I don't understand the lyrics and the music feels like how I don't want to feel. The music I like best is alternative hiphop, and the only person I've met that was into that was a tool. 

Look theres other things people bring up, and I feel confident for every typical thing someone might bring up, there's no way I have more than one or two things to say, and i can never think of any questions.

I've been at this for years and i still dont understand. This isnt my first cry for help. Generally the advice i get is: Dont force anything. Dont take yourself too seriously. Try new things.

My first problem with this advice is i don't undersrand what people mean by taking yourself seriously. Feels like Im starving and people are saying dont try so hard to eat. 

I feel like no one understands and I don't know what to try. I've tried comedy, therapy martial arts, bar hoping, trivia, going to concerts, playing music, dancing, hiking, and going to the movies. All of those things sparked some passion in me once. Now they dont because i had to do them alone and now thats all they feel like. Still alone.

I dont trust the support system I was given. Father is narcisit. Mother is broken by it. Theres no one else in the family structure cause ol'Dad didn't like 'em. I cut them out of my life, but that's left me with no one.

293,"21F here a senior studying at a good college. For the past few years, I have been single by choice and working on myself, my goals, etc. I read more, exercise, do yoga, eat healthily, etc, I also improved myself emotionally since I had a bit unhealthy childhood, and developed healthy coping skills. I feel like I am in a good place in my life, especially mentally ready to date. I have been on some dating apps. I have no problem getting matches, dates, guys who appreciate me and want to have a relationship. 

I have developed feelings for this guy 27M, who I have been seeing for over a month (4-5 dates) he is great, free of red flags but feel like he doesn’t meet my needs/ wants as much?

When we are together in person, he is great, respectful, affectionate, but over text, FaceTime, he is busier and his communication gets a bit more sporadic. I understand he has a demanding job, unlike me who is a full-time student and has two part-time jobs, and a pet to take care of, but still make time for the things/ people I want. Like he doesn’t text me good mornings, or if I ask him how was his day, he doesn’t respond at all. I wish he communicated more, but it is ok with me for now unless we are to get into a relationship, then I’d communicate this need with him. I have worked on my clinginess so I do not nag or let it bother me as much if a guy doesn’t text me back. 

Next, 

If I feel attraction and the guy is someone I feel respect towards, not just some random dude, I have no issue sleeping on the first or second date, if a guy views me as less because of that, good riddance. So yeah I have been having sex with him each time we hang out, and the sex has been pretty great. 

1. Would it make it better if I held it off? I personally don’t agree to hold off, because if a guy wants to leave he will leave regardless. We discussed how we both are not looking for casual hookups. 

Then there is another guy 24M I like, he is also pretty awesome, but for some reason, I have more feelings towards the 27 y.o guy. The 24 y.o guy is consistent with his communication, compliments me, communicates his appreciation and he makes me feel like he is my biggest fan/ supporter. 

1. Is it ok to date multiple people at once?  Should I date one guy at a time? Some friends suggested that I should be “loyal”, and date one guy at a time but we did not have exclusivity talk with either of them. 
2. When is the right time to have the exclusivity talk? After how many dates, months, how well you know?

I want to have that conversation with the 27 y.o because if he doesn’t see a future, I would rather know now and move on but is almost 2 months enough? Each date lasted over 10 hrs, and I slept over at his place, cuddled, woke up together and we talked a lot so I feel like we did get to know each other quite well. 

3.a. If it is too early to have that conversation, am I going to come off as desperate? 

I want to have a relationship, I want to feel safe enough to be vulnerable and share the beautiful and some painful moments of life with someone. I know I do have a lot to bring to the table besides a great sexy body, like intelligent/ interesting conversations from politics to sports to emotions, open-minded, speak multiple languages, empathy, nurturing nature, mature yet fun-loving, etc. 

1. How can I lead the 27 y.o  guy to commit? I feel like because of our age gap he may see me as less accomplished, or less interesting than women his own age. 

The 27 y.o guy makes me feel less like a priority or first choice of a woman when I can have almost any single guy I want. 

My plan, for now, is just to move on with my life, continue seeing the 24 y.o. and unless the 27 y.o actually decides to put in more effort, communicates better, starts initiating dates again, and wants to take to the next level, at least to become exclusive, delete dating apps. 

1. the 27 y.o is pretty much perfect for me, what I have been looking for but my relationship/interaction with the 24 y.o feels more like an equal partnership which I like more. Need advice not sure what to do.",27Oct2020,1

295,"So I have lived 19 long years being painfully inexperienced in romance. At one point, I did have a boyfriend for an entire month (part of that month being long distance cuz of covid) and still didn't get my first kiss because we were both to nervous to initiate things.

Lately I've been doing things more out of my comfort zone in an effort gain more experience so to speak which leads me to the situation I'm in now.

I've been talking to this guy (W) for only like a day. We have a hang out thing(?) scheduled for Wednesday and in the moment when plans were being made, I was really happy about it but now that I've had some time to think I am unsure if I want to go through with it.

I barely know this dude, we're in a pandemic. Idk if he's a murderer, has STDs, or if he's going to respect my decisions (and not rape me) when the time comes. 

I dont need to have my first time with the love of my life, and I don't have to be in a relationship with them. But I at least want to do it with someone I trust, and I don't know this guy well enough to trust him. 

That being said I don't want to miss out on an new experience because I'm nervous. Like what if it ends up being something good.

 But overall I kinda want to get my virginity over with cus I feel like once I no longer have the virginity label, I'll have be able to be more open and pursue other romantic opportunity

I also have a somewhat high sex drive, but I'd rather keep to myself until I'm certain I'm with the right guy. Because of that, I use a sex toy every now and again. For three years, I've been using toys made of PVC (which, until recently I didn't know were harmful for my body and learned the hard way).

297,"Backstory: me (26yr) and my (31yr) sister were never really close. My mom and dad split when I was in kindergarten and she moved away in grade 9. She left when mom was having issues with her boyfriend and went to stay with my dad in a separate province. We lived in separate provinces until about 2 years ago. I have flown up to the province she and my father resided into seasonally over the years. She always had something against me even though I spent years trying to figure it out and come up empty handed.  What's annoying is that even though she seems to not appreciate me she expects so much of me from appearances at social events and her upcoming wedding. 

-----------------

Everytime me and my sister get together she finds ways to downgrade me. Most times she calls me down in front of family, friends and my boyfriend. She always refers to me as a brat and attention seeking even though I genuinely try to avoid drama with her at all costs. She will purposefully try to provoke emotion from me whether it would be anger, sadness or other negative emotions. 

When she found out she was pregnant and she had her baby shower she told me to ""wear black so I look smaller"" ( Ive always had issues with my weight and she knows this). I helped organize the event and was seen as a worker rather than an attendee. She brings up very often that I don't facetime my nephew regularly even though I facetime at least 2 to 3 times a week considering commute is four hours away to physically visit I feel like that amount is adequate. 

Fast forward to today, she won some big money on a random raffle took me, her and my father out to a lunch. She wouldn't fork the bill for my $14 chicken tacos. I also lost my job to the pandemic and lost my apartment lease last month (unrelated but still adds salt to the wound). It wasnt even that I expected her to pay for my meal but she called me a coniving bitch over lunch as well for mentioning I would like to take my father to a single movie while he is down for a week long trip. She expects him to be at her disposal for the duration of his trip because she also bought his airfare to the province from her winnings. I felt so embarrassed when the server asked how the bill would be split and she said I dont mind getting mine and his but definitely not hers. My father was so embarrassed and I was as well. 

She also treats my mother poorly. My mother injured her shoulder and is awaiting specialist appointments. She makes her babysit for her at her convenience multiple times a week and drives her around everywhere multiple times a day, drops her son off at daycare and picks him up, and other driving errands because she doesn't have her liscence. If my mom is at an appointment or simply has other plans she calls her down to the absolute dirt and just expects her to get there now or there will be consequences. If she doesn't get answers from calling someone she will harass and call insane amounts of times. 

It infuriates me and I'm finally beginning to see that myself and my mother are seen as low class relations in comparison to her fiancee's family(who has more money), our father and her friends. She even talks different around them. Almost higher tone and attempting to sound sweeter. It's absolutely disgusting. 

I apologize for this long post and it may not be entirely coherent because its 4:30 am but I honestly have noone to talk to and needed to get this off my chest. I'm looking for outside advice because even though I'm not looking to have a relationship with my sister because I do not like her character, I am looking to retain relations with my nephew and godson. It breaks my heart that my one sibling is like this and leaves me feeling so alone in this world. If it is a personal fault I am willing to take ownership but I am trying so hard to find what I am doing wrong. Thank you so much for taking the time to help",27Oct2020,1

Recently I’ve noticed that when we hangout with our mutual friend, my girlfriend will tell her things about  her mental health that she doesn’t tell me. Like deep personal secrets about her mental health. My girlfriend and our mutual friend always “joke” about their mental health or they will just talk/ vent about traumatic or depressing things. And most of the time, the things my girlfriend is saying are things I’m hearing about for the first time. 

I’m just wondering why she hasn’t told me these things previously and why she doesn’t talk about her mental health being that bad unless it’s around our mutual friend. It makes me very sad that she doesn’t tell me these things. I want to try to help her feel better and I would like her to tell me about her feelings so I can help her. But she isn’t doing that with me. Just with our friend.  

Am I doing something wrong? Does she not think she’s safe to tell me this? I just don’t understand why she would tell our friend and not me. I know this is extremely selfish but it kinda hurts. I just want her to know that I love her and that she is beautiful and that she can come to me anytime she wants to talk. And I tell her this all the time. I think I am loving and supportive? At least I try my best. And yet, she tells me she’s doing good even when she’ll tell our friend that she is struggling mentally.  I must be doing something wrong. Please help!

303,"Random Saturday night and me and my sister are talking stories. Something I realized with my family over time is that they are dysfunctional. I’m almost 30 and over the past years, I low-key dread coming back knowing that when everyone gets together, someone is bound is instigate something at someone. I have a older brother, sister (the oldest), and me the youngest.

My dad was abusive with my mom, sister, and brother before I was born. Cops have been called before when there were fights. She said my dad changed when he had to go to programs. I didn’t really remember anything dark when I was younger. I feel fine but my sister makes me feel bad that I’m “loved”, “spoiled” etc… when I feel like I’m just being myself. 

And for some reason, she always talks about traumas. She’s going through it right now with her husband. For some reason she brings up a story where she said my dad smashed something over my mom was pregnant with me. At the moment I was very offended that she would tell me that. I like to live in the present, I don’t dwell on the past but I thought it was rude of her. I’m working and I need to keep my energy levels high… I feel like she’s trying to bring me down.

When I came back home (bc of covid), me and her got stoned but then she reminded me of a time I got mad years ago... she didn't have to bring it back up. I can't be like her where she just thinks of all the traumas of life. She has a lot and it scares me.

308,"Me and my dad have always had a rocky relationship. Me and my mom have as well but that is irrelevant to this discussion. The problem with my dad is that I find that he never enjoys having a conversation with me. Growing up, I didn’t feel like I have a father figure because we wouldn’t be able to talk and often times, we just aren’t able to have mature discussions and compromises. It’s always him accusing and yelling at me. But anyways, basically what happened today is that I want to have a conversation with my dad (I don’t know why I continue to do that. Maybe because I like talking. Trust me it never ends well.). We talk for like 3 minutes and he holds up his hand and says stop. That’s enough. You talk to much and I’m no longer interested. Your boring. I feel a little bit offended when he does that. I know he may be a little bit autistic (I have no proof of that obviously. Just random speculation). I try to explain to my dad that it’s not nice to say that and it’s doesn’t feel good to be ok the receding end. He says that he feels violated that I am forcing him to talk to me. He then proceeds to lecture me and say that I need to learn not to talk so much and that people often times don’t want to listen. He then blames me and says that other people will judge me for doing that and that I should annoy other problem instead of him. While I agree that others not everyone enjoys talking for a long time, the conversation was extremely short. I have never had this experience with anyone else.

309,"Okay so im like 16 right now, so i met her when i was 13 about turn 14 i was in 6th (repeated a grade) i got transferred to her class my new teacher was really formal i had to write the heading and shit (the class i was in before had a teacher that really aint give a fuck about that shit he just wanted his work) but she was nice and helped me out cus at this point i didn’t know anyone in the class except ma son eddie i sorta joined his click with Jo and Jeremy, no cap they was funny asf but she would casually talk to us and me and her became friends a couple of months after that( i was shy to talk to her, she was mad attractive like j.cole wet dreams type shit yk like that song describes how her appearance is) her personality was outta this world,she was this cool down to earth person and could really be friends with anyone type of person but she hatedddd going outside she also didnt like little children all around a good hearted gentle soul. she was always so adorable but she was also emotional distanced. We grew closer in 7th grade, we would text every minute of the day. I would always have a text from her( i didnt mind it at that point i already loved her yk) i kept asking her out once in a while but she always shot me down. But 8th grade was when shit hit the fan, we started dating around October(i shit you not i got so excited so i showed ma mom a picture and she thought u was datin a HS JR) and we broke up in December because I thought she was pulling away from me and she seemed less interested in me so I thought i was doing her a favor, but the next day her friends tell me that she cant stop crying over me and shit, i feel so bad because i was still head over heals for this girl man. I went to were she usually chills after school it was this library and I remember the adrenaline running when i got buying flowers and her favorite things to eat. I get there and shes really is crying. I go up to her with everything and i try to apologize and tell her that she really meant a lot to me and that i really truly deep heartedly loved he, she ended up throwing out the snacks and she didn’t take the flowers, so i went to the park where all ma friends were and i just broke down with the flowers in hand and all man( nobody really saw me cry i’m someone that doesn’t show my feelings unless it truly hurts yk) so a week goes we haven’t spoken a word to eachother i tried to move on because at that point I thought she was done with me so me and one of her classmates started talking and we started dating (me and the classmate) but like for some reason im just not happy anymore everything seemed dark and gloomy and i broke up with her . We’re abouta go on winter break my associate got emotional and started talking about a girl he liked and how he felt “numb” until her met her. I started thinking about her and i just bursted out crying like hardddd. Ma friends ran to the see what was wrong and the only thing i could say was “ i just want her man” so after that long double period i ran to her in the halls and i told her how much i missed her and how much life sucked without her and then boom we’re together but we lasted until ma birthday week. She literally broke up with me 2 day before ma birthday💀she never gave me a reason she stopped talking to me and then on graduation we’re both happy that we’re finally leaving that bitch ass middle school and i see that she’s crying and I didn’t do anything i just stood there not knowing if i should go for it or not... but I didn’t and that was the last time I physically saw her. It’s been almost 1-2 year that we haven’t spoken but she constantly in the back of my head. I have dreams about her they’re lowkey weird. I had one where we were at a mall and i found her and grabbed her and told her how much i loved her and how I should’ve hugged her, then the second weird one was with her in one of those one peice table and chair with white and black twirls behind her and she was looked pissed. The last one happened recently like 2 weeks ago i got this dream where she texted me and we met up. The weird thing is that the day after i went to my brother crib and were we all had different dreams that were lowkey like signs yk, but this us all, if you read everything i would love to hear ur opinions.

We were talking on instagram, and again, they look legit. They have a few hundred followers and photos dating back quite a while, with likes and comments and such. They had locations on some of their posts, so I did a lil creeping myself and saw that they all live in the same state (but far from where I live), so they all obviously know each other in real life.

The only thing that’s really throwing me off was just how overly welcoming they were. We were talking through an online game, and they were practically begging for my instagram at the end to keep in touch. I, being pretty naive, gave it to them. They all followed me, and I followed back, and we were talking in a group chat. They were talking like your stereotypical BFF group, and maybe it’s just cause I’m a shy person, but I was pretty overwhelmed.

Anyway, is there any possible way to be sure that they’re 100% real? Or that they won’t hack/dox me? I feel like simply asking them won’t do any good cause they obviously wouldn’t admit to anything like that. Are there any ways to protect myself from doxxing or hacking if need be?

As an 18 year old I finally sat down with my step dad (a great man whom I respect entirely) after she stole 30,000 from their joint bank account and begged him to stay and help after he said he was done and swore he was leaving. She got clean, for a while. About 3 years. We finally had a relationship all my life I’ve just wanted a goddamn mom. I was so jealous of all those girls that went shopping and watched movies and talked boys with theirs. I had that for the first time in my life. That’s just background I guess. I’ve had a feeling for months now but my step dad finally called me up to say he’s been in denial too but it’s clear as day. 
She’s flighty and withdrawn. Denies ever making money at work. Runs to the “gas station” three times a day. If she can’t get it together I’m beyond terrified I’ll lose the only positive male figure in my life and my little sisters life that still lives at home as well. (Her father is a severe heroin addict) 
So how do you stage an intervention. How can I be there for her when I’m so hurt and scared at the same time. I’ve also heard it’s true people are much more likely to over dose during a relapse.

You read the title. In the next few hours or so, me and my boyfriend of roughly 5 months are gonna check out an apartment. I’m excited, yet nervous.. I can’t sleep which is why I’m writing this. I don’t know how to tell my parents I might suddenly move out. You’re probably like wtf. Yeah me too. But let me explain. We like each other a lot, uhh love each other I guess. I trust him. He’s risking a lot by being with me and so am I. I’m not sure my parents would approve of him since I’m waaay younger than him (10+ age gap) but he makes me happy. Living with my parents has been rough over the years, I just want to start living my own life and stop worrying about their problems and just be happy for once, But I’m not sure if what I’m doing is okay or not. I love my parents but they stress me out and are sorta toxic. I want to be happy and free, but I don’t know if this is the right way. 

Thanks for reading, I’m tired and nervous so hopefully what I wrote makes sense... I just really need advice from someone.

When we all go out together (in a car) we put on music. Now, I'm mostly into metal and rock but I try to enjoy all genres of music but some of them I just can't have fun when I'm listening to it, and I've tried very hard to enjoy it.

Everyone of these friends hate like 99% of songs in my library. That's fine, because people are different. They keep saying stuff about my favorite songs and albums like ""it isn't real music and ""put on some good music"" when we're in my car. I'm also fine with this, and when they put on their playlist to listen to ""good music"" I try to enjoy it and I like some of the songs. 

The problem is if I keep listening to their playlist for longer periods, eventually it really starts annoying my ears and I just feel very bad in general (sorry but I don't know how to describe the feeling). This becomes incredibly frustrating when we go on a road trip or something. I get so glad when I'm home afterwards. 

This keeps happening again and I'm considering to get some kind of noise cancelling thing to put in my ears when I we're in a car while going somewhere because when I get out of the car, it's like I'm on edge and stressed out.

5 mins later I find myself on a feminist page story that I'm harrassing her etc and the place I used to work at earlier also got a call regarding me, luckily I sorted it out because I had proof of the whole thing and people called her out on it. She got so mad that she said to me ""you dare turn my friends against me, now I'll go to the police"" she did File a complaint but nothing came off it.

When people understood that she is doing this all for attention, everything died down, but I'm still mad at the fact that she got away without any repercussion.

I got alot of hate messages because of it, (most of them later understood the whole situation and apologised) but still, when this scene died down everything was back to normal. But the 24 hour of torture is still with me, so many calls, hate messages etc and death threats too.

I have anger and anxiety issues so my heart was beating outta my chest. I'm all fine now but when I look back I get chills and my stomach churns.

It makes me soo angry that she didn't have to deal with anything, she did this all for attention and even tho it is false, she was let go easily, where there were people looking for me.

Thinking of this makes me angry that some men don't have proof of this and they get their entire lives ruined over 1 small sexual false allegation.
Women like this make real victims of harrasment look like a joke.

I still get my blood boiled whenever I think of her and I wish I could crush her fucking attention seeking skull. Ik this was harsh, I want to get rid of this anger and live my life in peace, but the damage is still there since people love drama.

2. Personal boundaries: I think that it is simple decency to respect the privacy of someone’s room and not outwardly ask what someone does or doesn’t have in their room.

333,"For context: whenever my mom gets angry at me or my dad, she resorts to the silent treatment. She doesn't say anything and doesn't acknowledge our presence. I'm not sure how long she can do it for, because it's almost never directed at my dad, and when it's directed at me, I tend to apologize to her immediately before it can drag on for longer than 2 days. 

So, onto the main situation. My mom gifted me a really pretty necklace with a valuable pendant, and I really loved it. I wore it every day and never took it off. A few weeks ago, when I was changing for gym class (Where I live, the government has deemed it safe for students to return to school), the clasp got caught on my shirt and the necklace broke. I could only find the chain, and the pendant went missing. I couldn't find it anywhere, even after enlisting the help of my friends and searching the whole of the locker room.

When I got home, I didn't tell my parents, which I admit was a really stupid decision. I was quite scared of the reaction my parents would have to the news, and I didn't want to disappoint my mom, who had trusted me with the necklace in the first place. I was also dreading the inevitable silent treatment she would give me. I just hid the chain in my jewelry box and didn't say a thing for the next few weeks. 

Today, after a conversation this morning when my mom asked me about the necklace, I admitted that I had lost the pendant and apologized for not telling the truth earlier. Both my parents were understandably disappointed in me, my mom especially. I don't recall her exact words, but she had told me that I shouldn't have lied and that she was disappointed with me, and I wholeheartedly agree with the former statement. 

After that, though, she hasn't said a single word to me, and she hasn't acknowledged my presence in the house at all. Whenever she uses the silent treatment on me, it makes me feel as if I have to creep around on eggshells until she finally acknowledges me, and I hate the feeling. I've tried bringing it up to her in the past once, and she said that it was something that she was used to doing and that she would try to do it less in the future. 

In this case, I fully acknowledge that I was at fault for not telling my parents the truth earlier. However, I'm still not sure how to move past the silent treatment, and I'm not really sure how to talk to my mom about how it makes me feel, and how I want her to talk things through with me instead of just giving me the silent treatment, and I'd like some advice regarding that.",27Oct2020,1

Just like that, someone I have poured my entire life into. I know we wont work things out or anything like that because this is literally it, it's done.

I need advice and lots of it. I have no job, no car and no qualifications. I dont think I can stay here anymore and I need a fresh start somewhere else.

I have worried that if myself or my girlfriend get Covid it may affect my child's health (when I eventually choose to have one, just want to make it clear I am talking about kids that do not exist as of now but will probably exist in 4 or 5 years)

As of late I have begun to worry about how the vaccine will affect their health. As my title says, should I wait for 9 months or so to see the health of other people people's children who were vaccinated?

I also want to make it INCREDIBLY clear that I am in no way an anti vaccine person and I put a large amount of faith into scientists and doctors. I have always worn a mask and have been staying inside for the entirety of this pandemic while doing online school. I know that it is important that many of us get the vaccine and that, because of people who have chosen to ignore the pandemic, it may be the only way to get this pandemic under control.

340," 

My boyfriend and I had a fight where he was basically asking me for some intimate pics and vids which is quiet normal for us cause we've actually done it before. I have sent him various pics of me and like 3 vids in the course of our 8 month relationship. The guy is extremely respectful most of the times when things are all happy between us but the moment we have an argument he becomes kinda mean and does not realise what he is saying and then later does not sometimes even accept his mistakes.

In our 10 month relationship, as far as I can remember it's always been me who has kind of chased him to solve our problems cause he has the habit of cutting me off when things get tough and its always me who ultimately apologizes. the moment i get upset at something, he gets 10x upset about it and then I now feel like i can't be sad or mad around him. when things are all good between us he is the sweetest guy but again as things get bad he becomes extremely cold and mean.

This time around we were just chatting with each other and as i mentioned earlier he had asked me for my pics... I have a habit of sending my pics to him and then kind of joking about how i am a good girlfriend and how he should be greatful and how he should probs not get used to all this and stuff, but it's all in jest and he never complained abt it before. This time we were joking as usual and he had said that my pics are the sole reason for his survival and just as a joke i told him that i kind of now want to see what will happen if i don't give it to him. He all of a sudden flipped and got really mad and started saying that me sending pics to him is not some luxury i'm providing him and i should not make him feel like he is comitting a sin by asking me for em and that he does not understand y i send him pics when i say such stuff to him. Honestly, i get his point but that was never my intention, I was just joking around like he was and I never meant it that way. I constantly apologized to him for offending him and told him that i did not mean t, i was just joking, but then his exact words were-

""B\*tch, please. In the span of 8 months u have sent only 3 vids to me so don't make it seem like u r providing me some luxury. Don't make it seem that i'm doing a sin by asking you for such stuff. I have deleted everything you've sent me and you are a c\*nt, just so you know.""

and then he blocked me everywhere. He had actually already broken up with me before because of the distance but then we had started talking again and it was good and we decided to just take a break instead of breaking up. But then this happened. Idk who is at fault and how i should deal with it. I love him a lot and he makes me happy but when things get bad between us he becomes super mean and I am just scared sometimes of annoying him or like setting him off because of this so I have to sometimes really think abt what i say in front of him. He had once before called me a pathetic, egoistic f\*ck during one of our fights before but then i had let it slide but then when he called me names again I just got really offended. He had once blocked me before as well during one of our fights and he has done it again now. I agree I have made a lot of mistakes as well but I always acknowledge them and apologize, i feel like sometimes he is just not ready to acknowledge his mistakes as well. He is a supportive bf and has helped me a lot thru stuff so i feel like i should maybe overlook some of his mistakes and maybe not hold it against him and that i should not leave him and stuff because of it, but there's a limit for me as well, I can't keep chasing him everytime there's a fight between us and Idk this name calling really made me feel like he does not respect me?? Idk what to do.

tl;dr : My boyfriend called me a c\*nt and a b\*tch while we were arguing. Please read the entire thing to get the full story

Update : I broke up with my boyfriend and I really really miss him a lot. He was not good for me, ik that, but we had some amazing moments together and I can't stop thinking about them. He used to be super sweet and send me these really sweet messages and stuff and I really believed he loved me a lot but now I just don't know what to believe. It's so hard to comprehend the fact that he cut off contact with me completely because of some pics and vids or even because of a joke i made unintentionally. I really fought hard for him and really tried to make us work, damn it! I fought with my mom for the first time for him. I don't know what to believe anymore and the worst thing is this happened like right before my bday. He was my first boyfriend and I was super excited to celebrate with him but now it feels like it just ruined my bday and i feel super down and i don't even want it to come anymore. The guy is in my classes in my college and before I was so excited to go back to college but I don't want to do that either cause I don't know how I will face him.",27Oct2020,1

343,"That might sound confusing, so let me give you some backstory. 

There are three people involved here: me (17F), ex A (18F), and ex B (17F). 

I started dating A when I was in seventh grade and she was in eighth. She made me realize that I was bi and practically shoved me out of the closet once I reached high school. I thought I was in love, but the more I've reflected over the years, I think that I was just infatuated with her and the fact that someone was actually interested in me. I'd never even had a best friend, so the relationship that we had was as precious as gold to me. 

That relationship ended toward the end of my freshman year. During those two years, she would tell me that she loved me so much that she didn't know how to live without me, threatened to leak my 14 year old nudes (post them on FB and tag my dad) because we got into an argument, guilt trip me into staying with her because she had pushed all of her friends away ""for me"", tried to sexually assault me when I was asleep once, and a number of things that should've sent me running for the hills. As a result of this emotional termoil I was extremely depressed and suicidal, and self harmed on the daily. 

After I cut all contact with A, I started to get better. I didn't self harm anymore and I focused on myself and became much happier. The summer before sophomore year, I started texting with B. 

B made me the happiest I've ever been. I'd known her for a while, and apparently she'd been crushing on me for a year. She made me feel beyond loved and important, and I did the same for her. We had our arguments and struggles of course, but we always came back from them stronger. I was so in love with her. Classic butterflies every time I saw her.

Then A put herself back in the picture. 

She started talking to B casually, asking questions about ROTC, and sometimes asking if I was okay because of random things like ""this will be a hard day for her"", or ""she's scared of thunder and it's nasty outside"".  (This made B insecure and jealous)

B asked if I was okay with them talking, as acquaintances, and I said I was. I wasn't, but I was terrified of being controlling because of criticisms that A had given me. (My mistake!) Over the next few months they started talking every day. B grew more stressed with school and family life, and started pulling away from me. Their texting made me nervous and I wanted to know what they were talking about (they were using ""view once"" pictures on Instagram), but B said that it was a violation of privacy and that I shouldn't worry because they weren't talking about me. Eventually me and B were fighting every day, and most arguments stemmed from this strange friendship between her and A. I didn't get how she could be friends with someone who wrecked me. We decided to break up at the end of sophomore year.

We were both distraught, but a couple weeks later I saw that A and B were hanging out and I couldn't keep talking to her after feeling so betrayed, so we stopped contact. 

Shortly after, I found out that they were dating. 

After over a year together, A and B recently broke up. B reached out to me, needing support, and basically told me that I was right about A. She's manipulative, she guilt trips, she makes you miserable and won't let you leave. She even is blackmailing B. Having lost all of my friends and still caring deeply about B, I've let her know that I'm here for her. It's awful watching her go through the same thing I did. We talk about 2-3 times a month, very briefly. 

I've never fully gotten over B. She pops up in my dreams, and I still cry at old photos that come up in my memories. Some nights I stay up until odd hours, looking for a video I haven't seen, just to hear her voice. I seriously thought I would marry her. I'm full of anger for her, I feel betrayed and pissed on, but I know that A's influence can make a person forget who they are and do shitty things. 

I don't know if she still has feelings for me or not. It seems like she does, and there are multiple things she's done that make it seem like that, but when I've asked her straight out she always says no. 

I'm in pain and I need to know how to move on. 

Usually I would just cut her off, but when she does contact me it's because she needs talked off the edge, and I don't want to take away a safety net for someone who's suicidal. Her intentions aren't malicious. She has other friends, but she feels safer coming to me because I know more about her and her struggles. I would like to be friends with her again, but I don't know if the romantic feelings will ever subside. 

What do I do here??? This is a fucked up situation and I don't know how to proceed. Please help.",27Oct2020,1

346,"We were long distance, we talk very often and even jerk off together. Our relationship was that close...he always said no love from start and no giving each other false hope so we weren't in an official relationship but I told him everything and we did the jerk off together so it really felt like we were in a relationship...today he said he wants to block me for my own good and never talk to me again...he said he doesn't want me to think of him...and since it was long distance and we are in different countries, I only had his instagram and whatsapp but he deleted his instagram account permanently so basically if he blocks me on whatsapp he will disappear from my life completely with all traces gone and no way to contact him...I tried talking him out of it but it was of no use, I asked if we can say goodbye at night to accept it and process it and he said ok thankfully

I never knew how much he meant to be until this, I have been crying for almost an hour now and I haven't cried this hard since I was a child, not even when I was going through breakups with 2 ex boyfriends I met in real life or my best friend in real life when we broke up...

The reason for this ""break up"" is because he said that he feels guilty and bad when I message because for the past 1 week we have been fighting a lot...it was me who said a lot of hurtful things. His mom passed away a few years back when he was in the last year of university and he has not gotten a job and he has been depressed at home. I totally understand that and I feel him, it must be the hardest thing to go through. Me I moved out of my home a few months ago due to toxic and abusive parents and I have been completing my university (just finished) and working to support myself. He would ask me money to buy him skins on game and I gave in but I felt very used so I started an argument and I was an asshole because I was comparing myself to him. I said at least i behave like an adult when he told me to stop blaming him for me giving. The argument happened again this time it was about jerking off, he did not want to get into a relationship (I didn't ask directly but I inferred based on what he said, now i am wondering if I should ask directly...) so I did the comparison thing again where i said his life is simple his dad gives him money and he can play games (I was jealous but I sounded like I hated him) and jerk off with strangers but I want something serious and he is holding me back from finding it with other people

And the things I said really hurt him. I also blamed him for breaking me because when I opened up about my self harm and family issues when I first met him, he said I was doing it for attention and I am weak and that hurt me badly and made me very self conscious of who I say what to and I mentioned this to him last week even though it happened almost a year ago (and they weren't even his fault for saying those bcos he did not have a lot of family or friend interactions like that growing up so he didn't know what to say and ironically, what he said was the driving force that made me move and stop cutting because I wanted to prove him wrong- but I never recommend this method to anyone because I almost took my life because the pain was too much when I heard it so don't try this on anyone that is struggling). During the argument, I called him crazy and psycho as well because he wouldn't listen  to me and kept ignoring me and I regret this so much, I have a lot of growing to do too and I now realise that I can't undo the harms of my words. I feel awful about hurting him and I said those because I wanted a change and I didn't know how else to do it I know I have anger issues and communication issues I am trying to be more honest and clear in my thoughts and what I say everyday and working on those...

Is there anything I can say to save this relationship? Or have I really done too much damage that is irreversible? Please help...thanks...I can't stop crying and the crying is so intense...I feel awful and I think I actually really really need him, I have never cared about anyone this much since I was born, despite all the bads, he was the only one to listen to me through all my difficulties and we had a mental connection...what can I do now? :'(",27Oct2020,1

350,"I’m a 22 F, this is a 25 year old M. Is/was he stalking me? Is this something I should be concerned about? 

It’s 2:49 a.m, I haven’t slept for a day and so this may sound incoherent and annoying, as well as choppy because it’s sections from notes I’ve taken on my phone throughout. But here is the backstory: 

Basically, I was fostering a little animal, put him up in hoobly to find him a home. Some guy reached out, interested. We communicate back and forth and he asks me what cage I recommend and immediately buys it. By the way, I noticed throughout this that he was texting me kind of  flirtatiously, asking for my Snapchat to send future pictures of the animal, telling me his Instagram to “prove he was not a creep.” I was not sure why— as I the ad was anonymous, but I felt he may have picked up on the fact that I was young and simply had a gregarious personality. 

During the rehoming process, I also asked for proof that he had actually bought the animals future cage,  and he sent me a receipt. The receipt included his address. The next day, when I asked him if it had been delivered (amazon), he goes “it was delivered to my family who lives like fifteen  minutes away” (please keep this in mind). 

Later that day he came to pick up the animal and seemed attractive and nice! 

I texted him after he left to let me know if he needed any advice with them and to send me updates, and we began communicating frequently as well as following each other on social media. He keeps telling me to come visit the animal, so we decide to hangout. However, right before plans, he would always change them and try to insist we go to mine. It became a constant argument, because he seemed obsessed with the idea of going to my place. My place is tiny, his is huge with roommates and rooms. He always invited himself over as well. 

Eventually, I said fine, because at that point it felt like we were general friends not just pet owners. 

A few minutes before he actually came over to hangout, he tells me his roommate has COVID, and that he himself has tested negative (?).He also mentioned to me that his roommate hated the animal, was allergic, and wanted it given back to me, but that he had convinced the roommate to let him keep it. 

Anyway, he came over to my apartment, helped me with schoolwork, we hung out and it was fun. We flirted. He ended up staying the night on my couch. 

The next morning he was helping me with homework and all that and I take a shower for like 45 min. I cannot remember if my laptop was left open in the main area of my apartment. 

After I get ready and we talk about studying more and where we can go to find a place to study, he finally suggest his apartment— but was very hesitant about it.   on the way there I question him about his roommate having COVID, and he admits he lied and says he was worried he “would not have a good time” at my apartment, and needed a potential get out plan (was confused how this would work).

We go from my apartment to his apartment, and I notice it’s the same address as the receipt. This is weird to me, because he said that was his family’s address. His family, that he had mentioned to me while talking the night before, lives many, many states away from here in his hometown. 

About 30 minutes after going to his apartment, he, with fake shock, goes “oh I forgot my laptop at yours”— his reaction was blatanly fake. I knew he was lying. 

Another thing, my apartment is tiny. We also had spent 45 minutes making sure we had everything to go— because I had a lot of books and such I needed. He only brought one book, pencils, and his laptop— there is no way he could have accidentally forgotten it. 

He loitered for a while, seeming to suggest we go back to mine to get it? It was strange. Then he goes “it’s okay I do have a spare one,” and has a whole nother laptop?

We do schoolwork for like six hours, I meet his roommate and ask about the pet and his roommate never said anything about the pet and likes him, never asked for him to give the animal away? Later, he admitted to me that he was lying about the pet because for a second he wanted to give him back to me. I was so confused because he signed a contract stating he wanted to be his forever home, and bought him hundreds of dollars of toys and such. He told me it was a moment of panic and that he would never do that though, and I have noticed he loves animals. 

He was being extremely creepy and overbearing while I studied, constantly looking at me, I just felt smothered. 

At one point he gave me a couple of little gummy candies saying they were CBD or weed or whatever gummies, which they were, but I got so high when I asked him to make sure I wouldn’t, like I did not feel fully coherent. I had a horrible pounding headache and went home and it’s been 3 days and I still feel it and it’s awful. I don’t know if that showed him violate a boundary but it felt weird. 

I finally left to go and I get back to my apt. While there I go to my room and text him being like “damn I forgot my phone charger”. He immediately Ubers over and gets the charger and his laptop. I noticed the laptop was hidden beneath the couch cushion? I just don’t get how it would’ve gotten there. I thought nothing of it really, I actually thought it was sweet for him to come get the charger, and he left.

Over next few days he’s just texting me and calling me a ton even unanswered, assuming he’s coming over. I did like him at first so I flirted a little but I started to just feel weird about everything. I had the worst feeling in my head about him couldn’t get rid of it, something so anxious that I have NEVER felt before. He also would say things that made me cringe, “I can wait to watch you eat pasta” b/c we talked about going to eat together and like “I love watching you while I study” and I just think the word watching is so bizzare because who even thinks to use that word in that context I don’t know.

The next two days, he was pushy all over again about hanging out. He was also sending me a lot of memes that videos and being like “me as a dad”— and getting extremely panicked every time I didn’t text him. It was creeping me out. At one point, after hours of me not andwering, he was like “I’m not allowed to go home for thanksgiving.” He knows my family lives nearby, I don’t know if was inviting himself?

He constantly FaceTimed me even though I wouldn’t pick up, then would guilt me. At one point, I got a weird phone call from his number than directly back to mine. Weird alarm bells set off in my head. 

(Other shit;
• he’s told me he like gets revenge on everyone who’s wronged him, all his ex’s were evil— cheated on him with entire teams of athletes, etc.)

I told him I wanted to slow things down, to be normal and I didn’t want to see him everyday yet. He said he understood and I actually started to like him again thinking maybe he just really liked me. The thing is, it just did not feel that way. Minor things were setting off huge alarms, I felt and still feel so dramatic. 

I forgot to answer his text last night, and this morning, until the afternoon. When I tell him this he goes
“Hey bug. I ended up getting so tired from staying up that I smashed my head and ended up in the ER. I’m going to get some more sleep and text you after.”

I felt this was a lie, something about it felt like a lie, and for me it was enough. When I finally made it clear to him I did not want communication, he contacted me on all forms of social media constantly. He also began calling me incessantly. At one point, he had someone text me “(his name) says you can have the animal.”

I was not responding. 

I noticed that all of his calls would come up as my own number/contact, I would decline them and it would say six missed calls from (myself). I have a service that texts me whenever I get a voicemail, so I was receiving texts notifying me that a voicemail from him (his actual contact) had been sent to my number, however, my inbox was completely empty. 

He would also call me on *67, and I would unmask them with a service, and his number still showed up as mine?! I tested it with several other contacts, and this did not happen, their voicemails also were delivered to my phone. 

My best friend called me, and told me that halfway through, the ringing changed, and she was promoted with automated instruction to type the number she would like to leave the message to. 

A family member called me to test this, and noticed that the phone call started timing immediately (the timing starts when the call is picked up), even while it was still ringing.

I have a gut wrenching feeling constantly, and I don’t really know how this is possible. I’ve checked my phone for call forwarding and everything. Is this even possible?

He continued to contact me on all platforms 
Please help. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I genuinely believe he did something— but I just don’t understand how it would be possible? I feel watched all the time, but I don’t know why— I live in a secure apt building— but I am worried— could he have planted something in my apartment? Is that even possible? 

Sorry this is long and badly written, it is the middle of the night and I have been awake for days. I have never felt random stress like this in my life and there does not seem to be a reason for it. I’m a 22 year old female who lives alone in the middle of a city, I am getting behind on schoolwork because I am afraid but there doesn’t seem to be much of a reason for it. 

I cannot make the feeling go away, even though he has finally stopped trying to contact me on all social media. I feel weird and strange and deep anxiety and legit fear. I am not the type of person who thinks illogically like this and I have never felt this way. 

I’ve had crazy boyfriends and situations like that, but this deep panic I have felt since I met him is actually disturbing me. I feel I cannot think straight, it’s a deep gut feeling I cannot describe. I also cannot bring myself to do basic tasks it’s odd I have a sense of impeding doom and I don’t know if I’m imagining it.There is no solid evidence or anything big, but I feel frightened like I’ve never felt before. I don’t know why because this kid seems well adjusted and has friends and is in a great post grad program in a specific field (don’t want to name it) that requires a lot of intelligence. 

By the way, I ended it with him today. 

Are my fears justified? Is there a chance something is up or am I imagining it? 

I live alone in the middle of a city, my friends aren’t here because of the pandemic.

359,I have a problem where anytime I get confrontational with someone my throat closes up a bit and I feel sad. This is always stupid because I’m not actually upset in these situations and it also makes me look less stern and professional. Worst part is I’m a guy so I would rather be stern and assertive in confrontations instead of sounding emotional. I’m only 14 so will I grow out of this as I age or will it be with me for the rest of my life? Thank you,27Oct2020,1
360,"So I (19F) have just decided to drop out of my major (engineering) because I realized that this is not what I want to do with my life. I also am planning on (hopefully) transferring to another school that has a better program for the major I intend to transfer to. This major is entirely different than what I was previously working towards. All this, combined with the fact that my friends and I have somewhat plans to move in together and essentially start a new life of sorts.
I am unable to drop my current classes (engineering classes) due to me not being able to pay for the rest of the semester out of pocket. I feel a bit trapped, mainly cause all my resources and time have been dedicated to the engineering major, as I did not even plan for a change of major. 
Any advice on how to find a good art school, scholarships, or just in general what to do? I’m so genuinely lost because I don’t have a plan.
Also, does anyone have advice for applying to schools not in the country you live in? Or even finding study abroad programs. Any advice at all would help Thank you",27Oct2020,1
361,"So my parents live in the ‘hood, and they have neighbors that sell cocaine. There are multiple families living in this house and there are at lease 4 kids living there as well. I don’t live with my parents.

So my dad has been getting pretty fed up with their crap. Loud music all night long several days a week, trash in the yard, etc. Generally trashy POS type of people. He calls the cops on them when their music is too loud late at night but the cops don’t usually care. Just a couple days ago, he went over to them to ask them to throw their trash away because it’s all over their (the drug dealers’) yard. The person he was talking to was I think the main drug dealer’s girlfriend. My dad was probably a little insulting doing so but I wasn’t there. 

So my brother, who lives with my parents, talks to and sometimes will have a beer with the neighbors, god knows why. The drug dealer called my brother on the phone and said something along the lines of “if your dad does something like that again I might have to do something crazy”. Now this does not sit well with me at all, because I know these people are violent when necessary, have cartel connections, and I wouldn’t be surprised at all if they are involved with a few murders. 

I don’t know what to do. I want to confront the dealer and tell him he better not do anything crazy, but I don’t think that would actually be productive at all. I want to call the cops and tell them that they’re selling coke in that house around a bunch of kids, but I’m afraid they’d assume my parents made the call and retaliate in some awful way.

370,"I’m a F he’s a M-So I work at a deli called Wawa it’s an east coast chain. Well I work with this kid in the daytime who has a mental disability that isn’t very noticeable until you talk to him for about five minutes. His mom drank with him in her stomach and he came out a lil different. He’s a really cute, polite, and charming kid who does everything from making sandwiches all the way to cleaning our air vents. I’m In my 20s he’s in his 20s and I’ve been talking to him lately and he’s super nice and I just love it. He messes up words here and there and his memory isn’t the best but too me that stuff doesn’t really matter. I’m just in it for the heart, the true feeling. He has his own car, he lives at home with his mom, and he saves his money. His mental age is about 7 and he’s just a great person too everyone he greets. People know him and say subliminals too mess with him and it just doesn’t phase him whatsoever. He shrugs it off and laughs with them like whaaa, I find him truly amazing because of this as well. For instance, people will put their card in the chip reader and say “oh it’s probably going to get declined” he then would say “that’s why you should save your money” then they look at him like what haha I truly love it. He’s so confident in every situation and it just melts me. I see his challenges and he just glides over them with ease, as if nothing can bother him and I’ve seen some messed up things said too him. I plan on hanging out with him soon but some people aren’t so fond of me taking interest in a mentally disabled person, and that bothers me as well because they put him down so low in life. He’s a person too with feelings something we all have. My coworkers never talk to him they sing around him, he knows they sing too mess with him and he’s been putting up with it for years now. I just find him amazing, we never have real conversations that last more then five minutes but he try’s  and it just touches me like I’ve never been touched before.

My in-laws stress me out a bit because they are more traditional and will nitpick at things I do that aren’t feminine enough.  Like, my MIL will say that I shouldn’t cut my hair short because I look so much better with long hair, or she’ll try to convince me to dress nicer, etc.  It’s not necessarily said in a condescending way, and I genuinely don’t think my in-laws are trying to be hurtful or anything.  It’s just that these kinds of comments are normalized to them.  I have responded to them in a polite way that I don’t really believe these beliefs are necessary for me to follow, and I just want to be myself.  But they can’t seem to fathom why a woman wouldn’t want to “improve” her appearance.  They are generally nice people, they just give a lot of unwanted advice, I suppose.

373,"A bit of backstory. Growing up, I always thought I had a decent relationship with my Dad. He would get angry and aggressive with my sometimes, but overall I though we were okay. There was always arguments going on in the house, though. I mostly hid in my room and tried to block it out, and because of this I don't know exactly what went down (and it's also the route cause of my social ineptness seen as I was in my room 99% of my childhood). My Mum and Sisters tell me that he was abusive and incredibly aggressive and that he bullied my oldest sister. I do believe this to be true because he was incredibly narcissistic and aggressive, even with me, but it was much much worse for them, and he was even physically abusive. Pretty much everything from age 10 was a blur, the divorce, us moving houses, my Dad's few partners that he would often have round (he was cheating on my Mum too, according to her she found him on multiple dating sites. He denies this). Anyway, I was getting on fine with him and so were my sisters. During lockdown he phoned me regularly and we talked often. Everything was fine, until one day I receive a phone call in the middle of the night. He sounded completely deranged, talking about everything from aliens to God, just rambling on and on, and then suddenly I hear pounding at his door and an argument break out, the police were there. I was incredibly confused, I had no idea what was happening (I thought he might've been getting mugged) until he told me that the neighbours had phoned the police on him because he was acting erratic.

The next day, I receive another phone call. The ramblings had gotten worse, and it was at this point me and my sisters decided to drive up and see him. He seemed calm when we arrived, but something was definitely off about him. He wasn't acting normal. It's like he was on acid, or something similar to that. I thought he was taking drugs but he assured me he wasn't. This turned out to be false in the end, as we took him to the doctors and they said that he apparantly confessed to taking something called 'spice'. I honestly don't know much about it, other than it is really bad.

So, the doctors send him home, we go back home. The next day, it's the same again. This time his Mum is phoning us, telling us that he's acting erratic again. We go up, and the sight is honestly traumatising. He was naked, rambling on and on, shaking, just in general acting completely crazy, getting physical with me and my Uncle Billy who had came up to help him (I'm really skinny, he's taller than me and fucking massive). We get him to the doctors again and they refuse to take him in again. At first I was angry at this decision, until they spoke to my sister and basically told us that he was doing the entire thing for attention. I didn't believe it at first, but then looking back, the entire ordeal seemed very staged. Ties scattered across his couch, he was jumping quickly to OCD to a manic state to this illness to that illness. Looking back, I believed it at first because I was that scared, but it definitely does seem to be an act. And besides, this is something that he'd do. He has a history of stuff like this, faking illnesses and conditions for attention (he pretended to be a cocaine addict and he went to fucking cocaine anonymous. He's was never addicted to cocaine). On top of this, his sister also has a history of stuff like this. He's now diagnosed with bipolar and narcissistic personality disorder, which yes I do believe he has, but then he keeps blaming it on the medication he was prescribed for his depression on why he went into this ""manic state"". He completely denies taking any drugs even though the doctors found it in his system and he confessed to it. He completely denies the idea that he was even conscious at all during the whole ordeal. He's suddenly developed this ""stutter"" out of fucking nowhere, apparantly brought on by the medication, which is weird because it was nowhere to be found on the occasions we drove up to his house and he was coming off the stuff.

The thing is, I don't fucking believe him. I really don't. This is something he'd do. I tried speaking to him, but it's incredibly difficult. He was just so pushy, trying to get me to come up to see him, talking about how we can smoke weed together with my Cousin (who is currently watching over him), and it was just too much. I cut off contact with him. So now I'm being guilted by his family. He keeps finding me on social media (like my instagram, I have no clue how he got it, it doesn't have my name on it and my profile picture doesn't include my face), his relatives keep messaging me on facebook (I've had to block them all), it's too much. I don't want anything to do with him, and they're making me feel bad because I need a bit of space because he genuinely traumatised me. And not only that, but he's made me ponder on my past, and a lot of stuff has been coming up. Like how he constantly ranted to me when I was like fucking 12 years old about how ""evil"" my Sisters and Mum are for ""abandoning him"" (YOU WERE ABUSIVE), among other hateful things about my own family. He was trying to make me take his side and it was making me lose my fucking mind. I don't want to pick any side, I just want to exist normally and be happy. It just makes me think that he only sees me as a mini version of him that he can project onto and manipulate, that's all I ever was to him. When I pulled him up about all the manipulation, he said ""oh yeah, thanks for that by the way"". Not sorry. Thanks. I haven't spoken to him ever since that, really, apart from a few awkward phone calls that I had to cut short because I didn't want to speak to him.

So TL;DR my mentally ill Dad is trying to reconnect and I don't want to reconnect and his family keep trying to guilt me into seeing him. What do?",27Oct2020,1
374,"A friend of mine is in serious danger and we need your help. Please read till the end. And suggest some plans.

Trigger Warning - Domestic Violence

My friend (Female - 20) is being abused by her father who has Schizophrenia. It started way back when she was 13. Due to some petty reason, he started beating her in a fit of rage and it was so bad that she sustained multiple injuries and could have died. She is not the only one suffering from this. It's her mother too.

Her father was diagnosed with Schizophrenia a couple of years back and then her family found out the reason behind all the violence. They started giving him medicine from time to time, and the situation improved a little. But it is still bad. There are frequent occasions of domestic violence and it is bad.

It is affecting her mental health a lot. She tried convincing her mother to file an FIR against the father but unfortunately her mother is reluctant. For easy conversation, let's call my friend Karol and her mother Jess. 

Karol needs to leave the place because she's very certain that she'll get murdered by her own father. The violence is increasing again and she's getting more and more paranoid. It's affecting her health, her sleep and her academics. She wants to leave but she doesn't want to leave her mother alone in that scary place... Alone with her father. Anything might happen.

And if both Karol and Jess leave together, her father may wreak havoc on their neighbours. Maybe that is one of the reasons Jess won't leave. Because they have relatives living nearby and stuff.

They talked about this matter with relatives too. And they went to confront about this matter with her father. And he's so good at acting. He pretends like he understood everything and it was a misunderstanding. Just after the relatives leave, he pretends to be normal and waits till 11/11:30pm before starting his violence again. It's so messed up.

According to us, the best solution is to get some professional help by calling a helpline number or something. But we just want to ensure two things. One, that both Karol and Jess get out of that place and don't have to stay with the man. It's very dangerous. Two, that he doesn't come back to their life. He is so gooood at acting, he always escapes treatment. The thing with Schizophrenics is that they're super good with acting and pretending. They think that nothing is wrong with them and deny any such allegation. We fear that he might pretend to be normal and then come back to his normal violent self.

Please help her out. It's getting so serious. She's getting more and more paranoid by the day. We need to get her out with a proper plan in 1-2 days. She feels like she could get murdered very soon.

She has even tried to commit suicide once. And it's a recurring thought in her mind. I just wish we could help her - you and I.",27Oct2020,1
375,"Hello everyone. I’m writing this at almost 3 am because I can’t keep it in my mind anymore or else it’ll drive me crazier than it already has. Sorry for such a long post. 

 TW in this entire post here for family issues, anxiety, depression, abuse, alcoholism

I’m a fifteen-year-old sophomore right now. Everything was pretty fine until 8th grade rolled around. By fine I mean I had friends and a decent social standing, not a lot of drama, not a lot of anything, and I was fine with that. Since my father being cut out of my life due to choosing to believe his girlfriend over his daughter (his girlfriend was actively threatening me and making me feel awful, we drew the line when she threatened to lock me in a closet,) I had been struggling with depression. I’d been sent to a mental institution in sixth grade but it ended up making it worse. Fall is particularly bad for me despite being my favorite season. 
Spring of sixth grade is where everything went downhill. My house flooded. We lost so much and our life was just torn apart. 
My mother had always drank alcohol, but on weekends or special occasions. She had said and done some things to make me distrust her (ex: shooting a gun into the floor right outside my door and starting a fire in our backyard at like 2 am when she was piss drunk and setting fireworks in the fire). I’ve always seen her as irrational and kind of crazy. 
Somewhere around there, I hurt my friend we’ll call G. I was so overridden with emotion and scared to lose my best friend, J, that I became a jealous asshole. I was scared to be alone. J was all I had, and I thought G was taking her away from me. I messed up. I tried to make up but didn’t know how. I felt awful. I wasn’t able to reconnect with G, but J and I stayed pretty close, I think. 

My mother’s alcohol consumption went up as time passed. It got so much worse after the first flood.
Seventh grade rolls around- Nothing much happens in my social group except I notice I’m not hanging out with people as much anymore and I’m excluded from J’s newer bigger friend group. I sat with them at lunch, but they would hang out all the time after school and I was never invited (i thought asking would be rude, so i didn’t.) Everything was pretty okay. My mother’s drinking got worse, but I was able to (for the most part) hide it. There was drama, but I can’t really remember a lot of it. I stopped taking the bus to school because I was scared of the people there. 
Eighth grade. The thing that hurts me the most.
This is where shit hits the fan. 
My mother’s drinking got worse. Sometimes I’d end up skipping school because she was too hungover to drive, or was sleeping too heavily. When I did manage to convince her to drive, she’d speed angrily and yell “I THOUGHT THIS WAS WHAT YOU WANTED?” I was terrified when she did that. I tried to keep it to a minimum. 
Eventually, one night, she told me that if I couldn’t agree with her decisions I should just get out of the house. She took my phone so I couldn’t “whine to people for help” and sent me into the cold. The same night she made my grandparents take me back to the house because “I didn’t actually mean it” (which doesn’t help). 
I closed myself off more. Social lines were already blurry to begin with. This just made it 100x worse. I couldn’t (and still can’t) tell if someone was laughing with me or at me, so I’d just push them away with a snarky comment. I thought people were laughing at me. I thought people hated me. I thought I wasn’t good enough for anyone. I thought people were judging me, so I judged them. I thought people were being mean to me, so I was mean to them. I never bullied anyone, I don’t think. I wouldn’t go out of my way to hurt anyone, because people had done that to me before and I wasn’t going to replicate it. Social situations became hell. I ended up being that awkward mean kid that you wouldn’t want to talk to. I did have a few friends, including J (although we were significantly less close,) and I tried to keep it that way. I loved my friends. I sucked at keeping it that way. 
One of these friends we’ll call C. C is a super blunt but super caring and amazing person that I met in 7th grade. I liked C. She was an amazing friend to me. She helped me when I needed help, she made me laugh, and she hugged me when I was hurting the most. 
I hadn’t been hugged like that in years. 
I yearned for that kind of understanding and validation; however, like always, I managed to fuck it up.
I was with her and another friend on a writing project. I publicly criticized C’s writing style on an online app using her actual name. She, rightfully, called me out on it. She dealt with it wonderfully. I applaud her for staying so civil when I was treating her so badly. 
I had a crush on C. Or, at least, I thought I did. I saw her as an escape of sorts, like someone that distracted me from how much I was hurting. I didn’t know how to handle that emotion on top of everything else, so I did the only thing I knew how to do. I lashed out at her.
Eighth grade ends. Freshman year. I see a lot of the same people in my classes from previous grades, including C, J, and G. Everything was fine pretty much. Most of my mother’s worst moments were over because she wouldn’t drink with her parents in the house. We moved houses to live with my grandmother and grandfather. There was some drama, but nothing extraordinary. I grew more and more distant from everyone. I was just another person at the lunch table.
Until I wasn’t. 
One day, without warning, J and the entire friend group moved to an entirely different table with no room for me. The people at the table I was sitting at laughed and called me an, and I quote, “depressed fuck.” I became even more distant and fairly quiet. I don’t think I was too bad of a person that year as I was in 8th grade, but I still became snarky and upset sometimes. 
I didn’t think I fit in anywhere else, so I sat in the bathroom stall at lunch until I finally became so tired of every aspect of existence that I managed to convince my mother (with the school counselors help) to let me try the online program. 
I transferred out and have not walked back into that high school for the last two semesters. 
Now I’m in therapy for PTSD (previously was in it for depression) and beginning on working through everything. But I can’t get over how awful of a person I was.
I was such a bad friend to all of them. I still can’t tell what people mean, but at least I can restrain myself now.
Is it too late to change?
I don’t want to hurt anyone anymore.
I don’t want to ruin anything else with my friends.
I think I’m making progress, but I’m so scared I’m not able to and that I’ll just be a bad person forever.

Is it too late?",27Oct2020,1
376,"I dont know of this is a big deal but i A close friend of mine is getting married early next year and has asked me to be one of her bridesmaid. I am really happy as i have never been a brides maid before and was excited for her wedding. She wants all of her brides maid to look amd dress nice for her wedding and have asked us if we could. Both of us come from indian backgrounds so traditional clothings are worn during ceremonies like this. I dont attend indian ceremonies that often so i dont have much nicer ones for close relatives or friends, like this situation. So i decided to buy them online. The ones that i liked were not so grand but in trend and within reasonable price. I like to ask for my mums opinion as i am not good at picking at clothes. Just recently, i was showing her some of the clothes online which i liked and asked for her opinion. She instead told me i could wear some of my old ones and save the grand clothings for a close relatives wedding. She has mentioned this several times and i have said that i am also one of my friends brides maid and the least i could do is dress nicely for her wedding.This what got me upset and just walked away from here.  I dont get how my mums thinking. Its not like the clothes i suggested are so grand that it would out shine the bride nor was it expensive. I dont mind spending that money because i know  i have the budget for it and i am paying for it. I cant still wear them for other close family occassions.If i was just attending as normal guest, i wouldnt have mind wearing the current ones. But i am also one of the brides maid. I should have atleast dress up properly. She has done this several times before and has voiced out something in the lines of ""oh please tell your friend to make us spend so much for her wedding"".

377,"A few months ago, I had a sudden personality shift. It’s like it happened overnight. I noticed I lacked empathy for people like used to. I’ve had crippling anxiety and depression in the past, but took meds for it and learned to self-regulate so I could get off the meds (it caused weight gain.) after that, I’ve been going through life like normal, but with little anxiety or depression. It’s been almost a year since I got off meds.
Again, a few months ago, my personality changed and I noticed immediately. My whole personality didn’t change; some parts stayed the same. But the part of me that was once overflowing with empathy for others is now stone cold. I’m way more argumentative and have very little empathy for people, even people with mental health problems. If someone tells me they’re anxious or depressed about something my first thoughts are “so? Get over it.” I immediately catch myself thinking those things, even though I mean what I think. I’m ashamed to have a lack of empathy when I used to be a very warm and empathetic person, but I can’t stop it, and I don’t want it to be like this anymore.
I hate that I argue so much with people even on the slightest disagreements and have little empathy.
Is there any way I can revert back to the way I was? I don’t want to go through like hating people. And could being off the meds for a long time have any effect on my sudden personality change? Any advice appreciated.

Can anyone please give me advice on either how to deal with this sadness / anger I’m feeling. Or give me advice on what I should do with this girl.  Keep in mind me and my friends hang out with her and her friends. It our friend group sort of thing. Help me please",27Oct2020,1
379,"After years, I finally began therapy for PTSD, depression, anxiety and BPD. It seems well and whatnot, but I cannot be honest of how I feel.

A little bit of background: 

Growing up, my home and environment was not a stable place. As a form of survival, I’ve learned to appeal to adults and people with authority. Either through flattery, falsifying things and etc. just to not get smacked, hurt or etc. I’ve learned what to say and when to say it to please other people. Even with my parents, I either stay quiet (even at 7 y.o) or flatter and please them. 

Now, during therapy, I’m told and asked certain prompts to imagine things (I.e: my younger self). Continuously, my therapist tells me to forgive. At first, I was honest and told them how I felt about my younger self. But, as she proceeded to attempt to make me understand, more questions came and self hate arrived. Normally, people would voice those out. But by instincts, I replied with “I understand. You’re right.”

I cannot bring up topics in present form and be honest. I physically can’t. I feel sick and uneasy. The things I want to be honest about atm won’t come out of my mouth. I either say, “eh or meh or I’m neutral towards it” if Im unable to lie about how I fee. If they ask me a very subjective question, I answer things that I know would please my therapist. It’s an automatic response. Of course, I have severe dark thoughts but I cannot be honest with my therapist. I unconsciously lie or attempt to appeal to them. 

In these scenarios, what do I do? Therapy is expensive, but I’m afraid there won’t be progress.",27Oct2020,1

381,"So, i (M,22) met this girl (F, 23) like an year and half ago and we became close friend and kinda tried long distance dating and stuff well to put in short, we spend time

Now back few months ago she got a little agitated when i chose to be in a VC with another girl (she later said it was her anxiety) this detail is important 

Now currently, I have her only as a regular friend and she have her another squad so whenever we play, she decides to join her other friends on vc, which you see i wouldn't even have thought but how she reacted at time I'm wondering

If you are dating someone or potential interest is it common that you leave them alone on vc but still play but join your other squad which already have company ?

383,"i guess you could say i kinda had a glow up in the beginning of this year because I took off my braces and bought contact lenses... nothing too special. Initially, it was nice when people started complimenting me for my looks, because I was always quite insecure about it previously, but as the months pass by, I’m starting to feel sadder and sadder over it because I feel as if people don’t see much value in me other than than that. I get compliments almost everyday for my looks. I know most of my friends don’t care too much about how I look, but I have a few friends in particular whose compliments are ONLY about how I look. One friend in particular seems to brush off everything else - for example, when I post my violin playing, soccer practices etc, she just comments on everything else (eg the funny background noises) except for the thing I’m the most proud of. And it really upsets me. Today, what another friend said really hurt me even though I don’t even think she really meant it. I was sitting alone when I saw some of my other classmates. I said hi and talked to them for a while, and as they were leaving, she said “Let’s bring (my name) along. She’s so hot.” - as if I were some kind of accessory. While this year people who have gotten to know me also tell me that I’m an interesting person, I can’t help but wonder whether it’s simply because they expect me to be some ditzy girl and when I say anything remotely intelligent, become super confused.

It has also started to make me really wary of straight guys because I just feel as if they only care about how I look. I’ve become really skeptical of romance which makes me really sad because I don’t want to feel this way.  

I feel very worthless because it seems as if the only value society has deemed me to have is how I look. Am I overthinking things? And should I tell my friends that I feel this way? One of the reasons I haven’t is because I don’t want to come across as boasting (especially because I know one of them is insecure over this). That’s why I’ve come to reddit, talking to strangers, to whom I have no reason to boast.",27Oct2020,1

College student here. I feel like I’m lacking in all aspects of my life and I don’t have anyone to talk to. I’m not sure what to do. I have a part time extended internship that is going south (bullshit excel work and poor training; nowhere close to data analytics which is what I want to do in the future). I’m also debt free because I have a full tuition scholarship but I’m attending a no name college. College, work, and home balance is unmanageable despite doing part time for school. My research advisor is pretty toxic: every time he makes it seem like I’m inadequate. Doesn’t pass on any knowledge. I’m also starting to question whether my degree will be good for anything during the poor job market (I study applied math). I don’t want to go to college immediately, wanna work a little, but I don’t know if this is possible. My family won’t understand, and they won’t listen to me. They kind of have their own agenda and I feel like my feelings don’t matter. I don’t feel respected by anyone. I don’t want to talk to some of my close friends either because I feel like I’m showing my weak colors. Maybe I’m going through an alpha contest? idk. In the past I’ve learned that people move away from you if you complain too much. I don’t really have friends where I could express how I truly feel, just brag and “what are up to.” Kinda feel like everyone expects a positive response. I feel like I’m lacking behind my peers too: when I look at their LinkedIns I just feel like I’m not good enough and that something is wrong with me... that I missed out on so many opportunities.

386,"Hi there, I’m on mobile so sorry for the weird formatting. Also, English is not my first language, so please excuse me for any mistake. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for more than 3 years, so I’ve known his sister M(F21 like me) for quite some time. She started a relationship with this guys C (M20) 2,5 years and everything seemed normal for the first year. 
She has always been very clever and studies focused, she’s a  brilliant foreign languages student (like me, relevant later). He works in IT, very focused on his career since he left his parents job to pursue his dream of leaving home. 
They see each other every weekend and every Wednesday, one week at her house and one at his, so every other week I see them together, and I’ve started to notice some worrying things. 

He constantly belittles her, saying “you’re stupid/what the fuck are you talking about/shut up/you don’t know”, but never when her parents are around them. My boyfriend and M’ family are immigrants, and he’s said before that they are not real Italian like us since they were born somewhere else (wtf man). 
A few days ago I talked with my BF about her and he said since Rona she hasn’t seen anyone, even when the lockdown was lifted, except for her boyfriend. When they are together they do nothing but stay at home and stay in bed to watch Netflix, even if they’re invited to go out (her friends confirmed). 
She has stopped to go the gym with us, giving us the excuse that “C doesn’t like that gym” (totally normal place, we all go there), she has stopped going to uni and follows only online lessons even though she could so some days a week, even just to catch up with friends. 
She also studies less, and he pushes to do so because “I’m here and you should pay attention to me” (even though languages require every day exercises). 
She was planning to go to Japan before to see a friend and work there (a perfect occasion for a Japanese student) but she has been hinting she’s not going anymore. 

Yesterday I talked to her friends in private, telling them I was worried about her and her future, I thought he was sabotaging her. They confirmed everything I thought and added a few more worrying stuff:
- he reads her messages and listens to the voice messages they send her, and sometimes answers for her (also with her brother). 
- she stopped taking the pill because he was anxious about it. 
- they are thinking about marriage (unusual at this age here) and started searching for rings, set an ideal date and even chose the first born name (she never talked about marriage before). 
- she doesn’t want to continue her studies because she wants to go live with him. 
- no one actually likes him. 

We think we have to talk to her, but we don’t know how, how to approach this without having her run from us and seek even more his attention and his time. I’m seriously concerned this relationship will lead her to take wrong decision that will impact her future in a negative way. I’m not against relationships, marriage or kids, I’m only worried he’s pushing her to break every connection she has with her loved ones to isolate her. 
Any advice on how to talk to her, previous experiences, advice of any type? Everything helps, even a “you’re wrong this is normal”, I’ll take in consideration everything. Thank you!",27Oct2020,1

391,"I’m 15 (gay) from the UK. There’s this boy in my drama that’s bi (not entirely out though) and due to us being in year group halves (basically, half the Year is in one half A, the other B, and we don’t mix unless certain subjects) so I haven’t really spoken to him. We do drama shows together, but not necessarily one on one, we haven’t really got to known each other. Well, it was I think 2 weeks ago he asked me first, he gave me a note (this was Period 4 so leading onto Lunch) and said don’t read it until after the lunch had ended ( I think that was 1:30 lunch ended). So I waited, talking with my friends and one of them (who is also in my drama class) told me *Boy* gave me a note and I should read it. So I did, I pulled out the note and read it to myself. It read, “hey, ring me sometime *phone number* - *Boy* xx”. I felt strange, I’ve never had a bf before, I came out in Year 7/8, and knew he hadn’t either. I didn’t show them the note and said it was something to do with drama, and we carried on the other conversation, something about sixth form. That night I text him and we talked for a bit, but I never openly declined the request of a relationship. He recommended we spoke at lunch and I agreed. 

//Next Day

It was lunch and he came up to my table, me with around 5 other people (dw, we are in a “year group bubble”). Beforehand I’d told a couple of people what was happening, so I got up and walked with him, hearing whispering behind me. I felt so rude, I tried to keep it quiet and I know he didn’t want that. We walked around the corner and talked for a bit, before he asked “so you want to be my boyfriend then”. I said, “no, sorry”. I felt so horrible. His face dropped a little, but he smiled and said okay, before walking in different directions. I sat myself back down with my friends and told them what had happened. We didn’t talk much on Snapchat after that. 

//FF 2 weeks

It was last Friday, and my school was holding a fundraiser so we were in our own clothes. He came up to our table again and said, “I know your not interested, but would you like to go out sometime”, and I said “hey, im not one to hang out, but we can still talk?”. He smiled lightly and walked off.

Currently I rent a flat ~40 miles away from friends and family, but my sibling is close by. I’m working from home until at least March due to the pandemic. My current flat is a bit of a sh*thole as nothing gets fixed so I definitely want to leave. 

I can either move back in with my parents and use my old bedroom and their spare room as my space or rent a new flat. 

I’m pretty torn on what to do and moving back with parents has benefits (save money, company, would be with people if another lockdown happened, would be close to home friends) but I also generally enjoy living alone as it’s a better work environment and I do like where I live. 

Either option would be moving for ~6 months as I’m looking to move jobs (and probably job location) within the next 6m-1y so I can’t really do a half and half.

Now it's been 2 years and I feel way less and Idk if this is how everyone feels once the honeymoon stage is over? . I rarely miss him anymore even though we are often apart for weeks due to repeated lockdowns to slow COVID19. When we first met, even being apart for a few hours made me ache for his presence. A year ago I still felt like this when I couldn't see him for a day or 2. Maybe I just got used to not seeing him for weeks at a time thanks to lockdowns? I rarely want to make out or have sex anymore, it feels like an effort.

411,"
I have two beautiful cats, Z and P. Allow me to explain a situation that occurred earlier this year to explain my concerns.

Back in February, Z began developing sores on his lip and I took him to the vet, who gave him an injection for it. I was told I need to come back and get this injection every few months for him to prevent the sores from returning. A few weeks later, I noticed he was struggling in his litter box, revisiting it to do small pees every few minutes, and peeing all over the house. I took him to the vet, and they want to do loads tests, including a urine sample which was very painful for him to go through. They told me while I await results, he needed to change his diet instantly to a dry food only diet of a particular food intended for urinary issues, which only the vet sold, and it was extremely expensive. After all the rounds of tests, they tell me to continue feeding the special dry food and give me a daily pill for him to treat his bladder issues.

A few weeks later, I return for him to have his top up injection, but it’s out of stock, they give me some pills to give him once every few days instead. They also don’t have the medication for his bladder and at this point I am freaking out because I don’t want him to start experiencing the pain and difficulty again. The vet casually tells me that it’s okay, I don’t need the bladder medication because his issues were actually a side effect of this injection all along. That these new pills shouldn’t give him bladder issues anymore, and at some point we can try tapering the doses of the pills to see if he’s okay on his own. Lo and behold, he was fine without his bladder medication. And after a few weeks of taking these pills, I began spacing the days apart more and more, his sores didn’t return. He’s been off them completely for months now with no sores returning. I also stopped feeding him the expensive dry food and added wet food back into his diet, and since then he has been doing brilliantly. Honestly I was furious, I felt like I was taken for an absolute ride and that they traumatised my cat in the process. He would get scared every time I was getting ready to leave the house because he thought I was taking him to the vet, and he was completely withdrawn for months after all the tests.

Now I took my second cat, P, in to be neutered. I bring him in first thing in the morning, and by afternoon I do not get a phone call I was expecting to bring him home, so I call them myself. Turns out they decided not to do his surgery because he had a fever, I was furious that nobody bothered to call me. They decided to keep him overnight to make sure he’s okay.
The next day, I meet the vet and they tell me they want to run a bunch of tests to rule out what this fever could be from. They say it could be stress related but they just want to make sure he’s not very sick. I know my cat, he gets stressed and upset very easily. I haven’t noticed anything different in his behaviour to indicate that he’s sick prior to the visit. I pay for tests, which comes back showing nothing. Then they tell me that they want to conduct other tests now. At this point, I don’t know what to believe. After the situation with Z, I am worried they’re just making shit up to make money out of me. On the other hand, if there’s something wrong with my cat then I need to get to the bottom of it. I’m just so confused and don’t know what to do or if I’m being crazy for believing my vet doesn’t have my pets best interest at heart.",27Oct2020,1

Before covid-19 he would always sit next to me in class and ALWAYS interrupt me even if he knew i had headphones in, was watching a movie, or was doing work(who tf does that😐 if you’re guilty of this, please stop) but anyways, I learned to get over it as he has some mental issues and sort of depends on me to hangout with him and be friends with him. recently i learned he was mentally and physically abusive with his ex’s and cheated on most of them but will always deny it if it’s brought up(i have proof because i’m really close with one of his ex’s.) he asks me to hangout every week and begs me when i say no or have other plans and honestly it’s really getting old. idk if i should stay friends with him till maybe he finds new friends and doesn’t need me or if i should just cut him off completely but i have no idea how to do that and i have no idea what his reaction would be",27Oct2020,1
416,"Bit of backstory:
My (now ex) bf and I had a bit of an age gap (9 years). We met through sports and spend some time with each other before we confessed put feelings and everything was just great. A few months later a began to notice that he has a hard time making decisions and outsources that task to me like 99% of the time. We talked about this, that I feel uncomfortable with making all the decisions and that we have to work as a team. He promised to try harder and make more decisions on his own. Then Corona happened. It was a long distance relationship so we haven't seen each other for quite a while but spent time together by playing video games, having phone calls etc.
I am an university student and I struggled so much with all the online learning and told my bf that I have a hard time studying for the exams. He said that he is worried that I will have to drop out of university because of that. I replied that I don't feel like this is an okay thing to say and instead of reinforcing my own fears I wish that he would encourage me to carry on. And that was kinda the starting point of the entire disaster. I got diagnosed with a mental illness and had some other physical health issues. When I once again told him I am not feeling too well, because of all my health problems he said I was a group project for half a hospital. 
I know that what he did was not intentional but he just tried to be funny, however, this had hurt me. I called him a few weeks later after this incident and told him that what he did hurt me and I feel like I can't talk about serious or sensitive topics with him because he makes fun out of me. Shortly after that he asked when we can see each other again and we agreed on last weekend (23rd October to 25th October). Between the phone call and our last meeting almost a month passed and during that month I felt uncomfortable writing with him and constantly thought about what I should tell him or not. 

So I decided to break up with him and I feel like the worst person ever to walk the surface of the earth and I kinda want to turn back time. None of my breakups has ever been that bad and I really want to go back to him. It feels like the worst mistake I have ever made in my entire life. He was a good and kind lad, just not the smartest guy on earth sometimes. I kinda want to call him and tell him that this breakup was a terrible idea and that I want to be with him again. I blame myself and my mental illness for that. I feel terrible. I know my family will ask why and I certainly won't tell them about that it has to do with my mental health because they have lots of prejudice about this topic. I meant the world to him and most of the time he took great care of me. Any idea on what I can do to feel better or at least not guilty?",27Oct2020,1

418,"During my years in college I became friends with my now best friend. We came from two very different walks of life but after college we decided we wanted to stay in each other’s lives so she became my roommate. But now she needs advice on a situation. I would really like to hear everyone’s opinion because I have no clue what to say to her now. So about 5 years ago her aunt got Married to a guy who had 2 sons in his previous marriage. So she never grew up with them nor did she have any kind of family relationship with them. She didn’t consider them family to her because there was no blood relation and they never spoke to her aunts side family, there was always problems with their biological  mom so there was a lot of family tension. However a few years had past,  she got really close to one of the sons and they both developed feelings for one another. Both her aunt and the boys dad accepted the relationship because their was no blood relation and they practically were strangers for years. Fast forward to 2 years after dating, they both went their separate ways but now she’s feeling ashamed and guilty. She feels like she made the wrong decision in ever being involved with him and she feels like if people ever found out that they’ll talk about her. She’s also Afraid that if her brother of relatives find out they dated that she’ll be disowned. After speaking to her I could see that she knew she probably made a mistake but she can’t get over the guilt. I personally told her that because there was no blood relation that I don’t think it’ll be a problem, also they broke up so it’s done and in the past and I told her to not harp on it. But she thinks I’m just being nice to her. Can someone give me advice on what you would say to her? Or what do you think about this situation ?? Also she feels like if her next bf asks her about her past relationship that she’ll feel ashamed to say something.",27Oct2020,1
419,"So the other might I had some really dark thoughts in my room because I'm constantly being told I'm narcissistic and self serving. I want to go into the esports world, whether that be with video production, the business side of things, and creating graphics for orgs. The main goal I have is becoming a professional esports athlete. I have spoken to many coaches about this and they have all told me a certain way I should be going about this, as it worked for them.

I tell my mother this and try to get into a healthy conversation about my future, but all she wants to do is attack me and tell me I'm narcissistic and that I am not going about this as I should be. Now I ask, should I believe the person who literally works in that field ay this very moment, or believe someone who hasn't even researched the industry.

I have stated multiple times that I need to focus on me at the moment and nobody else. The next few years of my life is what will define my future and if I want this career I need no distractions and all the time possible. I tell her that 2 hours at the computer a day to study this and practice is going to be a minimum, as many of the professionals practice for 5+ hours a day. 

She does not like this whatsoever and no matter how much I show that it helps, she thinks that anything over 2 hours is way too much and that I'm being ridiculous if I think otherwise. I know she is my mother and she wants the best for me, but the way she is going about this is not keeping me mentally sound.

The main reason she diesnt want me on the computer for more than 2 hours a day, is because of god. She wants me to put my whole life towards a god that I dont even believe in. She has been shoving it down my throat since I was in 7th grade and now I'm in 11th. The past 4 years have been extremely mentally draining trying to put on the mask of a believer just so I can skate by and not have my future completely ripped out of my hands. Its gotten to the point where I am beginning to think suicidal thoughts and that's scaring the fuck out of me.

I posted something on twitter that got the attention of my school counselor and she is telling me that she is legally required to tell my parents about what they saw just to make sure I'm being supported at home. I conpletley understand this. When my mother finds out all of this, she will say that some demon has attached to me and that I will need to pray about it to get the demon off of me. And this is where I'm stuck. I dont know how to tell her that it's not a demon talking, it's just her and I. I dint know how to tell her that it wont work because I dont believe it to be true.

How do I tell my mother i don't believe in god?

I don’t have enough money to stop working and retire now but I am not living paycheck to paycheck by any means. I get it that I am very fortunate and money is not my issue.

434,"Context : So this girl (let's call her F) and I (both 21F) have been friends for about 6 years. We were inseparable during high school but went to different universities and drifted apart during the last two years. She goes to a very demanding school and is always struggling to find a good school/ life balance (which she openly admits herself). I was always understanding of this since I care about my schooling very much too , always engage in extracurricular activities, get very good grades as well as a scholarship. I always texted her to check in during her exam time, drove over to the next city to bring her an ""exam care package"" with snacks, coffee and school supplies and understood if she had to postpone plans. I even voiced my opinion that we were drifting apart many many times, told her how much our friendship meant to me and found some ways for us to hang out more. But it never worked out for longterm and since last year I stopped trying as much.

Last year she found a guy she really cared about and they have been together for a little more than a year now.  I talked to him a few times before they got together but wasn't that impressed by him because he always tried to explain to me how ""a woman needs to listen to her man"" or some other sexist shit. I ignored this thinking maybe he changed, matured, but lately I realised how much F has changed since being with him.

When F and I met, we were both very naive, kind teens not ready for the world around us, of course we matured and toughened up in the last 6 years, but F was always that  nice, kind, supportive friend, always happy to help, always talking about feminism, tolerance, giving everyone equal chances and rights. She was so passionate about her school and future work, wanting to help people and basically change the world. 

During this year suddenly she was bothered by the immigrants in our country, basically saying they weren't welcome, they were dangerous and why don't they move away. Then she spoke against LGBT rights, even though she was always a supporter. Then she suddenly started saying that she wouldn't be bothered to be a stay-at-home mom while her husband worked. She stopped hanging out with her friends as much, going out and basically hasn't introduced her boyfriend to us in more than a year that they've been together. He has even told her once that he thinks that we aren't that good of friends. I've even spoken to out mutual friend about this and she also said that these changes are due to her very traditional, kinda sexist boyfriend.

I am really worried about her, that she is losing herself but don't know how to approach her because I'm afraid of losing even the remnants of the friendship that we have left.

My question is basically - do I even have the right to meddle like this in her life? And if I do, how do I gently tell her that she is changing everything about her without hurting her?",27Oct2020,1

437,"Hi, long post ahead, just need to let some things out and any advice at all is greatly appreciated, thank you for reading, F19

So I moved to a small town a year ago, new country so I didn't know anyone and only knew basics of spanish, been living on the island for 6 years but was always really isolated and socially anxious. I finally started meeting a few people last year, I made one friend in town who is a really sweet guy, we started going out this spring and he's like the former class president, studying engineering, super smart, good family, good reputation and wonderful personality. 

He knows about my past, my mother died when I was 17, always been very isolated, some drug and alcohol abuse in past and self harm. He's been helping me get over these things and I'm a much better person than before but I'm still really alone. 
This year I've gotten my spanish to a point where I can comunicate well with locals and people my age, however around new people, especially when talking in a different language I completely close up. I can't respond well or just become really awkward. I talked to a few of my boyfriends friends who are all also very well put together, kind people but I have been unable to really connect with them, and on my own I made one semi-friend, David M20(not his real name), who is more like me, comes from slightly dark past before but is one of the kindest, most thoughtful people I know, however he is always a bit awkward around people, we have met up a few times at the beginning of summer and things went well but it was awkward, and we haven't really met up since. He is the kind of person who lives life to the fullest but always remains responsible and in control of himself and the situation, and has a very mature outlook on his lifestyle. 

Last week I made a new friend, she is a few years younger than me, F17 but she's very much over the edge, horrible past experiences and drug and alcohol abuse on the daily, she has said she used to know my other friend David, as they were in similar groups, and I've met up with her a few times now, but each time she offers weed which in my opinion is alright, but then harder drugs as well, which I don't want to mix with anymore. I can't tell my boyfriend this because he thinks I'm doing well and staying on the right path, but she is a really good girl and I'd love to help her but I don't think I can. She seems really isolated in the town as well, and I'd like to be her friend, somewhat because I just want to have someone I can hang out with, to know someone other than my boyfriend, and partly because I think she is a good person, just slipping from her path.

If I were a stronger person I could be dealing with this better, but given the option, I know that if I start mentally slipping I will take harder substances again, it only takes a small slip up. 

I'm thinking of asking David for an opinion as he probably knows more about her than I do, and I don't want to risk my health again if I do hang out with her, having just quit smoking a few months ago it's all quite chaotic and pulling me apart a bit. 
I don't think I can talk to my boyfriend about this as he never has experienced addiction or I think he might just end up judging me rather than listening and giving me an honest thought through opinion. He is quite innocent and does his best to understand, but sometimes it is hard to talk to him about these things as he ends up being shocked and gets worried more than anything. 

Can anyone give me some advice? 
Is it better trying to become closer friends with David and break off my friendship with the girl, to talk all this over with my boyfriend? Should I try looking for friends elsewhere? I really don't know at this point.

439,"Hi I’m (30f) wanting clarification if what I experienced as a child was abuse or normal? I would be very grateful for any opinions and thankful for the time to read.

Growing up there was myself and two sisters (eldest is 4 years older and youngest is 7 years younger) and my parents were and still are married.

Both my parents didn’t have a job and this was due to my mother experiencing depression and anxiety and my dad was her carer. I remember we were mostly in my mums care day to day with my dad mostly being absent a lot but would come home drunk and at times be very nasty to my mum and also to us. It would feel like we had to walk on eggshells not to make him mad which would usually be being quiet and obeying anything asked. When we were with our mum we would occasionally not listen and she would threaten ‘wait until your dad gets home’ or ‘I’ll be telling dad’ and we would normally be good after that and say things like ‘your not going to tell dad are you?’.

I remember being very scared of my dad and he would have a very short temper and he could say very mean things which thinking back would be classed as bullying but this happened to us all and my mum and us children would turn it into a joke eventually about ‘who’s dad going to get this time’ as it would usually be someone in the target and we would all walk on eggshells when he was home. He would say our mum couldn’t control us etc but looking back I don’t believe we were very naughty maybe alittle noisy and possibly cheeky here and there which I’m not 100% if we were cheeky as this was more us answering back.

My eldest got punished a lot worse as she had a belt which I don’t ever remember getting but I was a lot more behaved or maybe more scared so I listened a lot more. But I do remember getting a hard slap now and then which would take my breath away and leave a red handprint from our dad and sometimes our mum would cuddle us after it which my dad wouldn’t agree with and then she would be the target again and put down on her parenting.

To try keep this sort I will mention things that stick out and ask whether these are abuse as I feel now I’m an adult with two children that I could never do these things and when mentioned to my parents they will say things like we deserved it for how we behaved. I remember when I was around 14 my dad choked me and my mum was watching and as it carried on my mum did tell him to stop but he carried on alittle longer. I can’t properly remember the reason why but it was either because my mum seen marks all over my arms from self harm when we went the doctors for a check up and they felt this was naughty of me and embarrassing for them or it could be that I had sent a man I had been talking to on a chat room on my phone a picture of my privates (which I know was wrong but felt no one talked to me properly about it I was just made to feel disgusting etc)  my parents say it was for the second reason but my memory feels like it was for cutting my arms and I did stop doing this which further makes me feel it was from being punished but I could be wrong. We were not really allowed to cry or throw tantrums and were always taught that adults were above us. I remember I would almost go mute when guests such as extended family would visit and believe this may have been from past occasions if I’d talked I would be critisized for it after they left .

My mum and dad have said they could write a book on how to raise a child and genuinely believe their opinions is always right and if I try to just get acknowledgment from them with how I felt in my childhood my mum will say things like ‘why are you so negative?’ ‘Why can’t you say about the good times?’ And my sisters both say we had the best childhood ever and have amazing parents so this then makes me feel like maybe I’m overreacting but it may be because they don’t have children of their own yet as this was when I started to realise things weren’t right.

There is a lot of mental health issues such as my mum is now diagnosed with bipolar, I am diagnosed with social anxiety disorder/possibly aspergers. My eldest sister has sychizophrenia who is now also cared for by my dad. My dad is not diagnosed with anything and rarely ever goes to the doctors but he is an alcoholic and has a gambling problem (only I see this no one else would admit it and just say things like ‘he’s got it hard he does everything for us and deserves a drink etc’ which would be ok but he can be nasty with it he has suffocated my mum with a pillow and I heard a lot of violence from my dad to my mum growing up and still know he can be nasty when drinks but as I live on my own with kids it seems he tries to hide it more when I visit) 

I also believe he isn’t a nice carer as he can be very controlling and say things that puts my mum and eldest sister down whilst being their carer.

I don’t want to just say bad things they can be nice too I just want to know whether these things are normal and if they were understandle or not. My mum also says things like ‘I’ve never met a man like your dad, try to find someone as good as him’ and it’s like they are all in denial or maybe I am overreacting I just want others opinions thankyou very much.

Lately I've had a really rough time studying, because my education is still full time from home over internet. I'm ln my second year, and I just can't seem to focus. I just feel so sad and tired all the time. Don't get me wrong, my mental health is still fine, but I worry it could potentially get worse depending on what happens in the future. I really don't want to make a pause in my education. Only reason I'm there is to actually get a degree, and having that delayed isn't something I'd like to happen. Usually when I've been bored I've had video games as my time consumer, but now when I study 6-8 hours in front of my computer, that would put me in front of my pc for 15 hours a day.

448,"It's a lot but it's a good story, I promise!

So I met this girl in Florida a few months ago when visiting my sister.  We didnt really talk much that day but she left me a note hidden in my things saying she thought I was cute and to text her.

Some further context is needed about myself before I say more...

I'm a 26 year old virgin (maybe not so much anymore, I cant tell, I'll let you be the judge later on)  I've been dealing with severe social anxiety, Body dysmorphia, as well as depression.  All these things have made it very hard for me to connect with people and especially girls.

Continuing, I decide to take the chance and text her on my way back to Ohio.  She kept me company the whole trip back and during that exchange I half jokingly said if I ever came back it would be in a Uhaul.  And that's exactly what happened.  I got the idea to make a change in my life and move to tampa near my sister and seeing her was a huge part of my decision.  Now I know I shouldnt base that big of a decision on a girl I barely knew but I want to give a little more context...

Before I met her, I met another girl in Florida three months before then.  I felt a connection with this girl and she was the first person that ever made me feel like I was desirable.  The option to sleep with her was there but I was both afraid and also not just wanting it to be a one night thing which is where her head was at.  Long story short I kept talking to her and I just wanted to be friends.  I was hoping to visit her every now and then (In kentucky) to hang out and just get some more confidence.  It started out that way but then she started dropping hints that she liked me, saying things like with me I could commit but I'm not in a place to do that right now.  She kept stringing me along saying let's hang out and I want to see you several times but when it came down to it she would always flake on me.  I found out she was going to visit her Dad in Florida and that was the basis for me going the second time to see my sister.  Dont get me wrong I wanted to see my sister but seeing her was the primary reason.  I told her I'd be around that during that time and she said we should definately hang, but just like all the other times she made it very hard for that meetup.  We did end up meeting up and basically we came to the understanding that she only saw me as a friend.  So in that moment I was at a very low point.  A couple days later is when I found the note from the other girl.

My whole reason for including that is I'm 26 and its embarrassing being in my situation and having to play catchup and going out of my way to get someone to give me a chance.

So receiving that note was an amazing feeling and the pick me up I needed.  We ended up texting for 2 months while I packed up my condo and prepared to rent it out.  I told her everything.  My previous experience with that other girl, my struggles with looking at my reflection, my crippling anxiety and depression and she accepted all of it.  She herself has issues with being bipolar as well as general anxiety and depression, as well as having scoliosis.  I accepted all those things about her.

I told her theres one last thing that she doesnt know but I'd rather tell her in person once I moved down there and she said she understood.  That thing was that I was a virgin and I had never been in a relationship.  

I loved texting her everyday and just hearing from her and it's something I had never had in my life and I cherished it so much.  But I was afraid to lose it.  I ended up staying at my Moms house for an extra month because I was so afraid to finalize the move (my things were already driven down and put in storage) and see her in person for the fear of her seeing who I am and rejecting me.

I ended up wearing out my welcome at my Moms house and my hand was forced and had to move down then.  I spent the first week staying in hotels while looking at apartments until I eventually found a place.  

The time had come finally come after two and a half months.  She invited me over to her apartment and I agreed.  I was beyond terrified because now she was going to see me as I am and I'd have to tell her what I had been hiding.  She was going to meet someone totally different than what she was expecting.  Dont get me wrong I didnt lie to her l, but I did give her the impression that I was less afraid and more confident of a person over text than I actually was.  Matter of fact she might have been expecting a lot more because I did give the impression at times that I was kind of a man whore.  I never said I was sleeping with a lot of girls or that I had been but I did make the point several times that a lot of other girls found me attractive at places like the gym etc.  Not to brag, its important to the story, but I kind of glowed up at 23 and I do have a very nice physique.  I hear a lot that I'm attractive but my issues with BDD I always struggle to see it for myself and constantly look for validation from other about my appearance.

So back to the story...

She thinks she's meeting this sexy confident guy who deals with BDD, social anxiety, and depression and what she got was this awkward insecure sexy guy with BDD, social anxiety, and depression.  I go over there and I'm terrified.  She invites me inside and I do my best to give her the impression I'm a confident guy.  She offers to go out on the patio to smoke (weed) which is something I rarely ever did in my life and she knew that and was looking forward to smoking me up for fun.  She smokes everyday and  often, it was somewhat of a hurdle when we were talking but we accepted it.  (Her smoking a lot and me not)  So I took a hit and didnt feel much and decided to take a second hit five minutes later...that was a huge mistake.

I had trouble stringing words together.  I started getting hot and sweaty all over.  (Even more so than usual being outside in Florida.  Then I start hearing a ringing in my ears.  My memory gets fuzzy but I do remember her asking if I wanted to head inside.  I remember going through the sliding glass door and the next thing I knew I was on the floor.  I fainted.  The next thing I knew I was sitting there feeling like I was drunk while she handed me a towel because I was still sweaty all over.

The whole day after that point was a blur and just a string of loose memories.  She invited me into her room and despite being high AF, my anxiety was through the roof because I knew what was going to happen.  We end up putting in a movie after spending 20 minutes trying to pick one out because I was high and indecisive AF...and then we laid on her bed.  

It started out ok, she wiggled back into me and I put my arm around her and we laid there just ""watching"" the movie.  I say ""watching"" because I was technically staring at the tv and I knew I was awake but I have no recollection of any scene from that movie...I couldn't even remember what movie it was until a week later after racking my brain.  (It was Red Dawn btw)  

It was going ok but I knew she was going to want to do more at some point and that's all that was going through my head.  And then it finally happened, she turned to face me and I knew in that moment she wanted to do.  My memory is fuzzy and I dont know exactly how it came up but in that moment I felt it was time to tell her.  I told her I was never in a relationship and I think she pretty much inferred the other part that usually accompanies that.

But she kept staring at me looking like she wanted to do something, so I dove in the deep end and we started making out.  Next thing I know I'm taking off her shirt and shes taking off mine.  I dont know what her intention for that day was but in my head it felt like that was what was expected of two adults who have been waiting to see eachother for so long.  So it progressed to more until the point where it was time for the main event...

The only problem was I wasnt able to ""perform.""  I dont know if it was because I was so nervous and couldn't relax or if I had the weed equivalent of whiskey you know what.  She was understanding and we did our best to make it work but it ended up just being a regrettable experience that was only exasperated by being high AF.  She told me it didnt matter and that it was ok.  We ended up just cuddling and hold eachother for a few more hours until it was late enough that I had to go because she worked the next day.  We put our clothes back on and she walked me to the door and kissed me goodbye.

***Also, couldn't find the appropriate place to include this but my sister was hanging out with her roommate and was right outside the door when all this happened.  So here's to being a 26 year old virgin and your first experience ends up with you fainting, being high AF, not being able to perform, and your sister is right outside...***

I woke up the next day to texts from her saying she was glad we finally got to hangout, that she had a good time, that she didnt see me any differently and nothing had changed between us.  It was a relief but I was hung up on the word finally.  Maybe I read too much into things but it left me the impression that hey it was a good one time thing but I'm not interested in more.  I felt insecure that she didnt want to see me again and that's kind of the impression I got the following week.  I wasnt confident enough to ask her out, especially after that experience, so I kind of left the ball in her court to set up another time to meet.  It never happened so I left little hints for her to come over.  I suggested jokingly she should help me move into my place, that I needed someone small enough to fit behind the stacked washer/dryer to check the connections, etc.  But she didnt really respond in a way that left me with the impression she wanted to come over.  She also kept asking for pictures and updates on my place and it left me thinking if she was interested why dont you ask to come over?

So eventually it got to that point and it was all downhill from there.  She asked again to see pictures  another time and I jokingly said I'll never send pics, if you want to see it come over in person with a shrug emoji.  She said she didn't know if I ever wanted her to come over because I hadn't been very responsive that week.  Which was true only because I was so embarrassed by that day and I couldn't talk to her how I used to because now she knew the real me.  It basically lead to argument because in my eyes she was the one who wasnt being responsive.  Throughout our time texting it was constantly her who would ALWAYS take at least 20 mins on average to respond.  There were rarely moments where we could string together a conversation with 5 minute or less responses times consistently.  I grew frustrated at that point and told her I wanted more than idle texting because the following week after that day we'd only exchange about 10 small talk texts a day about nothing...

Then she drops the ball on me and tells me something that's keeping her from ever getting serious with anyone is that she thinks shes bi and she has a fantasy about sleeping with a girl and she needs to act on it before it could ever happen.  I was so frustrated  because in the very beginning we both made it clear that we were looking for something serious.  Now after 3 months she tells me this, but the caveat is that she still wants me to talk to her (in the sense to keep pursuing things) while she acts on this because she assures me it will be just a hookup.  Am I supposed disrespect myself and wait on her to act on this and decide what she wants?  Maybe she ends up liking it and leaves me.  But I feel the more important point is she has the audacity to want me to still want to pursue her while she sleeps with someone else.  This feeling is made 100x worse when you consider she tells me this a week after sleeping with me, leaving the insecure virgin feeling like complete loser.  Now I feel like I'm not good enough and now she feels this way because I didnt give her the experience she wanted.

Later that day I told her that it was disrespectful and if she felt she needed to sleep with someone else to know if she could ever be serious with me then she should let that be the last message. If she wanted to talk about it she would have to come talk to me on person.  Her next three messages were essentially I like you and I dont know what to do, please talk to me, and ok I'll meet you but I cant tonight or tomorrow (while also adding IF I did what would it change I dont feel you'll accept it anyway)

So I texted her two days later asking if she still wants to talk and she said she does but added that she didnt know if either of us is ready for a relationship.
I kept insisting that I just wanted to have the chance to hear eachother in person.  Several times I pleaded I just wanted to talk in person to understand eachother and ensured her I wasnt looking to argue.  The fact that she wouldnt meet me and was adamant about it said a lot to me.  For two people to be talking that long and she doesnt even have the courage to talk in person just confirmed my belief that she didnt have any intention to see me again after that day.

This is when she started throwing excuses against the wall.  All these things we had previously acknowledged and accepted about eachother she was now saying she didn't know if it would work between us...

She said she needs to sleep with a girl and that it was essentially nonnegotiable... I was at least willing to listen if she came to talk to me in person

Then she said my mental health wasnt strong enough to support her and she needs a rock.... even though in the very beginning and throughout we both acknowledged that it was on that we didnt have everything figured out and we could grow together.  Now it's an issue...

Then she said it was her mental health and she didnt feel ready and I told her it was ok and I was going to be there for her whenever... now it's an issue

Then she said anybody she was going to be with would have to believe in god.  I'm not religious and this is not anything new to her.  We both know it was a big difference but wanted to talk about it in person.  And in the very beginning I made a point to mention this and she said I wont judge you for not beleiving if you dont judge me for beleiving.   Now it's an issue....

Then most recently she suggested that I'd do better with someone who doesnt smoke all the time, which to me was the furthest concern in my mind compared to everything else...now it's an issue

I sent her one last message saying how she still meant a lot to me and I cared for her and that I'd be willing to work on all these things with her if she'd give me the chance.  I told her this was my last ditch effort, if this wasnt enough then nothing would change her mind.  I told her to think it over that night or the next couple days.  She said she'd reply the next day...nothing.  Nothing the day after either.  On the third day, unsolicited from me, she said she promises she'll reply tomorrow.  She didnt.  

Now it's the day after and I feel so betrayed by this person.  After not even being willing to meet in person she didnt even have the courage to respond over a text to give some form of closure.

We both said from the beginning that we wanted to pursue something serious and to be completley honest with eachother.  And now I feel shes just been lying to me the whole time and wasting my time.  We both said we wouldnt judge eachother for our religious beliefs and now she said she would need me to change.  We both struggled with our mental health and that used to bond us, now I need to be better for her.  

All these things we accepted in eachother were now obstacles.  Which is what makes me believe these are all just excuses.  The only thing that changed is that one day we had.  And despite her saying it didnt change anything between us, how else am I to feel?   She doesn't have the courage to tell me she doesnt see anything with me because of my lack of experience.  All these other excuses came after that.  I pleaded with her for her outright honesty no matter much she thought it would hurt me.  She wasnt willing to meet me in person or even give me a response over text.

I'm 26 years old and I just wanted someone to bare with me and give me a chance.  I confided so much in her and she supposedly was willing to accept so many things about me and it gave me a sense of hope I havent had in forever.  Now it all feels like a lie, that she needed me to change who I was, let her sleep with other people while I waited on her, that she couldn't have the courage to talk in person or even give me some type of closure by text.  I feel so betrayed when I've tried to be nothing but supportive and understanding to her.

I know I'm a good guy but I'm so sick of being alone and I'd do anything for someone to give me a chance.  I've traveled 4 states just to maybe hang with a girl, I moved 4 states just to have a chance to pursue a relationship with someone else.  I know these are irrational decisions, but when you're so desperate to be loved these are things I felt I had to do.  

Now I'm just sick of being the nice guy who gets pushed around.  Now I just want her to be miserable.  She already struggles financially and spends a lot of her money on weed.  She just started a new job after being fired from her old job.  Now I just want to call her job and let them know she used synthetic urine to cheat their preemployment drug test and smokes before she goes to work and while on lunch.  I have all the screenshots to prove it.  The main thing that would screw her is she needs the disability insurance and shes been having complications recently with her scoliosis.  At this point I dont care and I feel like she deserves it anyway.  She screwed around with someone who already confided in her that he was vulnerable, insecure, and hurting.

If you've made it this far you have to much time on your hands. Lol. But I hope it was a decent read.  Maybe you guys can talk me out of it, or into it.  Idk.",27Oct2020,1
449,"I work with someone who is a total nightmare and I want advice on minimising my dealings with him, while covering my ass. 

We're on the same team, have the same manager, were hired at the same time, and for all purposes are peers. Without going into too much detail, I think the biggest issue in all of this is that he's in way over his head in his role and isn't coping well.

His struggling isn't helped by the fact that he's also rude, incompetent, unproductive, unreliable, and needy. On projects, he often asks for input from others and then is defensive and passive-aggressive if anyone questions a decision he's made. He seems to put in minimal effort himself before asking others for hours of their help to finish tasks. He's a diva and refuses to do certain things that are in his JD - sometimes he even tells me outright to do them myself. 

We're working remotely, and I'll sometimes get extremely long, overwritten responses to basic questions I've asked about a piece of work, almost like he's trying to start an argument to stall doing his actual job. 

I'm not his manager, but I simply do not have the time or energy to deal with him. I empathise with the fact that he seems lost and the world is incredibly stressful right now, but I feel like I'm being sucked down by this sinking ship, mentally and emotionally.

I've raised these issues with our boss and tried to explain how this is affecting me. I told her I feel like our joint projects are extremely one-sided, and me picking up his slack is stopping me doing other tasks. She recognises that this person is challenging and that I'm frustrated but believes with support from the team he'll eventually improve, and we owe him a chance. 

I otherwise absolutely love this job and there is no way I'm leaving over him. I've tried clearing the air with him and building rapport, but it hasn't worked. I'm considering:

1. Confronting him when he's behaving badly - not to be overly aggressive, but just call him out when he's being difficult or otherwise making it difficult for me to do my job.
2. Step away as much as possible from direct dealings with him. It'll mean projects are completed much more slowly, but I feel like that will reflect on him rather than me.

Any other advice? Thanks",27Oct2020,1
450,"So im in my mid 20's, but i barely have any knowledge when it comes to insurances, taxes, and all kinds of paperwork. This results in me having to ask multiple instances for help.

When we hung up, suddenly more questions started to come up and i couldn't just ignore those questions, so i called back. I now got another lady on the phone that sounded really rude and told me that the section i tried to call were on break now and she'd ask them to call me back.

451,"Hello everyone. 

I (F20) have been dating my partner (M22) for almost 2 years now, and we have been pretty happy with each other for the most part.(Preface) We are still in college with demanding majors and have been basically living with each other for a little more than a year. 

Even though I am happy in the current relationship and we enjoy each other's company a lot, I sometimes wonder if this is the relationship that is meant to be the one. I ask this because even though we have been living with each other for over a year, there are some lifestyle choices that we disagree upon and im tired of being a ""Mom"" to him. 

For instance, I always have to do the dishes, laundry, cook, or clean up. Ive been teaching him how to do each of these tasks, but there's always something that he needs to do first (eg homework). I am in a related major as him, so I understand that there is a lot of homework, but I still have the time to clean up. There's like a lack of motivation to do something and it bothers me. I dont know if this is just a guy thing because my mom had told me how my dad and brother are the same way.

Speaking of homework, another issue I have is that he procrastinated really hard on homework (like pulling all nighters to finish his homework weekly). He always complains about how much homework he has but it seems likes he's always watching YouTube or hanging out with friends. This affects me because I can't sleep and I am an anxious person (who makes sure I do all my homework early and really focus on the task), so when I see him not starting the homework until 1am the day it is due makes me feel very anxious. I dont know if its just because we are in school. 

Lastly (and the reason that made me write this post) is that he doesn't believe me when I tell him about how anxious I am about the gov as a women of color and what is going on in the US. He's always telling me that he doesn't believe that the Supreme Court can overturn Roe v. Wade or that my women's health rights will be affected. This makes me very uncomfortable and upset that he keeps telling me this every time I bring up that maybe I don't want kids because I don't want our kids to grow up with the consequences of climate change, limited woman's rights and such. He tells me I'm overreacting and not to worry about it. 

I don't know if these are reasonable or if I just am trying to find the perfect guy that doesn't exist. Again, overall I am happy, but when it comes to these instances in life with him, it bothers me. I don't know if this means I'm just not compatible with him for marriage and if I should end it now and move on. Thoughts?",27Oct2020,1
452,"i've been together with the love of my life for a year now. we're both still pretty young (me - 23, her - 21)

&amp;#x200B;

she's had a rough childrood being raised by narcissists (r/raisedbynarcissists to see how that was.)

she spent some years at different places, where she was basically being abused and used as a house slave, having to do manual labour pretty much 24/7.

her only solace was being able to play the violin, so that's what she did in her free time, whenever she could.

her abusers would also take away her violin as a way to force her into doing even more manual labour.

about a year ago we've met, and i gave her a safe space in my home. she's the love of my live, and she loves me even more. she confessed that without me, she would be completely lost.

now, for about 3 years her shoulders have been kinda broken. she is unable to move her arms without experiencing excruciating pain. this has even kept her from playing the violin, and every time we see someone playing the violin in public or listen to music with someone playing the violin, she breaks down completely, and in the evening she cries herself to sleep in my arms.

we've been to multiple doctors and they all say it's simple muscle tensioning, and with a little bit of sport, visiting the gym every once in a while, it should go away.

we found one doctor who admitted her to physical rehab, where she now goes to twice a week. in addition, i am massaging her shoulders daily, every evening, and i can tell you they're hard as stone in some parts, definitely NOT how normal tension should feel!

we've been trying thsi rehab - massaging - combo for half a year now, and it even seems to have gotten worse!

the doctors simply don't take us seriously, because she isn't crying in front of them? she can't open her true feelings in front of strangers because of her past traumata! it took her two months of us being together before she could open up to me!

in addition to that she also seems unable to truly relax, and every time she uses her muscles she can only use them to 100%. she also told me that she doesn't know how to relax.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm already keeping her from doing chores by doing them myself. i do the dishes, i clean, i help with the physical tasks of cooking, i haul the shopping, so she can rest her shoulders all day.

some may say i shouldn't do that, she's just using me, but hear me out!

&amp;#x200B;

she feels so bad about unable to do anything that she's often times frustrated. we can't even cuddle properly because of her pain. we can only play some computer games before she almost breaks down crying because of her pain, and no freely available medication works on her.

a week ago she confessed to me that she doesn't know if she can hold out any longer, that she fears that this pain will follow her into her grave, that she'll never be able to play the violin, to finaly finish school or do something in her life.

she told me this pain is basically taking her life away and she's often thinking about ending it all, because at least in death she can finally be painless.

&amp;#x200B;

i already had to hold her one night because she was about to exit our flat, and i had a strong feeling, that if i let her leave now, she wouldn't ever come back again.

it breaks my heart to hear her say these things. she is a lovely girl, always wanting the best for everyone, compassionate, and everything one would wish for in a dream girl!

&amp;#x200B;

i've since stepped up my massage sessions, switching from one 20-minute-session to two 1-hour-sessions per day.

we don't have much money to spend, most of the money is being spent on food, shelter and her rehab sessions (insurance stops after 3 visits).

456,"I live in the uk in a tier 3 area with strict COVID laws due to high infection rates. Because of this, you cannot meet with anyone for any reason (not even if you distance and wear masks) yet my family (my mother especially, who I live with) go out with others not following any rules with the excuse “we haven’t been near any infected people so it’s fine”. Now that Halloween is almost here, the rule that no one is to go trick or treating has been introduced and while she doesn’t plan on going out, my mother said she will be giving to anyone who is trick or treating. I have told her many times that lives are at risk but she keeps telling me that if I don’t like her ways of living during this pandemic I can just not do as she is doing. I know I might sound like I’m overreacting but I don’t want anyone getting infected or worse killed. I know the odds of infection are low but I’m still worried. How can I explain to her that she needs to follow the laws? (I’ve told her multiple times that she is committing crimes by doing this but she just acts like it’s nothing)

457,"I haven't been on a vacation in nearly four years. The past three years, I was busy freelancing and saved up a lot of money so I could travel in 2020. Then early in April , I finished all my projects and decided to take a long break. And that's when the Pandemic struck. 

Now I don't feel like working, because mentally I'm exhausted, and nor can I travel. I feel guilty too for not working, and wonder sometimes if I should start freelancing again. But I'm so tired. 

I feel stuck and while i do try my best to keep myself busy (reading, gaming, music, exercising) , there are some days when I cry so much and get really depressed. I know it's just a phase but it's really hard

458,"My boyfriend’s (26) mom (59) had been sick for the past two years and unfortunately she recently passed away. He has two brothers, and the older one (29) is being a jerk. He has a drug problem that everyone is aware of (except for him), but recently he started going off the deep end. He bought a BB gun and is constantly inihibriated, to the point that his younger brother had to hide his gun out of concern for his and everyone elses safety.  He did extasis with his girlfriend (19) and she fell flat on her face 3 times. Me and my boyfriend took her to the ER at 4 am even though his older brother didnt want us to because he thought she was “fine”.  We asked him to stay behind but he showed up anyways. In the car we talked very seriously with him, letting him know we were concerned for him, and his girlfriends well-being. My boyfriend got particularly upset, and told him he was being irresponsible. His brother behaves as though he is the only one in pain, and that his substance abuse is due to that, but it started years ago. He and I dont really have a good relationship but I genuily try my hardest to keep peace and to get along for my boyfriend’s sake (even though he has been pretty horrible and condescending to me over the years). I thought after we spoke to him that things would change, but he keeps drinking and popping pills like there is no tomorrow. His girlfriend is talking about moving to their deceased mother’s home, and both me, my boyfriend, and his younger brother think that is a terrrible idea. Not only because she is so young and it is a completely different state were she would be completely dependent on him, but also because his older brother clearly has no concern for his or her safety. Today he cornered me and told me it was wrong of me to ask him to stay behind when we went to the ER while he was drunk, to which I told him I stood by my choices and that he didnt respect my wishea anyways. They decided to get him professional help since we are not qualified to deal with this, but my already grieving boyfriend is so stressed out and upset about it it breaks my heart. The three of them have ownership of the home and had agreed to keep it since selling it would add even more stress to an already stressful situation, but since they told his brother he cant move in they are scared he is not going to pay for his part of the mortage. He is just so awful to them, and I know they are going through a lot but it bothers me how utterly selfish and self-involved he is. He was also this way even before he stated doing hard drugs. I personally think there should be some distance between him and his other brothers, but feel like i’m a bad person for even thinking. What is worse is that he tries to get my boyfriend to do drugs with him and go to strip-clubs, (which he got him to do once) which really concerns me. What is the best course of action? Should we just let him figure it out? Should they let him get out of the lease? Am I horrible for wanting him out of our lives?",27Oct2020,1

462,"I'm 18 years old and I have no friends. I have 'internet friends' but they all live far away &amp; I really just want some friends I can meet up with or see on a regular basis. I started university this september and my plan was to speak to people and make friends there, but because of covid, everything is online and we (the students) don't get to speak to each other at all. Also, I'm living at home for uni so it's not like im in a compltely new city full of potential friends.

I also started a new job in August (I left my last job in December 2019) and I hoped to make friends there but I didn't click with anyone, most of the people there were much older than me, but there were 2 people my age, However, one of them was already best friends with another girl who worked there, and the other one didn't have a personality at all &amp; seemed mildly homophobic (I'm gay, so that wouldn't have worked out).

I'm leaving this job in a few weeks, but I don't have another job lined up yet, I'm still looking. 

I've tried making internet friends who live near me, by posting my general location on places to make internet friends, but since I'm from a small town, that didn't work out too well.

As I see it, the only way I'll be able to make friends in the future is to hope I click with someone when I start my new job, but as I've had 4 jobs before and not made a single friend at any of them (I used to have terrible social skills), it's not looking likely.

he had his midterms this month and did not do well on them and he found out it's because his mood stabilizers cause really bad memory loss. he takes things really hard and this entire time he thought he was an idiot bc he didn't do well. his doctor didn't even tell him this was a symptom and frankly, i think she's a joke. she has been late for appointments and forgotten them over 10 times. he's had her as a doctor less than a year and i am incredibly upset and worried for him that he got screwed over like this.

even when i pick up my meds from the pharmacist, they tell me the side effects even if they have seen me order it before. it blows my mind that in the several months he took this medication, his doctor failed to mention this and i think she shouldn't be practicing. her degree of unprofessionalism is ludicrous.

unfortunately though, i cannot get him a new doctor so i really wanna cheer him up but we don't see each other often (once a month or twice or so for a few days at a time but we talk every day). he says i support him plenty but i don't feel like i do enough.

466,"I'm a college student and my only on-campus class is on Tuesday mornings. Me and my mom agreed that I could use her car to go to school alone, after two whole years of having to be driven to classes by her (schedules made it easier for her to pick me up/drop me off). 

For the first month of the semester it was fine, but over the entire rest of the semester she's decided that Tuesday is a day she wants to get out of the house, so she tags along when I go to school then sits in the parking lot, hijacking my day to just get away, go to class my goddamn self, and enjoy a car ride without her criticizing my every move and being able to listen to my own music. It's frustrating and I've brought this to her attention but she makes it about her: she wants to get out the house, she wants to go to JoAnns, it's her car.

470,"So my fiancé and I have been together for over a year now and have spent almost every weekend since we've gotten together - well, together.

Every weekend I would go over to where he was living and sleep in his great small double bed and struggle to sleep as he sucks at being a good sleeper. What do I mean by this? He grinds his teeth, he fidgets and rolls all night, he likes to cuddle and cuddling makes makes me feel sick... I could continue as the list still has more but I imagine you get the picture.

During the pandemic we were staying at one place or the other. The only perk to where he used to live was a spare bedroom I could go into and sleep by myself if need be. I never needed it too much though.

I have a queen sized bed, and I thought this would help. It didn't. Every night he is still breathing and snoring in my ear, grinding his teeth, this morning he slept diagonally and kept me up by being in my space and just not moving when I tried to get him too.

He moved in with me about a month ago, and I swear I have not had a good night sleep since. He does his usual things but now he gets mad when I wake him up to move him at night. At first I chalked it up to stress, but eventually it just felt like this was my life now. Falling asleep - might I add - is not bad. Usually he's awake when I'm falling asleep so he doesn't fidget or roll or grind his teeth. It's usually around 3 am this starts. 

I'm growing increasing frustrated with this. He can't get a mouth guard, he simply can't afford to go to the dentist. I have to be up every morning for work at 7:45, and he doesn't have to be up at all. It's resulting in me feeling laggy and easily overwhelmed at work.

Sleeping elsewhere in my house is also not an option. Full house with few choices. I just need advice. How do I improve the sleep situation so I can actually sleep?

TL;DR: My fiancé sucks at sleeping and sharing the bed and I cannot sleep beside him anymore. But have limited options on where I can sleep or he can sleep and I dont know what else to do to sleep well. I feel fried.",27Oct2020,1
471,"I met my boyfriend in the cutest way, on the very first day of college. We hung out everyday after that and wer exclusive in just 2 weeks!! What we had was all I ever wanted and more. I thought ""amazing I've met the man I wanna be with forever at 19"". 

Now it's been 2 years and I feel way less and Idk if this is how everyone feels once the honeymoon stage is over? . I rarely miss him anymore even though we are often apart for weeks due to repeated lockdowns to slow COVID19. When we first met, even being apart for a few hours made me ache for his presence. A year ago I still felt like this when I couldn't see him for a day or 2. Maybe I just got used to not seeing him for weeks at a time thanks to lockdowns? I rarely want to make out or have sex anymore, it feels like an effort. 

His mental health issues come and go for periods of weeks. It drains me and he won't get professional help. I become a therapist, reading for hours how to help and he does nothing. I keep thinking life doesn't need to be so hard. I also feel sad lately when I think that the excitement of really wanting sex and being fascinated by someone, is gone and maybe that's how love is. I started having dreams about meeting new guys and feeling so excited, which is really out of character for me. I think the fact my boyfriend has kinda ""let himself go"" for the last year is part of the issue. He has black hair and will only shave his stubble once a week of longer when it grows back in like one day. It scrapes me and takes away from his beautiful face. He rarely eats fruit or veg anymore, just eats pizza/fries/chicken/burgers and chips. I worry for how he is getting any nutrients and he has gained 30/40lbs.

477,"I hope this is a proper sub for this, because in a way I need opinions just as much as advice. If it's not please let me know and I'll be happy to move it somewhere else.

I'll try to keep it simple.

Like a number of people, I feel it sometimes hard to be single. I can take care of myself without any problem regarding day to day life, I have a rather balanced life with friends, a nice job, a nice place, some sport... But I find myself occasionally craving some attention, tenderness and physical contact.

I'm not one for one night stands. Don't have anything against the idea really, but it's not my thing. Sex is very intimate for me.

However, when I like a woman and I feel she likes me too, I sometimes use that, in a way, to get what I crave.

We would kiss, hold hands, watch movies cuddling, I can cook for her, have a laugh, sleep together, give her little compliments. That kind of things. It can be for a night or a whole weekend. Like I said, sex is not, or rarely, even involved necessarily.

The thing is, even though I have to genuinely like the person, doesn't mean I want to go any further than that. I will actually enjoy her company and have affection for her, and I'll be ready to do it again, but apart from that I don't necessarily want a relationship.

Having said that, I also realise how many mixed signals this behavior has to send to the person. I get wary if I feel like the person is growing too attached, because I don't know where they stand, and I the same time I can't really blame anyone but me.

In the long run, I want to stop feeling the need to do that, in the sense that I'd like to be emotionally stable and self-sufficient. If I ever get involved in any way with someone, I'd like it to be because I want it, not because I need it. I wanna start a therapy to get help doing that. It just takes time (like up to 6 months) to get an insurance-backed therapist in the country in which I live because of the administrative processes.

In the meantime, I'm really questioning the morality of my behavior. I feel like it's not unreasonable to enjoy human contact and tenderness from time to time, but I also feel manipulative and guilty whenever I do that kind of stuff. I'm afraid of hurting someone, as I think I have in the past (never got any clear feedback but I think I did).

To put it simply, those are my questions :

1. In your opinion/experience, am I acting in a toxic way ? Should I stop altogether or simply take some precautions ?
2. In the latter case, do you have any advice on how to make sure things are clear and beneficial for everybody involved ? 

I'm always afraid of having a serious talk about that with the people involved because I don't want to make them feel like I'm relying on them ; I don't want to put anything on their shoulders.

I know it depends on the person. I'm not asking for anything more than what you can give me, what you feel can be relevant in that situation.

If you think I'm a terrible person, I want to hear it. I'm genuinely open to it. Please just try to give me something to work with.

In any case, thank you for taking the time to read this.",27Oct2020,1

479,"I (30M)  moved in with a good friend (33F) Apr 19 in London. She always talked about moving back to Australia, so I was weary to move in together.  I asked her very directly if she could actually commit to a 12-month lease - and she said she would. 

We found a great place, it was below our budget but unfurnished - so we accepted that we would have to spend some money on furniture.  Collectively we spent about £2k on furnishing and items (we both had practically nothing when we moved in). 

Just 3 months after moving in, she tells me she is moving back to Australia. I was upset because she clearly lied and knew she wouldn't be there for the whole lease.  Now I had to find a new flatmate as well. 

When advertising the place, we struggled to get anyone to consider paying a £940 ""furniture surcharge"" for her portion of the furniture.  So she suggested that the new tenant pay extra beyond rent each month, and then since I'm friends with the original tenant - I transfer that money to her each month.  I wasn't really keen on this idea because why do I have to be a financial go-between for something that wasn't my problem?  I wasn't the one who broke the lease.  Furthermore, I felt that she would be really lucky to get a full furniture pay-out - we went into the lease knowing the property was below budget and then furnture would be a sunk cost.  I won't recoup the full value of the furniture, AND i have to deal with it at the end of the lease - which could actually be an expense! 

We found a tenant (25M) and the agreement ended up being 20 months £47 extra per month.  Which is even beyond a 12 month lease anyways. I didn't really agree with her getting fully recouped but I didn't want to push back that much and rock the boat with my friend. 

Flash forward, it's now 14 months later.  Our rent was also raised in February before the pandemic.  My current flatmate has now paid £658 exta for the furniture - and I think this is a fair stopping point. 

Am I in the wrong for thinking that paying the FULL price of the original furniture is unnecessary, especially for bad behavior of agreeing to a lease that you knew you were going to break?  I'm going to stop the payments and I'm awaiting push back that could result in tension.  

TL;DR: Is it fair for my original flatmate who broke the lease, to be fully recouped for original furniture expense?",27Oct2020,1

So, I need some advice on whether I'm just crazy. 

My mom has 4 brothers and sisters. There's an 8 year age gap between the oldest and the youngest. None of whom have any idea who their father is. My Nana (their mom) has always been cagey and refused to discuss their parentage. 


They have however always lived along with my Nana at her fathers house, now the part that seems strange to me, is that all 5 kids called their Grandad, Dad/daddy. There is a history in my generation and the one younger of health issues and even early deaths, which just adds fuel to my theory.

484,"After spending some months at my home during quarantine, I'm worried about my sister (13 yo). She was never good at academics nor anything extra curricular. Her daily routine is:

1. She wakes up around 11 PM just so she can skip her online classes which starts at 9 PM, she already managed to skip her classes for about two months.
2. She either scroll through youtube pointlessly, watch her favorite TV show/cartoons or play games on mom's smartphone. She is also becoming addicted to texting and calling rather soon.
3. If mom's on work, all she does is sit around window and look outside for no reason.

After talking with her I came to know that she want to become an actor, painter or dancer albeit she never took part in a single play, drama, dance or painting related stuff. I've tried to motivate her to do something related to those professions and explained her how hard their life is even then she actively doesn't do anything to improve her skills in any of the above professions. The last time she drew something was about 2-3 months ago, last time she danced was a year ago afaik.

Talking about academics she had hardly completed a single chapter of her textbooks and she don't want to admit that. She also doesn't have interest in a single subject and she doesn't even do her homework. I've motivated and helped her to make a schedule multiple times which she never followed since all she want is entertainment. I also motivated her to use Khan Academy and even asking her questions about what she learned and tracking her progress on paper but that changed nothing and she stopped watching Khan Academy after a few days.

She is also dumb in front of her teachers ironically she have already started yelling at Mom with Dad being next target probably. She is also unable to speak for herself outside afaik. I don't know if I should include that she also want a new smartphone or tablet as Dad gifted me a smartphone because my previous one broke and I topped university in previous semester, I don't know what it is, her jealousy? I even promised her a tablet if she does good in her class but that changed nothing.

Also Dad have mostly given up on her, Mom doesn't care one bit and I believe Mom is the one to blame as when I tried to teach my sister Math, my Mom started saying that she cannot do anything in Math and won't pass the exams instead of taking care of her studies, I can't believe how toxic my Mom is, I'm grateful that I was raised by my Dad without my Mom after I was 5 otherwise I might've ended up like my sister, who knows?

485,"A. She never wants to be alone with me , seems negative , but my cousin also doesn't want to be alone with the guy she's into.

B. Over time she became ""me"". A couple of times a day she says things that i usually say , sometime she even says a few sentences just like i would say them.

C. It might be in my head , but it seems like the way she smiles at me is different than the way she smiles at other people. 

D. There have been multiple occasions (yesterday was the latest one) where she asks me if i love her or just says ""i know you love me"" .
On the surface , when she asks me if i love her she probably means as a friend , but maybe there's something under the surface.

E. When she compliments me , she sounds like me when i flirt with someone. 
I know it might be overstretching, but me and her have a VERY similar personality .


I'd really like to know if it means something , or if it's all in my head.

486,"I am a 23-year-old male, but in my mind, I feel like I am in my late teens at best. I do things that i consider somewhat childish but I enjoy them. I play games sometimes too much, watch anime and still might run and jump occasionally lol. I still do responsible things, I am currently in university so I get my work done but I procrastinate a lot (I think contributes to my feelings) and try my best to actively better myself so I exercise, read (Procrastinate on this too) and just overall try to improve even though not consistently as I like.

 Another factor I think that plays a role in this feeling is the fact I still live with my parents because I am still going to school, I dropped out of college the first time around and went back and finish an associate's degree and move onto a bachelor's degree. During this period where I left college, I went through the process of becoming a police officer. I passed all the steps like medical, physical testing and background checks but I decided to go back to school because the process was taking too long. This has resulted in me never working so I don't know I sometimes see others who I think have their shit together and wonder if I am just a child compared to them (I know it's bad to compare yourself to others).

489,"Context: These are non-epileptic seizures that don’t last long but cause some short term memory loss such as forgetting what the conversation at hand was about or what task she was doing. She has no ability to deal with ANY type of anxiety which is what typically causes the seizures. Understandably, between brain damage and loss of surroundings, she can’t work or drive so she gets lonely at the house. I feel so, so bad for her... However, she’ll go on *long* tangents and monologues that seem impossible to interrupt, stories she’s told us hundreds of times, and she lacks the ability to read the room or others’ body language and discomfort. Also bad about nagging and treating everyone like children.

I pride myself on my ability to communicate with others and really don’t face issues with anyone else in my life. I’m able to communicate my feelings clearly and politely and be understood. But damn I fall flat on my face anytime I try to talk to her about something.

To show how sensitive she is, she was once complaining about money being tight and I listed off a couple recommendations for saving. I suggested that she use the streaming services we already pay for (netflix, Hulu, etc) instead of dishing out hundreds for cable every month, especially when she barely watches TV and all the shows she does watch are available on these steaming services. I was not mean at all, not condescending, not rude, just a polite suggestion. And this caused her to have a seizure.

She’s really bad about telling a 5-10+ minute story (that goes all over the place) before making a request. She’s afraid people will yell at her if she asks them to do something without a lengthy explanation..? A lot of times she does this when I’m in the middle of doing something, so I once told her something along the lines of, “you know you can just ask me to do whatever it is you want without an explanation, and I’ll happily do it, I won’t give you any guff about it 😊.” Seizure.

She’s told US to stop her if she’s telling us something we’ve heard before as she doesn’t want to be “one of those senile old people that you have to politely listen to for forever.” This works maybe 30% of the time. Of course we’re always nice about it but telling her we already know the story will usually result in a seizure, or her doing a WORD FOR WORD monologue about hating her brain damage and more. Like I said, I feel so bad for her but when you hear the same thing more than once per day, it’s frustrating /:

What really got under my skin was on Sunday. My bf and I (both of us are 28) were celebrating a huge milestone in my sobriety. He came over to our house with a bunch of expensive cheeses and pairings so we got set up at the table. Now, I was raised BY HER to not be asking to have others food when you clearly weren’t invited, and to wait if you’re offered something. We’re clearly doing our own thing but she walks up and says “Wow that looks nice, I haven’t eaten lunch today, it *sure* would be nice if I could have some cheese...” We felt internally irked by this perceived rudeness but obliged, thinking she’d take some cheese and fuck off. Nope, she sat down for the entire duration of our hour long cheese sesh and talked about things we’ve heard a million times the *entire* time. We politely tried interjecting that she’s told us this or that story before to no avail. We tried interrupting her by turning to each other to discuss a cheese pairing. Nope, she’d talk over us. At some point, we were giving the classic “stop talking to me” body language and one word answers or saying “oh, interesting..” or “mhmm...” Nope, no ability to read our body language or lack of interest.

I so wanted to say, “I hate to interrupt you but we’re trying to talk about our cheese pairings and discuss our meal.” I wanted to scream. But I know it would’ve caused a seizure or an outburst of anger or crying, and that would’ve even further taken away from what was meant to be a special occasion /: we walked away from our meal absolutely fuming when I was supposed to be celebrating my hard work.

I’m completely ranting and rambling here but I NEED ADVICE. How do I talk to this woman?? Can anyone here relate with having a family member who has memory issues, anger outbursts, seizures, dementia, can’t remember if you’ve tried to politely correct her behavior, etc.? Please, I’m trying so hard to get back on my feet so I can move out again but this is killing me. I need help!",27Oct2020,1

And due to the court case that proceeded the abuse, my father called me a liar under oath and I lost all of my family as they believed him.

I’m on antidepressants that seem to be working fine and I’m able to get sleep due to my new meds.

But I just want to give up when my mom makes me feel awful. I’ve only lived with her the past two years, the only time in my life I’ve lived with her except 1-6years old. But it’s been absolute self loathing hell because every time I make a step in life, I come home and get called lazy because I didn’t clean something or called a burden because I’m not moved out yet, or lazy because I haven’t been able to focus on a higher education yet. Why, when I try my best, do I just want to give up when I’m not getting any support? It seems her sole purpose is to tear me down, and it works. 

I want to move out, but I have no credit history and I often change jobs a lot because I have manic major depressive disorder. So, my work history might very well disqualify me.

496,"Hi all,

I (25f) left a facility after it wasn’t working. It was terrible in that I would drive from and to work crying, and never wanted to leave the house. I had an interview lined up, but it was nights and I couldn’t accept. At the time of me leaving, my coworkers were telling me what a mistake I was making. I told everyone I was going to get this position (because I wasn’t aware that only nights was available), in part of embarrassment and feeling cornered. Two months later, I’m now being offered a days position I can take. I kept in touch with a coworker, who now is harassing me over text. It’s over her thinking I lied, and in someways I admit I unintentionally lied out of embarrassment and in response to the way I was being spoken to in my last two weeks. Recently, I told her about a position she ended up getting at this facility, and asked me through text if I was an X on Y unit. I said yes out of panic, and she said the manager doesn’t know you. She’s now texted me multiple times all asking questions about the job. For reference, I don’t really need to preserve the relationship, given how she’s stood me up multiple times. She only ever messages me to ask for help studying, since I got into a program she’s hoping to also. In general, she’s only ever used me to help her study or help her write emails to management. Not sure how to respond to these texts. Everyone is saying to ignore her, and I don’t get anything out of this relationship. If anything, I’ve given way more than I’ve received. How should I respond to these texts, if at all? 

I take accountability for my fault in this, and in how it snowballed. Of course I intend to not to fall into the pressure of having to present myself a certain way, even under pressure. I just don’t know what to say in response to her barrage of texts. 

Worst case scenario, she tells people at old employment. But they don’t even really like each other, I was never well-liked because I didn’t engage with the mean girl culture, and I won’t ever be returning to this facility.",27Oct2020,1

My mother is waiting for her paycheck to arrive so she told me she would pay back for a supermarket trip we did together yesterday but I saw her “counting” the items they were supposedly hers, two cookie packets and some trash bags.

The reason I'm making this post is because my cousin said that my dad is bordering on abusive. Yesterday, I got informed that my schools FBLA initiation was on Tuesday (Today) and I would probably have to bring some food since it's a sort of party. 

I asked my dad to take me to the store to get ingredients for an apple pie and he said ""Later"". So I waited for the whole day and he eventually went to bed instead of taking me to the store. I asked him about it today and he said that I should have given him more time and that I must have known for at least a week (We went to Florida for the weekend). So, I showed him the email that said that my FBLA leader sent the info yesterday. My dad just goes ""Whatever, that's your problem""

504,"Dear Reddit, 

I need your advice. I’m sorry for how long it is, I feel like the context is required in order to get the best advice. But as the title suggests, I need advice on what I (f24) should/should not include in a letter to my ex (m24) who cannot get over me because they don’t know that I cheated on them. We were together for 3.5 years and we have been apart for 1 year now.

Before I start, I understand that I will be receiving replies such as “you deserve the guilt”, or comments about how terrible I am. I already know these things, my guilt has eaten me alive for the past year to points beyond comprehension and have relapsed with many poor coping mechanisms. All I ask for is objectivity, and where you can offer it, sympathy or empathy or just a little bit of care with words. I consider cheating the worst thing you can do to someone you care about, it has never been something I’d have done or considered, but I did it, and it’ll be the biggest regret I will have till I’m on my death bed, something I will never forgive myself for or find peace with myself, because it meant losing them, and will mean losing them forever.

A year ago I cheated on my partner the night before I was going to leave them, with someone I had no feelings for and barely knew. The final, final decision to leave them was made on drugs earlier that night, I wanted to be independent and focus on me and my friends who I loved to be around. It was the MDMA talking. And it was definitely not something I had planned through. There were reasons I thought about leaving before, but no doubt, in retrospect, we could have worked them through had I had the courage to discuss them. 

Anyway, the person I betrayed my ex with kissed me at the end of an mdma fuelled party. I let them, and I spent the night with them (although this was not fully consummated because I was not only reluctant to start but simply couldn’t continue and I ended up crying, revolted at myself).

The next morning I cried and cried and cried, slept, threw up, slept some more and thought the only thing left to do was end my life. Instead, I finally spoke to my partner who was worried because I was being exceptionally distant, they asked me to promise I wasn’t leaving, which then triggered the break up. I told them I needed to grow, I needed to heal, I needed to be alone. This was true, but not enough to break up with them.

The actions from the night before solidified in my mind the idea that there was no going back. That because of what I did, I have to leave, that I cannot stay. Perhaps because I didn’t have the courage to be honest and I knew I couldn’t live a lie, perhaps because cheating in the first place would force me to stay with my decision to leave despite being unsure. I ended up living a lie in a different way, its been wrong on so many levels, I’m left feeling like a shell of who I was.

I pretty much cut everyone out of my life for months, and stayed in bed, lost a lot of weight, drank myself to sleep every night and really started to destroy myself. We met once for closure and agreed one day we could be friends. Every now and then we have a catch up via text (questionable in its own right, I know), and I can never allow myself for this to continue because I fall apart with the guilt every time I realise that we can never truly be real and honest with each other. I never stopped loving them but I simply couldn’t speak to them, I couldn’t talk to them the way I wanted to, i could never go through with meeting up with them to talk things through because I couldn’t deal with the lie, and I couldn’t deal with admitting to myself that it was the reality. Every time I’d hear that they missed me, or couldn’t get over me, I’d think “me too, but you deserve better”, and so I’d explain that we should take space because life’s a mess and that I was no good for them. I had so many opportunities to just be honest, but I was a fucking chicken and would rather have my head chopped off than live knowing they despised me for something so avoidable. 

Close friends of mine tried to explain to me that if I was breaking up with them anyway, telling them what happened adds insult to injury, doesn’t change anything, and is simply unkind if it is just to absolve my own guilt. To them, I agreed. To me, I knew I loved them, and I knew that I was sacrificing a life with them still, but surely thats what I deserved? And they deserved far better?

Its almost a year later and I still think about them everyday. I am not over them, they are not over me. I still believe that after what I did, we should never be together, I fucked it irreparably and they deserve the best. If I was honest at first, perhaps we stood a chance? I’d have been able to dedicate my life to making it better. But now? Every time I hear from them, I feel physically sick hearing them say they miss me. They’re in love with a person that isn’t me, a person who wouldn’t have done that to them, they’re in love with a lie and they deserve to understand why they shouldn’t be. 

I think I have finally made peace with the fact that although having them hate me and live forever knowing they cannot forgive me and we will never have a life together, even as friends will destroy me more than hearing them say they miss me and not being able to be with them, they will finally have what they deserve which is closure. To be able to move on properly once they understand, once they have that reason to hate me that I know they want. They need to let me go and once I tell them this perhaps they can.

We used to write letters. I plan on writing a letter telling them this truth. I don’t know what I should put in or avoid putting in when telling someone something like this. Nobody wants an explanation or an excuse. Nobody wants to hear about this in a way that sounds like you’re just trying to rid yourself of guilt. I just want them to know that I’m sorry. Sorry for betraying them, sorry for ruining any opportunity for us to be together again. Sorry for loving them and doing nothing to make it better. Sorry for keeping them in the dark for so fucking long, which is almost worse than the initial action. That they gave me the best years of my life and I fucked it up. And that they deserve someone good and pure and kind, the best kind of love, a soulmate. 

I guess this is an r/offmychest as much as it is an ask for help with what I should or shouldn’t include in the letter. I don’t want moral judgement, I have friends for that. But any help with this letter would be the greatest help in the world.",27Oct2020,1

507,"So a bit of context. Mt family amd I do not have an amazing relationship. And I'll be brutally honest about my behavior. I'll steal things like chargers amd use them for a bit, used to steal bits of money but stopped, I argue worh them a lot, every morning there's an argument, and just generally lack respect. But I really try to fix it. Honestly. But every time I try, they just shit on me in return, everything gets set back, start the behavior out of spite, etc. 


But, while I'm not trying to justify it, I have a feeling I know where it comes from. Like 4th grade I got C grades. Parents were furious and treated it like Fs, took me to a doctor, got misdiagnosed with ADHD, got pills, and family had a completely different attitude towards me. They were just flat out fuckin assholes to me. They'd berate, embarrass, yell at me, and in some cases, sister would just flat out physically harm me. My parents make the excuse that it was because I was an asshole in 4th grade as well. But I can't remeber at all be an asshole then. 


I became so self conscious of my self it wasn't wven funny. I used to be the class clown. Then just... nothing. And once I gained a bit of sense, I kinda realized how my family's behavior was wrong. Amd I became so cold towards them. This actually made the behavior worse. 



So here I am. But I swear I have good intentions with others. I give other people more respect and care than I give to myself. This is all making me question... ""Am I fake?"" I feel as if I'm being genuine.  I really do care for people, but when it comes to my family, I just.... Don't really care.



I'll be honest (again), it's mellowed out a bit though. It's more of we're just living together kinda thing amd the relationship is volatile.

TL:DR;
$60 missing from work, only 2 people on. I lost my shift other employee didn’t. What do?




Yesterday at my job, there was $60 down in one of our tills at the end of our shift.

There was only myself and my co-worker on all day from 9-5.

I did not count the till, but she did, 3 times to make sure it was missing. 

She didn’t directly accuse me but she kept saying how “that’s a $50 and a $10 that is missing.” Because everything is our store is $XX.95
There isn’t a solid $60 item..
So she quizzes me a few times about any refunds or people I’ve served, I know for a fact it wasn’t me. 
I wouldn’t ever dare take money from work nor am I that stupid.. I’ve worked in retail for over 10 years. 
But then today I wake up and I’m no longer on my Monday 9-5 shift but my co-worker hasn’t lost any of her shifts.
I am new to this job, less than 2 months whereas she has been there 5 months but it’s her first ever job in retail.

I offered a bag search on the night and she got HELLA offended... I repeated I wasn’t accusing her at all I just wanted to clear myself and in all my other jobs, if money was missing, we would do a bag search. 
But yeh. I went into my work today to talk to my boss and even she seemed very off with me.


My question is... what should I do..?
I’m the new employee.
Money is missing.
I can’t go back to not having a job, I lost my last job in early jan due to covid and only recently got back on my feet, I can’t go through that again.

I would say things like, “oh you were just looking out for me.” “I’d rather you tell me than let me go out looking bad.” In reality she’s caused me an eating disorder and I hate my arms now can’t wear anything that doesn’t cover them up. That’s an example, but it’s things like that all of the time and anytime she feels guilty or bad I feel like I absolutely have to make her feel better. How do I stop this destructive behavior?

I've known her since I was a toddler and in all honesty she's like a younger sister to me. I love her with all my heart but recently I'm kind scared for her. A few years ago she moved a few hours up north because her parents divorced and her mom got a nursing job there. At first we thought this was a good thing cause it'd be a new start for them, but I don't think her mother knows about even half of the stuff that goes on with her life. Before she even moved, in 7th grade she was smoking weed with freshmen in high school. Since I was 14 and nowhere near as mature as I am now, I assumed that this was normal and didn't think too much of it, one of my biggest mistakes. 

However, about five months ago she came down to visit and she basically bragged to me about how she was going to huge parties and smoking weed and alcohol. I'm by no means a saint, but this bugged me that she was starting this so young as I began smoking at 14 and it wasn't good (still do, but only occasionally). I tried to easy my anxiety by saying she's young and it's normal, but then she told me she was partying with literal college students and one had felt her up. She also said that she usually gets crossed to the point where she can't speak or walk straight. At this point, I told her that was incredibly dangerous and someone could have easily raped her. She tried blowing it off by saying she knew everyone, but she literally said there was about 30 people there and I told her there was no way she was aware of each of their intentions. Along with this, she just seems to have gained so many bad traits. We live in the south, meaning there is lots of people who are homophobic, and I think she has many guy friends who have this 'belief' because she told me she doesn't think gay people should be able to marry and it's gross. She also is always criticizing random girls about their looks behind their back and is incredibly two-faced to her friends, something that I really despise in people.

522,"*** I've been off of my bipolar medication for two years and my psychiatrist thinks that I am still taking them

I am currently 26 (M). This is more of a confessional because there is too much to share to stick to one thing.  This will likely be very overwhelming for most people to read. I have made some TREMENDOUS mistakes recently that will haunt me for the rest of my life and I can't afford therapy so I want to share my story here to see what rational people have to say. If you can help me in any way I will be blessed to have the help. 

First off, I now have an established history of mental health problems and drug abuse. I take full responsibility for my actions but I still desperately wish I could go back in time and redo my life with better decisions even though that is not possible. 

(14-18) I spent my high-school years drinking a lot and smoking weed and never took my grades or classes very seriously and almost did not graduate. I always tested high on standardized tests and was regarded as very intelligent at that time but never cared enough about school to actually focus and learn anything beyond what would pass me in the class. I almost did not graduate due to lack of attendance and poor grades. I also worked fast food jobs during these years to pay for my weed addiction. I was prone to cutting myself frequently then and was in complete denial of having any mental health problems and when my parents would arrange for me to see a counselor I would refuse to admit there was anything wrong with me and never continue through with treatment. 

(19-21) After high school I took a job as a dishwasher. I worked my way up to be a line Cook after a year and had hopes of one day being a sous chef or supervisor. One day I had been having back and forth arguments with a newer employee who ended up threatening me with a knife because I wouldn't listen to his instructions on how to cook certain things. He said that if I did not stfu and do what he said he would see me outside after work and flashed me his kitchen knife which he had put in his pocket. Some of my coworkers saw what happened but denied knowing anything when I brought this to the attention of management. Management asked me if I was okay to finish the shift with the person threatening my life and I said that I didn't  think he would do anything in the restaurant so I could probably finish the shift and they said that I must not really be that scared then and refused to discipline the employee. I walked off the job right then and never came back. 

(21) After this was over I became very depressed and did not do much besides play video games for a year and sleep all of the time. At one point I had a severe manic episode where I parked and lost my car in the city in a very bad neighborhood and walked around for hours in the cold. My phone died and I wound up at a Walgreens that called the police and took me to a mental hospital in this bad neighborhood for three weeks. 

At this point I started treatment for anxiety and bipolar disorder. 

I burned through all of my savings not working during the year I spent at home and needed money so at this point so out of desperation I took up a position as a warehouse worker for a large company. 

(22-25) I quickly got promoted to be a supervisor here. I did this work for 3 years and was making about 30K a year. 

The workload became pretty overwhelming during COVID and I had a confrontation with an employee for simply asking him to do his job who ended up pushing me. I told my boss about it and wanted to file a security report and he said he would take care of it but no report was ever filed. I did not come in the next day to work and later that week the manager had me in to meet with him. He asked if I could work another area which I did for one day and then had me file the report with security and at the end of the night I clocked out and did not end up returning to work. 

(26) While I was jobless I frantically applied for jobs online and was willing to take almost any job but I lied on my resume and said that I had an associates degree when in fact I need to finish 4 more classes to receive my degree. I was offered and accepted a position doing customer service for a local business. They have been extremely nice and supportive but my lack of dictation skill and focus caught up to me and I am currently struggling and feel like the worst performer here and have missed a few days of work due to stress and anxiety clouding my ability to think. 

I have been to a primary care doctor only once in the last 8 years which was a few months ago but I did not follow up on with the blood work they asked of me to screen for diseases. 

I have not been to the dentist in two years and at this point have pretty bad breath and looks to be several cavities. 

This is a really bad one. 

I adopted a dog two years ago without any logical concept of how much money it would actually cost to be responsible for their wellbeing and life. My dog has always been cared for with food, water, and exercise and he is in good health. But when we went to the vet after the adoption he would try to bite the vet when they went to administer anything and they were unable to perform blood work. I went back in again with sedatives but he tried to bite them again. He is a large pitbulI. I failed to continue to follow up or seek the proper training. He is not current on vaccines or rabies. He is one year past due for rabies and vaccines and has not been treated for heartworm. 

Another really bad one. 

I recently bought a car at a dealership without discussing the terms. I believe I was manic from receiving the new customer service job and I withdrew all of my 401k money to pay the down payment on the car and am now upside down almost 15k on it because they ripped me off really bad. I did not negotiate and essentially blindly signed for a 35k loan. 

Right now I have been in bed for almost a week doing nothing but watching YouTube videos passively. I've been barely able to feed myself and take my dog out but it cripples me with fear thinking about him biting someone. I am already tremendously in debt due to the car purchase and can really no longer afford him but I am just not sure what to do anymore. 

I know laying in bed is really bad for your health too and I am already a really high risk for heart problems 

I feel like I've made some of the worst decisions of anyone ever. Thank you for reading my story",27Oct2020,1
523,"I feel so alone. So isolated and awful. 

I don’t want to sound like a whiny bitch, but I really need somewhere to vent to or at least somewhere to put my thoughts down and hopefully get some advice because I’m not in a good place right now. I’m 16m (17 in December) and very deep in the closet,from a pretty rural area outside of America (all you need to know is that it is not a good environment for gay people). I’m in a very small school, there is at most 2 semi-out lgbtq people. I have a good amount of friends, but I think most if not all of them would definitely drop me if I ever came out (casual homophobia is a benchmark of most conversations). My parents, (especially my mom) are extremely religious.When marriage equality was passed here I remember her complaining about ‘the gays’ taking over. I love my parents soo much but I don’t think I could ever have a healthy relationship with them while also being out. I do honestly love my parents. 

I just feel very alone everyday. I don’t want to sound too cliche but, everyday I play an act. It’s an act that I committed to playing when I was about 12 and if I stop playing it, I’ll lose everything, but at the same time, playing that act is slowly killing me, making me hollow. It’s like I’m not even inhabiting this world anymore and I’m just floating about. It’s so isolating, and I’ve no one to talk about this to. I’ve cultivated an image of the “rugby lad” but that just isn’t me nor was it ever me, i just use that image as a way to survive, but what the point in surviving if I’m miserable. I feel like I was on the verge of an existential crisis and lockdown just threw me over the edge. I kept saying to myself that once I go back to school, the work will keep my mind from wondering to dark places, but now that I’m in 5th year (which I think is the equivalent of grade 11 in America, but I’m not 100% sure) , the opposite has happened, it just feels worse, and I don’t know what to do. I just want to be myself and to be happy, but I just don’t see anyway I can do that right now. I just feel like my teenage years are slipping away. I had / kinda still have a super crush on this guy that I am close to. Amazing personality, super intelligent , just an incredible person to talk to.. So I try to get closer to him and he turns out to be super homophobic. I just want to be happy, I honestly don’t remember how it feels. 

Basically I’m in a situation where the real me and the me that I present to the world are so drastically different. Not being the real me is killing me slowly, but if I ever showed even the smallest bit of my real personality, my whole world would collapse around me and I’d lose all of my friendships/ family relationships. 
I feel snookered, what do I even do?



I’m sorry if this post doesn’t belong or fit in well on this sub, I encourage the deletion of it if it doesn’t, I just really needed a place to just type out my feelings, because I don’t know how much longer I can go without telling anyone (even if it is a bunch of anonymous redditors) 

Thank you for reading my post, I’m aware of how whiny and long winded it must sound like. Also I’m aware that I’m in no way the only person who has/is experiencing this, so I know I’m not unique, but sometimes it can feel like you’re the only one.  Thank you.",27Oct2020,1

They are extremely rude and loud even when you are on the phone taking calls with clients or other co-workers. They constantly smack their lips and slurp loudly when they drink coffee. Blowing their nose in a handkerchief in our little office and not washing their hands afterwards.

533,"Hi, my (F20) partner (M19) has difficulty receiving affection. 

He grew up in a very unaffectionate and inattentive environment as a kid, and so has lots of difficulties giving affection publicly (which I don't mind) but even more accepting *any* affection. His dad is quite verbally abusive, insulting him and such, and his mother is neglectful, focusing on his elder/younger sisters instead of him.

I, on the other hand, grew up in an environment where care and love were to always be expressed, though it was similar to his in some ways (My mother would have breakdowns fairly often where she expressed a desire to pack up and leave my whole family because we were pigs and my dad prioritised work over my family) it was much more affectionate than his was. Giving gifts, expressing physical and verbal affection, anything you can think of, it's all something I do to show my love for someone. 

I had a conversation with him recently because he seemed down, and he said that the amount I care for him and love him often *hurts* him because he feels indebted to me, that I shouldn't make him gifts, spend money on him, or waste my time on him. He did cheat on me recently during the quarantine by requesting nudes from another person, but I've decided to give him a second chance, which he seems really upset by. (again, feeling indebted) 

In my previous relationship, I was emotionally and verbally abused by the guy I was dating. I would justify every little thing he did with his family situation. I'm still fairly naive, but not to the point I was before. I've learned from my mistakes and won't accept repeated unjust treatment, but at the same time the experience has made me very mild and unaggressive, my patience seems to be unending as well as my ability to forgive. Which also adds to my current partner's feelings of inadequacy. 

Personally, I think he's perfect the way he is, he's always trying to learn from his and others mistakes and grow as a person, and I don't want to stop showing him how much I love him, but I don't want him to feel so horrible about receiving that love.

Is there anything I can do to help him? Should I tone down the affection? Or should I just not worry so much?

TLDR; partner's home situation was really bad so he feels indebted to people he gets affection from, what should I do?",27Oct2020,1

535," I am a 24 year old married man, with a wife, a puppy, and a decent 9-5 job/career, but am having intense urges to play a game again...

I had previously been playing this game for quite a while (Seven Years), and have loved it throughout that long span of time. Despite my deep love of the game, and the joy it brought me to play, I deleted both of my accounts at the beginning of September, because I felt as if it was developing into an addictive habit.

\- I would play as much as I could (Several Hours a Day), if it did not interfere with my life. (Job, Relationship, Family, etc.)

\- After I quit playing for the day, I would enjoy watching Streams/YouTube Videos of League, scrolling through Reddit, etc.

*It seemed as if this was the only hobby/interest that I had at the time, and I thought at times if this was wrong, seeing that I am older, with a job, a wife, etc.*

Since I quit playing League, and deleted both of my accounts, I have been enjoying College Football, console video games, and other things that would pertain more to my age... But nothing compares to the joy that playing one game of League brought me, nothing has even come close.

I miss having a hobby/interest that I truly looked forward too. And to make matters even worse, my long-time friends still play/talk about the game, and have asked me to join them several times. Other than that, we really don't speak/talk that much, which makes it really the only avenue that I can keep in touch with them.

I have been thinking recently, since my urge to play the game has come back, what is the point of living a life that you are just going through the motions, or barley enjoying the things that you call, ""hobbies/interests."" (Football, Woodworking, etc.) I use to look forward to my weekends, but now when they come by, I am just sitting around, trying to enjoy said, ""hobbies.""

I love my wife, dog, and family, and will always cherish the time I have with them, but when it comes to, ""me-time,"" I really have nothing I look forward too.

If I could strike a balance between work, family, and League of Legends, while still having a grasp of topics that pertain to the general public, like College/NFL Football, etc. (Important for my Job Believe it or Not) That would be ideal, but I think that is to much to ask.

I would greatly appreciate help, thoughts on the matter. If I should stay clear of League, or reignite my passion for the game, in a safe manner. If so, how should I regulate my play time, while balancing other important aspects of my life?

She hates this new person in the family. My tito's wife and I'm close to her and all. Were friends. Suddenly,my mom would make ways for me not to talk to her again and shut me off from her so that we wont talk. Ever. I don't like it, really. When i make remarks on things she'd take it too seriously and relate me to the person when, in fact it has always been my attitude. Its like she's just giving attention to me to compare me to the person she hates.

Fast forward like 5 years later she have come to hate my fathers sister and me on the other hand, don't want to butt in on their issues so i spend time to my dad's sister's house, spend time with my cousin and now everything is much worse. 

Whenever i make remarks that might sound rude or ain't rude at all she just blatantly shove her views that i have been really adapting their attitude. I don't really see the problem in what i was saying and they're literally just finding ways to make me look like a big fat attitude adopting kind of person. When in fact, all of those have been my attitude waaay before I spent time with my tita and cousins.

Its like she just starts to pay attention to me when she wants to compare me to people she hates. This sucks.",27Oct2020,1
538,"So, awhile ago i was with someone who i didn't appreciate. At the time, i didn't know how much of a toxic person i was and what that person really meant to me. He was always around.. Always. I just thought there was better, that he wasn't what i wanted. Over time, on the low, my mind was plagued with another guys existence. For he was all i thought he wasn't. He portrayed himself differently.. That's what caught my eye. Aww me and my boyfriend at the time grew apart, i started to hang with the other guy. Whole time me and that ex were broken up, he was always on my mind. Still is. We ended back together &amp;' the one guy i thought was different, was worse. He was always texting other girls, making me look dumb.. &amp;' feel dumb. There was a point in time where i was kicked out and i stayed with him for a week. After, i returned home. When he got kicked out, my initial thought was to help him bc he helped me. Oh boy.. Did i fuck up. This was back in the beginning of April. He's been with my family ever since. Yes, he pays bills. Yes, he's a genuine person. Yes, he works hard, Yes, he's mature... but everyone, even my family fails to realizes, he's toxic. I feel like he stayed.. Over stayed, because he knew me in his sight, he could control me. He is obsessed w me. I try to break up with him.. He'll argue with me, go cry to my mother; then come back to me saying how he's not letting me go. I have a lot of resentment towards him. For he's pressured A LOT on me. I'm only 17. I don't wish to settle down. I say that because i have some emotional scars and toxic ways which must be fixed,alone before i keep giving fake love. He don't understand that and he doesn't care. Not even my family. I feel as if they choose him over me..., because the ways he portrays himself. i don't know what to do anymore... I'm still a lil stuck on my ex. Not to get back with him, but to feel that emotion so i can finally heal. Instead of being masked with love i don't want and love i won't give. What shall i do? I really need help before i just give up. I can no longer bite the bullet. I used to wonder why people did crazy shit to get out some situations...&amp;' that's because in the moment, it's the only way out. Any advice?

540,"For context, i'm a 22M now working full-time from home and she is a 21F still at university, we've been dating for 10 months, the first 2 months were fine and I started to really like the person I was getting to know, she also seemed to like me a lot as well. However, each month after that, she became increasingly more busy to a point where it became insane. She had stuff she had to get done with uni work, with actual work, tests/exams, being the leader of a society and organising a lot of calls and events for it, multiple assignments, lectures she has to catch up on, tasks she has to do for her dad and so on. She has basically given herself so much stuff to do that she is caving in, she is extremely anxious about having to get it all done and it is the only thing she can seem to think about. My country is safe from covid but she doesn't go out for weeks, I am concerned for her mental health and she is obviously under a lot of stress.

Okay, so she is clearly very busy and I am very supportive in turn. However, I literally only see her every 2-3 weeks for a date, sometimes even a month, right now I haven't been able to see her for 2 months because of multiple things getting in the way. She likes me, I like her but she also is so focused, doesn't want to break concentration and isn't ever really even feeling like she wants to talk to me or anyone. These things aren't exclusive to me but she is shutting out all her friends in the exact same ways. I literally only get to talk to her about once a day, a single collection of messages sent to each other, not even read or replied to until 24 hours later, sometimes 48 hours, sometimes longer. Communication is important to me in a relationship and I told her that honestly, I'd look past all of this if she would just actively talk with me for 30 seconds a day, i'd be happy with even 10, we've tried so many things, we've told each other what we are feeling and why things are happening the way they are but it doesn't seem to fix anything since it just reverts to how it was previously after a few days.

She is expected to be like this for another year and a half, she has taken up 5 subjects, the recommended is 4, she is also going to be away for a few months on an internship in the middle of nowhere. She is clearly worried about the future and wants to focus on getting a job but I feel like she can't mentally handle a relationship, we aren't even official yet, I asked her to be my girlfriend but I held off for so long because I was hoping for a sign of change which has still not come.

543,"Okay, so here is the situation. 

My dad (63) has been using Wesing app and he gained virtual friends from there. These past few months I've been noticing that my dad was more techie in a sense that he changes his profile (to his younger photos) and was uploading some photos on his Wesing profile. 

I currently stay in a separate house with (the main house just next door) this quarantine. My mom and other siblings being next door.

At first I did not mind whatever's happening, but lately I have noticed that he was chatting with someone. I saw it cus my dad asked me to help him with something about deleting a convo on his phone and I happen to see a glimpse of a convo ""is it wrong to like someone"" bla bla bla (translated in Eng). Sometime after, my dad asked me to load his phone (yes, prepaid load still exist on my part of the world). His reasoning was that he will call his relative for something IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. Me being suspicious, i decided to load him for just 30 mins of call because assuming that it's his sibling, it would just take a bit.

Lo and behold, he went downstairs and told me he needed more. I ended up giving him unlimited call for the day. 

Days passed and I can still hear him talking to someone. I think they went over to Facebook Messenger to converse now. Anyway, I told about this issue to my sister.  And I just wanted to be 100% sure before I break it to him. I asked her permission for me to snoop around and she gave a go signal. 

Earlier, my sister noticed that my dad was talking to someone and heard the lady's voice. So as of writing, I'll check out his account and try to snoop around. 

Next thing I need to know is on how to confront him about it. I'm really clueless. My older sister told me that it's better if it came from me because I'm closer to my dad. I'm really angry and disappointed at him right now. I don't know what to do.

I had no such problem a few months ago whatsoever and they even made me a shy pooper because I'd rush whenever I entered the toilet to don't make them suspicious.

554,"Ok so I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post this on but I'm going to ask anyway.

So I met this guy in 9th grade and he annoyed me quite a lot, I would go out of my way to ignore him, but I always thought he possibly liked me. At the time I liked somebody else, so I didn't care. But then one day I flat out ignored him. He was standing and he called me from across the room and I looked at him and walked away. I always felt kind of bad about it but at the time I didn't care. Slowly he stopped bothering me and I was okay with that and I still avoided him because I never really knew what to say to him.

Then he got a girlfriend. Someone in my grade. I was slightly offended because I thought he liked me, but again, I didn't really care. Then I started an extra curricular that he happened to be really good at, and he kinda one-upped me while we were doing it and I was super embarrassed and he was kind of just amused. After that I couldn't stop thinking about him.

Then he got a different girlfriend and I started liking him. At this point he spoke to me much less than usual, just a comment every now and then. A few months later he left the school but was still there pretty often for extra curriculars. 

Its been 2 years, I'm in 11th grade now, he has had 2 serious relationships in this time yet I can't get over him. I've tried everything. I haven't spoken to him since he left the school 2 years ago either. I don't know what to do anymore

556,"TL;DR 

I've cut myself off from friends because i feel like I don't belong with them anymore and like our lives are just too different, and experiences too different to justify the friendships

It's a long post so apologies in advance  


I (M22) feel like i've fallen behind my friends lives and that it means there's something wrong with me and that i shouldn't hang around them anymore because of it. I've always struggled with my self esteem, and i'm on a waiting list to see my psychologist about this but I just feel it's spiralling out of control faster than i can manage.   


I recently got some time to hang out with them again, and we went indoor rock climbing. Now a thing to know about me is I've put on a non-trivial amount of weight and lost a lot of my fitness, while they've managed to keep themselves active and fit. So I just was just not able to keep up with them at all. I pushed myself as hard as i physically could to do the things they were doing, but after 3 walls I was spent, and they kept going for another 5 walls while i was forced to watch. They didn't actively exclude me, but I felt horrible and because they were both climbing I wasn't able to engage much.  
We followed this up by going back to one of their places, and we played games they both liked that i wasn't any good at/didn't personally like, and just kinda talked, although it was much more them talking about their life experiences and me listening, not being able to add anything. (For context one had been over seas for a solo trip, and both have done things I've either been unable to do, or too afraid of doing). Listening to it all, instead of being happy for them and basking in the stories, i just straight up felt jealous. One of the largest things to me, which isn't objectively big, is having sex. I've never done it because I've never really been close with anyone physically or emotionally, I also didn't know one of them had sex in the first place, and through my own projection I thought they were like me. So that was quite a shock, and being able to hear them both talk about something i had no experience in, for the entire night felt rather alienating, and with the few attempts i made to change the subject to something i could talk about to, it would always shift right back to something else. Needless to say, by the end of the night I felt miles and miles away from these people.   


Add to this I recently had a friendship collapse, who is best friends with both of these people, and i just couldn't help but feel more and more isolated. The straw that broke the camels back (proverbially) was that the very next night, one of those friends snapchatted me while they were drinking, and was joking about hooking me up with a male friend, while they know i have no interest in that.  


So I made a choice, admittedly in a bad headspace, to cut off all contact. I deleted my Snapchat account, deactivated my facebook and instagram, and basically any form of contact that wasn't SMS or phone was gone. And it still is. I've actively kept the accounts shut down even though i feel so very isolated. So i recognise the signs that i'm actively not helping myself by doing it, but to some degree believe that it helps free them from my presence and that it's a good thing.   


I guess the advice i'm seeking is more perspective based. Am i right to try and let these friendships die and find people who are more alike me? Am I completely off base and need to apologise? Something else? Or even if you have advice on how you handle feeling like the 5th wheel on a bike. or like you witness the vibe but destroy it by being there. Honestly anything would help

33, looking on it had GERD since childhood, my teeth are a wreck (blamed on sweets and soft drinks), had persistant cough and sore throat a lot of my life, always blamed on allergies and heartburn.

Fairly heavy drinker since 18.

Also big coffee drinker.

Diet isn't great either.

Not overweight though 😃

Night sweats and low grade fever started a year ago but were brushed off my my GP, bloods all normal, no raised glands etc.

Sat down a few weeks ago, long time after eating and had massive aching discomfort just below my sternum, this did not get better after downing milk which has been my go-to for years.

Looking back over the last 6 months, beer in particular has been hard for me to drink in any quantity without feeling nauseous.

Current symptoms:

Sore throat.
Pain swallowing deep down.
Hacking cough originating from deep in chest when I eat or drink.
Difficulty swallowing due to discomfort deep down
Hot flushes.
Persistent pain under my breast bone, not associated with eating.

Haven't eaten for a few days now, symptoms are just the same. Losing weight fast.

The cough and persistent pain worry me the most, and the fact that I've had this all my life but never this.

Endoscopy is next Friday, need to get through to then, instead of being the absolute mess I am right now, basically bedridden!!

No-one can tell me I'm low risk with my history but if lots of people can tell me that they've lived a similar life then that would help I think!

567,"Context:

I'm a mexican young adult (currently 23) and I have a Graphic Design Degree and a technical in Theatre, wich is also my more developed profession. I've been in different stages and states, and in theatre festivals and even I've been paid very good for a while. (Bad times came and my jobs and plays got away).

The last year (2019) I decided to move from my mother's house (the East of the country) to Tijuana (the West) to study another technical degree in Contemporary Dance, to be finished in June or July of 2021. I paid my life there with a little help of my fam and friends, but 80% was all me. But then Covid-19 came and my studies and training passed to be online. (Which it sucks, because, you know, it's DANCE not math or words, but movement).

So I came back in April and I've been studying here since then.

But our teachers and our school made miracles and THEY SAID that WE will be back in January next year (2021) unless the Covid gets very bad again. But my family doesn't support me. My mother tells me that the pandemic is not over, and my brother thinks I am a selfish person because, if I go, my mom and dad would be so worried all the time, and if I get sick, they couldn't do anything from where they are and that 

And I don't know what to do. Because I'm not happy in here, and my studies suck in here, I need the contact, the movement, to be with people and tell stories through my body and words. Probably the pandemy won't finish soon, and even if I go back to Tijuana and keep myself training and in reharsals and all, I won't be on stage until 2022 or something like that. And it sucks but I will be with my classmates, and moving, and keeping myself strong and wealthy.

But also... If I go, my mother (whit hipertension and anxiety) maybe will be worried all the time. She never thought or thinks that I'm going to be fine as an artist in life, and constantly tells me that I should be working a full-time job in design or even study something more ""productive"". And my brothers tells me that I have to leave hedonism and adapt to the times I'm on, and still online, and still in house. Also they talk about the economy, the risks to get sick, etc...

So, I don't know what to do. If I go, I'll be happy and my family will be unhappy. If I stay, I will make my family happy but I will be unhappy. My family don't believe in me, and I'm depressed because they still thinking that my career doesn't worth the risk. I just feel so alone.",27Oct2020,1

569,"Hey! This is my first ever post so I hope I’m doing this right. I’m 19(F), and I’ve had a pretty cool life up until now. But when I realized I’m turning 20 this year, my head swirled into some pretty bad places. I’m currently serving in the military (it’s mandatory in my country. I was discharged at the start of the process, but I volunteered to serve because I didn’t want to seem weird for not enlisting). I have a whole year of service ahead of me, and I feel like I’m waiting for my life to begin. I feel like I haven’t used my teenage years to the fullest, I wanna do so much more. 20 feels a decade away, when it’s just around the corner. I can’t put into words how sad I get when I think about it. I know I’ve done many ‘cool teenage’ things, but I still feel like I haven’t found myself yet. I still wanna do stupid things and I’m afraid that people are gonna look at me differently. I’m scared I’m gonna feel different, or force myself into a mature person I don’t want to be. My main questions are - is it really that much of a change? Does that feeling go away? Should I leave the military and try to find myself, even though so many people around me will stop talking to me? Thank you for you time❤️",27Oct2020,1

571,"My friend and her wife moved in with me and my partner a week ago because of money issues. We’re offering them lower rent for 6 months-one year so they can get back on their feet and not be homeless. 

My friend is disabled and neurodivergent, and has been crying a lot lately. I don’t want to get in to what her specific personal issues are, but she has PSTD, and we even talked about trying to be respectful of her triggers before she moved in. She doesn’t always want to talk about what’s bothering her so I’ve been leaving her alone and respecting her privacy. 

However I’m a very sensitive person with anxiety and her crying is definitely affecting my ability to relax in my own home. Especially when I can hear it in the privacy of my personal space. I worry that I said something wrong to upset her and she might be shutting me out. Or it could have nothing to do with me and my anxiety is just trying to convince me that I did something wrong. My partner and I also follow her on Twitter so we can occasionally see her posting about suicidal ideation and crying while working from home. 

I feel helpless and anxious and don’t know what to do. I can’t force her to talk to me about what’s bothering her and I don’t want her to feel like she has to contain her emotions. I’m not very close to her wife and don’t feel comfortable asking her for help behind my friend’s back. I can use earplugs to ignore her crying but that doesn’t always help because I know she’s upset in the other room. I’m afraid to leave my room sometimes because I don’t want to be affected by her emotions.

That before I get into anything serious I want to fuck around as much as I can.

For way too long I felt I should stay a virgin till Marriage.
Then I learnt that is the one of the stupidest thing I can do. Well Ok, I mean I can hope to not if there's someone out there who hasn't either.

Well It's not worth waiting for marriage or so I have heard. And people will fuck around. That includes your future wife and husband.
And Retroactive Jealousy is a big motherfucking bitch. 

I used to think losing your Virginity is a special thing to occur between spouses.

I used to think having firsts would be something to celebrate among spouses.

I used to think, ""Soulmates"" are destined to be so there's no need for having exes and I should just wait for it...

NOPE.

574,"Quick run down of my last 6 months...

1. Living out of country  teaching English (not my favorite job but interesting experience)

2. Get into first real relationship, then promptly set 🔥 to it because that just what you do right 

3. Come back on holiday break to parents house just as Corona hits, so now it is more of a permanent situation + evicted from my apartment abroad (lose all my possessions that I didn’t pack)

Now I am being told to get a job and to leave, but the problem is I don’t know where to go or what to pursue. I was thinking maybe college, but I don’t have any idea what I’d do in there. To be honest the only thing appealing to me right now, is suicide. I avoid talking to everyone and although being a mute is a really poor idea, I don’t see an alternative. I think that is just what being older is like. You don’t get more mature you just learn to bottle it.

I have an option to move out to Idaho and live at my grandparents for a couple of months until I can get the funds for an apartment. But I don’t want to leave my hometown, or move to ID after being gone so long, I don’t really have too much of an attachment for it now. But I feel when I left two years ago that I was running away from the people here. Like I could never connect with anyone, and leaving although it has helped me become more mature, I can’t shake the feeling that I won’t be a complete person if I can never thrive in my hometown. My friends here have all moved on in some ways, and others have changed too much and I’m not sure if they are they same anymore.

I don’t know why I wrote this, I just feel trapped without any help. No one wants to hear about this kinda stuff around here, and if they do then it was a mistake telling that person. Any advice or comment is appreciated. God Bless 🙏

Recently I pulled my money from the joint account I hold with my parents, and they are now trying to take me to court for the amount of money they put into the account (marginally less than what I put in) as well as for the amount of everything they’ve paid since I was 18 (insurance, phone, etc). It will most likely be small claims court, but should I be worried? I’ve already offered to pay them back for what they put in the joint account if they sent me an itemized list of each transaction they made, but they will not send me that.

589,"Hi all,

Current college kid here. I’m currently a junior, studying engineering at a university during the pandemic. 

It’s horrible here, I can’t think, I feel like I can’t breathe, I’m failing my classes bc of online learning and my mental health is probably the worst it’s ever been. All I have been told is that “you knew what you were getting into” and that’s about as much support as I’ve been able to find, aside from people telling me to drop courses. I pretty much call my mom every day on the brink of tears about how horrible I feel. I was using the crisis text line yesterday because I was having a panic attack about being here, and being so stressed about classes.

But even while it’s horrible here, college provides me a safe space from living at home, where I was this past summer, and was one of the most stressful experiences of my life. Between constant fighting, the police, and everything that happens at home, I don’t think I could even handle being home again. I even have stress induced hair loss from being home last winter and summer.

I don’t know what to do next semester or even over winter break, I have a job as an RA and if I leave, I lose my job, but I don’t have anywhere I really can go, I can’t go home again.  But at the same time I feel like I’m wasting my education, this isn’t learning, it’s regurgitating just enough to pass, and I’m miserable. Also my only close friend on campus isn’t going to be here next semester so I’m just going to be even more alone.

I just don’t know what to do, everyday I just feel like I’m trapped in a corner because I don’t have a place where I feel comfortable, or even just happy. I have a therapist and have been talking to her for months because I lost some people in my life, but sometimes I feel like it just doesn’t help.

Everyday I feel like I get up just to fall down the second I start. 

I just don’t know what to do at all, I’ve talked to the Dean of Students, I’ve talked to my boss, I’ve talked to my friends, and I still have no idea what options may even be.

591,"Hi, I hope you all are well. I made this post because I'm looking for some advice for my future.  I am from Eastern Europe. I finished HS this year. Now I'm at a crossroads. I have 2 options for my future. 

The first option is me studying medicine in my country to become a doctor. This is my safe choice. It would take hard studying for many years, but I would have a relatively good life secured by my parents while I'm studying. Plus, I'd be in a very familiar environment where I've grown up in. The cons for this would be that I would remain in my poor EE country and not go out to explore life. My salary would also be sub-optimal.

The second option would be for me to study in the US. I have been admitted into a state school along with a scholarship ""honors"" status. It would still cost me around 7k$ a year but it would be covered by my parents. I would be studying Computer Engineering with the choice of also adding in a Physics double-major and staying 1 more year(5 total). The pros of this choice would be that I would be getting a good education and diploma that would allow me to find a job in the US or other Western countries paying a good amount.   I would be going to a foreign country and exploring a new culture. The problem is that while staying in the US, my legal standing would be delicate, and finding a job after graduation in this market would be very hard. There is a very high chance of me having to go back to my home country if I don't find a job within 60 days, which would defeat one of my main purposes trying to emigrate to a better country.  I am scared of the economic situation and would not like to have my studies go to waste by not being able to find a job. Internship opportunities are also scarce right now as far as I've read online.

595,"This is a very long post and I apologize for it.. TLDR at the bottom. 

My best friend from kindergarten (F late 20s) has 2 young sons (7 and 5) and a boyfriend (m mid 30s). 

My friend has been through a lot in the past 5 years. Her husband and the father of her two children died in a car crash about 3 years ago. Shortly after she started dating her boyfriend. They have been together about 2 or so years. 

At first things were fine I believe and recently she has been messaging me and calling me with problems they have been having.  She says that they argue so much and she says he keeps bringing up her husband that died in the wreck says horrible things about him and how he is so much better than he is than her husband. 

I knew her ex husband as he was my good friend since we were kids as well. He was not a horrible person. He had his flaws, but he was a much better man than the person she is with today.

He told her that if she didn't change her last name and her kid's last name to his he would leave her. Keep in mind that they are NOT married yet. She told him no and he went on and on about it. Eventually he finally dropped it. That was the first red flag that something is ""off"" about him. 

During an informal memorial for my sister, he showed up drinking alcohol from a cup. Her child interrupted him in the middle of saying something and he told him ""shut up or I'll knock the piss out of you."" That did not sit well with my husband for talking to a child especially that was his like that. That was the second red flag.

A few months ago she called me crying saying that she was about to leave and said he was acting crazy talking about he was going to shoot all of them. He wasn't there at the time and she didn't believe he would do it but hid the guns in the shed just in case. She also told me that he left bruises all over her oldest son and sent me pictures of his throat where you could see clear hand prints like he was choking him. 

He also calls her a ""fat bitch"" and says he will go ""fuck someone else."" She said he said he said was going to take her car and run it into a ditch and kill himself. He didn't realize I was on the phone during one of their arguments and I heard him kick their poor puppy and it whimpered for the longest time. My husband at the time was listening so he is my witness. 

After everything calmed down he begged and pleaded with her not to go saying his anger was caused by the new medication changes and he went to rehab for 1 day and check himself out. I wanted to call DHS that time, but I didn't because of her. I did inform her family and they understood the severity of it and took her sons for a few days. She continued to stay with him because she believed his medicine made him do it. I wasn't buying it. 

Last week she messaged me and told me to help her look for places to rent in the same area she's at since her son is enrolled in school there. I was excited, but had a feeling she wouldn't really leave. She told me he punched her in the face and she punched him back. She said she was done arguing in front of the boys and had to go. She also said he threatened to run her car into the ditch again. After all of that I assume he came back to the house because she stopped texting me so much.

I gave her a code word just in case something bad happens and I need to call the police. She finally told me that he went to the hospital and tested positive for Covid and had papers proving it so they had to quarantine. Her aunt found a house for them to move into it, and was ready for her to go. She hasn't messaged me much but said the boys tested negative. She hasn't said anything else about moving so I assume she's not. 

I should have called DHS the first time she didn't leave after he threatened her and put his hands on her son, but I contacted her parents and her mom told me her father would deal with it. How can I go about contacting them without her hating me? Would they do anything without physical evidence (bruising is healed but I have pictures).

596,"So I’ve never really had friends, or the friends I’ve had had had better friends that they like more, I have ASD so people usually find me either really hard to manage or really annoying and weird so I struggle to make friends, there’s only one person who I’ve remained friends with over the last 11 years. Because of this, I’ve adjusted to either paying for things or organising things that I want to do with people, so people actually hang out with me. This has caused me to get very happy when people are actually grateful for it. My current friends aren’t like other friends I’ve had at all, not only are they super understanding with my ASD, but they also like doing things with me. Originally, it started with me buying games to play with them (because we can’t really do anything due to COVID), but then their happiness started to make me very happy and now it’s gone further than that and I basically spend more money on my friends than I do on myself (after I pay rent and bills and whatnot). Yesterday, I was on steam and I decided that I wanted to buy my three friends and I a 4 player game (at $20 each) because it looked like fun and I thought they would enjoy it. When I told that friend I mentioned earlier about it, she got mad and told me that I should be spending my money on myself, I responded and said that I get just as much happiness out of them getting things and being happy as I would getting things for myself. I mentioned to her that I gave her the same amount of money the day before to get food while she was at work and she got mad at me because “she just wanted to eat”, she then said it’s kinda manipulative cause now my friends probably think they can’t not be friends with me cause they owe me friendship.

597,"As a kid, I was ""gifted."" So, I excelled and did well-above average, and second, third, fifth, and eleventh grade were all considered ""severely below my level."" Ergo, I was only 15 when I entered college in 2006. The following year, I realized I was gay.

I had never been attracted to men. Every ""crush"" I ever had was on other girls. I was clearly a lesbian. But I've kept it as a secret ever since. I haven't even told my family or friends. I just tell everyone I'm straight but don't care about relationships.

In October of 2018, I attempted to kill myself. Long story short, my parents were emotionally abusive and I was too socially inept to make friends as a kid, so in 2011, I began spending my free time doing ""childish"" things to make up for it, leading to my neighbors despising and smearing me as a pedophile trying to lure in victims (patently false, I would kill myself out of guilt and shame if I ever touched a kid innappropiately.)

I survived, and made a vow to live life to the fullest and not let anyone stop me from having fun. That same month, I vowed to come out as gay before I turned 30. I was 27. My birthday is January 8.

Time is running out, and I don't know why I'm so scared to come out. Me and my friends hug, give eachother raspberries, and even kiss on the lips. I still eat cotton candy, mac n' cheese, apple juice, etc. I still watch cartoons like Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and We Bare Bears. I still wear tutus, overalls, and lace-up boots.

I know my friends would accept me. One of them is a transgender woman. They were a popular jock in high school, and began transitioning in their first year of college (and they look prettier and more feminine than most women I know!) What should I do? How should I overcome this fear?",27Oct2020,1

Usually, I can manage with anxiety symptoms and keep myself under control, but lately it has escalated to panic attacks. He is rude and aggressive, and not very accommodating. I have told him before that I suffer from anxiety and specifically struggle with working on the phones and offered to provide medical documentation as well, to which he declined.

603,"Moved into an apartment (me and gf, if it matters) in Richmond Va. a few months ago. Lease is for the first floor only. Lease says we pay all electric, water, sewer. Fine. 

According to people in the upstairs unit--and seemingly the landlord--turns out the first floor person also pays utilities for the basement. Basement has hot water heater, (gas?) furnace, washer/dryer. All tenants are allowed to use facilities in the basement.

Additionally, Landlord's lawn mower contractor apparently uses a horrifying toilet in the basement that barely has its own stall. My unit has had water pressure issues/flow issues for weeks. Landlord goes into the basement today and finds that the toilet down there has been running for several weeks since that person was last here and used it. Ostensibly, we are paying for it running constantly over the past few weeks and had no idea.

We do not have control over the basement, yet apparently pay for the utilities. It is not in the lease that we are responsible for paying the basement utilities. We have been paying utilities for the basement for three months so far.

Anyone have previous experience? Don't know if I want to try to go nuclear and break the lease or go to court but this is certainly not fair and/or stealing.

Thank you so much.",27Oct2020,1

605,"All my life I’ve been told to go to college and society and the people around me make it seem like those who don’t will automatically fail at life and be looked down upon. I just graduated high school and i’m my first semester at a community college. I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life and I never had a true passion for anything, but my parents and teachers have always told me that I NEED to go to college. I always obeyed that and never questioned it until a couple weeks ago. I recently fell in love with videography and editing and for the first time in my life, I’m actually passionate about something that could potentially be a career path for me. However, my only problem now is college. 

I struggle with learning in the American school system. I learn absolutely nothing from homework, especially when it’s a subject I don’t care about. In the short span of two weeks that i’ve been studying videography, i’ve learned so much in just a few hours a day where I’m free to watch youtube videos and experiment in editing software at my own pace. I work two jobs currently, six days a week, while attending online colleges classes. Despite this, my newfound passion has found a way to squeeze itself into my daily life. Yes, I know college is an amazing resource and I think it’s great for people who are able to learn that way. However, I’m not one of those people. I genuinely think that I’m much better off without going to college.

My biggest current obstacle is my parents. They’re second generation Asians, whom “did not have the opportunities I have,” which is why I “need to go to college.” I understand this completely. Their parents (my grandparents) weren’t fortunate enough to send them off to college and out of all 14 of the brothers and sisters on both sides of the family, my mother is the only one with a college degree. I know they want the best for me, which is why they want me to go to school.

What do you guys think? Is college really necessary? How should I convince my parents to see from my perspective? The best possible solution I can think of is to make a video for them before the start of the next semester that convinces them to let me live my dream.",27Oct2020,1
606,"This is long so sorry. I(f) had a best friend (m) for years. He was the only one I could talk to without worrying about judgement or my secrets getting out. He was really everything to me, we never fought, we always had fun. And we loved each other. We were never physical. I went through a bad break up and he introduced me to his (M) best friend. Him and I hit it off and had kids got married. My best friend and I lost touch due to him and my husband falling out. I realized far too late I was in love with my best friend. We haven't spoke or seen each other in 4-5 years and last time we did speak we agreed we would always be each other's ""the one that got away"" but I still feel that I'm in love with him. Like every choice I made the past seven years has been one huge mistake and I don't know how to fix any of this. I am terrified to even message my old best friend, I don't want to interrupt his life or cause trouble. I just want to know if feels the same way as I do. Or at least if he's happy.

609,"The story goes as the title says. We’ve had experiences on and off for the past 2 or so weeks. I’ll recount what’s happened so far. 

Incident #1- 2 weeks ago- 3 people in the apartment: Roommate (E), Me (L), and my SO (C). 

C comes to stay with me on a Saturday night. E told me she was planning on having a guy over, but that he wouldn’t be over until late. C and I retire to my bedroom to watch a movie around 9 pm, and don’t come out to the common area at all before bedtime. At about 4:00 am, I heard our front door unlock and open. (I was already awake) My roommate has an erratic schedule with sleep and studying because she’s an engineer, and the guy is also an engineer, so I assume it’s them. I then heard a male voice whispering, and footsteps over to her door. It was quiet for about 10 minutes, and then I hear footsteps back over to the front door, the door opening, and then locking. 

The next day I ask if that was the guy. She said the guy never came because he flaked, saying his mom was sick with COVID. C was the only person in the apartment with a male voice, and was fast asleep next to me. I don’t know who was in the apartment. 

I can’t recall if the deadbolt was locked, but since my roommate has a stalker with breaking and entering on his record I always make sure it is before bedtime. The deadbolt was still locked in the morning when I checked.


Incident #2- A few days ago- only E and I were at home. 

E was awake in her room, on FaceTime with her friends at 3:30 am. I was asleep in my bedroom. Front door is locked and deadbolted, I’m pretty sure. E heard the door unlock and SLAM open. Her friends on FaceTime comment on it. She hears footsteps walk over to her door. She gets her gun. She hears a male voice whispering, and after 10 minutes of silence, hears the front door shut and lock again. I was asleep the entire time. She told me based on the sound of things she expected for the place to be totally wrecked because it seemed like they were “looking for something”, though nothing was taken.


Incident #3- Last night- only E and I at home. 

Now paranoid at this point, I suggest we prop a chair under the door handle to buy us time before we can get cameras. There is NO WAY this door would budge since the chair is metal and I slid the doorknob at an angle in between the bars as I propped it up. Door was locked and deadbolted with the chair propped. We would’ve heard them struggling with the door, or at the very least, the sliding of the chair. My roommate texted me asking me if I was in the living room at 6:00 am. I was asleep. 

I think she is asleep now and hasn’t given me any other details from last night, but I know she must’ve heard something or someone in here. I will update when she wakes up. 

Also, a similar thing has happened recently with a friend of hers also living in this complex in a 4-bedroom unit. They don’t know anything either.

614,"I’ll try to make this story short. My best friend from high school moved in with me and my parents about 10 months ago after her father was sent to jail. Her childhood dog, who is a rather large dog, was sent to live with a different friend of ours because my parents did not want the responsibility or liability that this dog could bring. My friend was okay with this because she now had a comfortable place to call home and she knew her dog was in good hands. 
Fast forward to the summertime after my friend graduates high school. We started looking for an apartment together to get out of my parents house. My mom had to be a co-signer and her one stipulation was that the dog could not come. Our apartment isn’t even 900 square feet and he’s lived outside his whole life so his living situation would be less than comfortable anyways, so my friend reluctantly agreed to keep him with the same family in our hometown 30 minutes away. 
After about 2 months, this family could no longer take care of her dog because their son who had been taking care of him was moving across the country for school. She had known about this for a while but had not made an effort to find a new place for him. It came down to the day her friend was supposed to leave for college and she calls me begging to let her dog stay at our place for just a few days until she could figure something out. A few days turned into a few weeks which turned into a month. I stayed on her about finding him a new home before my mom found out and she always had a new excuse. Eventually I told her that if she paid the pet deposit, we could keep him and hide it from my mother. I now realize this was a mistake, but I’ve gone too deep now. 
This was two months ago now and she has yet to pay the pet deposit and blames it on finances but will buy vapes, tattoos, and all kinds of other unnecessary things every day. The dog is starting to make my house smell and he’s torn up her bedroom door. She only takes him out two or three times a day for more than 15 minutes even though he was used to living outside for 5+ years. I know that living with a dog is only going to get worse at this point. I even heard from a mutual friend not long ago that my roommate had never planned to find a new home for her dog in the first place and was going to keep him in our apartment until I finally caved in and let him stay. By the time I found out it was over a month later and I didn’t want to start a conflict, so I never said anything about it even though it hurt that she would disrespect me like that. My mom still doesn’t know that her dog is living with us, but she made the comment the other day while we were all together for dinner about how she would never co-sign for my brother if he had a dog. We only live 30 minutes for my parents so I know it’s only a matter of time before they try to come visit. 
I’m now facing the conflict of whether or not I should tell my friend that it’s time to seriously find her dog a new home. On one hand I feel like a super shitty friend for making her give up the only family she has left but on the other hand I don’t want to disrespect my mother (who did not have to co-sign for me in the first place) and I feel like it’s unfair that he’s trapped inside all day anyways. What the hell do I do??",27Oct2020,1
615,"When I began college, I started hanging out with a group of people, and we had a blast together. For the first year, we became (what I thought to be) good friends, but close to the end of the year I was going through a lot mentally and really doubting my course and what I wanted to do. Those were rough times, and I did distance myself a bit from everyone, but I still liked hanging out with this group. I did go through a quite depressive period, and I noticed two of my friends (that I thought to be more close with) were slowly distancing themselves from the rest of the group (but not from me, apparently, as they stated). We had to do an assignment for a class and, to this point, I had hardly attended the class and was near my breaking point. I realized everyone in our group had formed groups for the assignment, and I had to ask these friends if I could join them, which they accepted. That same day, I remember finally bawling my eyes out, being so unhappy with my career choice, and feeling completely lost. My mom helped me calm down, and I reached out to these two friends to apologize for even asking them to join and explained in a long message that I was very unhappy and was changing career paths, probably following a different course (I would still be in the same university and campus - here, you have to choose your course before starting, so I´d have to start new classes from the beginning), and that I once again was sorry for the inconvenience, and just wanted to let them know and that I wished them luck on the assignment. To my shock... they never replied. After a year of friendship and explaining how I felt - which was quite difficult for me-, they just left me on read. I never understood what happened, or if they were mad at me. I saw them again in person several times after, and they barely recognized my existence but didn't seem mad or annoyed, just indifferent. They remained friends with a few from the rest of the group (since they were all in the same course), as did I,  since  I don´t believe in discarding friends like that, lmao. They never talked to me or reached out again, and I never understood what really happened. Now, I've really moved on, and am much happier in my career path, but sometimes I wonder how someone could just ""ghost"" a one year friendship like that... and if I should at least reach out to ask ""what happened?"".

617,"She thinks her shit doesn't stink and everyone wants to be her (or at least that's how she acts towards everyone).

She is so dumb you have to overly explain every fucking thing to her. Literally everything. She's just incompetent or incapable of understanding anything. Like even a joke, you'll tell her and 99% of the time she doesn't get it bc she's so fucking stupid.

She also is lazy and basically does nothing all day. If a task arises she just sends an email out to everyone saying ""not sure who this should go to"" when its actually her fucking job. So not only is she conceited, self-absorbed and self-righteous, she is lazy too so she can spend as much time as possible talking at people about herself. She's made it 8 years here, don't ask me how she still has a job bc I could not tell you.

She basically only talks about how great she is. If you're mentioning something work-related she will just interrupt you and start talking over you about some way shape or form in which she is so ""great"". Or about her kid. Like nobody fucking cares this conversation is about an issue at work like stfu about your kid. Lol

Also she is very uppity about herself and judgemental about others. The following is one example that really just rubs me the wrong way and throws me over the edge: 

Backstory about her: She had a kid at 19 and she bought some foreclosed home with her baby daddy for like 40k, her dad even paid the dp, and brags 24/ 7 about how ""she"" bought a house at 22. However I have a hard time seeing this, as all she really did was have a kid, have her dad pay a dp on her behalf, and split the remainder with her baby daddy..... Its a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom basically shanty in the middle of the ghetto too. Like literally nobody cares lol, nobody is jealous unless maybe someone is living in an even smaller home down her road or something.

(So, more recent backstory about me: long story short, my parents decided to sell their home so I had a chance to basically get a 380k home for like 50k. I didn't even mention prices, numbers, money, family discount. Just mentioned I'd be moving so would need a couple days off.

She starts prying me for details, when I don't give in she starts talking about how she's so happy she has a home and doesn't have to move etc etc. How she is so stable and how she doesn't have to worry about anything, blah blah blah, cuz, ya know, her life is so ""great""..... 

Finally she asks for pictures for the 100th time and I'm sick of her even talking to me so I show her the house. She starts carrying on about how the house looks out of my budget etc asking me if I have a night job nobody knows about (told you she's a hating ass bitch) so I cave and tell her its actually my parents house, they're selling it, and I put in an offer. 

She goes on and on about how she doesn't think i can afford the house (like she knows the bills for the house and has access to my bank account or something lol), asking me if they just gave it to me ( I wouldn't answer, its not her business what I pay) and how it ""must be so nice to have handouts"" and how she ""works for everything she has or has ever had"" (Remember how she got her house lol) but whatever. Ok great. So do I, my parents just happen to inherit basically a fucking mansion and they're moving there. Their old house is close to where they're moving so they wanted me to live near them; they knew I couldn't afford it so they were going to give it to me for a steal. I literally never mentioned the value of the home or what I will pay for it.)

So now, 6 months after this, her baby daddys father is moving and selling his house to her and her baby daddy. With her most loathed thing imaginable: a discount.

ALL SHE HAS BEEN FUCKING TALKING ABOUT IS ""MONEY-MONEY-MONEY; NUMBERS-NUMBERS-NUMBERS. Like, imo that is just acting like total trash. Also nobody fucking cares. I don't think she realizes how stupid she sounds acting like a big shot over a handout, the same type of help she was talking so much shit about when it wasn't happening to her.

She's saying she can get 110k for her house (good for her) but she's just constantly mentioning how she's getting a 150k house (the new house) for 110k because its her baby daddys father. 100k this, 110k that.... I swear she says ""hundred thousand this or that"" every other breath she takes. That and ""free equity"" 90 times an hour.

Like also, we live in NYS, so that should show you how ghetto this fucking area she lives is. 350k is a cheap house in NYS, at least where I'm at. And all she ever does is boast about it.

So every 5 seconds its ""thousands of dollars this"" and that. Like I'm happy she's excited, but after all the shit she was talking about me when I wasn't even mentioning anything money related, I really don't want to hear about anything she has to say lol. Like she couldn't be happy for anybody else but she wants us to all swoon over her life? How fucking trashy is she?!?!?

Like idk why she thinks she's so great but it's so annoying. Like good for her that she's excited but after putting everyone else down 24/7, and were all doing better than her, now she thinks we want to hear about her life? Literally, nobody fucking cares lol

Sorry but you couldn't pay me enough to get pregnant at 20, give up going to college, having fun, traveling, all this shit to live in the middle of the ghetto with my kid at the mercy of my baby daddy, looking to my dad to help pay for my place to live.... I'm really not sure what there is to brag about in her mind? I'm happy she isn't starving and whatnot but after her being so bitchy to me 24/7 I really don't give a fuck about her or what she's doing tbh.

Meanwhile, her appearance doesn't help my level of annoyance at her attitude. Normally appearance wouldn't be on my list of things to insult, but I feel its relevant here, as she acts like she's so hot and everyone wants to be her:

She has one of those smiles that's half gums and half chicklet teeth, a huge equilateral triangle shaped shnozz and huge pillow eyebags under her squinty eyes (she is Polish, she just has disproportionately small eyes). Also quite overweight, at least 30 lbs, and she wears overly tight clothes and struts around literally stomping in her heels. Like her sweaters stretch out in between the buttons and whatnot. She has a round ass but thats about all she's got going for her. She also acts like she has the best ass in the world and you can see her cellulite rippling on her ass and thighs because of her overly tight clothes. Like cellulite itself isn't gross but the way she struts it around in her overly tight clothes isn't very appealing, to put it nicely.

Idk I don't want to stoop to her level and I also don't feel comfortable talking about money/ numbers, so I def wouldn't ever say anything regarding that.

Also I don't want to be mean to her but I honestly wonder sometimes, what exactly is she bragging about? What exactly does she think she has that we want? (Work with 3 other girls, were all the same age).

It's like being on the bus with the kid who is bragging about being in 6th place on the softball team to the people who made the top 5. I just don't get it.

Tl; Dr (and also, disclaimer): I don't think I'm better than her I just don't want her life. Different strokes for different folks and I'm happy with my choices and my life. I am just very, very sick of hearing about how my coworker thinks she's so great and her boasting about things that apparently are horrible unless she's the one to have/ do them.

620,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 16 years now and I love him very much. Two years into our relationship he broke down and admitted he was suffering from anxiety and depression. I have been there for him during this time.

He has been to see therapists and tried to deal with his problems, but they keep coming back. It's not like this all the time, he has time periods where everything seems fine, but he gets very regular spells of anxiety.

I have done my best for him through the years, I've been there as a sympathetic ear but it's taxing.  We have two kids, aged 2 and 7, and they're more of a priority now. I work, he works, and I don't have the time to look after and be there as a constant companion during his bad times, as I could do 10 years ago. I need to be a mother to the kids too.

I also worry about how this is impacting the children. When we first had kids he wanted to do his best to keep his problems invisible from the kids, so it doesn't upset them and affect them, and he tries. However, it's hard and I think they often know that he's not always happy and our seven year old (OB) seems sad as a result. The two year old is probably too young When he's upstairs trying to meditate or just let things pass, as the bad times come, I try to tell OB that he's busy or napping, but he's not daft. It happens fairly regularly and he often seems downbeat and different, even if he tries hard, and I think OB knows given they seem downbeat at this time.

It's all so much and I have realised how much it affects me. I don't know what to do any more. I have work commitments, parenting commitments and I want some degree of a personal life away from my job, kids and caring for him. It leaves me feeling stranded and an event last Friday has left me deeply concerned about my own mental state.

Work was stressing me and he ended the working day depressed and downbeat, as he has been for a while. I was left dealing with the kids and he did nothing because he didn't do anything other than try and relax in his room, while I cooked and ensured the kids were ok and not running amok that night.

I don't want to make it sound like he's a lazy father. He's not most of the time. He changed nappies, he does housework, cooks and does a lot of stuff, but sometimes he doesn't feel up to it. I volunteer to do  it, because it's my way of helping, but the stress of Friday had got to me and I was annoyed and fed up of having to live like this. I am concerned for him, myself and the kids because of the situation.

This got me thinking darkly and I had an idea to kill him. When he came down to get me wine and himself a beer, once the kids were in bed, I went into the shed and got some rope and gloves. I had planned to trip him up, tie him up and strangle him to death, before making it look like a suicide. Of course I didn't go ahead with this, I had put the stuff in my pockets and walked back into the kitchen. I looked at him, thought about my dark plan and started to cry. I couldn't bear to do this to him after I saw him after collecting the rope I had planned to use. He looked concerned at me, which made things worse, and I ran up to our bedroom. He came in and asked what the matter was and I just blubbed, saying that work was getting on top of me. I couldn't bring myself to say anything more. We spent the rest of the night cuddling and watching comfort tv before sleep, but l could think about was my thoughts when I thought I was going to kill him.

These thoughts have been coming for a while. He told me in the past, when confiding his worst thoughts to me, that he has wished and fantasised about me killing him to end his misery. I think it has got to me and I now end up believing in his idea that he would be better off dead, as in his worse state. There was little malice, they were created through tiredness and a desire for things to be better. As I was walking to the shed I was thinking that this would be good for him, he won't suffer again and the kids won't be impacted by his mental health. I considered the impact of a murder/staged suicide to be less detrimental to them than his continuous issues with depression affecting them.

I have confided in friends that I am struggling with his mental health issues. They asked if I would be happier if I was to dump him. I thought about it and decided against, as I love him and it wouldn't fully solve the issue. If we were to split, he's still see the kids and I would still be worried about how his depression may impact them. In fact, it would be worse, because I wouldn't be there to help keep the kids away from him when he's bad and splitting up would negatively impact him.

Deep down, I just want things to get better, as a family. He's a good person, a good father and a good lover. He has been there for me when I needed it, it's not all about me being there for him as this might make it seem, we have similar personalities and senses of humour and I love how kind, thoughtful and considerate he is. I am thankful I met him. It's just his mental health that has created this issue.

I am now so upset and scared. I've not been able to think of anything but Friday since. I am dwelling on what I was about to do and how I have been feeling, as a whole, because of it. I try to think calmly and say to myself that ""I didn't go through with it"", ""I couldn't have gone ahead with it"" or even ""you were motivated by love, you thought those things because your stressed and fed up brain took that as a means of caring for him, because you thought killing him would be in his best interests. You were just heavily misguided, depressed yourself and need help"" as a means of trying to forgive myself. I can't forgive myself though. Most of my minutes of the day is spent dwelling on what I thought and what if I didn't snap out of that moment. If I hadn't broken down, would I have killed him? Will I go further in the future and actually kill him? If I was more sluggish in coming out of that manic period, would I have killed him?

Ironically, he has perked up since and has been there for me at night time, while I struggle with what he believes is just about work.

I like to think of myself as a good person, I think I am kind and caring, but this has shaken me. I am scared of my own thoughts and I am now scared that I am capable of murder. I don't know what to do. 

I know I need help. I've thought about it since and I can't avoid the need to see a therapist to speak this through. However, I don't know what to tell my boyfriend. If I was to tell him I needed help it would be fine, he would be there for me and sympathetic, but he doesn't know the full story. I am scared of him asking if this is just about work and thinking it might be something deeper. I would struggle to hide my feelings, because we were generally quite open and he would be concerned and upset if I was hiding something like my sadness from him. And if I tell him how on Earth would he react to me thinking of killing him? Should I hide my trips to the therapist from him? I don't know how, and I don't know if that's wise. If he found out he would be inquisitive and I fear he would lose trust if I start hiding things.

I just want to stay in my bedroom and cry right now. I  want my boyfriend to be well again. I want to think of myself as a good person again and not have any dark thoughts again. I don't know how to get there without breaking everyone else's heart for what I've thought and made some attempt to do.",27Oct2020,1
621,"So long story short: Last year was my freshman year in college. I was really looking to make friends, so I'd do anything to get people to like me, (which I realized was a mistake.) A girl in my Music Theory class started asking me for the homework and I'd send it to her. I don't know why I thought that sending her the homework would make her be my friend lmfao. But now we're in Music Theory III and she keeps asking me for every assignment. Heck, she even asked me for the midterm (since we're online. I didn't send her that one because yknow.. it's a test.)  How do I politely tell her that I don't want to be used for homework anymore? It just feels awkward saying it now since I'm in so far. I ignored her text last night but I feel bad about lying, saying I didn't see it.",27Oct2020,1
622,"I think the title sums it up really! I don’t want to give too much detail because the lies and betrayals go back so far and range from pointlessly small lies to huge ones.

I forgave him when he cheated on me. He continued to secretly keep in touch with her. I found out, by the end of that argument I GENUINELY felt like the villain.

He shared a bed with multiple girls on many different occasions despite me explicitly saying I was not ok with that based on his past behaviour. By the end of these rows I am left believing I’m paranoid, jealous and overthinking.

Late night texts to so many other girls, being open to cheating again and actively being in situations where it can happen (he probably did cheat again, I’m not blind to it anymore so I know this is very likely) and then blaming me for making it into a ‘thing’. I’m too jealous, I think too negatively of people. 

I feel so relieved it’s over, hindsight is 20/20! But I also feel so hurt, I forgave so much and he dumped me because he ‘couldn’t lie to himself anymore’. I repeatedly rebuilt my trust single handedly, and I feel I was still blamed for the break up. 

We have a house together (rented) and have 10 months left on the contract. I can’t afford to move. I kind of don’t want him to move (I KNOW)!

My emotions are variable and extreme. I’d be so grateful if any one has any practical advice on how to get through this! 

I am feeling really quite sensitive, but if you could shed a light on why I let myself get treated this way and how to never let it happen again I would also appreciate it! But I can’t handle any more blame on me, I know parts of this mess are my fault but I can’t handle the past better, I really want to take control of myself from here.",27Oct2020,1

I work for a public library in the computer lab area. I basically supervise people using our computers to make sure they don’t do anything illegal. Part of my job is to hand out passes to those who don’t have library cards. We have a lot of regulars, and I get to know some of these people pretty well. 

The last couple of weeks we’ve had a couple come in several times while I’ve been working. I’m almost 100% positive they’re homeless and like 70% positive they’re on some pretty hard drugs. 

Anyway, this probably isn’t a huge surprise, but they seem to have a pretty volatile relationship. I’ve noticed more that it seems like he probably physically abuses her. She comes in with bruises on her, will sometimes wear sunglasses inside, and once or twice I’ve seen him smack her while at a computer. He has never hit her hard, but hitting is hitting. This usually happens right before they’ll get up and leave. I hear him call her names and berate her about stuff totally out of her control. 

I have no clue what to do about this. We have a policy against any physical violence so they’ve been warned to keep their hands to themselves when in the building, but it feels so uncomfortable to watch this. I’m not even sure if I can do anything about it. I know their full names and the temporary housing they stay in, but that’s all. Does anyone have any advice?",27Oct2020,1
629,"I need some outsider opinion.  I have known my friend for several years now, because of her life history, she feels very strongly about a few things:  


1. Not dating criminals    
2. Not dating people with children, or having any of her own  
3. Intense detest for people who choose to have kids and don't tend to them  


(She has even called authorities on her own family members for the mistreatment of their children.)  She is someone I know in a very deep way, for the most part she has her shit together and is successful.  


Here is the thing, recently she met a guy on instagram and she decided to fly out and spend the weekend with him.   My friend is 30, he is 45.   Now, me having a career in (mild, no big time stuff) investigative work, something about this situation didn't sit right with me completely, and I pulled a report on the guy.  See below:  


He had some mild run ins with the law in his 20s (about 10 misdemeanors for being caught with marijuana), a short stint in jail for burglarizing a vehicle.  From 25-30 he was in prison for burglary of habitation, received a felony conviction. Has been through a divorce, has 1 child, and 2 years ago his ex wife took him to court for failure to pay child support.  He owes $21k.    


Now I have known her for many, many, many years.  If she knew about any of this, it would be very out of character for her to proceed.  But then I think, maybe she's making an exception for this guy for some reason?  People change, right, and his felony was 15 years ago.  But her life and her expressions, and conversations with people, and who she is at her core person doesn't date men with kids, doesn't date dead beats, doesn't date felons, etc.  


Part of me feels like I should tell her, but the other part wonders if maybe it really isn't any of my business and maybe he has told her and he's changed, and everything is ok.  Maybe he and the wife agreed he wouldn't be in his child's life and therefore he ""doesn't have kids"" and it's ok with her.  But that seems so out of character for her, too.  


I have never been in this situation before.  I usually stay out of things and always thought people who intervened were silly to do so, but it's sounding a really loud alarm in my head.  Part of me is going, ""No no, maybe he told her everything, and it's not sinister, and it's all ok.""  Then there is also the fact that in life people lie and conceal things to enter into relationships, especially online.  People are known to hide deal-breaker parts of them.  I don't know what to do.  Is it wrong of me to tell her, or right of me not to?  


TL;DR - Friend is dating a guy she met online a few months ago.  I looked into him and I feel if she knew these things, she wouldn't be entertaining this.  Do I tell her or not?",27Oct2020,1

For anyone who isn’t familiar with this movie, check out its Wikipedia page before reading the rest: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_the_Guardians Now that you’ve read it, I’ll just go ahead and say what I need to say: while I was watching the movie, I realized all of a sudden that I liked Bunnymund, and over the next few months I was obsessed with him. I saved a bunch of screenshots of him from the movie on my phone, I read countless Bunnymund x Reader fanfics and I completely indulged myself in Bunnymund pictures on Rule 34. And while I was doing all of this, I somehow didn’t realize something that would be blindingly obvious to anybody else: my love for Bunnymund technically made me a furry. I only realized this a few weeks ago and the thought of being a furry honestly makes me feel so uncomfortable because of how abnormal and/or immature it would seem to other people, but at the same time I keep thinking that by now I’m in too deep to get out because I still feel really attracted to Bunnymund.

638,"I met someone online 3 weeks ago and we've been talking every day since. We went on a first date and it went really well. We spent the entire day together doing stuff and talking. He did make it clear that he wasn't looking for a relationship though and I respect that. I honestly just want to spend time with him because I enjoy his company. 

I visited his house recently and we got intimate, which isn't something I do outside of a relationship but it happened. I know not to expect for us to think anything more than what it was. It wasn't awkward at all and we talked a lot after.

The only thing is he's very busy with studies and work, and he goes to the gym some days too. So I know he's very preoccupied with everything going on in his life. I've been super patient because it doesn't bother me when he's busy, because we talk and see each other when we can.

But recently he's been talking less and less, he'd sometimes just read my messages and not reply and hours after he'd send me a meme or something. But he does sometimes message me first in the morning so it's not like he doesn't talk to me at all.

I'm just scared that when he doesn't talk to me and kinda ignores my message, that he's maybe found another girl to talk to who he finds more attractive, more interesting than me. I know I can't control him and read his mind and that I can't expect anything from him because we're not in a relationship and we haven't established where we stand with each other because it's still so early. I just don't know if I bore him, if he changed his mind about me after we got intimate, that he's over it or just too focused on his work and stuff to talk to me.

I don't want to be the only one putting in effort but I also don't want to completely lose contact with him because I really really like him. Unfortunately I am a highly anxious person and things like this send my anxiety through the roof. That's why I'm here asking for advice from strangers lol.

So any advice on what to do? Should I just see where it goes and talk to him without expecting anything or should I ask him where we stand with each other.",27Oct2020,1
639,"TLDR - 
How do I even begin to figure out transferring community college transcripts when the website doesn't make sense? 
Are student loans worth it? 
Are there loans that I can live off of without being in debt for the rest of my life? 
Will I be able to take classes while working full time? 
Is it even worth it to go to college for 3D modeling and animation? 
Am I too old to try and pursue my ideal career? 
Will I be stuck in a dead end job if I take one now? 
Is there a job I can take in my field with so little experience? 

I originally went to community college right out of high school, but I had no passion or desire to do anything so I just flunked all my classes and wasted my parents money. A bit over a year ago though I went back to the same place and had a relatively successful couple of semesters. My grades weren't perfect but they weren't bad and I was making progress and getting on my feet. 

But as I'm sure many people are aware, there was a bit of a global pandemic this year. The college shut down for that semester, and I don't like online classes so I managed to get a refund from the college for the semester and was going to try and join next semester, not knowing how long this would last. While I was waiting, I got an offer from my best friend to move in with him in another city. I've been wanting to get out of my parents place for years, and I have the stimulus money, so I jumped at the chance. And now that the Republicans are cutting unemployment despite the fact that its still not safe to work, I need to find work anyway. 

I'm not scared of the virus though. I'm scared this is a dead end. I'm genuinely fucking terrified of it. I'm 26. I fucked up my best chances of a higher education, now I would need to deal with student loans and all that if I want to try and finish my associates here, and even then it would be online, something I struggle with, and thats if I even have time while trying to work full time for $10 an hour. I'll barely keep myself afloat. 

I feel like if I take work I'll be cutting off my opportunity to get a degree, and if I don't I'll be back with my parents and completely screwing my roommate. I want to do 3D modeling and animation, especially for games, and I wish I could take a job in the field to build experience while making any money at all, but they want people with years of experience. I think a guy who made a 95 in his modeling class and did half of the following animation class isn't going to get hired by anyone. 

The only way I can think to get that experience would be finishing my degree, because at least then I'm pretty sure I can live with the student loans and I'll have something to show for it by the end. But I hear every day about people who are hopelessly in debt because of their loans, or how it takes literal decades to pay it all off. What if I wrack up all that debt and then have nothing to show for it? Degrees aren't worth what they used to be. Even if I can make a decent portfolio with what I learn, theres no guarantees. 

Did I completely fuck myself by not doing this right the first time? When I was 18 I had no direction and my mental health was atrocious, but because I was hopless then does that just mean I missed the boat? I'm four years shy of 30 and I have nothing to show for my life and it only gets harder and harder to try and correct course. And even if I want to finish my degree, I tried looking at the website for my old community college and none of the transferring instructions made any sense to me. It was like that kind of bullshit lawyer speak that is intentionally vague to make it harder on the reader.

654,"Okay so I had a friend group of 4 people. Let’s say I’m friend 1. Friend 4 did some really fucked up shit and hurt me and friend 2. Like REALLY FUCKED UP SHIT. So at this point, me and friend 2 cut off friend 4 and no longer speak to them. However, friend 3 constantly talks about how they miss friend 4, and wanna hang with them again. At first I wasn’t mad because friend 4 didn’t really do much to them personally, besides being a casual asshole. I come to find out friend 3 has been hanging with friend 4, and kept it on the downlow but eventually told me and friend 2. I’ve asked my family what I should do, and they said I shouldn’t be mad at friend 3 because they have their own relationship with friend 4. I wasn’t mad for a while, but I’ve been thinking about it and I am pretty upset that they are still in contact with them. Not saying friend 3 has to cut off friend 4, but why aren’t they mad enough to stop talking to them because of all the shit they caused to me and friend 2? The 3 of us are very close, and knew eachother long before friend 4. So why is friend 3 so caught up on them? I know that friend 3 is a people pleaser, and I’m pretty sure they are just trying not to hurt anyone. But i feel like it comes to a point where if someone does really fucked up shit, we shouldn’t enable that behavior anymore and say goodbye to a friendship that is just toxic. I know friend 3 isn’t getting anything out of that friendship at all. Friend 4 is basically a narcissist. So why is friend 3 still talking to them after all the shit that’s went down? Should I confront friend 3? Me and friend 2 are very hurt by the fact that they are still talking to friend 4 after everything. 

In short:
My friend still hangs out with someone who has hurt me tremendously. Should I tell my friend how I feel?",27Oct2020,1
655,"I am currently residing in India. Here the government has allowed the schools to re-open. A student can attend classes according to their Parent's wish.

657,"[Posted this in r/religion but I think it's awaiting post approval there]

My (F18) father is Jehovah's Witness. My parents split when I was a baby and I became closer to my dad, and naturally I followed with the JW faith.

As a kid, I remember being very passionate about being a JW. I loved the whole preaching thing and always felt proud of myself when I got to answer during the question &amp; answer part of our meetings (JWs call church services 'meetings). I always thought I'd be faithful to God unwaveringly, no matter what.

But then, when I was around 11, my dad and I moved in with my grandmother. She is a very strict JW woman. Meetings were a must. You had to go both midweek and weekend meetings once you were in her house. Preaching on Saturdays was a must. I also wasn't allowed to have any non-JW friends over either because she didn't trust them.

I was fine following those rules at first; I even became an unbaptized publisher (the first step to working towards baptism)! Sadly, I barely lasted two months with that position before I began to waver. It was hard to maintain good grades, be an active JW AND have enough time to myself for relaxation. I started to take naps to get out of going to meetings. If my grandma saw me sleeping, most times she wouldn't wake me up and leave for meetings without me. Sometimes when I couldn't fall asleep I would even sneak my dad's Nyquil to knock me out.

Over the next few years, I studied with the JWs on and off but nothing constant. I questioned my gender and my sexuality, changed my style to be very masculine only to later realise I am cishet. I kept all of these things a secret from my grandmother because the JW doctrine is a bit conservative. My dad at this time was also not an active JW because he was too busy working to provide for my grandmother and I. Since then we've moved out of my grandma's house and my mental health has reached an all time low.

Recently I reconnected with some old JW friends who shared some words of encouragement from the Bible with me and I felt like it was the only thing that gave me true comfort in my hard times. Because of the overwhelming feeling of happiness I felt from reconnecting with them, I rushed and told them that I'd like to work towards baptism, but soon afterwards all the reasons I had left off being a JW in the first place came back to me and now I'm ghosting my JW friends because I'm torn.

While I do believe in most of the doctrine of JWs and I believe their teachings are the ones that make the most sense, because of the time I spent questioning my gender and sexuality, I gained an appreciation for LGBT+ rights and feminism. These two things don't fly very well in the JW circles. I don't want to change my stance on these topics but I've been told that putting my personal opinion aside and following His laws would show God how much I love Him. I keep thinking, is God displeased with me for defending feminism and LGBT+ rights?

A major JW teaching is the impending coming of Armageddon and consequently the coming of Paradise. I feel like I have no hope at happiness in this world so I want to make it to Paradise. But I'm afraid that if I don't become baptised and be an official JW, God won't accept me to Paradise. When I'm left to myself without the prodding of my JW friends, I don't do Bible study or pray or anything so I'm afraid I'm not good enough for God.

I am so genuinely so afraid that just being a non-religious person who lives a generally good and upstanding life isn't going to be enough and that I'll never have a chance at happiness in a perfect paradise.

This is alot to get off my chest, and I'm currently in tears as I type this sentence. I'm just wondering if anyone can provide me with some advice? Should I put aside my personal opinions and serve God as a JW, or should I just live a generally upstanding life and hope God won't hate me in the end?

TL;DR - I grew up Jehovah's Witness and now that I'm 18, I'm unsure whether to become an official JW or not.",27Oct2020,1
658,"Just had to pick up my sister from school because of a stomach, I suspected from not eating. She told me she feels she’s anorexic and maybe eats one meal a day, a small one at that. 
Before people say it; no, I don’t feel comfortable telling her parents (were half sisters, same mom but different fathers). Our mother is extremely abusive and wrote off my depression and anxiety when I was a teen and made me feel like it was my fault. I know she’ll do the same with my sister.

660,"So my girlfriend and I broke up in like the beginning of August. We've kind of been off and on for 2 years and stuff has happened but we broke up in August and it definitely had an end.

But I still have hope, especially because I really love her and we have made up and we still talk and recently she's left some signs at least to me that she might have interest and things might have changed. I've been told to not even think about going back and all this stuff. But I truthfully just don't care, I genuinely love her a lot and I'm having a hard time on knowing what to feel. Because if it's not over I definitely don't want it to be over. I've felt the same way since the day we broke up. It's almost November and I'm still madly in love with her. So I guess I'm just not sure how to feel because I don't know if it's actually over or not. It doesn't feel like it. What're your thoughts y'all?",27Oct2020,1
661,"I tried posting this to r/legaladvice, but they just took it down. I don't know why and I'm incredibly frustrated that I can't even post this shit to that sub because of the stupid rules.

This is a long story. I've tried to sum it up as best as I can. But it's still long. I just want one person to read this at least. Just one. I'm leaving out some details because it would take up an entire book if I were to write everything out.

Important prefaces - my dad is a mentally and emotionally abusive narcissistic control freak who has messed me up big time over the years. I also have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and dropped out of school in 10th grade due to mental issues. I'm ALSO extremely, very against porn, not for religious reasons even, I'm an atheist. I just believe that a man should be 100% loyal to his woman, and not even look at other women in any way (and vice versa). Porn/sex work is also a very fucked up industry in general. Say what you want about that, that's not what I'm here to discuss anyways. It's not up for debate. But it's integral information.

That being said, I've had a lot of mental health issues starting from a very young age, stemming from my dad's mistreatment of me and from intense bullying at school, as well as other events that have occurred throughout my life - including being raped/sexually assaulted when I was 14.

I also started being very promiscuous way too early on. I got my first computer at 8 years old and found hardcore porn, which I got addicted to. From 8 to 14 I was addicted to porn and saw myself as an object. A young girl viewing porn is a much different perspective than that of a guys. I was way too sexual for a child. Part of the reason behind this was probably the issues I had with my father being distant and emotionally unavailable. (I'm 18 now and haven't watched porn in like 3 years or so. I hate it so much). Anyways.

When I was 15, I was very alone and very vulnerable. My brother, who is 6 years older than me, felt bad. I was friendless. So he started to bring me sometimes when he would go over to his friend's house to watch UFC fights, or whatever. We'll call this friend ""Bob"".

Whenever I'd go with my brother to Bob's house to hang out, there would be maybe 3-5 of his friends there collectively. It wasn't just him and Bob. His friends girlfriends would sometimes come along too, so I wasn't always the only girl in the room.

Bob and all of my brother's other friends were normal and never really gave a fuck about me. In fact most of his friends just kind of disregarded me and I would sit there and watch the TV quietly and smoke weed. (I started dabbling with weed at around 14, my brother smokes it too, so do his friends. It's always just helped me cope).

But this friend, Bob, had an older brother. We'll call him Todd. Keep in mind - when I was 15, my brother and his friends were all around 21-22 years old. Bob's brother, Todd, was 24 at the time.

Well, I happened to be there one day when Todd came down to chill with everyone for the first time. He didn't always come down, because he was a loner. He saw me and it seemed like he immediately took notice of me. He knew I was young, and knew I was the sibling of one of his brother's friends.

He started paying special attention to me. I remember him asking me what my favorite music was/what kind of music I listened to. I replied that I'd been listening to a lot of Soundgarden lately. He then played a Soundgarden music video on the computer. He would smile at me and look at me a lot.

After that, I'd keep coming to hang out, and I'd see him more and more. Eventually, I asked him for his snapchat. Yes, I was the one who did that, oddly enough. I was lonely, vulnerable, and in need of attention. This older man was giving me that attention, so I latched onto it and went out of my way to get his snapchat. He didn't protest. He added me back and started chatting with me from there.

I began sending him nudes. At 15 years old. He gladly accepted them and would tell me (actual quotes) that I'm ""his little treasure"", that I'm ""juicy"", and that he's ""counting down the days until I turn 16"". 16 is the age of consent here in Canada. I wish it fucking wasn't. My naive self reveled in the attention he gave me. I became very attached to this guy.

A couple months passed and eventually I started sneaking out late at night to go and hang out with Todd by myself. He worked the evening shift at a factory, and ended work at 11pm. I would sneak out at around 2-3am almost every night, walk to his house which was 5 minutes away, and hang out with him until 4 or 5 in the morning. Sometimes even 6. This obviously started messing my sleep schedule up a lot.

He let me smoke his weed and always gave me some to have. He started buying me cigarettes too, since I started mixing tobacco with weed when I'd smoke bongs (I quit tobacco since then, it's been over a year).

He never made a creepy move on me when I'd come and hang out. We would always hang out in this ""smoking room"" in his basement. It had a lock and everything. He could have done something but he didn't. It wasn't until a few weeks of hanging out with him like that, that I asked if he wanted to kiss me at the door when I was about to go home. He said yes and had this childish look on his face, like a kid in a candy store who was super giddy. I gave him a peck on the lips and then left. Yes, he let a 15 year old walk at night alone that late.

Note that this guy was a virgin at 24. Never even kissed a girl, I don't think. Meanwhile, I had lost my virginity at 14 with a guy my age and had more experience since then. I know, I know. I wish I hadn't done it that young.

After that kiss, we decided we were dating. It became apparent to Bob, my brother's friend, that I was hanging out with his older brother Todd. Bob was weirded out and concerned by that, so he went to my brother to let him know. My brother questioned me about it, but I managed to convince him nothing was wrong and that it was ok. I don't know how. Apparently, Todd had also contacted my brother telling him that he liked me or something to that effect, and my brother just told Todd that it's ""her choice whether she dates you or not"".

So we started dating. Next up was to try and convince my parents that it was ok. At first, they lightly tried telling me that it wasn't a good idea. However, I never *once* remember them sternly trying to explain to me the intentions of this older dude or why he wasn't what he seemed to be. They just sort of... barely tried to tell me it was not a great idea, and then gave up. Nobody talked to Todd himself, nobody went to Todd's parents. Everyone was just trying to tell a mentally unstable 15 year old that this older guy ""wasn't a good idea"", as if I had the capacity to listen and understand that I was being groomed and taken advantage of. Which they didn't even explicitly say.

Part of why they gave up was because me, having BPD and a plethora of attachment issues and daddy issues, would have HUGE episodes if anyone tried coming between me and Todd in the slightest. To the point where I was suicidal and saying I'd kill myself if I couldn't see him.

If my parents tried telling me not to sleep over at his house or something, I would go into a rage, into a panic, into chaos. I'd scream and cry and self harm. They came to a ""deal"" that I was allowed to sleep over at his house only once a week, and I took it. They eventually just accepted the relationship and didn't protest anymore. I would bring him over, I'd go over to his house, and everything was... ""normal"". My dad even said ""you know what, I actually kinda like this guy"" to my mom.

Before we started dating, I made sure to express my hatred of porn to Todd, and I expressed, crystal clear, that I expect a man to be 100% loyal and keep his eyes to me. I do the same thing when in a relationship. I'm just very monogamous. He agreed and assured me that he stopped watching porn altogether for me, and that he was only looking at the photos I'd send him. He had so many nudes of me saved on his phone. I was young and naive, so naturally I bought his lies of loyalty.

Anyways - I met his parents and he met mine. I would go to family gatherings with him and meet his relatives. He met my grandma and he was there with me when my cat who I loved very much passed away.

It became so normalized. But over time it became more and more clear how dysfunctional the relationship was.

The relationship slowly morphed into more and more fights. My BPD went from being triggered around him rarely, to being triggered constantly. I had huge episodes around him where he would just ignore me, leave the room to let me suffer and panic and break down by myself, and just overall not respond properly at all. If he did try to comfort me, the effort was shallow and he gave up very quickly. Admittedly, I sometimes became so uncontrollable in my episodes that I hit him a few times during the relationship. I'm not proud of that but he would always just take it from me and the most he'd do is say, ""don't hit me"" in an annoyed voice.

He never learned anything. We dated for a year and a half before we broke up. Throughout that year and a half, his responses to my breakdowns remained a constant, each time, even after having serious conversations with him about my mental state and giving him advice and tips on how he should respond accordingly when I become that way. (yes I have looked into therapy. I've gone through 8+ therapists and will try again).

He never treated me like a girlfriend but rather as a friend with benefits.

The fights would never end. I would cry and beg him to change certain habits, like sleeping in way too late, smoking way too much weed and tobacco, not showing me much affection, not washing his hair. Just lazy habits that over time began to piss me off. He would ALWAYS cry with me at the end of fights promising to change and yet he wouldn't. Each time. And my weak ass couldn't leave. I was way too attached. But I was going insane.

I realized after so long that I didn't actually love him at all, and I was only with him out of fear that nobody else would want me or deal with me. He used to be an escape from my home life, he used to have me infatuated with him and obsessed with him. But he just became another problem to face. I didn't love him anymore, I don't think I ever truly did in my naive mind. He was constantly blaming me for my episodes and telling me to get help but he would be the cause of my episodes more than half the time. The entire relationship was so fucked up. I would legitimately go insane with the breakdowns I'd have, hitting my head against brick walls, pulling at my hair, screaming, crying. I experienced those episodes time and time again in part because of his actions towards me.

For example, he knew abandonment was a huge, giant, terrible fear of mine. Earlier on in the relationship, he left to a cottage trip without telling me and stayed a week while I was at home falling apart because he seemingly dropped off the face of earth and wouldn't respond to me. He refused to talk to me and only started picking up the phone at the end of his stay. That shit fucked me up. It doesn't sound that bad typed out but it was a punch to my gut.

Anyways. In June of this year, I found the proof that took the blinders off my eyes for good. I was on his phone, (in front of him, he let me go on it) and in the vault of my nudes, I found a sexual instagram text post. I immediately became suspicious and went to find instagram on his phone. It wasn't even downloaded. So I went to his browser, typed in ""instagram"" and it immediately came up as an often-used suggestion. Low and behold, he had made an entire fake account that he hid from me that he used SOLELY for looking at half naked IG models and pornographic stuff.

And he did all that when he had an entire vault of my own nudes. It was an encryption app called Keepsafe that requires a pass code to get in. That's where he kept all of the nudes I'd sent him, over 300 of them.

This guy was a porn addict from day 1 and hid it from me the entire time. He ""used"" to watch porn in VR. Pathetic.

When I found that shit, I IMMEDIATELY got up, told him to delete all my stuff off his phone, and left home. He tried yelling after me that he still loves me and I just screamed at him, bloody murder, that his ass did not love me when he was doing that shit behind my back.

After a few days I went to his house to make sure that app with my nudes on it was uninstalled off his phone. It was still on his phone, of course, so I made him uninstall it in front of me. He did. But I was still paranoid that if he reinstalled the app, the photos would come back. So I made him reinstall it to show me.

A log in screen came up. He hastily said ""see, look, it's gone, it's just a log in screen now"" and then quickly put his phone away and didn't let me see it again.

I am almost certain he logged back in and still has my underage nudes on his phone.

A few weeks or days after that, he hand wrote me a letter which he managed to give to my brother when he saw him hanging out with his brother Bob.

This is the letter: [https://imgur.com/a/bJANVKQ](https://imgur.com/a/bJANVKQ)

Very creepy and poorly written.

I also found out after we broke up that he made a fake account to stalk me on instagram with after I blocked him. On that account, he was following several 16 year old girls (!!!) and some dirty porn type of profiles. He was also following ALMOST EVERY ACCOUNT THAT I WAS FOLLOWING. Including my new boyfriend. When I found out about that account, which he made under a fake name, I messaged it a lengthy paragraph informing it that I knew it was him and that I have notified the police of his predatory behavior, which isn't a lie - I did, in fact, call the police and open a case on him shortly after we broke up and I realized he was a pedo, basically.

Here is the message I wrote: [https://imgur.com/a/f4Y6mlR](https://imgur.com/a/f4Y6mlR)

After I sent that message, he became unhinged and started harassing me.

He made 8+ fake accounts under fake names, one after the other. He started messaging me paragraphs about how fucked up I was, comparing me to my dad, telling me I was just like him the entire time, sending me articles about ""BPD abuse"", writing me huge text walls filled with poison. He would go on my reddit account and stalk that too. He also viewed my LINKED IN which I haven't used in years. He would send me quotes about ""narcissists ghosting their victims"", implying that I was a narcissist who was merely just ghosting him.

Here are some of the messages he sent me off his fake accounts: [https://imgur.com/a/fKe7OON](https://imgur.com/a/fKe7OON)

After this stalking and harrassment begun, I got into contact with police again and updated them on the situation. It was a lengthy process of phone calls and submitting screenshots of evidence only to be fucking useless in the end.

All this creepy motherfucker got was a phone call from an officer telling him to stop harassing me. They told him that ""if he continues then his actions could cross into the realm of criminal"". What was NOT criminal about everything he did to me? From dating me in the first place, to stalking and harassing me the second he knew my rejection was finalized?

The cop just closed my case after talking to him on the phone.

I want justice. I want that shit off his phone gone. I want to KNOW that he does not have my underage lewd photos anymore.

My parents and brother, after the whole ordeal, after I realized how screwed up everything was, had an ""I told you so"" attitude about it toward me. My brother refuses to delete Todd off his social media because ""it's very awkward and I don't want to see him again at Bob's house knowing I unadded him"". I will forever hate that he's even sparing this piece of shit's feelings in any way after what I went through with him.

My new partner is amazing, honest, and kind. He is only 3 years older. He has shown me what a normal, loving relationship should look like and I haven't been aggressive to him in any way like I was with my ex. I am significantly better off mentally with my current partner.

My question is: what the fuck do I do? The police didn't give a shit, even when I told them he was PREDATORY and following 16 year old girls. They didn't search his phone after I said that I'm scared he still has my underage nudes on it. So who the hell will deal with him? Everyone in my life turned a blind eye to my fucked up ""relationship"" with him. I can't just let this go, I cannot let this piece of perverted shit go scott free with just a fucking phone call from police. Fuck the police.

So I picked the movie Tenet which apparently is a pretty complicated movie. I enjoyed the movie but she didn’t really like the movie that much. After the movie I made the bad choice to tell her and I have feelings for her and ask if she felt the same she responded with “I don’t know if I have feelings for you” I wanna know if I should apologize for what I said or just forget it happened.,27Oct2020,1
673,"Hey guys, so I (22F) got engaged this past July 2020, definitely the highlight to a pretty crappy year.  Wedding planning has been very slow/minimal due to Covid and all the unexpected closures etc. But me and my fiancé do know that we want to get married next summer, and have a very quick engagement. 

I loosely talked about some of the plans that I have with a few of my close friends, one of them being a coworker (30F) that I’ve known for just over a year and a half. In the time we’ve become pretty close because she’s someone I see on a daily basis, and even invited her to a cottage weekend friend gatherings etc. we’re close.

But she can be a lot. She’s the kind of person who kind of needs a little bit more education on time and place, she’s very outgoing, and she can get along with a lot of people, she’s really loud and a little bit obnoxious. I’ve never had a problem with it personally but I’ve heard some feedback from other people.

Me and her always joke about how broke we are because we really are broke living in a big city, working retail management. But since coming back to work after quarantine she has been stressing almost on a daily basis how broke he is, how much she’s struggling, I even lent her money from time to time. No problem I have my friends back always. But came to a point where she would always just be complaining and so negative about everything, she definitely did have some bad luck with some situations I had happened to her but it was like we could never have a conversation that didn’t lead to her saying how her situation was so much worse or how bad she’s doing or how stressed she is etc. I’m also super stressed right now, and as much as I want to be there for her I did have to take a step back from our friendship because it was so draining on me.

She will occasionally bring up the wedding and ask me who my bridesmaids are going to be or if I’ve decided anything, kind of hinting in a sense that she wanted to be a bridesmaid. When we were talking about it in a group of friends I need a comment saying I just wanted to make sure that everyone that I picked feels comfortable to be in my bridal party because I do want to do a few extravagant things, (vacation bachelorette) and I didn’t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable or pressured to spend beyond their means. Or if they couldn’t come it would be uncomfortable whatever. She responded with “ your friends love you, they will make whatever you want Work!” 

The issue is the beginning of 2020 she was in a wedding, One of her lifelong close friends and although she did tell me she really enjoyed the wedding and being a part of it, she could not stop complaining about how much money she had to spend to be in the wedding. 

She still asks me and talks to me about a few wedding plans anytime I post anything, and I am about to do a sleepover for the girls that I’m asking to be in my bridal party, she’s not one of them. And I just don’t know how to go about this because I know that it’s gonna be an awkward situation or maybe a sour attitude from her after the fact. 

If she sees me posting on my bridal party weekend that I’m planning soon I just don’t know how she will react, and I don’t know what my proper response should be either. I do think of her still as a close friend but all of the people that I’m asking to be in my bridal party I’ve known for 10+ years. They’re also all my age! Honestly I don’t know how to go about this I don’t wanna ruin a friendship or make anyone’s feelings be hurt. Just not sure how to go about this.

TLDR; A newer friend of mine might be upset that I’m not asking her to be in my bridal party how should I go about this?",27Oct2020,1
675,"for context: we dated for 3 years and broke up a month ago but it was not messy. i (22f) initiated it and by the end it was a mutual understanding. we were going through our own shit and just didn’t work well as a couple anymore. (he’s 25m btw)

we still talk most days though just about random stuff going on in our lives or our common interests, and now we’re talking about potentially getting an apartment as friends. we both are looking to move out of our current situations and already know each other well enough to be comfortable getting place. 

and yes, we understand the dynamic would be 100% different and have already recognized we’d be living our own lives but occasionally hanging out as housemates but idk... is that weird? is it weird to still be this close of friends? part of me feels weird about doing it but it shouldn’t be a big deal right?",27Oct2020,1

677,"I am a lawyer fresh out of law school. My boss is gradually losing her mind. She’s screaming constantly(usually not at anyone). She has broken down crying multiple times in the past month.

Sometimes in the middle of scream at her work she stops and starts repeating “I’m not ok.”  She is sending away work because she can’t handle it and has been doing some borderline unethical things.

678,"Sorry for the bad formatting, on mobile.
This thought hadn't crossed my mind, but I was reading the AskReddit on spotting abuse in children, and I remembered. When I was young, kind of 6 to 10 ish, I was highly sexualised in the way a kid could be, I used to pretend snog one of my toys, daydream about sex without really understanding it, just knowing it involved being naked with a boy and a girl. Parents didn't really sensor sex scenes in films when I was young.
From the age of 11 to 18 while at home my parents were emotionally abusive and neglectful in the sense that they withheld affection and support, and period products, but that's a different trauma. 
I know my parents were naked a lot of the time, even as I was 16+, they didn't really respect privacy, they'd go into the bathroom while I was showing to brush their teeth or use the toilet.
I don't speak to my parents anymore, I have severe depression and anxiety from the years emotional abuse. 
I don't remember anything inappropriate sexually every happening to me. 
I guess I'm just scared something happened to me that I forgot about. I don't know if I actually want advice, or just get this out of my head.",27Oct2020,1
679,"I moved away from my home country at the age of three because of money problems, so many people did the same thing within my country in those years. Just like my family, they moved to England for jobs. And being absolutely fluent was never needed within my household and due to this, I lost my 'native tongue' and created an accent while focusing on English studies.

At one point my mother signed me up to a Saturday school to learn my native language and I was very uncomfortable because the other kids knew more than me and I ended up being teased and laughted at. I just couldn't handle it and I asked my mum on numerous occasions to take me out of it and she did. After that I completely blocked myself and stopped focusing on my native language as I thought I could never speak it properly if even my own family members could notice that I was more comfortable speaking English and I had a bigger accent than my siblings.

It's been years since then and now my mum has signed me up for another Saturday school to help me as I'm taking my native language as a GCSE and I am absolutely scared as I will know nobody, won't know how the school is going to go and I am not prepared as I feel so nervous due to past experiences. I feel like I only survived last time for as long as I did because I knew two school friends that attended.

It still hurts me knowing that I just couldn't handle it emotionally after people made fun of me so much that I just stopped caring about whether or not I could speak my native language properly that I can still cry about it. Especially since it affects me so much.

They have already started the school year (7 weeks) and I'm pretty sure that the students have been attending that school for years prior so I would love to have any advice on what to do to calm my nerves and such as I go next week's Saturday and and I feel like the world is closing in on me.

I like to feel prepared and have structure so this is completely outside of my comfort zone and even though the children are supposedly mature, I feel like even if they won't laugh I will still be embarrassed and my biggest fear is just having a complete mental breakdown within the classroom which I have done before. 

Is there anything I can do to help calm my nerves or get out of my comfort zone? Sorry for the huge amount of writing, I just needed to get it off my chest.",27Oct2020,1

682,"Hi everyone,

I am 17 years old (18 in November) and a senior in high school. My parents are pushing me to go to a high ranking, 4 year university, but I want to become a real estate agent right after I graduate high in May. My uncle-- who I am very close with-- started out as an agent and now makes millions a year in real estate development, so I already have a good mentor. I am actually really good with people, and would be willing to work 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. My only reservation in taking my parents' advice is that I think the early years would be tough. Would people really  be willing to entrust the purchase of their home with an 18-21 year old kid? With my high ambition, I also have a strong desire to make lots of money, and I would be discouraged if I didn't. Not really sure what I am looking for, just welcoming advice of any kind.

684,"I don't typically use Reddit of all things for something like this, but quarantine doesn't give me so many options. My issue is also going to sound really pompous from seeing the crazy things on the front page of the sub, but eh. 

I (M, 16) feel so hollow. I have no idea why. I have good grades, a nice enough social life (especially given our situation), and I try to stay healthy. Despite all of this, I feel so empty. I feel so unfulfilled; I feel like I should be something more, fully knowing I just can't. I even have plans for the future that would set me up for adult life, but I still feel like I could jump in front of a car without a second thought, without a care in the world on what would happen to me or the people around me. This could always be chalked up to 'edgy teenagers being/ thinking edgy' but I have always tried my best to avoid that stereotype and mindset by doing the things mentioned at the top of the paragraph. I feel worse everyday and don't have the motivation to do anything. I don't even care that my family is starting to notice my declining performance, I just don't care. Even regarding the people I truly love and care about, I really wouldn't care if I never saw them again if it meant starting life over to be something more.

Is this a normal thing to feel as a teenager? I have friends who have had similar experiences, but they usually have really sensible reason to, like school troubles, relationship issues, or home/parent problems. I'd feel so foolish if I felt all this because of such a pitiful reason like 'quarantine' because nobody should feel this way over something like that. (Maybe I just need to get a girlfriend haha) but really, I feel like shit.

Has anyone felt similar under the same conditions? I have a sense that this is a natural phase in your teen years I suppose, but the extent to which I feel sick to my stomach with emptiness seems too disproportional to my current life. I would like some advice on how to get over this damn hurdle, or at least, how to keep pushing through it until I get over it. :/",27Oct2020,1
685,"I was working my horse at the ranch I have her boarded at. She's a miniature horse that I do cart driving in. I was driving her on part of the ranch that was by a road, its not a real busy road but people do drive fast down it.  All of a sudden my horse bolted forward, I was quickly able to stop her but she was still upset. I looked over my shoulder to see two dogs (one big, one medium) running towards us. I have never seen these dogs before and they do not belong to the ranch. Since I didn't know what these dogs intentions were and my horse and I were trapped between the dogs and horse pens I exited my cart and waved my arm and yelled to go away while still holding my nervous horse. The dogs paused for a moment and then continued to run towards me and my horse. I yelled louder and stomped the ground with my foot. The dogs then turned and ran away, when they went onto the other side of the fence and left I got back into my cart and was going to drive my horse to a different part of the ranch in case they came back. I happened to look up in time to see both dogs run across the street at the worst possible second. The guy driving the SUV had no time to stop and hit both dogs hard. The big dog died a few moments after being hit, the medium dog got up and ran up the drive way to the ranch across the road and that's when I realized that these were the neighbor dogs. I called the owner of the ranch my horses are boarded at and told him about the dogs, he then called the neighbors and it was confirmed that the dogs belonged to them.

686,"I’ve been in this friend group since the beginning in high school ( I live in the uk so when referring to what age stage in the school I’ll be saying years not grades because idk how the American grade system works ) now stories like these are difficult to asses from an outsiders point of view because i could be twisting the events to fit my narrative and make me look good I’m not saying I’m in the write or their in the wrong I just need someone to converse with 


My friend group started in year 7 and built up slowly over the years the people in the group don’t matter too much I want you to know that they are genuinely great friends but when they all hate someone they get very toxic two people have already left the friend group permanently whilst I was in it I will tell you the stories quickly to show what they are like 


The first person to leave was a guy named jack he was in the group from the beginning but opinion of him scored after he was seen as annoying and a liar which he was we still make fun of him to this day whilst being friends with him we would shit talk about him a lot which he definitely deserved but it got to a point where a friend of mine hacked his Instagram ( jack gave the password to it and other stuff in dms earlier to the friend and the friend just dug them up and hacked account) nothing too bad happened but it was the main reason he left the group he has new friends which he continues to lie too 




Other is more recent happening about a month ago I can’t say his name because it’s 
Pretty unique so we will call him Mike. Mike was annoying lied ( to a lesser extent than jack) and harassed a certain friend on discord we had to tell him why we didn’t like him and not to hang out with us he has a new group but my friend group joined their discord server and pissed everyone off just cuz it was funny 


I want to say that I was complicit in this toxic shit I convinced my friend to hack jacks acc and was the person who told Mike the dislike harboured by the group so I’m just as bad as them 


Now to the point I feel like they hate me they have secret chats and vcs on our discord server which are invisible to just me and nobody and I have to be invited to them we used to hang out a lot but they’ve stopped inviting me and realising this I left the discord server about a day ago no one has asked me about it on dms and I’m sure they don’t care they haven’t explicitly told me they dislike me but the pieces fit I only really have one other close friend but we don’t hang out much do to their schedules and friend group I have some other friends but not being their fault I can’t stand them for more than a couple of hours my friend group is pretty unique so can’t just replace them I am in year 10 during the half term holiday I haven’t told them why I left the discord server and I don’t think they care the holiday will end and I don’t how I’m going to cope at school

Initially I wanted to tell whoever I would pair up with beforehand about the scars, and tell them to keep it between us. I just don’t want my classmates to see me differently because of it. Also, the instructions for the practical class say you should tell your partner beforehand if they can expect to find an “abnormality” when examining you. But now I’m reluctant to talk about it. The guy seems to be a nice person, I guess I don’t want him to think that I’m crazy or that I’m unstable, because maybe he won’t want to be friends with me because of it. The scars are only a few, slightly lighter than my skin, they’re a bit faded, but because they’re obviously cuts parallel to each other, I guess there’s a good chance he will notice them either way.

Hi all, I live in a rental house with a few other girls in their 20s in the Albany, New York area. My roommate first spotted a mouse back in July. I told my landlord about it immediately and he said that he ""wouldn't consider one mouse an infestation."" He set up one trap by the trash can and some poison in the basement. But that's no help because I have been hearing the mice making high pitched squeaky noises every day. At first, I was in denial and thought I was being paranoid the past few weeks and ignored the possibility of mice. I also did notice a lot of tiny black droppings around the house and at first, I just thought it was dirty or spider poop. But I didn't realize mice poop can be so small. I see it at my dining table even though I have no food there, just my coffee machine, and then around the kitchen counters. I don't leave unpackaged food on the counter but I do leave cardboard boxes filled with wrapped granola bars and stuff because there's not a lot of space in the cabinets.

I texted my landlord today about getting an exterminator and he completely ignored what I said about getting an exterminator and said he's come to the house and ""set up traps"", but I don't think setting up traps Is really fixing the issue. He also said we leave food out, even though I don't leave unpackaged food out ever besides the granola bars as I said. Overall, I feel like the house isn't completely maintained. We have spider, flies, drain flies. I already have OCD and am super clean. Now it's October and I hear the mice more since it is getting cold. I am grossed out because their poop is all over my dish rack even though there is no food there and on the tables and such. The thought of it makes me nauseous and want to vomit... I know him setting up traps isn't going to solve anything until he seriously covers the hole or areas where these mice are coming from. I feel like he should get pest control involved if he actually cared about the property.

If this mice issue does not go away soon, I want to move out because this is disgusting. On top of this, the house is not well maintained with issues with the flush and on &amp; off electrical issues where my room's power would go out. I have a job so I am willing to spend a few hundred more dollars on my own apartment in the area that is well maintained and more clean and reliable...What legal steps should I take for my landlord to take this mouse infestation seriously (for instance, should I report it to the Albany Health Department for health inspection)? If the issue persists, do I as a tenant have a legal right to vacate the apartment and live elsewhere? He also never mentioned any pest issues on the lease, so I presume it is his responsibility as a landlord to get rid of the issue in the state of New York. He keeps repeatedly saying he never had a mouse issue and blaming me and my roommates for ""leaving food out."" Is it that hard for him to just call an exterminator?",27Oct2020,1

So some background... I was hired at a private ophthalmologists office where about 4 doctors work. I was hired to help the office transition from paper files to EMR. I also occasionally help out with OCT and visual fields. However, my main responsibility is to prep patient charts, which take time. My pay is $15 an hour. That’s how I started. I began in May during the pandemic. However, now the main technician is leaving and the other main technician is alone. We have two other ones but one always calls out unknowingly and the other is old and only does fields. But now they want me to do more and come in like two hours earlier: fields, OCT, autorefracts, pressure checks, acuity, etc. I feel like I’m being thrown around doing all the shit they don’t want to do and getting paid much less than them. I’m wondering if I should text the head doctor and ask him to like set guidelines on what I do so I can also do the prepping that the other techs DONT DO. in addition I feel as if I deserve higher compensation being that I have so much more to do now.

707,"this'll be long, my apologies.

my *caucasion* dad, who is very christian, racist, homophobic, everything you can think of, is the worst kind of person ever. i try my best to have a relationship/bond with him, but i just cant.
whenever we try to do things together, he always brings up politics, trump (hes a supporter, we arent american though), covid(anti-masker), etc. it really annoys me that hes just so close minded and ignorant. not to mention, extremely sexist.

heres an ex;

when we were on a road trip during the summer, my mom, dad, and i, were talking about kids &amp; if i'm going to have them in the future, i said no, because i want to adopt, i dont want kids of my own because i dont wanna go through the whole pregnancy thing, and giving kids with no family a home seems way better to me. anyways, my dad told me ""you'll never be a full woman if you dont have kids"", ""thats selfish not to want kids"", ""adopting kids isnt the same as having your own"", ""you'll have lots of kids"".

another ex;

we were in walmart returning something, there were 2 cashiers, one black and one white, the lady who was returning the thing my dad bought was black, and the other one was white like i said.

the white lady finished returning the other customers item before ours (because they were there before us obviously, has nothing to do with race) and the lady who was returning ours was inspecting it, etc, because i assume thats just their normal procedure to do. it took a couple minutes and then we went back out to the car, when we got in my dad was like ""you see how she took so long to do her job? the white woman finished way faster than her"" (again the other customer beside us was there before us) he then said ""black people are slower than us white people, we're more developed in the brain""

first off, let me say i'll never be anything like my dad, i try and talk to him/educate him about how we are all equal, he just doesn't get it. i dont like spending time with him anymore because of how he acts/is. i've also kinda stopped eating supper/dinner with my family because politics is the only thing he talks about while we try to eat, it just sucks, i dont know what i can do to make him change his views

All was going so well, until I realise that I needed to improve my social skills.

Why I wanted to do that?, Because knew that after lockdown I was going to a new school for my first course in what you call ""Sixth Form colledge"".

I learnt about social skills by reading some subreddits, advices, whatching videos...

As protocol though, they needed my next of kin and as I'm Australian, I dont have relatives in the UK and so I gave my ex boyfriend's details (we broke up earlier this year - a British man). As I didnt go to hospital, will the paramedics still contact him?",27Oct2020,1
715,"So I'm in a new relationship, and have formed a pandemic ""social bubble"" consisting of me, my girlfriend, her roommate's girlfriend, and her roommate's mom who she goes to visit. Gf's mom has a couple conditions making her higher risk in terms of pandemic complications.

Before I entered the bubble, I quarantined and got a covid test per roommate's request, which I found reasonable. In the meantime prior to test results, she found out that me and my girlfriend hadn't been wearing masks on our social distanced outdoor park dates, and went ballistic and made us wear masks on our final social distance date. My gf mentioned that her roommate had gone as far as to ask us to not go on our date at all, and wait until the test results came back, even though we'd be outside at a park wearing masks and distancing. I found this a bit too much.

Then, my gf told me they sanitize their groceries and would I be willing to do the same. I said no and that I needed some boundaries, and she accepted that but insinuated she'd be checking with her roommate to see if that was fine.

This past Monday I went to go vote. Over the weekend, my gf said that her roommate (who I haven't even met yet) wanted me to borrow one of her KN95 masks to go vote. I said no, I'd wear my own mask, and that I saw that as overstepping my boundaries. Later that day my gf let me know that her roommate basically wasn't accepting that as an answer, and was overly anxious about her mom's safety, etc. I made it really clear that I was upset, and felt like me making my boundaries clear didn't seem to matter to anyone. And I felt a bit cornered by the roommate at this point bc I felt like at this point if I said no, then I'd seem like a douche who wasn't empathetic toward her wanting to keep her mother safe.

We're all having a social bubble meeting tonight and I want to politely tell her roommate to back off, but it's so awkward because we haven't spoken before. I feel like instead of micromanaging me, she needs to find her own solutions, like visiting her mom less if she's that worried. Am I in the wrong here? How can I get her to leave me alone?

716,"Hi, this may be a long post as there's so much I want to say and don't know who to talk to.

So for about 2 and a half years now I've been feeling like there's no meaning to my life, I'm not sure how it started but before I knew it I just live day by day not knowing where I'm headed. In terms of academics I do well or really well if I actually study but I've become so lazy and take everything with a literal ""just wing it"" attitude that I've lost the ability to stress about exams and studies in general. I can easily procastinate studying till the day of the exam and not feel stressed whether I pass or fail.

I know I'm the problem and everytime I try and get my act together I just land right back to the start. Last year was the worst for me as I started having edibles to drown out everything else, I'd take them everyday without even thinking twice, I'd take it for weeks but the lockdown helped in a way that I had to forcibly stop taking it as I couldn't get any, when I was able to get I did and used it for a while, I can happily say that I've been off any drugs for about 2 months now so that's a plus side I guess?

Today both my father and grandmother called me disappointments and that they don't see me getting far in life which really hit me, I really wanted to tell them everything but I know if I do it will just add fuel to the fire, I want to show them I'm not a total failure. 

I've been writing tests for university and have done well so far with what I've written but I still feel empty inside. I don't know where or what I want to do with myself in the future, I feel like nothing is worth it and to continue on is just disappointing to others around me. I know this is entirely on me but I can't find any motivation to make a change, I do it for a day then I relapse to my old habits.

718,"I (16F) live with my parents, sister, uncle, aunt, and two young cousins. Privacy was never particularly stressed in our house, things like my dad coming in to say goodnight while we were asleep was common since he used to work late.

(tl;dr at bottom, also am on mobile so excuse formatting etc)

My bedroom doorknob has been broken for many years now, and it cannot close fully. The locking mechanism is 'locked' so you can't even shut it all the way. Usually I solve this by closing the door as far as possible (you can't see inside that way) and then using a doorstopper to keep it shut. However it's fairly easy to open the door with even a little bit of strength.

My youngest cousin (6M) has a fascination with garbage, and often goes around the house emptying the bins into a garbage bag (he isn't allowed near certain bins for example the kitchens, but most paper waste and similar is free game for him). This means he will often come into my room to check my bins, both while I am there and even when I'm not. He is able to open the door unless I jam the doorstopper under the door very forcefully, and he doesn't have a very good grasp on the concept of closed doors meaning privacy. Since he's quite young I'm not as uncomfortable with it, but I am concerned that it will result in a lack of respect for privacy later on, and I am still not very happy about it.

What is worse, is that other members of the family also do not respect my privacy. My sister has done this often, which is not that bad but still makes me uncomfortable because I need my privacy. My dad often walks in without even knocking or giving me warning, which in my opinion is completely inappropriate considering I am a teenager (and have been for years). I have tried multiple times in the past to assert the fact that I want him to knock, but he never listens. Occasionally I try to point out that I could have been changing or something, to which he replies with ""but you weren't"" or something to that effect. Sometimes he has done it while I was actually changing, so I have taken to changing in a corner of the room so that if he opens the door I am not immediately visible.

I have asked to get the doorknob fixed, but it is always put off and eventually forgotten. I have also tried putting a note on my door asking to knock, but this is usually ignored after the first day or so.

I have tried getting advice from a friend, but her suggestion was to spend my time in my room shirtless or topless so that the lesson is learned the hard way. However this makes me very very uncomfortable and I honestly don't think that it could be a good solution. I would feel awkward bringing this up to another friend so I decided to ask the internet instead.

tl;dr my door cannot lock, and my family doesn't respect my privacy and often enter my room without knocking even when the door is closed.

What can I do to ensure my privacy and make it clear that I am uncomfortable with people walking into my bedroom without warning or permission? And is there a good way I can enforce this rule to my young cousin?",27Oct2020,1

721,"A couple years back i (F19)asked my best friend(M19) (of almost 10 years) to go to a party with me because I didnt want to go alone and nobody else wanted to go with me and I needed to be there because I was chaperoning someone else.


He didn't want to go with me at first but later came back and said he would if he could touch my butt one time. I was like thats so weird but whatever I need someone to go with me(especially him because i did have a crush on him so it wasn't such a big deal).

The next day after the party he became more touchy and it started to bother me but because I liked him i didn't say anything for a while but then he started to change he started to touch me not only on my butt and he wanted to be friends with Benefits.

I didn't want that because i was uncomfortable and I wanted to be more that friends with benefits. Told him i didn't want that and he became mad and stormed off. He ignored me for a very long time and my feelings started to fade.


I have to admit i did miss our friendship when it was just that and nothing else. After a couple of months he started talking to me and touching me again after i told him i didnt want that multiple times. He became more agressive and more forceful he would agressively touch me and start to hurt me.

 I started to avoid him and he started dating one of my friends(now exfriend). He would still message me asking for nudes and still want to talk about sexual stuff to which i told him no because i didn't want to hurt my friend.

He would keep on bugging me and keep mentioning stuff out loud in our group that only i would get to make me feel guilty. And he would make me feel bad by telling the others im ignoring him ect.

I tried my best to avoid him but sometimes he would somehow find me and touch me sexually much worse than before.
One time he tried to finger me in the corner of a room by blocking me in the corner behind the table with everyone around us (table was in the corner and i sat in the corner his girlfriend sat infront of me and everyone around me and he moved to the seat next to me trapping me in the corner)  

I felt so helpless i couldn't do anything please understand that he is very good at lying and if i did somehow find my voice there he wouldve turned everyone against me. Im not could at confrontation and he would very easily convince everyone he didn't do anything wrong.

He would sometimes even send me nudes from his girlfriend that he took without her knowing, it made me so uncomfortabke i just wanted to block him but i couldnt becsuee he wouod confront me infront of everyone abiut it making me the bad person. And the best of all he doesnt think he did anything wrong. They even told me they wanted me to be the godmother/gaurdian of their children oneday. 

Im not sure if this counts as molest. I'm very confused, im scared and i dont know what to do or anything. I saw him sexually harrash( he wiuld only grab their butts) other girls before but never anything like what happened to me.

Hes very manipulative and he never listened to me when i told him to stop or push him away. Because of this I'm overly sensitive and get triggered easily, if someone were to touch me suddenly i would flinch so hard and jump over a table i swear.

Nobody understands why i changed so suddenly and i still dont know what to do about this whole situation...

 i don't see him anymore and i did get a boyfriend and he started to teach me self defense because of this. I did get a chance to use the selfdefense against him(exfriend not bf) once. When he grapped me from behind my reflexes kicked in and he did not leave unharmed.

But except the whole self defense thing indont know what else to do.
I feel very guilty about all of this
(considering i gave him permission the first couple times)

Only my boyfriend, his dad and my other friend know about this and they want to best him up pretty badly but they wont because i asked them and didn't want them to get in trouble.

722,"Hey, I've never posted on Reddit before and I'm not even sure if this is the right subreddit, but stuff happened recently and I keep wondering whether I was really overreacting or if I was legitimately disrespected.

 So three days ago I hung out with three friends of mine, we're all around 17-18. I was the only girl there. There was a lot of booze, and one of these friends, who I'll call D, had hooked up with me before that, around january. 

 Last time we hooked up, a lot of shit went down because he's friends with my ex, and this almost separated their group, but the mess was mainly based around my ex still having feelings for me even though he said it was okay if we hooked up. I stopped hooking up with D because I didn't want anything bad to happen anymore, and I only did it again when i knew it would be okay or when I wasn't talking to my ex anymore.

 Three days ago, when we hung out, I hooked up with him again because I knew that wouldn't be a problem, I just asked him not to tell other people because I genuinely don''t like having my intimacy exposed like that. However, he and the two other friends who were there thought that I just didn't want to tell my ex (which wasn't true because I knew at this point he wouldn't have gotten mad about that anymore so i was totally okay with him knowing), and they didn't want me to tell him either because they thought they would be in trouble if I did, which again, not true, that would've been fine for everyone.

 Surprisingly, all this isn't the point. it's D's behaviour.

 During the whole night, maybe because we had hooked up already, maybe because he's an asshole (which would make more sense because he treats me like that since before us hooking up), he was just acting in an extremely fucked up way. When I slapped him on the arm for saying something rude to me, he'd slap me back even harder on the thigh, playfully tried to burn me with a lighter (that was quick though), pulled my hair hard by the front of it, and kept making jokes about how I should fuck him if he jumped in the neighbour's pool. He insisted on that ""joke"" for about an hour. He also slapped me on the ass out of nowhere, kept squeezing my hand to the point where it hurt so much and when I asked him to stop he wouldn't unless I bit him, to which he'd respond by slapping me (on the head, not crazy hard, but also not light at all). He also called me a slut once and told me to shut up a couple of times, and when I'd say ""stop saying that"" he'd yell ""IT'S A JOKE"". He also kept stealing my phone repeatedly, trying to look through it.

 On another occasion I hung out with these guys, we were talking about democracy. They were saying democracy was bad and it didn't work, and I was trying to counter that. D said ""If you like democracy so much, if most people here decided they want to fuck you, you should just suck it up then and accept it because that's democracy"". The other boys were cheering and saying ""Hell yeah I want to!"" Bear in mind I was the only girl there.

 On a sexual context, I would never say he forced me to do anything I did or that he sexually harassed me because it's a really serious accusation to make and also I could've stopped and said no, which I didn't, and some of it was genuinely enjoyable, but most of what happened right off the bat was a result of him moving my hand or yanking my head without asking me if I wanted anything at all, just basically assuming I did and that I was okay with it, or just not caring if I did because I wouldn't speak up. If you think this is only because we had hooked up before, that's not true, because he acted this way since the first time. The one time he asked me to actually have sex with him, I turned down, and he called me ""weak"". Again, he didn't force me to do anything and I should've said no to anything I didn't want, so that's not accusing him of anything like that, just saying he was an asshole about it, and really rough without asking me if I was okay with it. Still, my bad for not saying ""no"".

 Another thing that happened that made me extremely uncomfortable was another one of the three guys there, let's call him F, was looking through my bag without my permission. When I saw it, he had my tampons and pads out, and was starting to pull out other stuff I had there like my underwear, my clothes etc. They were making jokes about it. Again, I should've told them to stop. I was just too embarrassed. Apart from laughing at everything else that happened that was making me uncomfortable, that was the only thing F did wrong, I'd say.

 The other guy who was there, P, was actually really decent to me, didn't make any uncomfortable jokes, and when he noticed I wasn't okay with what was happening even though I wasn't saying anything, offered to take me home. The only reason I didn't go was because this was right after I hooked up with D and I wanted to talk about the whole ""telling my ex situation"", because they were telling me not to do it, even though I was saying I'd do jt because nothing bad was going to happen.

  So here's what happened after I left. I told a couple of friends of mine what happened, how uncomfortable I felt the whole night. I also told my ex boyfriend. The reason I told him, apart from being the same as why I told my other friends (venting about being treated horribly), was also because those were his friends and if I was in his place, I'd like to know those are the people I hang out with. I also told him I had hooked up with D, and like I said, that wasn't at all what he was pissed off about, or the cause of the whole issue. He was extremely furious at everything else that happened, and confronted F.

 I kinda expected the rest. Both F and D were telling me and him that I was lying about it, that I was making these things up just so I'd take the guilt off myself for hooking up with him and because I wanted my ex to be mad at them and not me. When I talked to F and D, they kept denying the things that happened TO MY FACE, D kept saying he didn't hit me or was rude to me at all, and everything else were just jokes (he apologized about it but denied the rest) and F was saying he did ask to look through my bag, which he really didn't. He even said I had asked him to hold him, which didn't happen at all. Their argument, apart from straight up denying or distorting facts, was that I was the one making stuff up to not look guilty about the hookup. Again, this wouldn't have made sense, because since I KNEW my ex wouldn't be angry about the hookup, what the hell would I feel guilty about? They were also telling him the things I did sexually with D, which again, wasn't the problem, but they were using it to say ""See? She wanted all this, otherwise why would she do that?""

 Although it's pretty difficult to understand the whole story since there are two sides saying completely opposite things, there was no reason for me to deny or make anything up. I realize my mistake of not saying ""no"",  or telling them seriously to stop, and as far as sexual things go, I don't accuse him of anything apart from being an ass about it. But with them saying that I'm making things up, and denying to do things I KNOW happened to ME, I'm starting to feel crazy.

DISCLAIMER: The reason I mentioned my ex is because they think the reason this all happened is because of the relationship we have and they think the problem was me telling him about the hookup, and telling the rest was just a way to shift the blame to them, and that's what they're telling me and everyone else. In reality, the hookup and my ex knowing about it had almost no importance to what really is the problem, which is the treatment I get whenever I'm around them.",27Oct2020,1

Suppose such people would have no problem if the someone in question would get a drink sometime; is it ethical so if this person takes psychedelics?


I think it would be ethical indeed, and I'm interested in reading opinions both against or according to this

I'm willing also to discuss the first two assumptions if needed",27Oct2020,1
729,"I think my friend group hates me and need help

I’ve been in this friend group since the beginning in high school ( I live in the uk so when referring to what age stage in the school I’ll be saying years not grades because idk how the American grade system works ) now stories like these are difficult to asses from an outsiders point of view because i could be twisting the events to fit my narrative and make me look good I’m not saying I’m in the write or their in the wrong I just need someone to converse with 


My friend group started in year 7 and built up slowly over the years the people in the group don’t matter too much I want you to know that they are genuinely great friends but when they all hate someone they get very toxic two people have already left the friend group permanently whilst I was in it I will tell you the stories quickly to show what they are like 


The first person to leave was a guy named jack he was in the group from the beginning but opinion of him scored after he was seen as annoying and a liar which he was we still make fun of him to this day whilst being friends with him we would shit talk about him a lot which he definitely deserved but it got to a point where a friend of mine hacked his Instagram ( jack gave the password to it and other stuff in dms earlier to the friend and the friend just dug them up and hacked account) nothing too bad happened but it was the main reason he left the group he has new friends which he continues to lie too 




Other is more recent happening about a month ago I can’t say his name because it’s 
Pretty unique so we will call him Mike. Mike was annoying lied ( to a lesser extent than jack) and harassed a certain friend on discord we had to tell him why we didn’t like him and not to hang out with us he has a new group but my friend group joined their discord server and pissed everyone off just cuz it was funny 


I want to say that I was complicit in this toxic shit I convinced my friend to hack jacks acc and was the person who told Mike the dislike harboured by the group so I’m just as bad as them 


Now to the point I feel like they hate me they have secret chats and vcs on our discord server which are invisible to just me and nobody and I have to be invited to them we used to hang out a lot but they’ve stopped inviting me and realising this I left the discord server about a day ago no one has asked me about it on dms and I’m sure they don’t care they haven’t explicitly told me they dislike me but the pieces fit I only really have one other close friend but we don’t hang out much do to their schedules and friend group I have some other friends but not being their fault I can’t stand them for more than a couple of hours my friend group is pretty unique so can’t just replace them I am in year 10 during the half term holiday I haven’t told them why I left the discord server and I don’t think they care the holiday will end and I don’t how I’m going to cope at school

733,"I (F17) have two best friends, Red and Blue. I am struggling with whether or not to use have or had.

We used to be very inseparable. We did everything together. We performed, travelled, cooked, played games, had coffee weekly and told each other everything. Red was diagnosed with cancer about a year ago and Blue and I were there for her through it all. I did all I could.

The friendship I had with Blue had slowly become unhealthy. We were friends for years. We weren’t good to each other— there was a constant dependency and she couldn’t support me how I needed to be. I understood this and we worked to fix our relationship. I understood the mistakes I had made and really worked to do better.

But I’ve come to a point where I’m starting to wonder if Blue is really putting in any effort at all. My relationship with Red has gone downhill, because it seems like they only ever care about each other. They stopped inviting me to go with them, I constantly have to fight for their attention, and I’ve tried to have conversations with them about our relationship but they continuously shut me down. They never tell me if there is anything going on or if I’m doing something wrong. I don’t know what to do. They make me feel terribly alone, make me question my worth, and I started to wonder if I could take back meeting them, would I have done it?
It causes me so much pain because I love them so dearly. 

My anxiety and depression have become very severe and I am going on meds next week. Today, is one of our friends birthdays, and we are going to have dinner with them as a group. I hate group situations because I get inside my head and I have really started to notice that they don’t care about me anymore. They don’t sit next to me, talk to me, or even interact with me. I am trying to stay positive and support my other friend because it’s her birthday, but Red and Blue break my heart.

I don’t really know if this is the right place for this but I’d appreciate your opinions anyway

I just feel so sad, the more I sit and think the more I realise nothing brings me happiness like actual joy or pleasure. I am 19F for context and have recently started uni (in September) I hate my course and I don’t have a group of friends here and I just feel fucking shit. It’s too late to change course and I don’t want to drop out because that would be such a pathetic move in my eyes- and I’ve always performed very well academically getting A*A*A in my a levels. I have no passion, I used to draw and read and play the piano (since age 10) and I just stopped a few years ago. Haven’t touched a piano since March. My friends and boyfriend have said in the past that I should seek professional help for my mental health but that just seems unnecessary (it’s been up and down since about age 14 but since turning 18 it has peaked and troughed more severely). My boyfriend is a music genius and it’s his passion and I just wish I could have a talent and enthusiasm for something like that; a drive. My other friends dance and read and have things they love doing- I have none. We used to enjoy playing D&amp;D together which has stopped since starting uni. I just feel pointless. It feels like I’m wasting 9.3k on a degree I think is boring as fuck but I have nothing else I want to do either. The only thing I can think of that I might like to do is woodwork which again I feel like sounds silly because my abilities have always seemed to lie in essay writing (hence the degree route). I’ve always made things with my dad and I took woodworking for gcse and it was so fun and I got 100% on my course (I made an art nouveau chair). I don’t know though maybe my course will get better but even if it does I will probably still feel shit. Just feel like an embarrassment with no passions and just wasted potential.",27Oct2020,1
735," I am now 23 and pursuing a degree in pure math. I am currently doing undergrad research with plans of getting a PhD. However, I realized I can never accept that I’m smart or trust myself. I second guess everything, for example if I have an idea I tell myself it must not be that smart because it’s coming from me. I rely on the internet so much and second guess everything.

Growing up, I was never given a choice even over the small things. For example, while all of my friends were part of the process picking out their first car, my parents just came back with one one day (not saying I’m not grateful for it, because I definitely am). When I was upset that I didn’t even get to talk about options with them, my dad informed me that I couldn’t possibly be part of it because it was their money and I had no experience. My life was a series of events like these.

I can’t afford therapy, so how can I learn to trust myself? I can’t see how I will ever be successful if I can’t believe I am capable of coming up with good ideas. I read so much, but whether I try to branch out to ideas of my own I immediately shut down.",27Oct2020,1

This is a long story. I’ll change his name due to privacy reasons. I’ll call him Will (23/M)

I returned to college in 2019 after a gap year from college as I wasn’t ready. I met my classmates and Will was in my class. Will was the most notable one to greet me in my class. He is a lovely guy with a troubled past.

Anyway, in October 2019. I had to do a short movie with Will and I find out he used to be bisexual as he came out of a bad relationship and decided to try it with boys to see if he liked it. However, after trying bottoming after a drunk night out. He didn’t like it anymore. I had to kiss Will and pretend to be his boyfriend for the scene. He lent in for a kiss (apart of movie) and like told me I would make someone very happy. Will got a girlfriend afterwards but they had a horrible break-up and it was awkward as they were both in the same class.

The day after the breakup, Will became very feminine suddenly and like was staring at me. For example, he bent over and said ‘smilingtribute, take me’ my friend took a video of this and I’ve still got a record of it. He apologised the day after as he noticed he made me uncomfortable. 

However, today things changed. I was reading my book and he yelled ‘smilingtribute, paint me like one of your french girls’ I wasn’t happy with it as he was doing the same thing as last time. I’ve also noticed he is completely different person outside of class today as he became very feminine snapping his friends by flicking his scarf and stuff. 

I told him that he confused me as changes from a normal guy to this feminine guy in the matter of seconds and I snapped him a few hours ago to tell him to stop with paint me like a french girl as I feel like he is using me to built up his ego and I don’t want to happen as a someone used me in 2017. Doing the exact same thing to me and I’m took me a few years to get over them.

A friend in my college class says he doesn’t liked to viewed gay and went he jokingly sent an x to him in a message. Will wasn’t happy with it. 

Why are boys like this?

Here are some examples, for you to understand the situation

&amp;#x200B;

* Once I asked him if he could show me how to use the power scythe ( It's like a land mower, but you attach it on yourself like a backpack). He explained it to me and then gave it to me to try. Normally with new things I need few tries to get the handle of it and understand how it works. I started mowing (obviously it wasn't that good, since it was my first time) and after a short time he took it from me and mowed the lawn himself. He basically told me that I'm dumb and don't have what it takes. He expected me to know naturally how to use it, even I never touched a lawn mower in my life before. I told him that I need few tries to understand how it works and he  exaggerated that and told me that I don't need university to know this. There were a lot of simular events where he explained something to me and took it from me if I didn't do it perfectly from the first time.
* Other example is: when we work something together, he expects me to read his thoughts and give him the tool that he wants to work with or do the thing that he has in his mind. I don't have much experience with working, so I can't know everything he wants. Yeah you can predict some basic stuff. Even if two experienced workers work with each other, communication is important, you can't expect your coleague to know what you want.
* He has an opinion of me  that I'm lazy, sleepy and don't pay attention. Example: He mentioned that there's an optician in our village. I asked where exacly, I didn't notice that. He then started arguing with me how I don't pay attention and all, that we drive on that road every day (which is not true) and simular stuff. When someone else drives I don't pay attention on the road that much, why should I? When I need to pay attention I do, but he expects me to pay attention to every single irrelevant detail around me.
* when I'm concentrated on something else and and can't pay attention to him or forgot what he told me, he always goes off about how I can't concentrate on more than one thing or that it isn't possible to forget something at my age etc.
* He belives that he is always right. There were couple of times where i knew that I was 100% right (on time it was something IT related, I go to school for that and I know a lot more than him) he argues that he is right until he realizes that he isn't  ( I or someone else shows him) and when he realizes he just shrugs it off like it didn't happen. When I'm wrong I admit and say sorry.
* Also simular to the one before: He thinks that his way of life is the only and right one. If I do something different than him he either thinks I'm weird or tells me I'm wrong.
* This one does my mom too: he accepts to do me a favour ( mostly to drive me somewhere) and then he nags about how he doesen't have time, or how I'm unrensponsible.

&amp;#x200B;

The title is a bit misleading so sorry for that too!

Anyways, me and my girlfriend just started dating, around 3 weeks ago, but we were extremely good friends for almost 2 years. Since uni started I moved to a different country cause my uni is there (even with online learning I still have in person lectures). My gf got accepted to a really good uni in her hometown, so she started studying there. 

To clarify a bit, we started the relationship on long distance, it’s a bit difficult, but so far we’re doing really well cause we understand that we both need our personal space from time to time. 

Long story short, uni stress is starting to get to her, and I wanna help cheer her up a bit. We’re both very understanding of each and realize that sometimes uni has to come first for short periods cause it’s our future in the end, but we always try to make time for each other. 

I wanted to send her like a short message so she can read it every time she feels stressed. But I’m not really good with words... so this is why I’m here.

Hello all,

I need some advice and input regarding my living situation.

I currently rent a bedroom out of my friends home and live here with my GF sharing the one bedroom. My friend who is the homeowner also lives here with her significant other. We are approaching 2 years since we have moved here and are perfect tenants to her. We clean often, where as before we moved in the house was a mess, (literally grass all over the floor that hasn't been swept in months, as they used to wear shoes in the house) we cleaned it up, influenced her to also clean the carpets and have kept it clean since with no other issues.

We haven't had too many issues staying here besides her cleanliness, and delays on getting stuff around the house done. (wall damages repair in our room, appliances are dated and don't function properly sometimes, which still hasn't been fixed etc.) but not the end of the world for issues as they still worked for the most part.

We never signed an official lease like she said she was going to write up, which wasn't an issue as she knew we were good tenants and friends. Also, she hasn't raised the price of rent since the two years we have moved in, which we appreciate, and we currently pay $900 a month for both of us which includes all utilities and internet. I believe she gave us a good deal, and I have no problem with her increasing the rent a bit. However, recently she briefly mentioned to us while in passing that she was going to increase our rent $400 more a month, making it $1,300 a month for both of us. She quickly mentioned a few reasons for the increase, but did not go into any detail. But she stated that taxes on utilities are going up, (we are in Washington state suburb 30+ minutes away from Seattle) our internet speed/data cap increase, and a larger garbage bin. All seem very trivial besides the potential taxes on utility, which I will need to do some research on.

I felt that increase was a little high especially for one bedroom in a deteriorating home that will need upgrades soon. Like I stated earlier, I have no problem with an increase, and was thinking that $1,150 a month would be more accurate of an rent increase, as usually renters increase renewals of lease about 3%-7% each year. Also, the fact that there are plenty of one bedroom apartments in the surrounding area we researched that will be less expensive in rent cost per month, especially with COVID there are more apartments available at this time. Obviously with utilities the price may be a little more than what we are paying now, but we would at least have our own place and not have to share the home with others.

We are thinking about asking her to see the utility bills for the past 6 months for more insight, as I am sure we are using quite a bit, but we should also be splitting this by 4 people who live here. I will also research some potential locations that are less than what she is offering, and see if she is willing to negotiate the increase with that information, as well if we promise to stay for another year. Since we don't have an official lease, and treating this as a month to month rental, she is probably concerned about how long we would stay.

I would just like some input from others on this, as I would prefer to stay and not have to deal with the move out process at this time, but I can't justify staying here in a one bedroom and sharing the home for that high of a price. I was gonna do some more research on this, but would like feedback on if she is trying to fuck us a little on the increase, or are we being unrealistic about the increase?

Appreciate any feedback/help on this issue! Hopefully I was clear enough on this.",27Oct2020,1

749,"Hello Reddit,

I \[18F\] really need some advice, or at the least to let off some steam. 

I've found myself feeling increasingly gloomy and frustrated. I'm a full time college student, however, it's getting to a point where I have been greatly considering dropping out.

When I first applied (this was pre-lockdown), I was told I would be attending campus 3 days a week, however the week before I started I was informed it would be only one day a week, and the other 2 days would be done purely online. This is where my first problem begins, as I live rurally with extremely limited internet access. I cannot make any calls via the internet, and only one person can be connected at a time, which is generally my mum. I had explained this to the college, and they got a 4G dongle sent out to me, which didn't work as I do not get service or data on my farm, and they requested for me to send it back, which I did. 

After that, I did not hear back from the college, despite contacting them about my connectivity issues both via email and attempting to discuss it in person. I have now missed every single video call (3 times a week on their personal website) since the start of term, and I am very far behind on the work, as I've not been told what I'm supposed to be doing. I can't even access the website they have to access my course materials or contact my lecturers. 

I asked if I could come on campus a couple more days a week, however due to the pandemic this was denied. I'm at a loss as to what else I can suggest I do.

I have not been on campus in three weeks, as three weeks ago one of my dogs sadly passed away from cancer, and October holidays were the last two weeks, so I've had no contact or support from my lecturers, and I'm now over 3 weeks behind on my work, as well as behind on an entire topic, which no one has informed me about. 

I have completely lost passion for my subject, to the point that I think I've lost skill in it. I don't know what to do, my mum wont let me drop out, even though she has not had to pay for anything, nor have any involvement in my college studies. I brought it up earlier today and she just said ""I didn't raise a quitter.""  I don't even think she knows what my course is. I cannot do what my course requires of me, simply due to a lack of internet access. I'm at my wits end. 

Between college and my home life, which is an entire different rollercoaster of problems, I just feel burnt out and just gloomy. I don't know what to do. Do I just have to fail?",27Oct2020,1

Now to the point I feel like they hate me they have secret chats and vcs on our discord server which are invisible to just me and nobody and I have to be invited to them we used to hang out a lot but they’ve stopped inviting me and realising this I left the discord server about a day ago no one has asked me about it on dms and I’m sure they don’t care they haven’t explicitly told me they dislike me but the pieces fit I only really have one other close friend but we don’t hang out much do to their schedules and friend group I have some other friends but not being their fault I can’t stand them for more than a couple of hours my friend group is pretty unique so can’t just replace them I am in year 10 during the half term holiday I haven’t told them why I left the discord server and I don’t think they care the holiday will end and I don’t how I’m going to cope at school 

Anyone has advice

752,"Here’s the setting: eating disorder (not specified), working quite intensely with a therapist for trauma (ptsd), just recently moved back to London to restart university after being deferred for two years, coping with painful joint disorder of some type that’s being investigated. 

I cannot get my diet under control. I’m not overweight yet but I’m heading that way. I have put on 20 pounds since July. Normally I would eat either not enough or just the right amount week to week and maintained a certain weight. 

Now I am just binge eating consistently. My therapist says this is because of trauma but I’m not sure. 

I do not want to become overweight. It’s bad for my joints, my heart (which may be affected by the joint condition) and my mental health.

He lies to his wife about why he goes into work on Sundays (she has asked me to fix his e-mail before because it was ""broken"" and he couldn't use it at home).  This is not a new occurrence, as back in 2016 I discovered something before but ignored/deleted it not knowing it was him.

755,"Here’s the deal I went to an agency to help hire someone to do some odd jobs.

The agency required upfront payment around $5000 USD and then employment rates paid directly to the employee.

I was thinking if they deliver what they promise  that’s fine by me I just want to have no hassle. Their guarantee mentions they have trained the employee well, super hard screening and filtering so it’s guaranteed no problem. The only problem you will have for replacement is when they are “gone”. And they also have guarantee if this doesn’t work they will refund 110%, now see I don’t care about that extra 10% I just want shit to be done and if it doesn’t work I’ll gladly just take the 100% refund.

So I went ahead, but the employee I got was so bad and was told specifically she only got like 5 hours of training and doesn’t know what to do most of the time, randomly ghosts me and late. And does 1 hour of work in 8 hours of time. Actually messed up some company stuff and that took more time to recover than having her.

I was so upset, so I talked to the support team. They said they’ll talk to her maybe provide some more training to her assumed. But no changes happened or improvement so I fired her immediately after the 6th day.

And of course I asked them for a replacement in the next 2 weeks. However after discussing with my other friends, they said they shouldn’t even be charging you for poor services and this is super bad service.

So I asked for a refund, but they’re insisting a replacement. 

I don’t really have faith In the replacement however, but I’m thinking what’s if it will be good. But at the same time, I’ll have to give access and keep paying for another employee that the agency sent who I did not have a good service with....

Will you guys take the replacement or insist on refund?",27Oct2020,1

As I was explaining to the patient what to expect he interrupted me and said to just check her lungs. I was confused as to why just the lungs and not head to toe, so i did just that. I looked up and saw him on his phone the entire time not even paying attention to me, and as I left he got frustrated and asked why I took so short. He started to ask me what 4 areas of the heart you auscultate and I wasnt sure of the names and he started to grab my hand forcefully and made me poke myself aggressively(using his own hand too) for a minute along the 4 areas as I kept getting the names wrong. It did kinda hurt and I tried to get my hand away but he still insisted on grabbing my hand, at that point I was in shock and didnt know what to do. I was so distraught for the rest of the time and wish I had said something. I emailed him and CCed my program chair saying how that was wrong and went into detail as I did just now. My instructor replied back saying how I should have known the names and said ""Im sorry you misunderstood me."" I got ticked off that he ignored everything else and didnt apologize for being aggressive. A student shouldnt be touched without consent especially if theyre showing they're uncomfortable. My instructor is now texting me how hes sorry i misunderstood and calling me, im assuming so he can hear me say its okay so i can dismiss it.

760,"My boyfriend lives with his ex and 16 other people in a big warehouse. He's been there for 8 years, her for 1. She has been emotionally spiraling for the last month or so, yelling and screaming at people, and forcing her way into his room to yell and scream and cry at him. She's gotten two people kicked out of the house in the last 2 months and now seems to be on a crusade to get my BF kicked out. She yells manipulated half truths and downright lies about him being an emotional abuser when other newer younger roommates are within ear shot. I've never seen him this emotionally distraught. 


I'm at a total loss here. I don't know what to do. She I have a long complicated history, she's hurt me deeply in the past, and now she's emotionally abusing the person I care most about. She's playing this game of character assassination and she's repeatedly shown she's really fucking good at it. It's so hard for me to not get roped into her bullshit. There are plenty of people who dislike her. But I'm not the type to try to ruin someone's life and reputation like that. I just feel like there has to be some way to stand up to this bully without stooping to her level.

But honestly even I am scared to talk to her. I have no idea what kind of bullshit she might throw my way, and I certainly don't want to make things worse for my BF. I've been trying to stay out of it and just offer emotional support to my BF, but I also really really think he needs to move out of there. He's been there for 8 years and is the sole lease holder and bares a lot of responsibility/vulnerability. but I also feel like I shouldn't push the issue with him. The thing is there's constant emotional upset in that house, and he talks about moving out, but as soon as the dust settles for a minute he drops the subject. and honestly him moving out is really difficult because of what he does for work, it's not like he can just get an apartment, and he can't move in with me permanently either, because of his dog and the place I live in.

767,"Short version: Basically I (18F) have been friends with a girl (19F) since I was 3 years old. I now am coming to the realisation she just uses me to help her with her problems but doesn't bother to do the same for me. Basically stopped seeing me when she got a boyfriend except for when he's busy. And now I found out that months ago she badmouthed me to a guy (my now boyfriend 18M) I was interested in and told him lies about how I get obsessed with any boy I talk to. 

Looking for advice on how to end friendship in a non dramatic way which is difficult as she always plays the victim and I think she will say my boyfriend is lying but I know he isn't. FYI blocking her isn't an option because our families know each other and I don't want the awkwardness. 

Long version:
I (18F) have been best friends with Jane (19F) since the age of 3. We used to hangout everyday during summer and every weekend when we were in school.  Ever since she got a boyfriend, it was clear after a few months he was her priority. If I asked her to come over I'd get ""oh Ted (her boyfriend 18M) is coming over."" I understand she needs to see her boyfriend but she wouldn't suggest to make time for me next weekend instead. Eventually I gave up asking and we went from seeing each other nearly everyday to once every few months. Anytime she asked me over I would usually go even though she only ever asked if her boyfriend was busy. 

I've brought her on holidays down the country two times, everything paid for all she needed was her own spending money for when we went shopping. When I invited her the third year to come she gave me some excuse but I knew it was because she would rather spend the week at home seeing her boyfriend. 

I had accepted that we just were not as close as we used to be and I was fine because I had other friends. Overtime I noticed that we weren't just not as close but that the friendship was toxic as I always helped her with any fight she had with her boyfriend (all the time) but when I came to her with a problem I would get a half assed response. For example, my boyfriend and I were on a break as the relationship was about to become long distance due to college and marines and I told her this and that we were taking a few days to think about what we want clearly and that I was going to meet him at the weekend to talk. I was crying when I told her this and the only reply I got was ""aw don't cry"" and ""idk what to tell you really"". I changed the subject because I knew I wasn't going to get any support. I'd like to add, I didn't tell her for about 48 hours because she had been crying to me about her job so I decided I'd let her vent first before I talk about my own issue.  

I met my boyfriend, Evan at Christmas time through her and her boyfriend, Ted. Her boyfriend and my boyfriend, were best friends at the time. My boyfriend and I were not serious at the time and he ignored my text after a few days and I told Jane that I was frustrated because I knew he was scared I wanted a serious relationship when at the time I really did not and just enjoyed talking to him. She was going to the club a few nights later and he was going to be there and she insisted she would ask him why he had ignored me. I asked her so many times to please not do that as I look so desperate and I don't care that much. She agreed to not say anything. Later that night I get a text from Evan apologizing for ignoring me. I text her immediately asking what she said and she said ""don't worry it was nothing bad"". Little did I know she had completely bad mouthed me to him just before that. As I said this was at Christmas and my boyfriend and I became serious around march. I asked him many times to tell me what conversation they had that night that made me text him because I thought it would be funny, didn't realise it would be hurtful. He didn't say anything for months because he didn't want to cause an argument but in September he told me that that night she asked him why he ignored me, he said that I was a bit too much for him at the time as he didn't want a serious relationship. She went on to tell him that I am like that with every boy I talk to, I get obsessed and that apparently I was like that with another boy and was continuously texting him acting as if it was serious after I had just kissed him once. She basically initiated for him to not get involved with me again because I will want something serious even though I told her the complete opposite. When my boyfriend told me this I burst out crying because 1. None of that is true, 2. Even if it was true I would never badmouth anyone to someone they liked, nevermind do it to my best friend. 

I have come to the conclusion that she initially set us up just for fun but then got jealous when she realised we were still talking and I was becoming apart of their friend group as she was no longer the only girl. When I think back, before I knew my boyfriend, she used to always say she wants to look extra nice because she's going out with all her boyfriends friends so it makes sense. She clearly wanted to be the centre of attention. 

After I found out I carried on talking to her as normal (which is minimal, dry texts everyday) because I didn't want to have to deal with the drama. I then decided to tell my boyfriend the things she told me before I was with him as I thought I owe him more than I owe her after what she did. She told me before that her boyfriend warned her not to bring my boyfriend over to her house as my boyfriend would rob her and so would his friends. Her boyfriend had said this about his supposedly best friend at the time when my boyfriend had never done anything to make him think that he would rob anyone. Jane also told me that my boyfriends family were definitely the knackery type and said that her boyfriend complained about my boyfriend's mam after she went out of her way to give Ted a lift home. He was bitching about the fact his mam made chicken nuggets and chips for dinner and ""how come she can't actually cook real food"". My boyfriend was obviously pissed off over this as her boyfriend said these things while he was calling him his best friend. Now my boyfriend wants to tell boyfriend  that he knows what he said and not to talk to him again. 

My problem is, if my boyfriend tells her boyfriend then her boyfriend will tell Jane that I told him these things and then I have to explain why I did which involves telling her I know what she said about me. I have decided I do not want to be friends with her anymore as I do not want a one sided friendship with someone I can no longer trust. I am looking for advice on how to end this friendship with minimal amount of drama as I am extremely anxious at the moment over how this is going to go as Jane and her boyfriend can be very immature and play the victim in situations and I don't want to have to deal with it. I feel like she is going to accuse me of believing my boyfriend over her but I know he is telling the truth because he could tell me exactly the messages I sent to her that night as she was reading them out to him as I was sending them. And mainly because I have every reason to trust him but don't feel like I have any reason to trust her anymore. 

I just want advice on how to end a toxic friendship without the drama. Blocking isn't an option fyi before someone suggests that as our families know each other so I do not want to look like the evil person here by blocking her.",27Oct2020,1
768," Me and my girlfriend both moved away together to university this past fall. Neither of us have any close friends within a 8 hour radius and we both dreamt of this as an amazing bonding experience for the two of us. Recently, she reconnected with an old friend of hers online. Their relationship is only online, playing video games and such. They were close before the two of us started dating and I am respectful of that; however, they haven't been close in the past 2 years since then and now it is like she values us both the same. She swears up and down that she loves me, and that nothing has changed. Though due to the time-zone difference between the two of them, she often stays up excessively late to spend time online with him. Though she still spends a couple of hours with me a day, she still spends sometimes 3+ online up until the late hours of the morning, then sleeps anywhere from 2pm-6pm. This has taken a toll on me, due to the differences of sleep schedules (I stay up sorta late, but I never sleep in late, if at all). Most days now, I cannot keep in contact with her throughout most of the day because she is sleeping, then when she does wake up she has school work to do. If I get to see her, it is only for a little while before the cycle repeats itself. I am lost in what I should do, or if I should try talking to her about it again.

773,"Hello, i'm hoping someone can help me.

I have no friends. I know a lot of people say this when they mean ""I have friends but no best friends"" or ""I have friends but they just don't get me"" but I have literally no friends. I moved to a new country a little over 2 years ago and I never even made what I would consider an acquaintance. 

At the start of this school year, I skipped past an optional gap year that's offered while the vast majority of my grade stayed behind. I was excited to maybe finally make a friend but nope. I feel like I just moved to this country again.

I really can't blame it on other kids though, I can't name one kid in my grade I'd like to be friends with. I've had an awkward obligatory ""she's new to the grade so talk to her!"" conversation with nearly everyone, and not one person made me think I'd like to be friends with them.

I don't know what to do but I can't take it anymore. I'm sick of awkwardly waiting while everyone else partners up in class. I'm sick of eating lunch alone scrolling through Instagram looking at my old friends hanging out. My parents say I'll do better in college and that's all i'm banking on to get me through the day. I have a countdown on my phone until I graduate and I look at it when I feel especially lonely, like my lifelong-awaited best friend will be waiting for me day 1 of college.

I said ""Where's the negative test?"" and she said ""Little girl, fuck you-"" I cut off the phone because I didn't want to hear anything else.

Then, later she called my little sister and told her I wasn't her mother and I was poisoning her mind and she would come here and shoot me and f*ck me up. I honestly believe she's psychotic.

776," So I've been in a casual relationship with a girl for 5 months I met off tinder. We literally messaged each other non stop everyday for these 5 months, frequently met during the week, and had long phone calls where we both opened up about our mental health issues together. However, in the last couple of weeks since starting my new job, she's been taking longer to reply to my messages, and bailing on plans to meet up.

It got to the point where I messaged her two days ago, asking how her day was and if she's free soon and she's not replied , despite being frequently online for the last few days.

I've accepted that she is no longer interested, but I want her to feel shit for ghosting me. Do you think I should message her a final message? and if yes how should I word it. Or should I just do nothing.",27Oct2020,1

basically if there is any console heads here can you guys help me, i’m not too sure what console to go for this year since i’m mainly a pc player and i always have a console for playing casual games like call of duty and cyberpunk (when that releases) 

i previously owned both the xbox one and ps4 but i much preferred the ps4 for its UI the xbox was just too microsofty and felt like it was trying to be a computer.

which one is getting better game releases and which one is more powerful?

781,"I'm currently in highschool so I'm still very far from moving out but I'm not sure whether to move out or stay in,

Moving out
-more expensive
-I can manage myself and only I will suffer the consequences of my lack of responsibility
-i won't have to deal with my parents and I can control my own time without being forced into anything

Staying in
-I get to be with parents which mean no cooking, lower rent so I can spend money on things I actually want
-instant advice

Downsides

Moving out
-less money
-potentially loud living area (not really a problem)
-area could be riskier

Staying with parents
-My time isn't mine for as long as I live there
-societal pressures to move out (really dumb downside)

This seems clearcut because I like money but I also like having to to so what I want after the 10+ hours for work and transportation, also transportation is at max 1 hour because I live near a go station (15 minute walk) I know this isn't internet parents please but advise me!",27Oct2020,1

Then he left to assist in a war overseas for 3-4 months. 
 I moved on and began dating.
I'm currently dating my best friends brother C, he's got a very complicated life so we might not be in a serious relationship for a while, but I love being around him and he makes me laugh, we've seen eachother every weekend for 3 months.
My best friend comes back from tour and tells me that he wants to date me now. We went out for drinks and I hoped it would spark something, because he'd be so good for me and he's such a great person, but I didn't even want him to touch me, it just felt so alien. All I could think about was C, even though C is so cold on the whole relationship front which can make me feel sad.
My best friend has said he doesn't want to pressure me, that he'd rather I was in his life as a friend than not at all.

She spent 6 years at college pursuing a fashion degree and still managed to drop out before ever finishing it. This is partly because of substance abuse and a bad crowd she used to run with. Our family was quite well off until a few years ago, so you could say she was enabled. This resulted in rehab and driving my poor mother insane. 

Her and I never had a warm relationship but we still had enough core things in common that we got along and could make each other laugh.

She's changed alot with time, but still has a long way to go. I lead a very stressful life with my work and study but in a way having her helps me by not being alone, but I really want her to find a job. Not least of all because her presence costs me double (food, electricity, etc) but moreso because in the absence of looking for work she just plays video games and gets stoned. Worse still, she's very good at turning nudges or questions about her career into full blown nuclear confrontations. There are moments when I genuinely hate her.

i mentioned the alcoholic part because when she drinks she starts talking in this weird ""baby voice"" way. but imagine someone who smokes and drinks on the regular speaking like this. like its just really bad and even my brother has said this so its not just me being mad for nothing. ive heard these voice my whole life so far and i feel guilty about it but whenever i try to change how i feel she starts singing or gets drunk again. i am just so sick of it. i use my earphones and turn the volume up all the way she can be pretty loud sometimes so i just have to deal with it and try to zone her out if that makes sense. i just dont know what to do. she about to be gone on friday i just dont know how to cope for now and the other times im with her.

And I’ve tried many things but I haven’t got very far.

I live in the UK and I’m looking to ask advice by paying (and not through any government services or social security healthcare service).

But I’m not looking to pay lots - my idea would be less than £100 for first diagnostic kind of session, if it’s worth it.

I’m not interested in ‘alternative therapies’ or things like that.

And I’d only be interested in new types of things or methods sort of things — if they have a strong set of lots of genuine reviews.

And I’m very much for science and evidence based things.


I’m basically looking for the real deal, whatever that is.


My issues that I’d like to get advice with are:
1. Very significant OCD
2. I have diagnosis of ‘mild tendencies of Aspergers’.
3. Dyspraxia
4. Moderate Depression

Also: I’ve been diagnosed by a health professional for all of those things in the above list except for Moderate depression, but I’m sure that I have at the very least mild depression

F2 an di are closer than the others in the group, so we talk a bit more often. I think of him as my brother, if anything. Last night we were playing a game, and he said something i didnt understand. I decided to ask him about it later that night what he said, and he said that he loves me. (quick note, i am in a relationship already that he knows of) This is the same person who ive been great friends with for a couple of years, and think of as a brother keep in mind. I couldnt sleep last night, just thinking of those words.

The next day, aka today, i was starting to feel guilty and un-loyal to my current boyfriend. I went against my better judgement, asking F1 for advice. He brought to light that this is pedophilic behavior, and i should stop talking to F2 and let F1 handle it. I don't think this is a good idea, though, because F2 is a quite unstable person, with his bad mental health. I'm afraid F1 might send F2 into a depressive spiral.

We have made multiple jokes on many occasions saying to like take off your shirt or show your thicc thighs, and shit like that, towards everyone in the group. 3 of 5 of the people in this friend group, are minors. I hate to think of F2 in the sense of him being a pedophile, but i dont know what else this could be.

I am afraid of what F2 might do in response to F1, because F1 tends to go overboard with things like this. He says no sympaty for the pedo, but i can't help but think of what F2 might do. I've put alot of pressure on F2 to tell F1 the truth and nothing but, because F2 knows how important this is to me right now.

Two of us are from the same country, while the 1 guy is not (we are all from North America if that helps). I like to think we all get along, but the 1 guy can be really annoying sometimes and lately it’s been worse than before. 

A couple nights ago, on Sunday, him and I got into an argument. The point of the argument isn’t really important, but it ranged from why I believe English is the most important course (whereas he believes math and science are more important) to why I think western philosophy is more important in a western nation than eastern (this is important because I want to teach after my undergrad and he thinks that I won’t be a good teacher because I don’t find other philosophy interesting, but I digress). 

It got to a point where he yelled at me as I was leaving to go back to my room as I had had enough of the conversation and it was getting late. He yelled and then slammed his door and in turn scared my cat downstairs. 

Every argument gets to this point. He always plays the victim and if I don’t find something interesting, to him I don’t find it important. I’m tired of trying to explain why I don’t find something interesting without him turning it on me. He makes fun of my hobbies (particularly beer and coffee) and treats me as if my opinion is always wrong. This is not the first time this has happened.

807,"Hello People
So I found the love of my life 3 weeks ago: why and how I know that?
My heart started beating after 1 week with her, I have never felt anything like that before. I was just overjoyed to meet this one person, online mind you. But every time I talked to her, I felt warm all over my body and I blushed in some things I even almost cried. And I haven't felt all these feelings for 8-9 years. I am 22 and I live alone and I have about 2 friends who are there when I ask them and they help me as much as they can when they are there. That to me. For now.
So the girl I met is 20 and she had a terrible past (which I won't talk about because first of all it's none of your business and secondly it's private). Like me, she has a personality disorder which she was afraid that if they said anything to me I would not love her anymore. But I promised her that I would never leave her because my heart only beats for her. And here I am, for 3 weeks I could feel my heart open, now everything is black and dark and I don't know what to do.
Last friday I was already feeling bad in the evening. At a certain point a personality came out that destroyed everything before and I hoped that it would never come out with her, because it rarely or never comes out. Now I am standing here sad, bad-tempered, stupid and feel like a monster. 
It hurt her completely. I know what it wrote, this me, she will have more than just cried, probably even hurt herself. I still could not get in touch with her yet. I'm just afraid of what will happen when the personality comes out again. And what happened to her. I have been writing an apology since Monday, but how am I supposed to apologize for that. You just can't apologize that what happened is such a deep injury that I can't make up for it no matter how.
Her best friend tried to write to me via Reddit but I wasn't back until Saturday noon. And unfortunately I hardly know what was in there. The whole weekend I tried to keep myself from doing anything wrong (I don't have suicidal thoughts, not anymore my will to live is too strong for that. Besides I will not go to therapy even if it would help with myself. But I have other problems where a therapy would be just in the way)
So now I am standing here and have no idea anymore 
Conclusion is I have lost the most important thing in my life and don't know what to do because I will never confront my parents with problems, not anymore, I just ask random people on the internet. What should I do?
Someone has a clue if I should tell her what happened. And hear all about her weekend. Or just do nothing and live with it for the rest of my life?
Or any ideas?
I hate to ask for help. So real reluctant, because I hate to ask people for help no matter what.
But this time I don't know what to do.

808,"I bought a truck last February which was (seemed to me) in good condition. There were a few things wrong with it but overall it wasn't a bad truck. A few months pass, I go out to the woods to use my 4 wheel drive and get done and my front differential starts to smoke so I park it and get it towed. Come to find out I didn't properly take it out of 4 wheel drive when driving on the highway and it just caused a little smoke but it didn't ruin anything. When the shop looked at my truck I was told I had a decent amount of rust and that it's not bad now but in a few years it will go out on me. I didn't want to put the money into fixing it and deal with vehicle problems and the headache so I decided I wanted to get rid of it.

This year I got a good job and I decided I'm going to finally get a brand new truck from a dealer. I didn't feel comfortable with selling my old one (the one this post is about) because of what I was told so I was going to trade it in. When one of my friends that I work with heard this he asked to buy it because he has been looking for a vehicle for a month because his other one got totaled and asked if I would sell my truck instead of trading it in. I told him I wanted to trade it in because I didn't want to sell it and there be problems and have to deal with getting intertangled with going back and fourth with who bought it. I told him about the rust and a few other problems that wad wrong with it and he said he didn't mind. He even said ""hey its an older truck, all trucks have rust"" it even passed an inspection a few months ago with no problems. I just told him what I was told (even had the paper from the shop of what they looked at and what was wrong when it got towed). He tests drives it looks at it and decided  he wants to buy it. I sold it to him for the trade in price of what I was going to get at the dealership and got a bill of sale and on the Bill of sale it specifically says ""buying AS IS and the buyer has been given the opportunity to inspect or has inspected the vehicle and agrees to buy said vehicle"". All is well and I sell him the truck and i use that money for a down payment on my new truck.

*Important I live in Massachusetts and he lives in Rhode Island so I don't k ow about inspection laws, all I know is I took it somewhere and it passed inspection, got the sticker and receipt*

Yesterday he calls me telling me that they won't pass his inspection because of the rust and that there are holes on the frame. Now I know I told him about the rust but I didn't know that there were holes in the frame of it and that it was in bad condition. He asked for money to help fix it but I don't have that money and I told him the reason why I didn't want to sell it in the first place was fear for something like this to happen. Legally I'm covered but I feel bad about the situation because he's a good dude but I don't have the money to give back to him for a truck that I was trying to get rid of in the first place.

813,"I am currently very anxious and stressed over my phobia, I am scared so much that I may be hacked. Above that, I’m scared it’ll get worse and worse.
The cause of all this was when my credit card got hacked and I lost a lot of money, even though I got the money back, I was curious as to why my credit card got hacked, this curiosity made me overthink everything. After that, I data reset my iphone meaning any malware would have been removed either way. I am now skeptic and scared that my computer is hacked. I am very much anxious and stressed about, it has affected my marks at school, it affected my activity, it affected my lifestyle, it affected my appetite, it even affected my sleep. I looked into it, no signs of any malware, I used 3 different scanners(sophos home, malwarebytes, and bitdefender) Nope, no virus or malware. I recently noticed that my fingers were sub-consciously moving in directions opposite to that which I was going at, for example, I would be heading over to the left, my finger would shake and it would act as if someone tried to move my mouse. This thing scared me a lot, I had a dream that my mouse went rogue and it was going against me, I decided to shape that dream into reality, I dreamt the same dream 5 times over in one sleep, it ruined me. I believe that my mouse will go rogue the moment I open my computer, it didn’t and probably never will. So, please, I am begging, I need help to overcome my stupid phobia.

814,"For the past 8 years or so, I've had panic attacks basically every single time ive left my house. I have a massive fear of walking where people can see me- sounds stupid I know, but I don't think its agoraphobia. it started when I had to walk 3 miles to school and back every day when I was 12, I would struggle to breathe and sweat immensely, I told my mum and she said it was just hormones. this continued until I was 16 it took me 4 years to even realise they were panic attacks, but then my friend started giving me a ride to school everyday so the panic attacks stopped. When I left school I noticed whenever I walked to the shop, or work, or walked anywhere where there were cars or people going past I would have a panic attack. I don't get them if im with someone else, or if its dark. recently its became real hindering as its been manageable thus far; if I needed to walk somewhere id simply manage the panic attack and try to reduce the amount I was sweating and do deep breaths; however its got to the point where im too scared to go outside in daylight hours at all; this means having to wake up super early to do my grocery shopping and to do some exercise, which means I go to bed really early so I can't hang out with my friends anymore as they hang out quite late and im scared they will stop speaking to me.

815,"Hi,

Three years back, I bought an iPhone for fifty bucks from a colleague. I’d always had Android, so had to personalise the thing. This also meant creating an AppStore account. 

Back then, my girlfriend and I had been travelling about and were in Australia. So, my AppStore account was installed with country ‘Australia’. 

For my birthday, as a present, I received a $30 AppStore voucher from friends. 

Fastforward a year: back in the Netherlands in 2018, I bought me an Android (el cheapo Motorola GS5 plus, sim only) and had that phone for about 2.5 years. 

Three weeks ago, my girlfriend gave me her old iPhone (6), which I am currently using. I wanted to download an app to track our utilities usage (don’t know if that’s the right word, but I mean: the m3 gas usage for our heating system, electricity usage etc.). Note: we have some solar panels and I was wondering what they generate. 

Anyhow: this app I wanted to download wasn’t available in my country. Like, say wut?! After some checkingz, I found out my AppStore account was still on Australia. With that $30 voucher I’d completely forgotten. And I must spend that voucher first, before I can change the country code. 

So I looked in the AppStore to quickly get rid of those $30. Nuance:

- I don’t like gaming. 
- I don’t have Netflix, nor a TV. 
- Apart from r/tiktokcringe, I don’t like those things either. 
- I am not looking into ‘how to become rich in two weeks’ kind of advice apps. 

Spending this $30 was going to be tougher than initially thought. And lots of apps are for free. How odd: I usually like things for free. You see my first world dillema here?

Reason for posting this rather boring story is following: I don’t want to ‘just’ spend that voucher on a game I will not play at all. I don’t want to know how to D-tour the ‘change your country withing spending’, but I would like to use this $30 wisely. As in: invest it in myself. Learn a language, grow as a person. 

What app has helped you become a better person?
What app allowed you to grow as a person? This could also be a starting point that lifted off a new hobby, friends, work or even... life!",27Oct2020,1
816," 

So... This semester in University has been the shittiest experience of my 25 years in existence.

I study at arguably the most competitive university in my country(Western Europe), just started my Masters degree, after doing a year of study-related travel after my Bachelors degree was done in 2019.

I have really struggled to get into the study process this semester, with everything locked down and lack of socialization due to the ongoing pandemic. As a student, my preferred method of learning is in group activities, on-campus learning, by sitting long-hours reading followed by several colloquium meetings weekly where we share knowledge tackle issues, questions etc. Sadly this went all astray for this semester.

I think all of this, combined with lacking social activities(usually go out once a week), staying way to much at home(in a new city) and the level difference from Bachelors to Masters really hit my psyche. At the moment, I feel depressed to be honest, I have my first exam a week from now, and I will probably fail it, or in the best case get a D(in which case I will have to retake the exam next year which fkin blows).

I have not seen a shrink, but I am considering it, and as the bar for declaring sickness during exams is now lowered, I might file a sicknote and post-pone the exam by two months.

Right now i am struggling with some form of imposter syndrome, my classmates seem to all do well. I usually end up as top 3-5 in my classes, during previous years at both uni and going back to ""highschool"", but now i feel like i am barely scraping by.

What should I do? I feel terribly guilty, as I feel I should have stopped complaining and feeling sorry for myself and start studying harder, but I just end up procrastinating and the depression and anxiety, seemingly just keeps growing cumulatively. I am very much afraid of where this spiral is leading me...

Do any of you have any advice? Should I accept that this semester is a ""write off"", how should I deal with all of this? 

Thank you.",27Oct2020,1

She asks to wear my clothes, use my pencils and pens at school, use my beauty and feminine products, my phone and computer chargers, and so on. And it just really gets on my nerves. Partly because I like being prepared and that she doesn't plan ahead. But I don't want to sound petty or selfish (because I worry that I am being selfish and petty by being bothered by it).

Which is something that hits me every so often, I am now trying to decide what I want to work towards with my life. I have many aspirations, a large span of imagination, and great rune of procrastination. I have tried to become more social, and outgoing, I have succeeded, partially. And if you are willing i'm going to spill...

Please keep in mind that not all the following could be true

I had anger issues as a child, which pushed people from me, I would almost always hit and hit back. Sorted, my anger issue has calmed, I cant hit a punch or even a good slap, I don't want violence.

Age 9. I remember thinking of an idea named suicide, what a strange thing I thought. I thought, what if I killed myself? How would I do? Don't you write notes? But alas I must stick around, why? I dunno you just do. Maybe I had more friends than memory, and a crush or two, both ways. I pushed myself from gatherings and I remember I pushed my views onto a friend, thinking from them, and I fought when someone did the same to him, I realized what I was doing. I released grip. There were some weird kids, but not bad weird. We even had a make believe war in our school. I was a liar, hiding on both sides. And thinking now I remember a time I had a friend, I guess one. Who left me. that was during my early school years. A teacher, awesome writer really stretched the year he taught out, he was fun, stern, a good teacher. Mid year six (the end of primary school), I got a big role in a play, stage freight might I was hyped! And...a new house, new school. I went from a place I considered smart and well educated, mixed with culture and some slang to a chavy place and school innit and dumb shit wich made me think of them morons and I still kinda do. I'll get through this I was top in my last school, doesn't matter I can change and fit in secondary school. School ends, I had a really short emo phase. Good grief. 

Secondary school 
Maybe 11. I do fine make a few friends, stay behind in the library, don't do homework, Lie. Change words. Something I started to tug on and express my ability to do so. Hello procrastination. It goes on for a while lowish grades maybe C-D and some Bs perhaps an A. 12. sleep deprivation. I stay up late. On my laptop and whatever going to bed midnight waking at six am 1am 6am, 2am 6:30am, 11pm 6am. You get it. My memory fades. I start to question things. My life felt on loop. Not deja vu but a loop, i remember remembering a corner i had seen, I forget things. Depression. Maybe. I have a group that I confessed to. A writing group. D&amp;D is around, i discovered it on YouTube sitting behind some boxes in the new unfurnished house. I don't know what happens. I make friends online, this year. Off school. Procrastination on work drives me deep into the dirt. Terrible grades, some work I didn't submit. O become more talkative, try and become who I would like to be. And here I am. Thinking about what i'm going to do properly. I went in before and thought about it.
Everything i've ever wanted to do:
-Make pokemon, merge animals, make Creatures
-Make games, code
-Write, draw
-Write a book, make a game, find a love (big fantasy romance nerd),
-Have a shop plants and pets, 

I have so much imagination i wish that I go to another world like anime, i would wish for powers, supernatural anything that isn't boring and that I wont become a rat in a rat race. There so much I want to do. But all I can do is wait. I'm too young. And D&amp;D will help with my imagination and wishes, which I still believe can happen after a ghost encounter.

822,"Hey Reddit, I thought I’d come here for advice since I need more opinions. I will put first that I don’t drive and have never owned a car so don’t know the whole process. 

My boyfriend sent his car to be MOT’d at a worldwide known car manufacturer giant’s official local garage at the start of September. They diagnosed that it has a broken exhaust and said they would need to replace the entire thing, so cool, they got to work. Due to covid they weren’t able to give him a temporary replacement car, and also weren’t able to give an estimated amount of time, but he let it slide because hey - covid. 

After a week he rang up asking for a date for when they’d have it back to him and they said by the end of the next week .... so we waited and .. nothing. He rang again and they told him the same - the end of the *next* week... but again heard nothing. So he rang again and said even though he calmly told them (and I know he was calm because he would never raise his voice at anyone - He’s very soft spoken and diplomatic) that he needs to know when he’ll get his car back and they hung up on him. Since then, he’s been given reasons such as ‘the part is coming from China so it’ll take a few weeks’ and ‘we haven’t got the staff due to covid’ as to why the date keeps getting pushed back. 

It was finally meant to be done at the end of this week and we’ve waited nearly 2 months. I asked him this morning if he’d rang to confirm this and he suddenly sighs and says he doesn’t want to talk about it. So I guess they’ve said the car exhaust is still not done. Surely this is an insane amount of time, right? They’ve offered him no replacement car and no refund or anything and it’s coming up to two months of still paying tax and insurance for a car he doesn’t even have right now!! 

My boyfriend being my lovely laid back boyfriend won’t confront them about it properly - I’m not sure of the real reason why - but he says to properly confront them would take up too much of his time (he’s not an overly busy person outside of his average full-time work week hours), and that he’d need to read up hours on end of law to tell them where they’re wrong. And that he can’t be bothered to go to the effort for a £few hundred. ... even though he made a big deal out of paying that price when it first went in for the work.

Can somebody please tell me if I’m overreacting about this or is my boyfriend being too laidback with them?!! He keeps avoiding talking about it with me because he’s much more a ‘let it slide’ person whereas I’m more ‘GET A REFUND!!’... this is a car manufacturing giant so it’s a bit bad in my opinion??",27Oct2020,1

825,"Hi, so its not rly about me rather about my girlfriend. 

So me (m18) and my girlfriend (19) have long distance relationship since 3 months.

We both live in Germany, but on the different sides of the country so we are about 5 hours apart. We met online in August and she said she would only live 1 hour away from me, when she starts studying economics. So we got together and it was actually great. Until now everything went fine. We visited each other on the weekends and spend time together.

A few days ago we met again and I sensed that she was different. She was more distant towards me. After some time she finally told me that she has trouble with her studies. She feels like she cant study and have a distant relationship without feeling like she would neglect either her studies or the relationship. So we agreed on keeping some distance between us for now and pause our relationship so she can focus on her studies for one month. We still write daily, but we dont talk or plan to visit each other. 

I thought about helping her with her studies, but I dont have any knowledge about economics.                 She also argues that if i am with her she cant focus on her studies, because she would want to do something with me instead. 

Important things for her to do are Homework (depends on the week but lets say 5x), reading like really big books for school and writing on her home assignment that has to be 8 pages long (She has 2) and has to be done until 23rd of November. 

So just to make things clear: Her Studies come first. I also agree on that, so if I have to wait and give her some time, I am willing to do so. 

But I think everyone understands that this is not our prefered situation. So I hope you guys have some good advice on how we can make it work without having to sacrifice our relationship.  Any idea is welcome.  Have you experienced somehing similar and what did you do?",27Oct2020,1

835," 

I have a friend who is making me lose my mind at the moment. Every few days for the past- well a lot of months, I can't even count them all, she's been making plans with me to hang out. I get ready and go meet her at the time and instead of her showing up, she lets me wait there for a good half an hour and then texts me that she ""couldn't make it"". Another quick thing to mention- the girl is literally my neighbor and I've been friends with her for about 3 years now, she calls herself my best friend, but I'm starting to get annoyed because she's been flaky with me ever since we started hanging out outside of school (corona break happened). She never shows up and sometimes it makes me feel as though she's just making plans with me so she can fill my slot and I can't make plans with my other friends. The point where it really got me annoyed was when she suggested we go running at 6:30 AM, so I got up, and low and behold, she didn't show. Not even a text that she wouldn't be able to make it so I could go back to bed or know to go out without her. Instead, I waited till 7:50 ish before I told myself she wasn't responding and that I should go back to bed. I'd like to be nice to her but I'm just really annoyed. That's not even the first time she did the running thing, she showed up the first time and the next 5 times was a no-show. So after I figured out she bailed, I had to change back into my PJ's and take my hair out and everything and then go back to bed. I'm just so done. When we normally hangout, we actually ""hang out"" and walk around, well that's what we did the two out of fifty times she showed up. Sorry if this is a lot to read but I figured more information would help. After she bails on me, she doesn't text me back or even respond to me for a while, sometimes she waits days, sometimes weeks, before she gets bored and texts me or I get worried about her. And I'm not done yet- sorry this is so long, but I need opinions on what to do because it's driving me crazy. Our text convos are usually just me texting her a bunch or paragraphs or lots of lines and her not responding for days or more, and then eventually responding back with a text that's composed of a few words. I've talked to her about her ""love for bailing on me"" before and all she responded with was ""Uhm no you never respond when I text you and it's annoying, maybe I should get you a collar""- and then she laughed it off a bit after I visibly got a bit annoyed. Whenever she does text me back, it's when she knows that I""m busy (I have extra classes every Tuesday from 4-6 after school) and that's when she always texts me. It dings over and over until I tell her quickly ""that I have class"" and then she tries to make it a conversation. It really annoys me. Not just that, but she's a difficult friend, she would talk to me about her other friends and how she has so many best friends, and then a friend of mine would come up to me to talk to me and she would start with how she automatically doesn't like them and how she's my best friend and all this bs. I've called her out on it and straight-up told her that I'm not her pooch and that I can have other friends because it doesn't matter who I hang out with, she always dismisses them and makes up some remark they said to her when she's never met them. I know that I""m her only friend because I'm the only one that can tolerate it and she doesn't hang out with anybody else. She used to have a good amount of friends and then they all left and started ignoring her. Not just that but whenever she makes excuses I always catch her in her lies, for example, she'll say ""my mom turned off my wifi so we can't go"" and then add ""wanna ft tho?"" after it. I know you need wifi to ft, or at least a phone, which she doesn't have. Apparently, she can use her computer or something? I'm not sure because it never works or goes through. I've made it clear to her that every time she bails on me it hurts but she continues to do it. Now I'm going to wrap it up because this is getting long, but I've tried ignoring her texts for a few days in the past, and all that did was make her ignore me for longer (it lasted 3-4 weeks once). Whenever we hang out it just feels like everything is a competition about who's better, but I just wanna giggle about silly stuff, not have her dismiss every okay thing in my life because apparently, she's some royal diva. Like for example, I could tell her my grandpa died and she would go, ""oh that's cool, well my dad is super emotional because like 17 years ago, his mom died- oh and like 5 years before that- so like 22 years in total- ago, his dog died""- and then she starts spiraling about it and going on and on about it (the worst part is this exact conversation actually happened), almost like it's a show and she's the talk host, and I'm the audience who has to clap and praise her every word. What I""m saying is, it doesn't feel like a real friendship. Most of these conversations happen over text because we don't actually hang out outside of that. Also a quick note, I know coronavirus is a thing, but her sister has friends over all the time, and she constantly goes on vacation to these different places, so that can't be a bother compared to my family who sits at home and thinks that social interaction with friends is great during this time. Sorry, this was so long, but she's ignoring me again after bailing on me yesterday AGAIN so I'm ranting about it because I've reached my endpoint on how much this can happen.

The response to Panera’s deadline is due today, and I would much rather be there than at my current restaurant. I’m afraid that if I turn them down but the other two places decide not to hire me, I’ll be stuck at a job that interferes with the amount of time I have for school and friends. Again, I am trying to get out of food because it’s not what’s best for me due to some other things. 
Any advice will be helpful.",27Oct2020,1

840,"I am very upset. After everything that I have gone through, with this damn virus, not being able to work for almost 7 months, and then being told that I actually still have a job that I had dreamed of getting for years, and pushing myself to return there for the past two weeks, I have now been told that I no longer have the position and cannot work there anymore. I literally held my fUcking breath while going to that job because it was a transport team position and I was dealing directly with positive patients. The requirements of the job were to work “rotating shifts” (which I was not told of this during the initial interview) and they required me to work nights. I don’t do well with working nights and despite knowing that, and still trying to work through the physical limitations I have, I did it. I worked the night shifts they required. I then go to the Director and explain to him that at this time due to my health issues from the virus, I can’t work nights “straight” and requested that I have a split schedule so that some weeks I work a night shift, and then the following shifts for that week I work day shifts. Just as an easier way for me to transition back to working nights as well as working in general. Then man asks me to get a doctor’s note stating that I am able to do this. I spend a lot of time tracking down my doctor and scheduling a telehealth appointment (that I had to pay for) just to get this note written. I submit the requested doctors note. My doctor writes that I am allowed to work a split schedule and to consider doing this for me. 

After all of this, the Director sends me an email today saying that based on the prescription sent from my doctor the transport department cannot accomodate this scheduling request! I write back to him asking him why I cannot remain on the team based on the fact that my doctor stated that I COULD work overnights and that I don’t understand what the requirements for the department are. When I spoke to him via email the other day when he requested the doctors note from me, he said that as long as my doctor approved the overnight, I could work the split schedule. After all, that is the ONLY reason I contacted my doctor to make the telehealth appointment. HE requested the note. And based off of that, I thought that if I submitted the note he requested, I would be good and keep the job. I am just livid and I am so confused. I don’t know what to think or do anymore. Someone please help me I am so upset. 

Not that anyone can change his decision, but I just feel like I got tricked and now I feel like a stupid idiot :(",27Oct2020,1

843,"Hello,

I bumped into somebody's car in August, they wanted to avoid going through insurance and asked for the car to be repaired in a garage and for me to pay the invoice. We agreed on this however, the owner of the bumped car took weeks to get back to me despite numerous efforts to arrange repair. The owner then asked for a cash settlement instead but then didn't respond when I agreed.

Fast forward 2 months and the owner has chased me again for repair of his car however, I don't own the car anymore and insurance has been cancelled.

How can I move this forward? Greatly appreciate any advice!

Thank you",27Oct2020,1
844,"Im mobile, sorry for mistakes. Also might be long! 

Background: 

I am 16F and my sister is 13F, we have many siblings. Our parents are divorced, but both are remarried. My family grew up thinking hitting your kids is okay. I do know this isn’t, our mom used to hit us (until we turned like 8) and now she just yells/lectures/grounds. My mom always supports us, with our dreams, school work. And she works her ass off at work (now with COVID things obvi changed). At our moms its me, my three sisters (13,10,9M). Our dad never hit us, he lets us get away with like anything. (Technically hes just really understanding, he just sits down to talk with us about it). He also works his butt off at work.  My sister 13F throws fits a lot, doesnt listen and is rude. Ill give examples for both houses. 

Moms: 
- when we wake her up for school, she stomps, says she hates me/ wishes i was never born, ignores everyone
- ignores people when she can clearly hear them
- when my mom is talking to her when shes in trouble/not listening she will ignore her/not answer her questions, won’t do what she said to do until my mom starts yelling. Like earlier she had an hour in between class, then it started she was in the meeting for like 10 minutes then runs to the bathroom for 20. My mom told her to come out bc she’s usually just sitting on her phone. She comes out, my mom tells her she meeds to go before class because shes falling behind. She ignores her, then my mom asked if she would do that at school, still ignores her. It takes my mom to yell at her for her to finally make a sound. Then she starts giving me and my mom ugly looks. 
- if i tell her to do something she throws fits sometimes/argues with me. I tell her why she needs to do it or offer to help and she will start mumbling about me as if i cant hear her. 

Dads:
- most of stuff she does at my moms but she ignores completely and keeps doing what she isnt suppose to 
- my step mom will tell her not to do something with the kids. And she will do it, then get mad when shes in trouble. 

I know shes young, but it hurts to be told in the morning that you sister wishes you werent alive. And i used to stop my mom from hitting her when we were younger, i ALWAYS protect her when shes in trouble. I’m always there for her, and now its hard to talk to her other than when shes in a good mood. Am i overreacting and this is nothing? Is it okay for her to be acting like this since shes 13? Should i wait it out longer because maybe shes acting out? (I was thinking of getting her a therapist but were dont have the money for that)",27Oct2020,1

846,"So my wife’s uncle committed suicide Saturday night.  Funeral is Friday.  I told the coworkers at work I’m going to be out.  We were already going to be short one person now one is talking about if I’m out Friday she’s quitting Thursday.  It’s like you already don’t wait on customers and just do mail all day i’m sorry for one day you’ll have to work.  But i need to be there for my family.  Not to mention at this point of work day we’d been open about 40 minutes.  we’d had six customers I’d waited on all six of them and answered all four phone calls.  while the other three workers in my office have done nothing but wandered around the building and complained i’m going to be out Friday.  I was already scheduled to be off most of the morning for a doctors appointment.  I pointed out to a coworker who was sitting by that the other two who have each had one customer all morning at lunch we're laughing and joking in back and that is why they both wanted me here Friday so i can work the front so they can keep that mess up.  and she was like well I almost didn't get to go on my trip Friday because you had a doctors appointment in Friday morning we have to have 3 people up front.  Like I planned for one of my wife’s relatives to die and have a funeral Friday.  And then she was like it’s just your wife’s uncle it’s not even like it’s a real family member.  Add to the fact wife now has zero family members living left outside her sister a niece and nephew.  I also have no living family outside of my son and elderly parents.

It’s almost like my coworkers want me to just slap my wife on the butt and tell her to drive five hours to a funeral for her last remaining relative outside her sister and wish her well all so my coworkers don’t have to do anything all day since they know if I’m here at work I’m going to sit up front and wait on customers as I don’t like to socialize and even take breaks throughout the day.

How do I stop letting coworkers take advantage of me when I’m at work since I’m the newest guy here by a year, and only male employee in the building.  Our supervisor is an elected official and never in the building so I can’t go to her either.

854,"Hey guys, I'm a guy from Norway who doesn't know what to do ATM. I'll just give context first I guess. 
Me and my best friend met a girl through another mutual friend a couple months ago. We started talking online a lot, and she seemed pretty cool. It didn't take long for me to realize that I might be kinda into her. We'd talk everyday for about to months, and a few weeks ago I confessed to her. She's told me multiple times that she's really honest and that she values honesty. I asked her how she felt about me, and she told me she was not sure (she mentioned how she went too quickly into a relationship earlier and ended up hurting him). About a week later my best friend (who talked to her a bit as well) told me that she was very sad. At first she said ""Don't worry about it, I'm just tired"" multiple times, but she later said that she didn't like me back. Ok so I'm sad, but I could manage. She was still cool, so we decided to keep on being friends. That is the context for the upcoming probmem.
So recently I noticed that she started talking less to me, and being more distant. I also noticed how she's spend time with my best friend and talk to him alot more. I asked him if they're becoming more than just friends, to which he said that he didn't know, but it might. It obviously hurt me that my best friend and my crush were becoming a thing (especially since she'd become redacted from me). I ask her why she's talking less to me, and she says that she thought I needed some space. My best friend however had plenty of talks with her, where she said that she felt I was too obsessed with her, and she felt tired. So I apologized to her, and said that it was never my intention to make her feel that way. I've been nothing but nice to her, and it hurt me that she didn't tell me what the problem was. I thought she talked less to me because she wanted me to have some 'space' after I got rejected. But multiple times after this, she's said that things are alright when they're not, and I keep hearing problems she has with me through my best friend. She mentioned to him how she was tempted to block me once, because I talked too much with her. I spoke to her and said that I would appreciate if she could tell me these problems, cause I am willing to try and fix them to my best extent. She said that she would mention if something was wrong. And again, she's said things are fine to me and said they aren't to my best friend. Now I feel like I can't trust her anymore, and I feel like she isn't willing to solve the problems. Today I noticed how defencive she's gotten, and I told her that I think we need a break from eachother for both our sakes. I told her everything, my problems with her, how I felt betrayed by her not saying anothing and how I was willing to fix the problems she had with me. All these chats we've had for over 2 months have felt fake now, and I've never been this hurt in a long time. 

I obviously didn't tell everything (as that would be too much), but these are the main points in my problem. Now I feel thorn and I don't know what to do anymore. I've told my best friend that I'm fine with them moving forward, as I feel my feelings for her disappeared after all these problems. So now I have no idea what to do anymore.",27Oct2020,1

I've just been informed that my landlord is selling the property I rent. I am currently month-to-month with them as my lease expired earlier in the year, and my rental period begins/ends on the 15th of each month. 

They intend to close as soon as possible; certainly before the end of the year.

I also hoped to move out (of my own accord) early in the year, to a cheaper home out of the area.

One time I were trying to relate my friends to characters in a show I liked and then when I came to me; ""and I am.."" - she answered before I could continue; ""you are *my name*"" with a big smile on her face.
It made me a bit lost when she said that it I didn't show her any reaction but it made me feel lost, like I didn't belong anywhere or that I am no one.. I am just.. Me. - but that doesn't mean anything to me though because I don't understand what she means when she only says my name.

She can agree with everyone who everyone are but when it comes to me I am just my name.
She have done this before but don't remember everything because it is not before now I have realized it and taken notice etc.

Today she did something similar and could say what everyone are but I was.. My name.. Just.. My name.
I feel like she doesn't know and I feel like I have no one nor nothing in general to relate to.. In her perspective I feel like I am nothing to her - I don't belong anywhere.. I am just dust.. No personality.. Just.. Me.. My name.
This time I reacted. I said ""okay then"" and left the room and she and everyone noticed I was upset and went into my room and made my own bed to sleep alone on.

She later came in and asked if I was upset and explained everything I have explained to you guys about. - how I feel like she doesn't see me as anything - like I am nothing and just my name to her.
She said that she thought I didn't like it when people told me who I were like and thought I could get upset if she did - which I thought was funny because of that time I myself were going to explain who I thought I was based on that series I liked which I described about earlier were she interrupted that I was just me.
She didn't have any answer to that when I told her that and that I wouldn't get upset or she did.
She said sorry etc and now understands she shouldn't do that etc.. We now thought are laying in out own bed as I'm writing this. Did I have a right to my reaction? Is this silly?

867,"My relationship keeps going in circles and I don’t know how to stop it

I (17M) and my girlfriend (17F) have had some difficulty in our relationship. For the past couple months there have been a continuous string of problems that I have been causing unintentionally. I have never wanted to hurt her intentionally. I just want to make her happy.
Such as: 
1.) My mind wanders a lot, like I will think about random things a lot and sometimes they will be bad like another person naked. It feels like I’ll think about something randomly that isn’t bad and then my brain will keep going trying to make connections and will eventually lead to something bad. However, I get rid of these thoughts extremely fast, I find them disgusting and I hate having them. I tell my girlfriend about them and she gets heartbroken sometimes because she feels like it’s unfair that she has no difficulty thinking about me, but I have trouble thinking about her. I don’t have a difficulty thinking of her, but I have a problem of my brain going somewhere else. (This has happened while we were having spicy time as well, and I hate it because telling her that someone else has popped in my mind randomly while we’re doing that is like a punch in the face.)
2.) I have been having dreams where I have almost (as in it didn’t happen but it was going to) or full sexual interactions with other people. Sometimes they’re people I know and sometimes they aren’t. I once again hate having these dreams. I tell her about them when she wakes up and usually I wake up before her so I have to wait there thinking about how I’m going to tell her that once again I had a bad dream. These have especially made her feel like shit and it honestly makes me wish I stopped having dreams. I don’t like having the risk that maybe I’ll have another bad dream.
3.) I’ve become extremely forgetful. Most of the time it’s smaller things like I’ll forget something someone has told me to do a couple seconds ago, or I’ll forget some homework that I have time to complete. However, once I forgot to visit my girlfriend after I told her I was going to. She felt heartbroken and I don’t know why I couldn’t  remember to see her. It’s not like she isn’t important to me and I’m not falling out of love with her. 
4.) I haven’t been able to think before I say things, and I say things I don’t mean or that I don’t know 100%. Then when I realize what I said was wrong, a lot of the time after she calls me out, I realize that I used wrong words or have said something that has a completely different meaning than what is true. I have tried to remember to think before saying but I keep forgetting, it sometimes pops up in my head throughout the day, but for some reason I can’t keep it on my mind like I want to. 

However, for some reason whenever I’m with her it’s like almost all of my problems melt away. I’m always happy and cheerful and we’re making memories. Sometimes my mind will wander when I should be focusing on having fun or something else, but overall it’s like I’m somehow more myself when I’m physically with her. I have a theory of why this is happening because this has only been happening recently, and I don’t think it ever happened before. (I can’t remember) Basically what I think is responsible for this is my concussion that I had back in around March.   A doctor told me that maybe there wouldn’t be any problems at the start, but with time they would start to show. I haven’t gone into the doctors to have a brain scan or a check up in it ever since the first visit  in March. Basically I was in a judo match and I got slammed on my head. I lost consciousness for a bit and didn’t know what was happening for a good while. I feel like all of these problems can be linked to just me having forgetfulness. For problem 1 I think that because I’m so forgetful that my mind will go on more tangents without focusing on the task at hand. For problem 2 I think this can be linked to my forgetfulness because since my mind wanders and goes on tangents, my subconscious just keeps thinking about random stuff. 
For problem 3 this is basically the problem. Finally for problem 4 I think because I forget how to think first that I’m just blurting out what come to my feelings, when I’m reality it’s stuff that isn’t correct.

I love her and I don’t want to lose her. I feel like she’s just going to up and leave and tell me she can’t take it anymore. I feel like we’re at an age to know what we want, and how we want it. I want to be with her forever. That’s something I know I want. Is there another place I can post this for more advice or help?",27Oct2020,1

873,"To be honest things are not going so good and I’m not sure if it’s just my overthinking and anxiety. Things between my roommate and I had been going good at first. We’ve been friends since the 4th grade and he helped me out by being my roommate after my breakup with my ex whom I was together with for almost 7 years. But tbh, I’m not feeling so sure about it now. At first it was fine, he was asking me to not do things that bothered him. Like talking too loudly while he’s trying to sleep for example which is fine. I don’t want to bother him while he’s trying to go to bed for work. I’ve also gotten better at cleaning up after myself more and have never asked or expected for him to clean up after me. But then after a while it just seemed like he was getting more and more upset with me. There was one time where my bf was coming to see me a lot and it was for 4 days in a row, we don’t do anything to really bother him. We really just hang out in my room and it was the only time that it’s happened, he got extremely upset and was like if he’s going to be staying 4 days in a row, he may as well start paying rent and I don’t want to clean up after your bf too. I’m just like damn okay, so now we only see each other 3 times a week. He also gets really upset whenever I use the air conditioning so he tells me I should pay more in electricity because he doesn’t use the ac, okay fine so I now pay more in electricity. Even so he is still really stingy in using the ac and still gets angry whenever I use it. There was this one time it was extremely hot (over 80 degrees) and my poor old girl (my 11 year old dog) who has pulmonary heart disease does not do well in heat, she started overheating and she threw up. So I told him that I need the air conditioning on at least at night, it’s impossible for me to sleep and it’s uncomfortable for my dog. So he complies in the summer and doesn’t say much. Recently I turned on the air conditioning at night because it was a hot evening and he turns it off while I’m asleep, I wake up and I can’t go back to sleep, this is a problem because it was my first day of my new job and I was expecting a 12 hour day so I text him asking him not to do that while I’m trying to sleep, as I’m trying to get enough rest for work. He opens my message, doesn’t reply and I’m just like okay, maybe he gets the message. Then as I’m sending him other messages to let him know of some other things, he doesn’t open the messages and I’m getting so seriously anxious about the whole thing so i confront him irl, he doesn’t say anything to me at all. And then I confront him about it the 2nd time and he says that nothing was wrong and that he was taking a break from social media. Even though he was updating his status on Snapchat that very same day. Yesterday he turned off the ac again, and I sent him a message asking him for the 2nd time not to turn it off when I’m asleep because it woke me up at like midnight and I was unable to fall back asleep ( I have a hard time staying asleep because of my insomnia), I had to work a 12 hour shift as well. He just replied back saying he was cold af even though he had no problem with it being 71 the whole time I had my air on when I needed it on and that he would just suffer for me then. When I messaged him back about a compromise, he again did not open my message, left it unread for over a day and never replied back. Which leads me to think that the whole thing with taking a break from social media was an outright lie to cover up his irritation with me.  Not to mention he even blamed me and my bf for locking his cat in his room the whole day while we  were all working even though I have no reason to go into his room. So I guess what I’m trying to say is that I feel uncomfortable and I want to leave. We did already agree previously to renew the lease but this recent issue is really giving me second thoughts. I don’t want to hurt any feelings but I am also feeling like living with him feels like I’m always tiptoeing around him because I don’t want to upset him. It just gives me so much anxiety. Am I overthinking things? Am I just letting my anxiety get the best of me? Should I renew the lease? Or should I just follow my gut feeling and just leave? If so, what would be the best way to go about it? He’s one of my closest friends and I don’t want to hurt any feelings but I feel like living together is kind of ruining our friendship and I feel uncomfortable in my own home. P",27Oct2020,1

Hello everyone. I usually solve personal matters on my on and probably know the answer already. But it wouldn’t hurt to ask people who have experienced way more than me, so here goes. Thank you to all who take the time to read this. 

I am a 19 yr old kid who currently lives in the U.S. and have been thinking about leaving the country recently. I’d like to separate myself from home due to multiple reasons. 

Maybe I am being selfish ? Maybe I’m delusional ? Maybe I am being naïve ? 

Any way here are the reasons :

1.) I am starting to despise the West

From our embarrassing politics, horrendous acts committed by people, social standings, the notion of patriotism, the media, etc. I dislike it all. It’s no question that it’s a mess here and things tend to get pretty wild. I’d really like to reside somewhere peaceful, quiet, a better social space, etc. I am growing tired some of the many divides we have here. It’s even scary walking out in public knowing the next mass shooter could pop out and let loose. All these ideas and notions people have, all this spewing. Its not the environment I imagine myself settling in. 

2.) I am eager to explore and engulf myself in foreign environments

I feel as if I can’t seem to find the right thing for myself here as of now. I joined the United States Marines a while back for the idea of soul searching and purpose. But unfortunately I was medically discharged from boot camp and couldn’t continue with a military career. I believed I finally had purpose in life and thought that I was a part of something. I believed I was destined to feel as if I was on the top of the world. I’ve been thinking about to what else to do for about a year now and nothing has really given me the interest like how the Marine Corps did. 

So I thought to myself. Why not leave home for a few years and go to some other countries for a while ? Maybe I’ll learn a thing or two about myself ? Why not engulf myself in the many beautiful things countries like Japan have to offer ? Have an adventure, but obviously 
I know there’s certain obstacles I have to hurdle of course and isn’t going to be sunshine and rainbows. In a sense, I have an intense feeling to explore the universe. I probably sound like the most naïve kid right now, but I can’t really help it haha. It’s how I feel. Obviously “ exploring the universe “ can’t exactly be so simple and it’s more of an overstatement. I guess you could also call it “ soul searching “ regarding to as what I’d like to do.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Japan 

Japan is of extreme interest of me right now. It always has been since I was a little boy. But as I grew older I certainly started to gain genuine interest, respect, and appreciation for Japan. It’s nature, food, cultural norms, amazing architectural designed cities and structures are things that I genuinely know I like and 
appreciate, I’m not giving myself a fairy tale and fetishizing it’s culture, I have genuine
admiration and deep respect for Japan, at the end of the day I am not Japanese and wouldn’t make an ass of myself trying to be a Japanese person. If I ever had to classify myself, I’d be happy to be “ just some dude “.  There are some dislikes to Japan I have, but the pros heavily weigh out the cons. 

South Korea

I’ve too been real eager of moving to Korea as although I don’t feel for it as strong as I do for Japan, it still really interests me. I’ve been close to saying screw it and moving over there for a while to experience it since it’s Working Holiday Visa is available to me as in where Japan’s is not. Obviously I won’t move over there abruptly without a basis of the language and very good amount of finances to support myself. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I don’t currently don’t have any qualities that make me just as hirable as the native of one country, but I do plan on continuing to learn Japanese and some Korean on the side.
I also have 2 years of experience in hospitality here at home, obviously I’m not expecting to land a  job anywhere and I’ve extensively researched visas of multiple different countries and know how things go. I know I’m the bottom of the barrel and I have ambition to change that.

Could I have someone’s 2 cents on what they think about my situation ? I am currently enrolled in college with no interest in any careers, things just seem real bland. I am planning to start working soon before I make any big moves despite of doing it here in the states or in a foreign country. I have about 3k saved and I know that’s not going to do me any good ha. 

I know these are pretty naïve ideas, I know life isn’t so simple as “ Oh you feel this way ? Okay you can pack up your things and leave “. I just seek guidance in where to direct myself with this current mindset, maybe have someone point me to a thing or two. I have ambitions to make things of my life and make certain things reality. Thank you.

I also plan to obviously not travel anywhere right now. Due to covid.",27Oct2020,1
875,"Hi all, 

So, I got a new job about 6 months ago. Did well, so I got promoted into a new position. As I was just starting to transition, my bosses told me they wanted me to do a completely different position in a different department because they found someone else for the position they originally promoted me into. 

I wasn’t interested in the second position, so I told them I would probably quit if that were the case because I have an old job I can go back to easily, that would pay more and be less stressful. Well, now they’re letting do the original position that I originally got promoted to and wanted BUT I feel so awkward. I feel like I was being entitled, and now I’m completely second guessing myself since I didn’t know they were doubting my capabilities at all. 

They hired someone else out from under me, and this person isn’t necessarily more qualified and is less educated than I am. I actually did their initial training, so I saw how they operated and talked to them about their skills. The whole thing has me feeling confused and put off. I felt so ready for the initial promotion and excited to do well for the company, and now I feel weird and like I’m not what they want and I won’t do well. Halp",27Oct2020,1

879,"I work in a factory and yesterday was next to this girl, who we will call W.  W and I worked on the same line, and we were playing around putting some adhesive papers on each other to goof off during the shift. During so she had flirted with me and another coworker. I did flirt back a little but was trying to get her to be flirting with the other guy. (I did not know at this time she had a BF) On our last break we went to one of the break rooms together and she sat down right next to me. Shortly after, I went to scratch and rub my leg and during so she moved her leg next to mine and my hand ended up on her thigh. It was there for a few seconds before I pulled my hand away. Shortly after, some other coworkers came by and sat down with us and she went to the bathroom.

The next day, these coworkers messaged my GF what they saw and rumors started to go around. Apparently, they think I was fingering this girl when I was not. After some back and forth and more messages, W is trying to accuse me of sexual assault and saying I came on to her. Her and her BF are trying to go to the police about it and he has been messaging me and my GF.  


I think it is worth noting that she is notoriously known for flirting with other men on other shifts, even before she switched to our current shift. Other men can vouch for that.

883,"Got a question I wanna hear someone’s opinion, I developed abandonment issues from my childhood, I was extremely and emotionally tied to my oldest sister she practically was my mom . She took care of me a lot . She treated me like I was her baby . Well she lifted when I was 7 or 8 maybe almost 9   , well it broke my heart so bad I was crying like a baby for her . Calling out her name wanting her to come back to me .  I never knew til recently because I’m sober and ect . Because I realize I had attachment issues as I look back . My parents also got divorced when I was 7 . So idk I’m guessing I just latched onto whoever . To the point where when they left I felt separation and abandonment. Because I knew they was leaving . 

Then when I was I’ll say between 8- 10 somewhere between those ages , my mother left me and my sister for 7 years for another guy . But the thing is I also see there was emotional neglect and ect 

This just some , how would that effect my relationship with women in general? Idk why but i tend to go more for females then men . Also what if the father never once ever tells the son he’s proud of him , but has only said it when the son brings it up that he wanted to make him proud of him .

I, (16M), am trying to start to figure what college I want to go to. The thing is I’m lucky enough to have a college fund set up for me with about $100,000 in it by the time I graduate high school. I have great grades/test scores and participate in lots of clubs/activities. I think that I might be able to get into an Ivy League school and my dad is putting pressure on me to try to go to one. The problem is I don’t want to have loads of debt from an expensive school my whole life, and I get probably get a scholarship and use my fund to go to a less prestigious school and graduate with little to no debt. On the other side, if I go to an Ivy League school I could get a great job and pay off whatever debt I have. I really don’t know which to choose and my dad seems to think that I’m wasting my time in high school  by doing extra classes and activities if I’m not going to go to an Ivy League school.

890,"I know, I know, I shouldn’t have bought 3 pairs at once without verifying if the headphones are legit first. 

Basically as the title says, I saw a guy selling AirPods Pro on Facebook marketplace for $140 per pair. They had all markings including serial number in the right places and seal. I asked if they are original and he confirmed that they are. Plus he accepted PayPal so I thought I’d be covered by PayPal in case they indeed are fake. 

I messaged him and we met up at some plaza where I asked him to drop the price to $120 per pair and sent him $360 in Facebook messenger (using PayPal).

Long story short, when I got home I compared them to actual AirPods from apple and they were different. Headphones I bought didn’t show serial number when connected, noise cancellation didn’t work, and battery didn’t show correctly. So I’m 100% sure they are fake. 

What I have tried:
I tried to contact the seller, to either replace them for genuine headphone or for a return-no luck as you can imagine.
Tried to contact Facebook-they won’t help me. 
Tried to contact PayPal, who won’t help either. 

My question is, what else can I do? Where can I report him for scamming ? Can I involve authorities?

Usually they have already reached the max amount of players, so there is no space for me. Then one might leave at that point I may join, as an replacement for the person who just left.

Is there anything i can do to keep having the same weight instead of going back to 95kg+?",27Oct2020,1
894,"Due to quarantine, my track workouts have been severely limited to trail runs, which I obviously do alone. However, about 3 weeks ago, a couple of my friends gathered some of us and began to work out at his house where he has equipment. A couple of days into the workouts, one of us (5 including me)  got a sore throat, and we shut everything down. They were all quick to blame me, as they had begun working out together several weeks before I joined (I had college apps) and subsequently banned me from the group. Basically, I was kicked out based on the fact that they trained for almost a month without me, and when I came, everything went to hell. They accused me of not taking the pandemic seriously and dismissing it as something that couldn't affect us. 

 However, there is in no way that I had the coronavirus because I self quarantined, followed all regular procedures (masks, distancing, sanitizing), and didn't hang out with anyone except them. Luckily, it most likely wasn't covid, because no one aside from that one kid got very slightly sick, including within our families. Flu season is beginning around this time of year where I live as well.  The 4 of them continue to work out without me, in full health.

Their camaraderie really helped me out for a while because I was constantly swept up in school and dying for social interaction. Since shutdowns began in March where I live, I have had almost 0 contacts with my friends in person. It has been 3 weeks since I was barred from joining them, and I do want to confront them about this because I feel that I was a little unfairly blamed. What should I do? Will I come off as being a dick about their decisions? Should I just ignore it and continue on with my life by myself? What if I'm in the wrong here?",27Oct2020,1
895,"I have an online friend who seems like they don't care about me already. We used to be really close and we would talk about everything. Now, it seems like she's taking everything I say for granted. I open up to her almost everything, even the things I don't want to acknowledge but the next day it's as if I never told her anything. I would check up on her but now, I don't even get the slightest hello from her. I know it's hard to expect too much from people but it'd be nice to atleast know that she still cares. I considered her my soulmate because we just clicked. Right now, she just doesn't give a fck anymore and I don't know what to do.

I miss our memories together and should I just end the friendship? It just hurts because for the first time, I considered someone my best friend. I talked to her about this and she really did not say anything about it and it also broke my heart.",27Oct2020,1
896,"I graduated from my previous college with an associate’s of arts degree for transfer (AA-T). They basically sell you this in college because they tell you you get priority enrollment in the colleges you’ll transfer to. It’s been over 4 months since I’ve graduated and they still haven’t updated my transcripts even though all of my final grades came 3.5 months ago.

I tried calling them. They’re closed. I found out that they do virtual meetings, and every person working is magically all offline. Even when you email them they don’t answer and they just give an automatic reply that says processing is delayed. I’m sure this was because many students were calling to complain.

I understand we’re in a pandemic. Maybe that absolves them of their duties for this, I’m not sure. But they’re at least working remotely, and I was guaranteed earlier enrollment. I didn’t get it my first semester at my new college, and I don’t currently have it for the next semester either. 

The enrollment period begins early next month. My enrollment date is a week away from open enrollment for all students. I’m pissed. I know I won’t get any classes I need to begin my major because they’ll all be full (I’m in an impacted major at my new college).

Should I be contacting anyone in particular? Is there anything I can do about this? Or did I just get basically cheated (maybe bc of the pandemic) and just have to deal with it? Am I being ignorant at all? Is there more that goes into it than this? At this point I’m not sure. I just feel very annoyed and also cheated.

898,"Hey everyone. I need some help and some kind of advice on how to go about this problem. Right now I'm finishing up my senior year of high school and looking to go to college. I'm not sure if I want to go as soon as I get out of high school or if I would want to wait a year or two. My parents, who I'm living with right now, want me to go right out of high school and stay with them until I get out of college. But sometimes it's really hard to live with them. They don't always help with my mental health issues. I know everyone has problems living with their parents, but I've heard people say when they move out their mental health increases a lot.

899,"
I’ve always been a quiet guy who lacks confidence and anxious around others, I’ve also had many moments where I have felt very bad about things and find myself apologising for stupid things, which made me feel shit, people at six form then just viewed me as a nice guy because I was shy and then walked all over me I go on a few dates with girls and none of them work because I’d overanalyse things too much, then about a year ago i took a gap year and one night I go out clubbing with my mate after leaving he finds his own way home but I ,completely paralytic,was dumb enough to get in a fake taxi and to make it short and sweet, I get robbed and ditched in the middle of the city somewhere and just had my bus pass on me which luckily was not taken. I got home mid afternoon the next day.
So since then I find myself in state going out binging and coming home and continuing to drink in my room and not caring. Overdosed twice once before lockdown which I attempted to drink myself into oblivion and again last Friday where I get smashed then try to mix it with prescription drugs. The gap year was wasted, mostly crying thinking that I deserved to die for about 4 months and not finding a job at all because I simply couldn’t be arsed, I did do a couple some volunteer work but that didn’t work out because of lockdown and I did do an online course at home during my time. This brings me to now where I’m back at uni and worried about how far behind I may be. I honestly don’t know what I’m feeling to be honest but just need some advice really.",27Oct2020,1

901,"Hey there, I'm a 23 year old male living in washington state.
Due to my mental health issues throughout my life, I've mad bad decisions and feel completely emotionally broken and exhausted, and totally without purpose, and every dream crushed. It's always been apparent something has been wrong with me my whole life. From teachers during my childhood saying I seem autistic, to therapist saying I have ADHD, or my mother saying all sorts of observant things as I grew up.

It's never been really known what's wrong with me. From age 7 to 17 I was on medications adderall, and intuiniv. Yet coming into my teens I felt completely devoid of emotion, but at the same time obsessed over various subjects and doing academically fairly well, and learning a lot. Though after a few times, where I decided to not take the medications/forgot, I was feeling emotions. I was feeling emotions I hadn't noticed about things that happened in the past, and also actually feeling in the present. 

From this point I decided to cease taking these medications, because I would rather actually feel alive, I'd rather feel emotions. And Shortly after I had my first relationship, first breakup. And after that, everything from the past started coming to the surface. I felt myself flooded by every emotion seemingly not experienced in the past. Such as how it was growing up with my single mother who has bipolar disorder, as well as the way my father abandoned me in a certain way that really affected me. 

I spiraled. I was self medicating with alcohol and was extremely emotionally destroyed, and was telling my parents I wanted to quit school, as I was suddenly failing every class, hurting myself and drugging myself at school, and scaring them by having an alcohol poisoning of .39.

Anyway, my parents kicked me out on my 18th birthday, because they could not deal with me and my emotions. For their own sanity.

Since then I've been through cycles of homelessness, quitting jobs, moving to try to run away from my problems, drug abuse, suicide attempts, psych wards, extreme depression or seemingly mania.

After very much suffering, and experience, I've come to believe I have bipolar disorder in combination. After much research and failed friendships and relationships and self reflection. I'd love to be able to talk to someone official to see what is the truth about my mental health, and what I can do.

Right now I'm in this situation; I've quit my job due to emotional reasons. I live in an apartment that's in my name, yet I have a roommate. I had told my roommate that even though it's in my name I would be moving out on the 1st of November as I could not possibly pay rent. However I'm confused because he had mentioned something about moving out possibly into a house of his own. And it seems that they started packing a few things away into totes, but have since ceased. I'm really confused wether they're moving or not. But I hope they are because if they do, I could at least stay until I'm evicted, and sort some things out. However, my roommate was my ride to a job where I was getting paid 23/hr. And now if I were to start working once again, but in this town, because I don't have a car and can't legally drive, the most any job pays around here is only 15 $ an hour, which would never even come anywhere close to paying my rent. So I'm definitely facing eventual yet unknown start date of homelessness. And in the meantime wether homeless or not, I plan on obtaining books on DBT so I can maybe learn some things to help me deal with my mental illness, which could help with stability in my life down the road.

Now, my real question is what can I do? I'd be afraid to join the army only for the fact I obviously have lifelong mental illness, and wont lie to enter. I'm afraid to go to a psych ward where they try to just throw a blanket of drugs at me, that I've tried a huge number of from psychiatrists while growing up, and had terrible reactions every time. I wont live in a homeless shelter, I've done it before, and being mentally ill myself I want to stray away from other mentally ill people or people who abuse drugs. I don't do any drugs or alcohol anymore because I've realized they're very problematic for me, and affect my decision making, no weed or anything, except for nicotine and caffeine, and even then I intend to quit those as well because I've noticed they cause me issues as well. I have trouble with eating, i'm either binging food that could feed 10 people or starving myself for days.
I can't drive because I got into an accident while driving under the influence of alcohol and from having a suspended license. However I'm not being charged with anything and it's being turned into a diversion case due to complete cooperation and how I acted on the scene of the accident they decided to not charge me. 

So I'm emotionally fucked, ruined my own life. What can I even do? I have a bank account of -60 dollars, no job, no car, no friends, no family. I have nothing except for a neatly packed back for when I'm inevitably homeless soon. I need to do something but I am so lost. Please I need any advice or I'm going to be dead at a very young age, I'm completely serious.",27Oct2020,1

904,"Hello all! I am in serious need of advice! I will try to keep this short but basically I’ve (25f) had a very difficult past few years. In the past 3 years both my parents have died, I’ve lost contact with my brother and being in my home town is not the same anymore. There is not a lot of job opportunities and I’m also not happy with the political climate in the US anymore. I want to move to Canada, I’m already in the process of applying for immigration. All the paper work I can handle. The real question is, how does one move?? The furthest I’ve ever moved on my own was 2 miles and I accomplished that one car load at a time. I’ve never had to use a moving service before and I’m not quite sure how it works when you go somewhere but don’t have a place to stay right away. I want to buy a small house or condo when I get to Canada, but obviously that has to wait until I get there. What do I do with my stuff in the mean time? Where do I tell the company to ship everything if I don’t have an established address yet?? This might sound really dumb but I have zero experience moving a long distance let alone across borders and I want to make this as easy as I can for myself. And to be clear I am fully aware that there is a travel ban at the moment but I’m trying to get all my ducks in a row so as soon as it’s safe to travel again I can get moving. I plan on going to Canada as an investor so I won’t need a job offer if my application is approved, and I plan on visiting before I set this all in motion to decide where I actually want to live.

909,"I am a 46 yr old F with a 56 yr old M “husband” together 24 yrs. He’s always expressed a desire for me to be more sexually adventurous which is not something I’ve ever been comfortable with. I’m not an overtly sexual person and could probably go a VERY long time without it but I recognize that it’s an important part of a relationship, so I make a point to initiate intimacy on a semi-regular basis. So I was feeling guilty for not putting in a ton of effort lately so I decided I would surprise him and make the night a little more fun. While he was at work I plugged in the “massager” and set about watching an X movie and stimulating myself in order to get warmed up to the idea of “performing” later. Fast forward and he comes home and finds the “massager” still plugged in and confronts me about my daytime activities. I explained my plan but omitted how I was personally preparing. He didn’t believe me and insisted I was lying about being intimate with myself. We exchanged harsh words and he retired to a different room. An hour later he came back and said he could prove I was lying. He told me he had me on tape, so I asked to see it. It was not a video recording (thank God) but it was audio of me in our bedroom talking to myself “I’m going to put on some porn and diddle myself a little in the shower”. Confronted with these “facts” I explained the entire scenario. I questioned why he was tapping me in the first place. He said that it was in the hopes of catching me being intimate with myself because that’s a turn on to him–apparently, he did this before and on one occasion he did hear a private moment between me, myself and I. I told him how violated I felt that I didn’t have any privacy and what he did made him no better than a peeping Tom and that he took what should have been a private moment and exploited it for his own personal use was disturbing and it made me feel like I’m under a microscope and I’m not able to be free from inhibitions in my own home. But in his mind, I was supposed to be flattered by the idea that I turn him on and that he was honest about the tape(s) but because I lied, I’m untrustworthy to him.

So,

Am I A**Hole for not telling the entire truth when first confronted about the “massager” and subsequently getting upset about when it came to taping me?

Is he the A**Hole for violating my privacy and only confessing about the tapes because he caught me in a lie?

Are we both A**Holes for not having a trusting and honest relationship?

Is nobody the A**Hole because neither of us did anything wrong?

It should be noted that at the end of the night we went to bed upset and feeling like without trust in each other there’s no relationship and that we should consider going our separate ways. I can honestly say I’m not sure how I feel about that but I’m also not sure how I feel about living my life wondering if I am being monitored.",27Oct2020,1

So I just moved to a new city and and currently doing online school so theres not many opportunities to make friends. I do however have this one friend who moved to this city at the same time I did. The thing about her is she doesnt understands the struggles of money. I grew up in a trailer most my life have never gotten an allowance or anything like that. She however grew up very rich. So when we hang out she likes to go to the mall. Since I never had money I learned to save and have a decent bank account for some my age and no job. 

When we go to the mall she goes crazy and always gets a couple bags of close while try to never get anything. But when I do this she guilt trips me to spend money. If she goes over her limit she begs me to buy it for her saying she will pay me back(if she does it never the proper amount) but other then the money thing shes a great person.

913,"So about 6 weeks ago I moved into my bf's house with his family. For a few weeks before I moved in, their dog had always been scratching like crazy. They checked for fleas and couldn't see any, so they presumed he had an allergic reaction to his dog shampoo. 

6 weeks ago he got professionally groomed and the groomer found he was infested in fleas. The vet gave us monthly treatments to give him. The whole house was vacuumed, soft furnishings, clothes and bed lines were washed, and everywhere was sprayed with flea killer. For 3 weeks after that the fleas slowly disappeared, however i was severely bitten in those 3 weeks compared to the rest of the family. 

Sad news is the dog passed away 1 week ago (just saying this for accurate advice). However, I kept getting hives or bites ever since I moved in even when the fleas were apparently gone. In the last three days I have seen atleast 1 flea each day. I'm guessing these could be the eggs that have now hatched. 

My mental health is on the brink. For the last 6 weeks I have not had 1 full night's sleep because I keep waking up itchy and can feel the fleas on me (a mix between paranoia &amp; reality). 

I need this problem resolved because we are moving into our own home in the neighbourhood and I know his family will visit a lot. I dont want them to bring fleas from their home to our own. I will have a nervous breakdown if I see 1 more flea, I am desperate for advice. Please someone help, or anyone who has been in a similar situation that could offer reassurance.

916,"This general contractor who I've met probably about 3 months ago has gone from perfect role model to a straight crack head. 

We met after my father's death, and he offered me some work in exchange for ""my own"" place. He said as long as I would help him remodel the entire house, I could stay for $300/month utilities included.

So, the remodel began in early August with just tearing everything down to the studs out. We are here today with half of a bathroom complete, a new kitchen subfloor and only new sheetrock in the kitchen.

The past month has been full of empty promises. He would constantly say he'd be there  on Sunday, but never showed up besides during the week. I work, and go to school at night  so I'm almost just at the house to shower, shit, and sleep.

Now the first time I saw him blacked out on whatever was about 2 weeks ago. I just waited it out and told him the next day this was unacceptable especially considering his 11 y/o daughter saw him. He told me it was a complete accident, and it wouldn't happen again

Yesterday, I took a video of him when he was blacked out just screaming, and banging on a mirror. I sent that to the homeowner because I've known him since we were little, and he has a right to know what's going on.

Hoping today would be better, nope. I could tell he was blacked out AGAIN before I even got to the door.

I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I want to call the cops because I'm sure the neighbors don't appreciate all of this, but he's on parole because of previous crimes. I have other beds to sleep in, and am planning on taking one tonight.

918,"I(22F) live with my mom, step dad, and half sister and had 2 step brothers. My mom has constantly been angry with my step brothers for years over their attitude, disrespect, lack of manners, etc. She’s kicked them out of their room and moved them to the living room where they sleep on the floor. They were also the root of my parents’ marriage issues. Occassionally they would get hit badly by my step dad when he’s had it. 

I’ve always stayed out of it because I never really spoke to them despite living with them for years because I didnt like them when we were little. However, last year my step brother who is now 20 (ben), just left without any warning to go live with his uncle. My parents didn’t care at all but they did take an issue with him moving in with his uncle because they didn’t like him for instigating in the past regarding their treatment of my step brothers. After he left, I did feel for my younger step brother who is now 18 (jerry). Jerry wasn’t allowed to speak to Ben at all. He was more lonely than ever, constantly yelled at by my mom and worked six days a week while going to high school (he wanted to save up to move out). 

Last month, things got really bad where he disrespected my uncle. My mom waited for my step dad to get home and he just hit him bad. I heard the screams from my room. I was so angry with my mom. After that, I yelled at her and told her it wasnt right. He was clearly miserable in this house and filled with anger because of all the mistreatment he’s been recieving. I even yelled that there was no love in this house. She yelled at me saying that she couldn’t just let his atittude get worse and that me standing up for him allows him to justify his self pity. I stopped talking to her for about month after. I began to support Jerry whenever I could and spoke to him more. Jerry had also stopped eating at home so I tried to give him food I cooked when I could. 

A few days ago, Jerry told me that Ben had been texting him. He finally gave in and told him how he was doing (including the beating). Which resulted in Ben telling their uncle and their uncle filing a police report. Jerry panicked and I had to tell my mom because their uncle was on the way. At first the uncle tried persuading Jerry to stay with him but he refused. He felt guilty? But I told him this was his chance to get out of here. After awhile of encouraging him he decided to go. When his uncle arrived he had threatened to call the police and did yell at my mom for her verbal abuse. 

Now, my parents are only thinking of what my uncle did was wrong. For calling the police and threatening his own brother and you shouldn’t treat family like that. They told me and my sister not to speak to them and even tried to get us to hate them. Am I wrong for not siding with my mother against my step brothers?

I laughed with friends at school, I was faking everything... I just don't know how they can have so much energy and care about so much bullshit which really doesnt matter at all.

Before at least there were things that would make me anxious, so I used to like them, these things made me feel something. Now.. I have long since overcame those things, they no longer even bother me.

Couple weeks ago, a train almost ran me over, the people around me were freaked out, I couldn't even begin to care. I tried to feel bad for not caring, that I almost died, but to no avail.

I simply lack the ability to feel anything, I used to like to just sit down watch youtube snd eat. I even dislike eating now..

You have no idea how shity it is to live lile this. To feel nothing at all, nothing brings you joy nor anything hurts you. You are just, just there, a neutral point.

921,"So I’ve been pretty sad lately about my family situation my grandpa got into a car accident and it’s hard without him here (he’s in the hospital not dead) and my mom has been kind of an ass to me and my siblings I’m 17 with my brother and older sister 18 and younger siblings 8 and 11 my mom has been increasingly getting more and more mad at us as the days go by slowly I can’t even escape by going to school since it’s at home and I just wanna move out when I’m 18 the only problem with that is it’s a long time from now since the days get longer and longer and I’m not sure what to do financially, I don’t have freedom when it comes to going out with my girlfriend or friends and she just makes it worse by yelling at me for small things like 2 days ago she blew up at me for not taking my dogs out, and when I went to take them out she says “why don’t you ever listen to me” and “why do I roll my eyes at her” and I got mad so I called her out on the eye rolls because I knew she was lying and she thought I was giving her attitude which in my defense I was but so was she so I just gave the same energy back and it’s been hell whenever she’s around getting mad for every single thing. I’m not sure what to do now and I can’t sleep or celebrate the good things that’s happened like me getting a scholarship or applying for colleges.

927," Im a female in my late teens and i dont have friends. I have aniexty but ive goin pretty good a faking it ig. For some context, in middle school i moved around a lot so i didnt keep through friendships, this is also around the tine i was slowly unfriended by  life long friends whoi just recently became neighbors with (we grew up together because our parents were also best friends), they never asked to hang out but i felt close enough to insist, after a while i reliazed i wasnt wanted because i wasnt invited to events and i was gerenally treated like i wasnt there. Eventually i let them go, stopped forcing  our  friendship. After that i was devastated and started to relize how alone i was. I forcedvmy time to develloping my art skills and schhol work. In highschool, because i gained a very low self esteem i  went in with the intentions of doing well in school and being well liked, i accomplished both but left with no friends.,i had people during my time in highshool i consisted friends but they ended ( i was friends with someone who had feelings for me but after i had tonmake it consitently known i didnt have the same feeling, we both quickly grew cold and tired of the discorse and every conservation turned into into an agruement.) At 15 i got a job to keep myself busy because i dint have anyone to spend that time with. Im very shy so i didnt join wnd extra currical activities. The people i was well like by in highschool and i relationships mostly consisted of help them through theyre problems, and school work because i was an honors student and mature for my age. I tried to work at these relationships but  betwwen work and school it was much easier leaving the relationships at school. 

At work i did the same, i focused on being the best i could be at work and school because it what i was good at. After a while i tried to make friendships with the people i worked with and grew to love but found myself being excluded from the group so i didnt push it and returned to my solidue. I tried over and over again trought highschool and unless i actively helped in there lives i wasnt seemed to be wanted.  After a while i would grow tired of not feel heard and oppted to notblisten as a response ending friend there once i stopped offering to help so much. In 101th grade i stated wbl were i i was allowed to leave school to go work  in the afternoons. By the time i got to 12 grade i had to attend one class if any. This distroyed the few fleeting relationships i  with my classmates because i never perpared myself to speak with them outside of school. I gratuated with no one to sign my yearbook.
 After another move directly after highschool i quit my first job uruptly also ending those fleeting relationships. I was at my lowest with no job and no one around to really talk to even in passing. I found a job but still without friends, i moved from one parents house to the other which are about an hr away from each other. (Family drama) i kept that job and made some friends. Not having knowledge of keeping friends i lost them after a couple of month because i was so anious i would flake on them, would begg for forgivness and try to manatain the relationships but i son wasnt invited to things and the group of friends i brought together stop inviting me to hangouts (understandably). After corna i left that job because they were going to take the proper steps to insire my safety, even after then i  tried to mantain these friendships and ignore the fact i was being pushed out. Eventuallly i reliazed and i let  it go. They were the last people i consisted friends. 

(Tigger Warning) Ive tried to make friends with people online but theyve largerly ended in grooming. (TW) From 14-17 the only way ive felt confortable talking about meself was with stanger online. I have an old soul, meaning many of the things i like are based around 70's, 80's,and 90's pop culture, im also very mature for my age and ive consired myself with self with topics that were seen as more adult for my age ( no sexual, things like politics, a broader understand of history, social justice, studying art and art history and futhering my learning in different ways rather that be :practical, emotional or intentectual.) Because of my maturaty and despiration i made ""friends"" with many grown men, this lead to myself being groomed. I soon grew untrustworthy of people online and stopped talking to everyone online because of this fear i still have. More recently ive tried again, explictly seeking friendships from woman looking for friendship, this lead with the same result from people preping my for sexual experiences i was not seeking. 

Ive had many more failed friendships i dont feel like bring up for my own nental heath. Im quite simply asking for advice. I try to make make friends now but i start be used or i becone so anious and untrusting i cut it off myself. Since age 13 ive exsperience intense loneliness and idkwhat to do. The people i connect with most are usually much older and see me as a child or object. Ive tried apps, trying to approach people, trying to show im approachable, being super upfront and honest about who i am, hiding myself away and alowwing others to be focus of the realtionship, ect. I cant even explain everything i want to say because it would be so much longer than this. So please please tell me how i can make authentic, meaningfulll relationships with well intentioned people. Anything help

933,"This is my first time on this subreddit, and I'm not even sure if this is the right place to be asking this. I found another subreddit specifically meant for college advice but it seems pretty dead and for some reason I need to be approved to post on there...so I came to a more active one..  


Anyways back to the topic, I'm currently a first semester sophomore in university struggling through Zoom University like every other university student is during this pandemic. Ever since high school, I never really had a good idea of what I wanted to be in life or what I wanted to study in college. And here I am as a 2nd year in uni still not entirely sure of what to do.   
Growing up, I wasn't ever really talented in anything or exceptionally good at one thing. A lot of kids around me were good at let's say piano, or singing, or they were just super smart. I wouldn't say I'm dumb, but I wouldn't say I'm an exceptional student either. Nothing really interested me in school, and the only things I really had a huge interest in was video games (lol ik..). I applied to universities during my last year in high school as an undeclared major because I still then had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do or what I was really interested in.   
The mindset I had during my first year of university was ""okay, it's my first year. I still have no idea what the hell I want to do, so let's just take it a bit easy and just try and get used to the college environment and setting while I think about what I want to do"". Freshmen always get the lowest priority in terms of schedule making, so I ended up having to take random, boring, and meaningless classes just to try and fulfill my general education requirement. None of the classes I took I thought had any value to me whatsoever, and I felt pretty unmotivated because of that. I wasn't taking anything I wasn't interested in or cared for, but the annoying part was I didn't even know what I was interested in, I only knew what I didn't like.   
Fast forward to second year, I've been thinking for the past month that a more creative career is a fit for me, rather than something I'm going to have to study the next 6 years or so for. I, with difficulty, narrowed it down to Graphic Designing. And to think deciding a major would solve my problems, I get hit with another problem.   
My school is not known for art, it's actually pretty weak I would say in terms of it. My school is very STEM focused: it's mostly known for pre-med/med, science, and all the others alike. I used to draw and be in an excelled art class at high school, but I stopped doing it and never really explored into art after that. So I was thinking, maybe I should just try the major here for one semester and work hard and try and transfer to a different school that is good with stuff like graphic designing. But, I was also thinking about how difficult it would be to make a money doing graphic designing, or anything art related in general. I always heard that from my friends and family, which is why I think I just completely neglected art as an option for me for the past year.   
Because of how supposedly difficult it is to make a living doing art, I was wondering if I should just stick it up and study something that would actually make me money like dentistry, or nursing, or something of the sort since my school is really good in it. But, since I'm a sophomore now, I'm going to have to study my ass off cramming four years into two years, and most likely go to grad school (which I originally did not want to at all).  
What is the better option for me? I know it's pretty 50:50, a lot of people end up doing something they absolutely love and have a passion for, or they do something that they're not really interested in but makes money. My girlfriend is someone in this situation, she's not super passionate about what she's studying right now but she seems very motivated about the security it will bring her later on.  
I honestly don't know if I'll be motivated at all studying in any of the medical fields. Maybe the money could motivate me but I'm not confident that will motivate me very far.  
I honestly feel like I'll be more willing to hone my art skills and practice, instead of staring at textbooks and studying for exams like a slave, but the money part is also stinging me here.   
Any sort of guidance would be appreciated, thank you so much.",27Oct2020,1
934,"Im 24(M) and my wife and I are expecting a baby in February. I have worked for a state agency that is revenue generating for 2 years now but like many states, budgets are being cut and lay offs are becoming more of a reality. I recently interviewed for a job that i felt would be a good fit for me. Didnt hear fron them for nearly 2 weeks and they offered me a job today at $5,000/yr less than I make now. The salary range advertised ranged from 10000 less than i make now to over 12000/yr than i make now. I outlined my salary expectations in the interview at what i make currently if not more. Pretty big pay hit for me and my family as young as we are. Im not sure if id be cut from my current job but they are expected to cut more people from my agency than previously anticipated which, if going by seniority and overall performance puts me pretty close to being cut.

This whole situation has given me lots to think about and lots of anxiety. On one hand i can see this employment uncertainty through and hope i dont get cut. On the other i can take a position where i have better job security but stretch our current budget thin. I guess the advice im asking for is:

1. How should i go about negotiating salary should i take this position?

2. What factors should i consider when leaving my current position even though im not sure i would be let go?

3. If anyone else has experienced something similar, how have you dealt with the stress of uncertainty?

Hey all,

So I'm just so confused on whats happening and I need advice. I'm 17 years old female. Basically, I started working at this really big store. This was my very first job ever and my position was a sales associate, I was 16 at the time I started and I turned 17 last month. When I started my first day at work  everything was going really well. I was the youngest worker and everyone was around their 30's, 40's, and late 20's.  Other workers were surprised to see such a young worker. The older people were nice and friendly. Some of the ppl who were in their late 20's were more friendly and talkative with me. At the end of my very first shift, the manager took me upstairs to sign some papers and so I could grab my stuff. In the lunch room there was this man he was probably like 30ish years old or maybe 27. He gave me stare and I felt a chill run down since I got a weird feeling. He was also shady I guess idk how to describe him. So later after a few weeks there was this guy who i didn't know he came over and said hi to me and introduced himself and did elbow shake (Due to COVID-19). He was very nice to me and helped me around. Since the store was closing all the customers left and the store was closed. I finished my work and he said he can let me out. I brought my school work with me to work and it said my grade level on it. He glanced at my book and said that’s your school work and I said yeah. He took a look and said ""You're in grade 11?"" and I was like yup almost grade 12 since this school years almost over. He opened the door and started asking a bunch of other questions about me. I realized later that he is close friends with the other guy that i saw on my first day at work. Long story short, the other guy that stared at me on my first day always looked at me strangely when i was working. He randomly started talking to me even though i did not know him or his name and helped me out. Than once i came into the back of the warehouse to grab some stuff for a customer, it's very dark and creepy in there since all the warehouse workers work early mornings and leave during my shift. there was no one in the warehouse except for the guy and he saw me coming i walked past him but he's like hey u need help? I was like yeah sure and he asked what i was looking for and i showed him on the stores scanner he leaned over but very close to me. he stood behind me but half beside me and i felt really uncomfortable he put his head really close. my heart started racing and i didnt know what to do! i stepped back but he came closer i thought at first he didn't know how close he was. someone came into the warehouse and he finally told me where i could find the item and stepped back. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just brushed it off and i thought it was just me. I started noticing weeks later that whenever i went into the back warehouse he always came and when it was just us two he always whistled past me or walked really close behind me whistling and humming. I started to avoid the warehouse and when i had to go into the warehouse to do work i always made sure there was someone else.  

I had to go throw cardboard boxes a bunch of them away in the warehouse at the very back in a shredder machine. Unfortunately, i came and it was completely empty i turned the corner and he was there by the shredder machine. its located in a very narrow place and u literally need to squeeze through. i waited and waited for him to be done he was just standing their pushing the shredder button. he looked back and saw me and my heart was just racing and i was sweating and my tongue felt knotted. he wouldn’t move so i tried pushing past him but it was super narrow he moved to the side a bit and i pushed past and threw the cardboard in but he was so close to me and moved behind me  standing very close to my body i could feel him breathing i quickly walked away and looked back he was smirking and looking at me.

I was just so scared and i hated him after that idk what happened , weeks later he complained to the manager about me not putting the cardboard back properly he told him to teach me how to do it properly . again back in the wairhouse he taught me and i barley looked at him and i was just so mad. he said to me smiling that i can ask him any questions and not to be afraid of him.

944,"Hello,

So I'm in the Navy. For a long time, I've always wanted braces but never could afford them. After joining the Navy, I finally can afford them.

I am currently stationed at a shore station in America. But I'm only here for two years; only have 18 months left on my orders. The Navy won't pay for them, but I would be happy to pay for them, myself. I went out to get a consultation and told the orthodontist of my time crunch and he said we can make it work in 18 months. Initially, before I told him of my time crunch, he said without any hesitation that it would take 2 years. I'm a little worried maybe they might try taking advantage of me... Maybe someone has a few words of advice for dealing with orthodontists? I have another consultation coming up Monday and potentially another.

I've asked around and looked everywhere for the answer to this question: When will they make me take them out? And with them in, is this going to affect what orders I can get when I'm up for orders here in \~6 months?

I really want overseas orders on a ship... To be specific, I want to go to Japan on a destroyer. Now I know I can't have them on when I'm on a destroyer, that's not the issue. Gladly take them out right before I transfer, no big deal. My worry is when I'm up for orders... Will braces affect me negatively on what orders I will be available for, and/or will they make me take them out when I get the orders 6 months from now (Basically only having the braces in for 6 months)?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have another question, but it's geared a little different, so I'm going to put that in another post.

I will highly appreciate any advice you might share... Including if it's just about having the braces in, disregarding the Navy part.",27Oct2020,1

948,"So I’m a 25 year old female and moving to the city and it’s the first time out of my parents home. I have two living options. The price difference isn’t enough to be a factor:

1. Studio Apartment in upscale financial/corporate district, not very walkable. Grocery store across the street but most restaurants around are very expensive. Kind of isolated from things to do but 10 minutes from work. Not really my vibe, but I would have my own space. 

2. High rise apartment in the middle of the city with two roommates. Would have my own space and bathroom. Very walkable to restaurants, parks, museums. 20-30 min commute. I’d much rather live in this area but not sure it’s worth sacrificing the distance to work and my own space. 

Just some thoughts... Pros of the studio would obviously be alone time and space. I’m an introvert but I’d like to try to be more social. Would like to start dating soon so I don’t know it multiple roommates would be a hindrance. Cons would be that I might get super lonely and I’m already kind of prone to depression and I don’t have any connections in this city besides a great aunt. Also, don’t know about safety issues. Reviews for this particular apartment seem to say that they have a lot of people renting out for AirBNB and complaints about big parties but that may be an issue everywhere. 

Pros of the roommate one, it’s directly in the city and easy to walk to a ton of places safely (but I also realize COVID is still going on, so it’s not like I’ll probably be going to bars or anything any time soon). It’s close to restaurants and parks and a museum that I love to go to. The view is great and I’d still have my own bedroom and bathroom. It would nice to have friends in a new place buuuut I’ve never lived with roommates so I don’t know how I’d deal with it. But again it’s a longer commute. 


Anyone have thoughts on this?",27Oct2020,1

My friend and I jumped at that, then asked eachother ""Why did he do that?""

Im not allowed talk to my bf who really is the only person I have that can talk to me most of the day. I feel like my childhood is being wasted because of how restrictive she is. I can't have social media which is the main way other teenagers communicate without giving out phone numbers. I always have to go to bed when my mom gets tired. She doesn't let me bring my phone or laptop in my room so I can't do anything. I have no way of transportation and there aren't any kids my age in this apartment complex. My mom is a toxic bitch, all she does is yell at me and constantly asks questions about the littlest things. If I laugh while im typing she demands to see my computer screen thinking im talking to somebody. When my mom installed the app qustodio so she can see EVERYTHING I do on my phone I asked her how she would feel if someone was always watching you and snooping. She wouldn't answer, she absolutely refused to listen to my feelings. She always comes into my bedroom without knocking on the door trying to catch me with my hand down my pants. All she does is bitch and complain, she always looks for the smallest thing to criticize about me and absolutely refuses to listen to me. She demands me to change myself when she wont fix herself. I feel extremely stressed and paranoid all the time and it doesnt help that we share the same therapist. My therapist always sides with my mom on her restrictiveness and always says, oH its because she lOVEs you. Bullshit, my childhood is being wasted. I have no social contact at all. How can I make her change the way she parents me because I feel like im so disconnected with the world and I feel extremely isolated. When I got bit by a dog on the hand 2 days ago she didnt even bring me to a doctor to get it checked out (yes it broke the skin and drew blood). Does anybody agree with me. All I get is the same thing over and over. Its to the point where I feel like I have no control over my life or myself. I feel so empty and its to the point where im having suicidal thoughts. It doesnt help that I have ADHD, Anxiety, and Bipolar 2. I am doing online school. No way to get out of the house and away from her.

953,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been in a relationship with somebody for about 6 months now, and it's been a roller coaster of emotions.

Ever since the start, I've been having trust and anxiety issues left and right. In the span of 6 months, there's already been a breakup, a get-together, and still constant struggles.

For some insight, my parents divorced at an early age and it really messed me up in terms of trust issues with others, including relationships. I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD, as well as only recently been talking to a therapist about these concerns.

It's been causing time and time again conflict between my partner, often it's an impulsive anxious thought that clouds my judgment, and I assume the worst in a scenario.

What are some proven methods, materials or programs I can use to help myself on this? In Canada btw.

958,"So before the pandemic started in March (I'm in Ohio). I was going to get a job as a personal trainer at my local gym. My plan was to make money doing that while I live with my mom as we finish up moving and selling the old house. I'm 28 years old and the only reason I'm living with my mom is that when I graduated from college 4 years ago, my dad got sick with cancer and died. We took care of him and then our life got aborted and ruined. We were both traumatized and I got really sick at one point and my mom was suicidal so that scared me. He didn't have any life insurance policy and claimed that he was going to live to be 100 because he's vegan (and we are not). He also put us into $300K+ of debt and he was also a hoarder with 5 storage units (20x10). I loved my father but he was terrible with money. It was only me and my mom doing all the work of cleaning up after a dead person and my mom doesn't have a job and is unable to. We just finished moving 2 months ago and got rid of more than half of the stuff. Now it's just a smaller home and a 10x10 storage unit. We are selling stuff on eBay and Marketplace. Our house is like a hoarders house right now but we are working towards getting one room all cleaned up and nice one by one. 

I really wanted to be a game developer (3d environment artist) / game designer, which is what I studied at school. I'm unable to do that right away, I need to upgrade my pc and get some software to rebuild my portfolio, and make some new work. I also so badly want to be independent and have an apartment of my own. I also need money. So that's why I studied personal training, got certified, and thought of getting a job as a personal trainer while I work on my portfolio. The pandemic aborted all that and then last week, I called my gym to ask if it's safe to go back to the gym, what safety measure are they taking, and if they still have a personal trainer job available. So I went in for a second interview which went very well. Today, I went in for shadowing, I notice that group classes that people are not wearing masks, people are not wearing a mask at treadmills and at a workout when drinking water or chatting. It's terrifying to me. I don't want to risk my life or bring it to my mom who is 59 years old and has asthma and autoimmune disorder. It really sucks that there's a pandemic. It really screws everything up. The job pays more than any other part-time job or retail job I ever had in my life but am I willing to risk my life or my mom's life for it? Should I not take the job? Ohio is getting really bad and the numbers are going up. However, I do need money really bad. I need new clothes, haircuts, stuff for my computer, and software to get a job in the gaming industry as a 3D artist. I also have a cat and dog to take care of. I also need my car fixed. Should I just work my ass off on the 3d portfolio and borrow money? A 3d artist job would pay a lot more than any personal trainer job for me. 

Should I take the job or not? Is safety more important or money? What should I say to the personal trainer manager who's in charge of hiring?

P.S. I'm also feeling really depressed as of today and feeling lost, like in limbo like the past 4-5 years of my life is god awful and I'm seeing no end to it. I want a life, money, and social connection.",27Oct2020,1

960,"Recently my boyfriend (23m) and I (26f) had a discussion about the future and what we want out of this relationship. We've been together for 8 months. 

I want to reach milestones eventually like move in together, get a dog, and get married after years have gone by doe instance. Stuff like that. 

He himself went on to say that while he does want a long term commitment at the same time he doesn't. Mainly because he's afraid of opening up and have a chance at something bad happening. Basically he knows what he wants but is scared to go for it. Because of his worries he feels like he's looking for a safeguard because his ex (3 years ago, they were together for a few years) hurt him badly when she broke it off. It made him realize there's no guarantees and that certain people come and go no matter how hard you work on a relationship together, so trying to build something with me I feel is something he's cautious about. 

He reiterated that he does like me and wants a long term commitment (he's also said he could see us going long term and enjoys his time with me) but doesn't know how to go about the situation and wants to wait to deal with it when he's ready. 

He also added that he'll probably never want to marry but he doesn't know if he'll change his mind. He mainly just doesn't care for the system overall. He knows that I would like to marry eventually, and I know he wouldn't want to string me along so I'll take that as a sign that he can be flexible with the idea of it? He doesn't seem to be worried about it. I have a feeling that's the case since we had a discussion about having kids early on for example. He said he'll probably never be ready and if I wanted children he didn't want to waste my time. I don't really care either way about raising kids so we cleared that up. I figured in this case regarding marriage that he still wouldn't want to waste my time. I do want to ask him if he's comfortable with me wanting to get married since it's a serious compatibility issue if we can't reach common ground, but we've only been together for 8 months so I don't want to talk about it too much. 

He also admitted in our talk that he had a rough childhood and because of that he's closed off emotionally and wants to work on that as well. He explained that he's direct (sometimes his tone can be mistaken for having a cold tone) because it's how he survived but that doesn't mean he doesn't care. That's caused some issues but we've been great at communication for the most part. A few friends have even said that the fact we're talking about it and are on par with communication makes them believe we could be/are an amazing couple. 

I'm wondering, how long should I wait for him to commit/be comfy to do so and fall in love with me? 

Is waiting another year too much or too little?
I can be patient for another year and would want to evaluate the relationship after if nothing changes, but I'm afraid of missing something amazing/long lasting if I don't wait enough. And I'd like to know the best way to be patient and understanding, as I don't want to rush him. At the same time I've heard stories of people waiting years or during the entireity/rest of their 20s with no change and I'm lowkey worried if that'll be my outcome.

I think this is more of a chance to get some feelings off my chest that I have been burying for years and hopefully run into a few anonymous people who can hear me when I don’t have anyone else to open up to about this.

I feel like my entire life I’ve given the best of myself to the people around me expecting nothing in return. I try so hard to be a good person and to put others before myself. I also think that this practice has trained me to believe that everyone else and every thing matters more than I do. I’m so willing to put my wants and needs on hold to the point where now I feel guilty any time I even think about doing anything self serving. It’s like I’ve brainwashed myself into believing that I’m not worth anything. I’ve always struggled with self esteem and confidence despite having great friends and family. I know that I have no logical reason to feel this way but I can’t help feeling like literally nothing matters anymore. I’m not suicidal by any means, but I can’t help but feel like if everything ended tomorrow I’d be relieved.

965,"Hello,

I know the title is confusing, but I shall explain it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in the Navy, at a shore station, and I want braces.

I actually made a post a few minutes ago about this. This is the other question I have that I didn't want to include in there. This isn't really a direct question... I just need guidance. I don't have anyone to ask..

I really want braces and I brought it up with my chain of command. But I feel like they don't really approve... Not so much like they think it will negatively affect my ability, but more that I'm wasting my time/money. I feel as though they would rather me save my money and use it for education.

My goal in the Navy is to be a pilot, and they are very much aware of that and want me to achieve that goal. My LPO (Leading Petty Officer) checks on me a lot, asking me about my studying. As soon as I brought up braces, I got the idea that they don't approve of that at all...

I don't really know what I want to ask, or what I need guidance for... I just don't want to choose the thing that will not make me happy. I want braces to realign my teeth and fix my deep bite and over bite. Something I noticed years ago and wanted to have fixed, but never could afford. It's been a goal of mine as long as it has been wanting to be in the Navy and to be a pilot. It's a lot easier to achieve this one than it is to achieve the two other goals, quite frankly...

I want them sooner rather than later. I'm young, I want to try to look my best... My next orders will most likely be 5 years long, on a ship where I cannot get braces... It would be nice to just be a little more confident in my looks during that period. Be more attractive. Maybe I shouldn't worry about that... But I just don't know. The corrections will make me look older, more mature and more masculine. It would make me a lot more happier.

But becoming a pilot would also make me really happy... Maybe this is a waste of time... My chain of command will see I put money into my looks instead of my dedication to the service, so maybe they'll think my priorities aren't right and I won't get much respect from them. The military loves it when you try to make yourself better, but I don't think they consider aesthetics in that... I think maybe they would see it as a negative.",27Oct2020,1

967,"So this Sunday I attended a party. It was a friend's daughter's birthday party. This is a friend I've met recently through my best friend, who runs a car shop. Basically everyone in attendance that day works in said car shop, so they are a tight knit group. I still have a good relationship with my best friend, but since I stopped working there some six months ago I don't see him as often, while he hangs out with this group of people basically every day of the week. To be fair, my best friend told me I could visit whenever I wished to, and I often do, which is how I got to meet the host, but I can't join them on weekends because I still live with my family and they don't want me to drink alcohol, which these lads of course do, sometimes a lot.

So, back to Sunday, I went to the party and overall had it nice, was chatting and drinking a bit with everyone, but I had to leave earlier than everyone else because I didn't want to run into trouble at home. At some point, the host mentioned he wanted a picture of everyone taken, but everyone was so busy chatting with each other no one really paid him attention. After that, the moment for leaving comes, and I'm invited to another party this Saturday. So, everything fine and dandy. But for some reason, when today the host posted on social media a picture of the group, I felt bad. I assume it was taken after I left. I don't believe it was their intention to leave me out of it, because I was invited to this party days in advance, sent a reminder, and the host called me when it started and I wasn't there yet, and I have an overall good relationship with the other guys. 

I wish I could have stayed a little bit longer so I could also have been in the photo. I realize this is probably my insecurities playing with my mind, and I think I need to go back to therapy soon. But I would still like to have a similar photo of my friends and me taken. How should I go about it? In this case, it was the host of the party that asked for this photo, so he was naturally the center of attraction. But if, say, this Saturday, ask the lads if I could have a photo taken with them in a similar way, would it be weird? Given that I don't think I am a strong part of the group (aside from my relationship with my best friend), would it come across as desperate, or low-self-esteemy? Should I do it or should I just stick around longer next time and wait for it to happen naturally? I don't think I'm gonna throw a party where I'd be the center of attention at least until my university graduation next year.

TLDR.- I was not part of a group photo because I left a party early. I don't believe it was intentional. Should I ask for a similar photo to be taken with me next time we meet up?",27Oct2020,1

I’m (25F) definitely going through a quarter life crisis!

All of my life I have been focusing on getting into a good career field and climbing the ladder. Now that I am an adult and in a career that I genuinely love, I am still feeling crap.

I don’t know WHAT I want in life, I feel overwhelmed. I have lived away from home (FAR away) when I went to uni, I’m back in my hometown now for a few years (when I was a kid I actually lived in another country but been in the UK for majority of my life). So it’s not like I’ve been settled in 1 place for ever.

I don’t know whether I want to move to a bigger city, but I don’t like the idea of being away from my friends and family.

My 7 year relationship is coming to an end I think, which sucks but I think have just grown up to be different people which happens!

Even the prospects of getting a better job isn’t getting me excited.

I feel frustrated because I dont own a house yet and I’m stuck renting.

I just feel like I always thought I would be this amazingly special person who would have a great job and a great adventurous life and a great house and the reality is we are all the same and I’m just like everyone else! (Deffo my mums fault for making me feel too special haha).

I just need something more in my life and I can’t figure this out, I just feel so weird and unfulfilled, but I don’t actually know what I want?

970,"I am a sophomore undergraduate biology student at a University in the western half of the United States. I am thinking about changing my major to economics for many reasons. For one, even though science interests me more, I am still quite interested in economics and finance. Also, If I wanted to do post-graduate work, I could go back to school and earn a master's or Ph.D. in economics and work in academia.

Here's my dilemma: I find science unbearably interesting. Working as a researcher in academia is what compels me. I want to solve complex biological problems and contribute to medical science. It's what I've wanted to do since I was a kid. That's all great, but there are some pragmatic issues. 

For one, my home life isn't very good. My relationship with my parents has deteriorated for reasons I'm not getting into. As you probably know, getting a P.h.D in a scientific field takes many years of study and research.  Years that I would likely have to live with my parents. With undergraduate work in economics, I could make decent money right out of the gate.

Furthermore, I value a decent work-life balance. Even though I love science, I don't want to be under massive amounts of stress to get my work done. Graduate students endlessly complain about their social lives. I don't know if it's much better for post-docs.

Also, I am struggling with online school. I can't find any motivation to do hard science classes online. I know that covid restrictions won't last forever, but I am getting mediocre grades(mostly B's,) and graduate school is very competitive. 

 I am thinking of doing science as a hobby (like NileRed,) and doing a different major. Switching to economics would be no problem since most of my completed coursework are general education requirements.",27Oct2020,1
971,"Somehow whenever I nicely bring up when I’m uncomfortable about something this person in his family did he goes ballistic and we actually almost called it quits. All because I held in my feelings for so long and decided to sit him down and talk to him about inappropriate attention seeking things this person has done that makes me uncomfortable and how we can either fix how I feel or just plain talk about it. Instead he called me a liar and non of these things happened and if I ever mention her name in a negative way then he will be just as pissed and will always react this way. Basically there’s been scenarios where there was pics sent to him each time she has a kid of her boobs and no baby in the pic hardly like you had to look and see it in the corner. I thought why couldn’t she have her husband send a pic of her smiling or holding the baby so we can see her and the baby that’s so weird. I’m only mentioning a few scenarios but I could go on and on. Little stuff like nobody thinking I’m around and accidentally saying in front of me ( it was only supposed to be my fiancée their dad and her) comments about her boobs and pointing to her so everyone can look as she sits very very awkwardly in a fetal position bending in a chair so she can have her boobs hang out on her knees. They looked frozen when I walked out and heard it. Little stuff like everybody just standing and talking then her suddenly sitting down on the ground not in a chair plain on the ground and looking up at everyone with lingerie poking out and boobs showing. Then her husband purposely trying to get her to bend over for everyone constantly in front of my fiancée. Everybody in the family commenting about how they can’t wait for a blonde blue eyes white baby how gorgeous it will be also. ( she’s not naturally blonde like most people who bleach their hair) but really why say that stuff in front of me? I have black hair pretty much black eyes and I’m tan. They’ve painted pictures in their sons head of how gorgeous fully white women are it seems like. It’s super creepy. Like calling him away from me to look at someone with bleached hair on the tv how pretty and awesome they are. Then saying “ omg that gorgeous person looks exactly like so and so” ( the person who’s been making me uncomfortable by seeking attention at any family gathering). Yesterday I find out that he sold a phone to the girl and I didn’t have a problem with that I usually try to not have a problem with anything because I want him to be around his family. She absolutely could not figure out how to transfer her pictures to her new phone and even him explaining exactly how to do it she could not do it so she had to bring in her phone and use his Wi-Fi at the store he works at for her pictures to be transferred even though she has Wi-Fi at home with her husband and was having my fiancé transfer her pictures for her. It just freaks me out I really don’t want to know what my fiancé has seen. She dropped the phones off with him today to play on her phone and all that. This makes me extremely uncomfortable and I don’t know how to talk to him because she is at the age like us where she should know how to do this stuff on electronics and she’s had plenty of phones.  It makes me sick to my stomach that she had to do that and he took time out of his day working to do all this for her. It’s literally so easy you can do it on iCloud or an app. I just don’t want to fight with him when he gets home. Should I wait on it and see how I feel a couple days from now. Am I overreacting? We’ve been together for 6 years almost with no other problems... but it seems she’s someone in the family that’s looked at as a absolute queen.

I knew all of the kids that worked there from school. Well, I forgot I was in reverse, and I reversed into a woman and her car. In front of my classmates. It wasn’t anything huge. There wasn’t a scratch on either of our vehicles, and because of that, she decided not to call the cops. But my sister was SCREAMING at me. She told me I was awful, I could’ve killed us, and that she knew I wasn’t a good driver. I feel awful. I really do. I’ve been crying for hours. I already told my mother I refuse to ever drive again. I don’t know what to do. No matter what I do, I keep replaying the incident over and over in my head. I can’t do anything but think about it, and I feel like I’m going to throw up. I really thought I was ready for my license, and I know I’m stupid, but I was confident I was ready.",27Oct2020,1
973,"My little sister was recently clinically diagnosed with depression, shortly after confessing to me about it. It was honestly heartbreaking to hear about how she inflicted harm on herself since she was only nine years old, but she is doing a lot better and I am infinitely grateful she had the courage to talk to me about it. Her revealing her depression to my family has kinda caused all of our family's problems to be brought to light. My mom, who has always been a little uptight and anxious, came into my room crying the other day begging me to reassure her that my sister's depression wasn't her fault. I consoled her and told her how as a family, we should always be trying to create positive interactions and memories, and learn from the bad ones. She then promptly stated that she thinks she has bipolar disorder, stopped crying, and left the room. Her saying that made me realize that yes, she does actually display a lot of the symptoms. My dad has always been my rock. Cool-headed, soft spoken and wise way beyond his years, he is truly a magnificent mind. My respect for him has been so great that I have always idolized him. That is, until he shared with me his fair share of mental issues. He got into an argument with my mom (nothing out of the ordinary, this wasn't a terrible fight) and I tried to console him by talking. He never really shows any emotion so I tried extra hard this time, especially in light of my other family members' revelations. He then started to cry, something I have never in my life seen him do, and he confessed about how he thought he had depression too. That really crushed me.

I made promises. Individually, I went up to all three of them and I promised that I will make sure everyone will feel better. I promised them that things will get better. But most importantly, I promised them that I am okay.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend is the only one who knows I'm not. I have an issue there too, though. I keep pushing her away. When I myself am feeling down, I crave for her physical presence. When she tries to console me over facetime, however, I find that I keep pushing her away. Last night during one of my own depressive episodes, I got so frustrated with everything going on that I hung up on her. Understandably, she got upset with me and we spent the entire day without calling each other, until just now. I apologized and explained how I can't seem to stop pushing people away, and she got upset because she didn't know what she was supposed to do. Seeing her upset makes me heartbroken, so I immediately took everything back and acted like I was okay.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not.

&amp;#x200B;

Writing about this here is literally my last option. I stay up all night crying sometimes because of how alone I feel. I can't ever rely on anyone because they're all relying on me. I'm an atheist but these are moments in which I wish I believed in God, just so I have someone to talk to about how I'm feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My dad is depressed, my sister is suicidal, my mom is bipolar, and I lied to them that I was fine. My girlfriend knows but I downplay it so that she doesn't get upset.",27Oct2020,1
974,"So I've been dirty talking with this girl for a few days and we were building a friendship, she was really sweet and a nice girl. 2 nights ago she told me she had a rough day and it's a long story, so I wished her the best and let her sleep it off, she didn't tell me what it is. Last night we talked a few words and she suddenly disappeared. Dead silent. I checked today and only untill a few mins ago her chat box disappared... she blocked and left without a word. Now im here feeling sad because I lost someone I was building a friendship with.... how do you overcome things like this?",27Oct2020,1
975,"We broke up in july and I hoped that I would get over her by now, but I just can't stop thinking about or day dreaming about her. We broke up because of many reasons all of them being outside of our control. We tried to meet each other half way, but our became longer and harde to cross and we had to put an end to it to save each other from harm.


I just don't how to stop thinking about her, she keeps popping into my thoughts dreams and daydreams. How do I let go or forget?",27Oct2020,1
976,"So, my dad was diagnosed with IPF about 2 years ago. At first his symptoms were just a persistent cough and some shortness of breath if he walked a lot. But over the last few months both have gotten much worse - he has shortness of breath even with few steps and has to take oxygen. He almost can't walk at all without oxygen.

He's also lost a lot of weight and is looking frail. He's been on Esbriet for 1.5 years now and although it may have slowed the progression of his disease, it also has some serious side effects. He has zero appetite to eat and has constant bouts of diarrhea. And he's become quite depressed. I'm not sure if we should get him started on anti-depressants or not but we'll be speaking with his doc soon about it. I think a support group would really help him but with the COVID situation we haven't been able to go to any of them.

And I'm having a hard time dealing with all of this - I feel like I'm becoming depressed as well. I live with my parents and help take care of both of them. There are days when I don't want to deal with seeing him this way - he's really turned into a shell of what he was.

Not sure what I'm even asking here. Is there anyone else here who's been through something like this? How did you deal with it?",27Oct2020,1
