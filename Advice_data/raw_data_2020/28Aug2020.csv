0,"I work in a place where we constantly hire people who leave within 5-9 months. We sink a lot of money into training them off the street and getting them licenses. And it's a waste of time and money. We are constantly understaffed and constantly behind because we are training in a high traffic, knowledge based business. There are currently 7 employees that have been there anywhere from 2 years to 15. We make below the average minimum for our profession. A trainee left financials out on the counter and we found out they make significantly more than 5 of those 7 longterm employees. Turns out, every time we hire, we raise the starting rate. Now we have 4 trainees making significantly more than the long term employees, two of which who have no intent to stay. Are their any laws in the US that regard unfair wages in this aspect? To make as much as the trainees with our raise rate, it would take 4 years.",28Aug2020,1

Ever since berry came in contact with him tho, she’s been depressed, suicidal, and has started un healthy habits. I’ve talked to berrys parents about this, but they’ve seemed to not take it seriously. A few months ago, berry sent her address to cloud. Now she plans to mail something to him which idk I’m just very skeptical about. Any advice would be highly appreciated. (This was just a rundown as this situation is more complicated)",28Aug2020,1

4,"im seriously at a dead end. An extremely close friend of mine has been hacked by a stalker and we dont know what to do.  The stalker hacked into their computer, phone, bank account, school accounts, gmails, literally anything you can think of. We have VERY strong suspicions its someone who they used to be in a relationship with but no absolute evidence its them, which will make sense when i explain it in a minute.

This stalker had talked with my friend at school for weeks prior before the relationship, they knew everything about my friend. What they liked and didnt, and stuff that my friend never even mentioned around them (stuff that this stalker had NO WAY of knowing). They dated and then broke up, all of this happening in jr year of highschool (11th grade). Fast forward, my friend is about to get ready for college and suddenly got all these emails saying all of their socials and the like have gotten their passwords changed. They did some digging and found out there had been recipts of an unknown user signing into their accounts for the last 2 years and looking through their stuff.

The rabbit hole goes even further though. A couple hours have passed and were all freaking out trying to fix it. We already talked to a lawyer friend who said they cant really help, the advice they gave didnt help either. And an unmarked car with tinted windows sat outside of our house with no one leaving it, and only left when one of us went out to investigate. My friend said it could be their ex, as when they met their ex they strangely knew alot about my friend but they didnt think anything of it at the time. My friend also said their ex was extremely good at hacking and that they would do it for fun sometimes, and that this ex had hacked their own ex and exposed private photos of them to the internet. We immediately knew it was them, as my friend told us this and more stories about how their ex would be obsessive over where they were and who they talked too and the like. 

My friend tried to go to the police, but the police said they didn’t believe her and even if they did they wouldn’t be able to do anything unless the person had physically hurt them. Then when my friend was leaving the station, they got a call from an unknown number and it was just 10 seconds of someone breathing deeply then hanging up.

We have taken precaution about what devices we talk around as were sure some of them have listening spyware installed. But were seriously at a dead-end. My friend has become paranoid and spends every waking moment looking out the window, trying to find out more about this, or suspecting every random person on the street as the hacker/stalker. 

I know some of the things that happened can just purely be coincidence, but i want to take every chance i get to treat the coincidences with caution so my friend will stay safe.

Any advice helps, i just want my friend to feel safe again in their own home.",28Aug2020,1
5,"Hi everyone. I'm having a really hard time and kind of don't know what to do here. Sorry for the long story, it's complicated.

Last week, I woke up with a sore throat and fever. I had just gotten a COVID test 7 days before, and I freaked out and went to get another one that day. 2 days later I came back negative but decided to still self-isolate because of the possibility of getting my roommates sick.

That day, we figured out that our old roommate's (let's call her R) boyfriend (they live together in a different house from us) was sick and COVID positive. My current roommate, let's call her K, went skating with R that same day and even drank out of her waterbottle. R was definitely exposed - she and her bf even sleep in a bed together and he was actively symptomatic that day. The CDC's website says any exposed person should quarantine themself for 14 days.

We're all freaked out and agree she could be sick. Until the next night, when K comes to my door and says she's ""going for a skate"" and will ""mask and socially distance"". I assume she's just sick of being cooped up and say OK. 

When she comes back I ask her how it went. She skirts around the subject before casually mentioning that she went skating with R. My brain does a backflip. I confront her later and say she shouldn't see R for a while, at least until she gets a negative test result. K assures me that they were very careful and stayed far apart, and agrees not to see them til their result comes back.

A few days pass. I'm still self-isolating and haven't really talked to anyone in a while. Out of nowhere I get a text from R's boyfriend that says R and K and our other roommate are all going to skate together, even though R's test result hasn't come back. None of them said a word to me about this. He says he thought it was wrong to lie to me and eventually convinces R that she shouldn't go skate because it's risky. She texts me an apology. They don't skate together. 

Neither of my other two roommates have talked to me since this happened. I feel so lost and upset, I don't even know how to address this. The COVID part is bad enough, but the fact that all 3 of them knew what I has asked for and went behind my back anyway is somehow worse. Didn't even discuss it with me. I have been self-isolating for 8 days to keep them safe. I just want to leave but I'm scared of exposing my family. 

How do I address this? Should I tell them how upset I am that they lied to me? Do I wait for them to say something? Am I being an asshole by asking them to wait to see R? I feel like shit.",28Aug2020,1

7,"Hello reddit, I'm a 16 year old boy who has autism. For my entire life I've been treated differently because of my autism. I have no friends who actually like me, No one likes to talk to me, No one likes being around me, And no body cares about me. I've been dealing with depression since I was 12 because of my autism, getting bullied, etc. Now I'm not suicidal i swear, but I think if I died the only people who'd care would be my family. Now the only time I feel happy is when I'm around people or I'm on video games or watching something. My parents get mad though when I do those things. Nobody talks to me at school even if I start the conversation. And thats rare for me because I don't like starting conversations. Whenever I tell my crush I like them, they think I'm weird and talk shit about me. I feel like shit most days. I want to talk with someone but nobody wants to. And therapy is super expensive. I feel alone and its a shitty feeling. No one likes me around and I just want to feel happy and be around actually friends who care about me.

11,"so in germany we are now getting 300€ extra money from the state for the children 
i dont live with my mother anymore so i get like all the childsupportmoney from my parents and the state (which is like 200€ a month)

my mother decided to keep the 300€ extra money for herself without telling me about it and just hoped i wouldnt notice
when i confronted her she said that she had to pay 500€ tax extra and didnt have the money so she wanted to keep the 300€ 

which would have been totally fine if she talked to me about it (I would have shared with her), didnt buy a pair of new shoes 2 minutes before i confronted her and didnt do almost the same thing (but with 1500€) two years before and said she needed them to move houses
(we had a big fight about it, i didnt talk to her for half a year and then i kinda forgave her)

shes always complaining about being ""poor"" or having no money but everytime I visit her she shows me new clothes she just bought

so basically I don't really care about the money but I am really hurt that she went behind my back like that after I just trusted her again because our relationship was good for the first time since I was 8
legally the money is mine but idk if I even want it now


I told her she had to really do sth to make me forgive her (but I dont know if I should or want to) and I'm thinking of me making her give me the money, get a therapist that's actually good for her and never really trust her again or just never talk to her again 

also pls have in mind that I have like 4 mental illnesses (partly) because of her

14,"This is kinda rambled because I've been an emotional wreck, and I'm on mobile. Apologies for formatting, and I appreciate any advice you have to give. I need it. Some language and it's really long so if you dislike that you can choose not to read. 

I'm a 19f currently, going to college (In the US) for a job I've dreamed of having since I was 12. I've been able to get by with grant and scholarship money, while living with my mother in the same city as my college. Everything was actually perfect. I love my school, my city, and my boyfriend who joined the military is moving about a state over in October, so many visits are possible. (I was a part of the reason he put that city on his list, but I wasn't his only reason for wanting to work there.) 

Everything changed when the fire nation--- I mean my mother, decided she needed to move out of our current state. This started back in early July, so we're coming up on two months of this being her hill to die on. Okay. So two months ago she decided she needs to move, but she couldn't tell me when or where she wants to move. Fast forward to the start of August and she decided that we need to move out of our current state before November, because she wants to be gone before the election. 

My response to this was along the lines of ""Oh, oh fuck, that's a really short amount of time. Where do you plan on moving? Will there be a school with the program I absolutely need that I can go to?"" 

The answer to which was equivalent to ""idk, lol"" but in a much more motherly, much more all-knowing tone. So she asked for a list of all the schools in the country that had the program I need and I gave it to her, and she said she would think about it. Great. 

She had told me that she wanted to stay close to our state, but move to a different one with a college that has the program I need, so I wasn't stressed out. I thought overall it would still be a close enough city to see my boyfriend and the community I've built myself growing up here my entire life. And then, the other day, she said she had made her decision and that she hopes it'll be something I'll like... 

AND SHE DECIDED SHE HAS TO MOVE ACROSS THE GODDAMN COUNTRY. As in, 36 hours in a car non-stop, or an almost $500 dollar plane ticket kinda jump. The state she chose has some laws I really don't believe in, they have less than half the minimum wage in the city I am in now, and while the rent is cheaper the poverty rate is 30% higher. The absolute cherry on top? It's a six hour drive from the only school in the state that has the program I need for my dream job.

Needless to say, I broke down into absolute tears. I explained that this kinda felt like a really big betrayal, that I felt like she was tearing apart the foundation I had built myself (something she has done before), and that she hasn't given me enough time to adjust to anything or prepare myself if I don't want to go with her. Because I'm not prepared. I've been focusing on school and my savings are little to none, built up only by my occasional odd job. Never in my years was I expecting to be thrown across the country into a city so far away from almost everyone I know and love. 

She apologized that it was a rough transition for me but has held firm on her choice to move to this state. She's basically told me that she will provide whatever money I need to go to this college six hours away (she hasn't had to help me out with college financially yet), but she won't help me out with trying to stay in the state I'm in because she can't afford to keep living in our current state. (Can't afford it? She's bought a new grill, two new piano keyboards, a new car... In the past few months.) 

This leaves me with a few options, and none of which are great, considering I have six weeks. 

1) I move with her to this new state, suck it up, live 2000 miles away from everything and everyone I love, and get a free education. 

2) I start trying to get a job immediately with little to no job experience to support myself, in tandem with my current course work, I look for a cheap apartment, and move in, to keep going to my current school. I can't take the program in little chunks, just in one year long intense study session, so I'm not sure how this would work once I get into the program. This means I'd probably end up getting a student loan and going into debt, but I'd be home. 

3) My boyfriend, a sweetheart, has offered to help me get a footing in the city he's headed to one state away. (There happens to be a school with the program I need there) This hasn't been properly explored, but I feel really weird about just accepting how much money that would cost and it would still probably end with me getting a student loan. 

4) I throw caution to the wind, marry my dearest darling, and we get a house together because the military provides additional income for that purpose. This is irrational and I doubt we are truly ready for it but we joke about it consistently and this is an extension of the joke.

Her birthday was Monday and she does this every year. Act like she forgets to make me feel bad then get mad when someone else tells her.

21,"I'm a 16 year old female and i have been talking to a 23 year old guy who has been very nice and respectful to me at all times.
I never had a good experience with any males online, i have been groomed previously but i was 12 and didn't know anything, and thankfully it only lasted a day but it still effected me a lot. Other times there were dudes around my age who at the start appeared perfect but then suddenly only wanted to talk about sexual topics which I hated, it was always such a disappointment since they were so great..
Me and the current guy in question met while playing an online multilayer game, we came across each other on the same server a few times and since i was quite new to the game he helped me a lot while being nice to everyone. Since he was so nice to me I sent him a friend request and he to my surprise accepted and even messaged me first saying he is logging off for the night and asking if I will be available tomorrow for another game. First few interactions were very casual, we played together and talked about my poor laptop and how it barely could run the game at 12 fps. Then one time he asked me what I was doing and since I don't see the point of lying I said i was drinking some tea with my mum while trying to have a conversation which led to us talking about my relationship with my parents and a bit about his family. Since then we talked every day about different things but mostly he tried to give me support with my mental health and give me general motivation. He is very open with me so he did mention how sometimes he feels strange talking to me about certain things since i am 16 and he is 23 which I understand. He always told me that if something we talk about makes me uncomfortable i should tell him but honestly that never happened since he is always so nice and respectful. Our relationship soon became a bit different since we both shared interest in each other. He always feels as if he is doing something wrong when he just simply makes jokes that might be considered inappropriate but making these jokes actually helped me be more comfortable with these kind of topics in general, i myself finally feel comfortable enough to just make these jokes, talk about it seriously and share my experiences. He has helped me so much and according to him I added something good to his life too but even though everything seems perfect to both of us the issue of age always comes back. He never made me do, say or send anything, he just wants me to be comfortable talking about it with others especially my parents. We might make jokes about the fact that in 2 years time it will not look as ""shady"" but the fact will always stay the same, he started talking to me when I was 16.
This entire situation never effected me negatively in any way, as I said he has helped me so much and I genuinely feel better but for in his case people will not think the best of him, he does say that he is genuinely happy talking to me but he can't help it but feel like he us doing something wrong even though no one is getting hurt. I understand when people are groomed they don't realise it so my opinion in this might not be as reliable but people around me, my friends and family noticed that i am happier as well. Only a few of my friends know about him though since i know what kind of reaction I will get from my parents, they will not even listen to me.
Today he also asked what I would do if there was a person I liked in my college, would I go for it and date them or not, I said it would feel wrong since I am taking to him, I asked him the same question and got the same answer.
Then he started questioning if he should wait those 2 years or should it just not happen since it could have such a negative impact on his life (him meeting me when I am 16 and then dating when I'm 18, people might not think the best of him) I personally think that even though i want it to happen if he decides it's something that he wouldn't be able to live with i am ok with that. It's a part of life and if that is meant to happen it will happen, of course I will not feel great but once again it's a part of life and it's not really for me to decide since it will not have any negative effect on my life unlike for him.

So my question is, am I being groomed or is it just very unfortunate circumstances? Will it be fine if we do date when I'm 18 or will it still be considered shady since we started talking when I was 16?

Also him being friends with me and taking to me will not change but of course will be different.

31,"Am I though? For a little over half a year now I have been seriously questioning my sexual identity, I think I’m bisexual. I say this because I’ve noticed recently that I find a lot of girls attractive. Seems pretty point blank, no? That’s why I’m here.

I am having a RIDICULOUSLY hard time differentiating what I feel for women and sexual/romantic attraction, or just me thinking girls are hot. like in a “wow she looks great” way, or “wow I wanna date her” kind of way. You know what I mean? Do I appreciate how pretty she looks or do I...you know...feel more than that? 

I know that nobody here will have the answer, cause only I know myself blah blah I know, but if anyone here has been in a similar situation and has any tips to help me differentiate these feelings and help on my journey of self discovery, it would REALLY be appreciated.

33," Hello,im close to 30 years old,i used to be exbicionist,i have depression,some autism(aspergers) i think and other mental issues, and last year i was using omegle looking for adult women to expose myself to,i always watched porn before to help me get excited. i always ask their age and skip young teenagers(most have 15 or less), but in 4 situations for the first time  the girls were aged 16-17 (3 had 17, 1 had 16),in the first seconds i was exposing and didnt asked their ages yet but i was too horny and focused and confused, had lapse of judgement and overlooked their age after reading it and continue to show myself for some seconds to a minute until they skiped. in my mind i thought to use age of consent to justify the exposure and i was deciding to skip or not but i took too long, i even told one girl (17)she was undergaged to this and she laughed at me and she said she had sex before and showed her tongue for me to ejaculate, i ignored and she skiped. , After some time i searched on internet that society disaprove this in genera( sex with teen 16-17), i was ignorant and stupid. I realized i was wrong months latter and feel guilty and i feel should be killed or something i have depression and i hate myself. By the way,It was consensual i didnt see they naked and they wanted to see me. however it is still wrong to girls in that age look for naked men online, omegle is for adults. God i dont even attracted for this age group and im not some kind of p3do. I feel so gulty and need some closure, i think i need a therapist. everytime i read something about p3dophilia on the news it reminds me of those events. im also not gay and exposed to some men because i was too excited,but this is not serious to me. Is it realy bad what happened about the girls? I feel so ashamed and disguted with myself, i even quit to exhibit and never had relationship before. I have suffered from depression since i was younger and im impulsive. can someone please give me an opinions about this? Please i fell awful and sometimes i cry.

So comes time for me to leave and look at that. She's nowhere to be found and I'm working my ass off to get things out. And there is no end in sight. I've never cried from working but I couldn't breathe and I couldn't stop crying at some point. It was all a blur. She finally comes to help and gets mad every time I try to make something. I finally just ask if I should let my ride know I'm staying or if I can go. I didn't even get the words out. She just snapped ""I don't care go"".  

I don't know what she wants from me. My ride had already been waiting over a half a hour and I just wanted an answer. I also always come in early, never randomly can't show up and never really take off of work.

I can't deal with this. My mom constantly complains to me. My dad is yelling. My brother has decided he's going to be like this forever and has no hope of ever becoming better. He won't go to therapy, won't take any advice, and I don't know what I can do.

Recently there has been a lot of fighting in my (16f) family. my dad (46m) and my sister (18f) have never truly gotten along but we have always tried to remain a happy family. in the past few months my dad has become very hard to live with; he is constantly fighting with mum (50f) (not really sure what about because i tend to ignore it) but just now him and my sister havent been seeing eye to eye. my dad agreed to never kick one of his children out of the house, which means he has temporarily left to live somewhere else close by. 

my dad struggles immensely with his mental health, and because of it, he has developed horrible addictions to alcohol and gambling. this has been an issue for a while, but only recently has it really started to affect the whole family. he can be manipulative, and drains his business bank account often to fuel these habits. once he called me 5/6 times throughout the night to send him more money from his bank account. my mum has repeatedly tried to get him to get some help, but nothing ever changes. he is a very cool parent when sober, and i tend to go to him when i have issues of my own. 

i attend therapy and i have been able to see its benefits, and all 3 of us (mum, sister, me) agree that he should be attending as well. my dad also realises he has these issues but is very stubborn and uses his depression as an excuse to avoid it (not sure why). 

since i am out of all of this drama, i am going to stay with my dad tonight. i have been texting him and he has told me he is very lonely and wants to get the family back together. i was thinking that maybe if he heard from someone he is very close to (i am very close to my dad) that maybe it will change something in him. yet again, i’m scared of how he will react because he can either get very defensive, or it can go well. 

so, would i be wrong if i talked to my dad about him going to therapy?",28Aug2020,1

However, we were talking about rents and one of the boys(call him Michael) asked her about if she is senior and she(call her A) said no I stayed in prep class for a year. He asked me if I stayed too and I said no I did well and he asked how many people passed the prep class and I said 18 out of 90. A said that our exam was easy and in her year only 3 could passed. It drove me crazy this time because whenever someone congratulates me about it she says yours was easy etc. and I couldn't help but opened the archives for 2017-2018 prep class announcement and I said 18 had passed. She felt uncomfortable or maybe even embarrassed for a while but then she checked the list for a long time and talked stuff about those people to make herself more comfortable.

57,"Background: 

So I'm currently running a project centered on publishing and showcasing literary works. Our Board of Directors consists of me (co-founder), a girl we'll call Nellie (co-founder), a girl we'll call Nora (Chief of Editing), and a girl we'll call Samantha (Chief of Marketing). I have never met any of them, but we've been working together for a few months.

Our project is still in the process of getting started, so recruiting writers and marketing is very important. We have already received a few submissions, in which we must edit and review before publishing to our website. Although Nellie is supposedly the other co-founder, it was originally me who came up with the idea. Nellie also recruited Nora, who is her personal friend.

My problem:

I don't know how else to word this, so I'm just going to lay it straight. Nellie has done close to zero work and doesn't respond to my texts. While Nora still helps out a little, she does not keep promises and fails to edit pieces (which is her only job). 

Since Nellie and I are the co-founders, it's up to us to help Samantha with marketing, recruiting, and partnerships. However, at this point, it's only Samantha and I who even lift our fingers. Nellie has not done a single thing to help us maintain our social media, recruit new writers, edit pieces, or respond to emails. On top of that, she has failed to keep her (multiple) promises of giving me Slack emails so that I can carry her weight and recruit more writers. She has also failed to even post the ""several"" Instagram posts she promised she had finished. It's not like I'm asking her to do a lot. I'm only asking her to carry just 20% of the weight. Things like sending over Slack emails or responding to my text messages aren't that hard to do. In addition, whenever I'm successful in getting a new partnership or whatnot and I text the groupchat, she always responds with ""yay!!"", or ""sorry :( I don't think that's a good idea"" when I ask them a question. Why does she think her opinion matters when she doesn't even contribute 1 minute of her time a week?

Along with that, Nora's only job is to edit the article submissions that we get (which are very few). However, she can't even take the time out of her day to do so, even after giving her word. It always ends up with me not only carrying her weight, but also Nellie's and then some more.

I'm pretty heated right now so I probably sound a little aggressive, which might make you wonder if my attitude is the problem. However, I can assure you that I'm very level-headed and reasonable with them and have stopped texting once they stopped responding (so it's not like I'm badgering them with texts).

What do I do? Normally, I'm a pretty upfront person, however I find it hard to confront them about this for some reason. While their inability to help out hasn't directly hurt the project, I'm getting tired of having to balance my already hectic life with this project that I'm passionate about.",28Aug2020,1

Roommate B makes me feel unsafe because he is very aggressive, says things that aren’t true about us when he tries to argue with us, and loudly complains about us on the phone calling us bitches and selfish.

He has threatened to make excessive noise to show our new next door neighbor (who he calls a fucking bitch) who’s boss I guess. The way he puts his energy into malicious action makes me really wary of what else he would want to do.

We just want him to turn off the lights when he leaves a room, lock the door when leaving/entering the house, don’t park his loud car (no muffler) too close to the house since it wakes us up and makes the house vibrate, clean up after himself in the kitchen, and don’t blow up on us in the group chat when we ask everyone to remember to do these things.

He believes we (A, C and D) are heavily policing him because he is white and we are asian or half asian. He called it a cultural difference. But we’re all pretty american and only speak English. But we really just expect everyone to clean up, be respectful, don’t burn out the bulbs and lock the doors for safety.

So he has blown up on us via group chat several times and is constantly targeting the person who has lived here the longest, roommate C. C and D have lived for the 2-3 years with B and said he’s always been this way.

Both me and C feel unsafe, find B mirroring abusive ex boyfriends (C is gay male), and just feeling super trapped. We can’t address anything without B blowing up and calling us names. B has been going on road trips to escape our house so I actually haven’t lived with him for more than 3 weeks. I haven’t complained much. I try to keep to myself.

We don’t want him to become homeless but I’m scared to leave my room right now. He can’t afford rent higher than what he currently pays (~400/mo) and it’s a pandemic rn. He doesn’t have a job.

What can I do? Where do I have control in my own life? I wanna stay safe and I don’t wanna our anyone at risk, whether it be B or me and the rest.",28Aug2020,1
64,"TLDR: Boyfriend visited hometown for the first time in 10 months, we had a fight, said we needed to talk then he told me he wanted to break up and was at his breaking point, we decided to wait until Sunday for final decisions. How do I deescalate the situation and save my relationship?

For reference, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years

Two days ago my boyfriend and I had a fight. He is currently on vacation in his hometown after 10 months of working. He had gone to a party, which was fine, I gave him space and everything (in our hometown COVID, is not currently a problem.) Two days later I asked him who was at the party and he listed off a few names. Come two days ago, I learned this girl I did not like at all was at the party (my boyfriend had a thing for her before we dated and I haven't met her). I understood why she was there because they have the same friend group. I was upset with my boyfriend for leaving her out. I didn't know what to do and we had a disagreement. No harsh words were said, and during the disagreement, I also learned that he and she were taking a day trip to another town with their other friends. I was upset because I felt like there was no communication, and because I would of like to known she was involved in those things. Now while I trust my boyfriend very much, it seemed suspicious to me because normally he is very good at telling me these things.

Now yesterday, I was still mad from the fight that we had had. So for the majority of the day, I had left him alone to do what he wants to do. At the end of the trip, I messaged him that we needed to talk, because I wanted to sort through the fight and come to an understanding. He said he was kind of thinking that too. Because he was stuck in traffic and I had a lot of anxiety, I wanted to start the talk while he was on his way home. He kept trying to push the talk until he came back from his vacation, and I was trying to at least pinpoint his problem so I could calm down and not let my mind spiral. And here is where I began making mistakes. Instead of giving him space, I had messaged him more. I had asked him what he wanted to talk about and he said ""us"". And to me that was weird. So I had asked him if he wanted to break up with me or if he said he wanted to talk about the fight. He said I don't know, maybe. My mind was racing 100 miles an hour because I did not think our fight was big enough to justify a breakup, we just needed to talk it out. Then I asked him and made sure to clarify that I just needed to ask these questions because of anxiety (I have an anxiety disorder, and I have had poor mental health for the past 2-3 weeks) and I asked him if something happened at the party, or if there was someone else. He said no, and as the conversation continued I learned that he was unsure about the relationship and if he wanted to be with me. I also learn that he is tired and does not want to have the talk that day, and still wants to wait until it is in person. I tell him I do not think I can wait that long.

Now fast forward to when he gets home. He got home late at night and was tired. But I still pushed him to talk, which in hindsight was a big mistake. Rather than talking over the phone, we ended up texting and he was angry with me. And he told me that he wanted to break up. I was shocked but, I understand. He told me he does not think we are a good match because we have come close to breaking up multiple times and have broken up once this summer. I do not agree with this because I believe that every couple fights and with time our fights have changed. They have become less frequent and each time we fight we have attempted to come to a problem and work at the problem. He also told me about how I had ruined the trip with that fight, and that he did not want to fight. This trip was important to him, but I ruined it because I couldn't trust him. He felt as if I did not respect him enough to let him sleep before having this talk. And that he was at his breaking point. I managed to convince him to not make any emotionally charged decisions for now, and not to break up. We have a talk coming up on Sunday night where we have to make decisions about our relationship. I also told him that I was sorry for being selfish, and hoped that he would enjoy the rest of his trip. I also told him that I wouldn't message him until he got back from the trip but if he wanted to talk casually or just check in with me, I would be open to it.

Now, I understand what I have done wrong, and I really do not want to break up with my boyfriend. I have been putting in efforts to change things (habits) that bother him. I am worried though that I have pushed him too far last night by forcing him to talk to me.

So please, does anyone have any advice about how to save my relationship and repair the problems I have caused? Or how do I deescalate things from this breaking point?",28Aug2020,1
65,"my bsfr got a boyfriend. he doesn’t go to our school but obviously, i wanted to meet him. she wouldn’t really let me, so we kind of compromised. we made a bet of sorts - if i could get a bf [in a week] we could go on a double date. (we had no covid cases for 100+ days at the time - we weren’t in lockdown). 

i started thinking abt who would be the best person to ask. i wanted to use this to my advantage. if i got rejected, i could say it was js to meet her bf, but if i didn’t, then we could.. so i asked someone i liked. 

the person i decided to ask wasnt from school either. we’re both part of the same religious group but tht meant we only see each other twice a week. we’ve known each other ever since we were 5.. so i trusted him. (but he did go to boarding schl in the US, so we weren’t together all the time)

but we suddenly had more covid cases, and went into lockdown once again. tht kind of gave me the guts to ask him. long story short, it went well. i kinda gave him two options, we could go for practical reasons, or we could do it genuinely. he said he wasn’t super ready, but he wanted to get to know me better so we decided on “a little bit of both” (his words, not mine loll). 

a few days later, he kind of took back his words saying tht he wasn’t ready for a relationship but he’d be happy to accompany me to the picnic. i told him i understood and we left it at tht. 

keep in mind, even thought we were childhood friends, we didn’t know a lot ab each other. but the people around him all said he was super nice, and since he started uni at 16, i didn’t think otherwise. 

a lot had happened since we last saw each other, i went through anxi*ty, d*pression, and a lot of it changed the way i operated. so i decided to tell him about it all. big mistake. he told me tht i was being too detailed. and tht he didn’t like it. i didn’t know what to say. i had told my bsfr he was different to the guys tht had did sh*t to me. i was so wrong. being the protective friend she is. she texted him, saying tht it was hard for me to open up, it’s not smth i do often, so tht would mean i trusted him, she wrote a whole*ss paragraph and he replied with: 🤾‍♀️ js tht. 

afterwards he texted me. saying he wouldn’t come to the picnic anymore. 

i didn’t want to lose him, so i js said “cool cool” 
he responded: “Sorry things are hard for you. You’re very sturdy. Keep up the positive attitude matey”
i didn’t want him to think i made my friend say those things so i said: “sigh also fyi, my friends don’t act on command, they act on their own will so think what u will but i’ve said what i’ve said”
he said it was understandable 
and i said: “lastly, i’m not super mad at u so pls don’t make things awkward at fs ty”
him: “Make everything the same”

my fears came true. i didn’t want to ask him at first in case i lost a friend. i don’t like opening up for fear of judgement. no apology either. had i risked it all for nothing? did i js lose a childhood friend tht i cared ab so much? i was hurt, then angry. lockdowns being lifted and i’m seeing him in a few days. i don’t know what to do, or why he responded like tht. i don’t know if it’s due to smth i don’t know abt.. have any of u had any experiences like this? advice would be appreciated :)

thank you and stay safe &lt;3",28Aug2020,1
66,"We have been broken up for four years. 

We speak every other day and y’all on the phone once every week for hours at a time. We have all the same ideas. He says he wishes he could find someone like me who is active as him and someone who pushes him to be better like I always did. 

He says he really really enjoys talking to me. We have a little book club where we read books and discuss together.

We broke up cause we were immature and had built up resentment instead of working on issues. My ex refused to get back into the cycle of breaking up and getting together and said he wanted time apart to mature and grow as people so we wouldn’t just get back together and have the same issues.

I asked if it was fixable and he kind of scoffed at me and didn't respond then he went in to point out everything wrong with it and said no, it isn't. I voiced that I was upset because the item had some slight sentimental value to me, in that I'd gotten it years ago for my eldest child. He went to work and right before he left I said that he was taking out his frustrations because he can't walk through the house because I'm a hoarder. Which isn't true in either account and I texted him saying that it was bullshit. Sure our house isn't the tidiest fucking place but it isn't just my fault and he started going off about how I won't let him get rid of anything (false) and any time he brings up anything ""it was eldest child or middle child's"" so I can't get rid of it WHICH IS NOT FUCKING TRUE and I told him that the issue is actually that when I try to go through things I wind up doing the dishes and the laundry and the cleaning and if I even fucking finish those things, I don't have the energy to do anything else once I'm done and he says bullshit, and then throws in my face that I don't have custody of my other kids and when I got upset because he knows that hurts me he called me and said ""how about you fucking so something or I'm leaving you and I'll most likely get custody"" so now I'm just rage fucking throwing things into boxes that were originally intended for fucking donating that I was already fucking working on but now I'm so fucking tempted to just throw out EVERYTHING including his fucking computer and Vita and switch and Xbox and no, not just his shit, but all of mine too, everything.

69,"So last weekend, I went to drive to work at 6:30 am, and my car was making bad sounds and letting out a ton of smoke. I left it there for a few days, finally got around to towing it to a body shop, and, whelp. Turns out some dude got down and dirty with a Sawzall and stole some parts out of my engine.

Obviously insurance is now involved, I’ve filed a police report, etc. But I’ve never had parts stolen out of my engine before, and I’m currently pretty paranoid about it happening again.

If I get a dashcam/rear cam setup, I’ll have a recording of action around my car that is portable. I can take it to work (I park in an open-air lot downtown), too. A doorbell or house cam might be more logistically complicated, since I am renting my house, but it would make my driveway (the location where my car was vandalized) more protected. I’m pretty sure a motion-activated driveway cam is also cheaper than a nice car setup.

Other than occasionally scrolling r/IdiotsinCars, I know fuck-all about either dashcams or home security. More educated redditors, do y’all have any thoughts?",28Aug2020,1

71,"I'm a 24 year old male, who has had the same circle of friends since I was around 17. We've all had some great times together but nothing really ground breaking or ""moments we'll never forget"" kind of stuff. We mostly play PC games together, meet up to smoke/eat/drink and talk to eachother online. 

Until about a year ago, I've started to get really annoyed by their actions. I'm all for banter and having a joke in the group. But it feels as if its been directed at me a lot more often recently (and when I think about it in the past aswell). I tried to laugh and joke and ignore it, but some of it is hurtful, extremely repetitive and annoying. It almost feels as if im back in a highschool lunch room or something every time I speak to them. 

Im going through some stuff at the moment so when i do clap back I only ever really clap back with light stuff, nothing too personal or offensive, but they really dig in when it comes to me. They joke about my mental condition, the fact that I'm underweight, my poor luck with the opposite sex. Anything from my failures right down to my insecurities. Whenever I call them up on it, they tell me I'm being a baby, and that its all just a joke and that if I don't like it I can fuck off. But it's gotten to the point were I can never have a serious conversation with any of them anymore and I end up muting my mic to nearly pull my hair out or cry at the senseless barrage they give me everyday. 

I don't ever try and make myself a target, I'm always nice and try to have a positive attitude, despite my depression. But they always find some way to twist what I do and say into something bad or hilarious. Its gotten to the point were I'm avoiding them, having day dreams about hurting them and its lead to me to loathe some of them enough ive picked out distinct things that annoy me about each of them and I'm never normally like this with anyone I consider a friend. 

Should I cut them off? Or keep trying to make it work? As I said I'm 24 and I'm not exactly an out going guy so finding myself another friend group would be a challenge. And I'm not even sure if its me, if im the one being the asshole and making them act like this towards me :(",28Aug2020,1
72,"I was doxxed on discord 3 years ago. Its a 18+ server I (Stupidly) messaged a video of me masturbating to another user (my face isn't shown in the video). In addition to that, I got into a heated argument with another member of the server who then almost doxxed me, and the other user sent him the video of me masturbating. The other guy was able to confirm my identify, and now has possession of the video.

Its been 3 years, and the guy still mentions the event in the server every month or so. This guy is a total no lifer, he spends his entire day on discord, the server is basically his life. Im not worried of him exposing the video outside of discord because I can tell he's terrified of the real world. He doesn't have the balls to do anything like that considering he will face a massive fine and jail time. I believe the video won't leave discord.

He could easily find out where I work because when you google my name it comes up with the firm I work at (which is very prestigious), so if he does act on it, the companies lawyers will be all over him.

79,I (16M) had a female friend (16F) in middle school. We became extremely close and our parents began to know each other. It’s to the point where her mom trust me with her whenever we hangout (she’s the overprotective mom calling every min when she hangs with other people). That is fine but when we went to high school we went to different schools so we kinda saw each other less. Although we would meet every month or so. So here is where the problem starts. During covid I just had this feeling that I really liked her. And truly this wasn’t because of her looks! Although she is fabulous I really liked her personality. I believe she and I were compatible. So here’s what happened for the first time I gain courage and expressed my feelings. She was surprised but slowly let me down. I understood and left it at that. But then I just felt bad because I should not have broken the relationship by confessing. The issue is this rejection made me just look at myself and judge myself. What’s worse is that she wants to be friends and I saw who she likes. So of course I would be a little jealous. So I just want to ask what to do in this situation. Because she says she wants to travel with me and she said that we would be friends for a long time. I said that I don’t feel like our friendship will last because of how I feel about her.

81,"tl;dr I was raped by my brother who is my boyfriend’s friend and I still live with him. Is it wrong to be civil towards my brother and should I tell my boyfriend? 

I’ve been thinking about posting here to seek some advice, because this part of my life I usually keep hidden away. It’s not that I’m trying to bury it, but I’m worried that I might be wrong when it comes to my choices. This whole situation has made my life growing up extremely difficult, but I will say that I am a much happier person these days. I’ve moved forward and continue to move forward. I’ve accepted this as something that has happened to me and have overcome *most* of my problems, such as depression. But I am here to ask if what I’m doing is right, so here is my story.

Today, I am a 20 year old female. As a child (roughly ages 7-10, I have trouble remembering my childhood) I was raped by my brother (10-13 at the time) most nights, if not every night. I would rather spare everyone the details, as it is unpleasant both to hear and relive. I just remember being too scared and confused about what was happening, so I would pretend to be asleep and just wait it for to be over. Hopefully, it wouldn’t happen again, but it kept happening. I never said a word to my parents out of fear they wouldn’t believe me and because I felt expected to protect him - he was family. My parents raised me always telling me to stick by my brother, no matter what. I also lived in a verbally abusive household where my parents would constantly argue (my father was the verbally abusive one). At 11, my mother confessed that my father used to choke her when we were younger, which only traumatized me even further.

In middle school, I realized I was very depressed but I didn’t know why, because I’d blocked out all of these events. I didn’t face the reality of them until I was about sixteen years old. In seventh grade, I began having suicidal thoughts, but I never said anything to anyone. In my first year of high school, I had my first anxiety attack in the middle of the hallway on my first day and then anytime I felt anxious, I’d pull out my eyebrows (trichotillomania, which I still suffer from mildly). When my mother discovered that I was doing this once my eyebrows were nearly all gone, she was extremely angry with me and threatened to send me to a psych ward if I didn’t stop among other insults. 

When I was 14, I met a 21 year old guy who, long story short, manipulated the fuck out of me. I never did anything with him, but he asked for pictures and told me he would leave his girlfriend for me when I was older. His girlfriend was an actual psycho who’d called me at 6 am to scream insults at me and told me to stay away even though they had an open relationship. This girl was 23 and also asked me if I wanted to have a threesome with them. Fun fact, when I was 17 and a senior and trying to get closure through text from this guy, she called me from his phone and said all sorts of horrible things, telling me to stay away from him again. I couldn’t get a word in and she didn’t pay attention when I said I wanted nothing to do with either of them.

 When I was 16 and a junior, I faced my family for the first time and told them that I was depressed and occasionally had suicidal thoughts. They didn’t understand, got angry and asked how I could possibly think of killing myself if I had a life as luxurious as mine. They said depression was for ‘sick people’ and I was not sick, and that going to therapy was not an option because I would turn into a drug addict if they prescribed me medication. They don’t believe in therapy or medication.

After that happened, I met a fortunate friend that helped me see the world in a new light (still 16) and I decided, angrily, that I wasn’t going to let any of them win. I was going to try one last time to be happy. It took me a long ass time, but I can confidently say at 20 years old that I have healed, for the most part. I no longer let any of these events control my life. I’m happy, I have friends, a supportive boyfriend, I’m attending university.

But I still live at home, so this is where the advice comes in. I still live with my brother. My parents leave me alone now, but they’re nicer as well. They still argue, my dad is still an ass. A few months ago he put his hands on my mother for the first time in years and I stood up to him, but he is still here because of my mom wanting his financial support. My dad occasionally blows up, but it’s rarer and he only yells. I don’t like that he’s still here, but my mom has her reasons.

My brother’s girlfriend has lived with us for a year. He’s 25 and she’s 19. They met online when she was 14, so there’s that. My brother was also really good friends with my current boyfriend when they were in high school. I met through them, actually, by playing games online. 

So here are my questions.

Is it wrong of me to stay civil towards my brother? I’m never close with him but he always tries to talk to me and get me to play games with him and his girlfriend. He always tries to share funny stories. I listen, but barely respond. If it were up to me, I would avoid having him be a part of my life. I’m not a family person. But I can’t bring myself to say no to future family gatherings, if he were to ask. I’ve played my part for years and to suddenly cut him out would bring up a lot of drama. I don’t want to bring this situation up to him or any of them, ever. I’ve moved on. So is it wrong of me to be civil towards him? Should I invite him to my wedding? Should I go to his? Would I even attend his funeral? I haven’t seen him as my brother in a long time. I’m just numb towards him. There’s no hate, no love, no anger, no disgust, no grudge, nothing. I think he’s a sick person and that’s it, because who does what he did?

Should I ever tell my boyfriend? He knows that I was raped when I was young and he’s been incredibly supportive about it, but this was one of his best friends. They’re not as close anymore but they still joke around. My boyfriend knows that I don’t have a good relationship with my brother but doesn’t know why. I personally feel like it isn’t a good idea to tell him, but I also feel terrible keeping something from him, especially in the long run. I’m pretty sure I’m going to marry this guy, so I want to know if me not telling him is going to cause any issues down the road.

Does anyone have any tips on dealing with trichotillomania? It’s been almost 7 years now and while I don’t do it as severely as I used to, I still find myself pulling at my eyebrows without even noticing that I am. I don’t even know if I’m anxious when I’m doing it. I got my brows microbladed which helped a lot with my insecurity about them, but I’d still like to find a way to stop.

This one isn’t really advice, but more a concern. I can’t remember anything else about my life up until the age of 14. Everything else is blacked out. I have trouble remembering things that happened an hour ago and sometimes entirely forget them. Is this normal? I’ve heard of memory loss caused by trauma, but I don’t know how bad it gets.

I’ve had an immense lack of support and guidance my entire life, so I appreciate you all for being on this subreddit and taking the time to read and respond to my story. I’m sorry for sharing it, but it feels good to finally let it out.",28Aug2020,1
82,"This year has absolutely destroyed me. I had savings at the start of the year that i was planning on starting a business with. My student loan ended and because of lockdown wasnt able to get a job. So i had to start dipping into my savings. I requested to withdraw from uni because i'd rather be able to pay rent and eat than get a useless degree that my heart was never actually in. So Universal Credit told me i wasnt eligible for any assistance as well as my university hardship fund (pretty sure they just lied to me because nobody can enroll as early as May as you needed to be enrolled to be eligible) so i was in this sort of libo state where i was both a student but not one. It got to the point where i might as well just continue on and get my student loana nd use that to pay off the debt i racked up. Moved to a flat that was almost twice as cheap as where i was before. I cant move in with my mum because the stress from living with her is actually ten times worse than the stress of this. So that's not an option. Today i had a meeting with my personal tutor about continuing my studies but apaprently because the board already decided i graduate, this is not possible? despite the fact i never handed in a withdrawl form. So Im being left out to dry again. I went through the stages of grief today but now im back to being angry. Like just pure rage. My personal tutor made me do an extra year because of her own mistake so i emailed my student union about what recourse i have for that. Which i guess im doing as revenge for her fucking up my life prospects. She sat there with a straight face trying to tell me ""we've all gone througha  difficult time"" as if she wasnt being paid? Then was like ""when i was at uni i had multiple jobs to support myself"" like yes bitch but there was a literal lockdown this year? I know what i have to do. I have to get a job but i just cba. Like why? I dont have any energy. Ive been lying in bed all day which has made me feel even worse. All of this for a uesless degree in combined studies that i ddint even plan on using. I requested to leave for financial reasons that ended up fucking me even harder financialy lol. If i hadnt requested to leave, i would be just as poor but i'd at least have a student loan coming in next month that would help me get back on my feet. Savings gone. Owe a shit tonne to people. No motivation to try and fix it. Even thoguh i obviously want to try and fix it. Ive found myself increasingly considering suicide, even though i think there is a 0% chance i will actually follow through on it. It's not something that has ever been on my mind before. It's just shit.

84,"Me and my current girlfriend have been together for roughly a year now. I am utterly obsessed with her and I love her to death and I’d like to believe she feels the same way. However a few months back we split up for a month because I caught her texting a dude planning to meet up. I immediately left as I thought I was lucky to see those texts before it happened. And she chased me HARD for a month. Constantly apologising and offering various gifts and stuff to myself and my parents. I took her back and now things seems different. She always is suspicious I’m cheating or texting girls behind her back. I believe this is a guilt in her subconscious mind trying to make herself feel better about something she has done in the past and gotten away with?

87,"If anyone here lives alone with severe anxiety/panic disorder, how do you do it? I want to move out, I'm living with extended family because my parents died but they don't understand my mental condition and pretty much have shunned me, and I can't move with other family since I started university in this state already and I'm 3 semesters in, I can't just throw it away (I'm 22 already), so I want to rent a room and live alone.

The issue is that I have severe health anxiety (hypochondria), every day I have a panic attack because something feels odd (doesn't help I have a pretty bad dust allergy that sometimes makes me wheeze and that makes me panic and you know the rest). Sometimes when that's not the trigger, I still have out of nowhere panic attacks if I'm feeling too manic or whatever, sometimes I feel all weak and drowsy because of anxiety and that too detonates a panic attack because I feel like I'm gonna pass out. Anyway, some of you must know the deal, anxiety feels awful and I'm not sure how someone can cope with living alone like this. When I feel bad I usually go nearby my family members (without telling them anything or they get angry) and that kinda calms me down, but if I'm alone I'm not sure what I will do, I don't have any plan except go outside and lay down and hope I don't die and if I begin to die someone will notice and help me or something.

I tried medication but that makes me unable to drive and I need to drive to school, and honestly it just feels awful being drugged up. I hate taking medicine, it makes me paranoid as well.

Her company feels exhausting and she feels more like a responsibility than someone to talk to. I feel like i’ve moved on mentally and emotionally.

She takes everything very personally and also has bad mental health (possibly a mental illness although it was never officially diagnosed). She clings to me in public so i don’t know what to do.

I honestly just want to find my own space where there's no issues and I can just live my life in peace without hearing someone tell me some shit that's wrong with me.

As an example of what I mean, I'm in college and I literally started studying outside of class for the first time IN MY LIFE about a week ago because I assumed it would be boring and then made it seem like doing it would be hell. I demonized pop music so much that when I actually found a few decent pop songs I was so ashamed that instead of adding them to my main playlist I created a whole other private playlist on youtube so no one would see it. Because I'm sometimes bad at knowing how to reply to people I talk to I instead ghost them all day and dont reply until really late at night even when I already know what I'm going to say.

108,"sorry for misspellings english is not my first language

Just before the beginning of quarantine I lost my mother, it was a very horrific death that mentally destroyed me and my disabled brother that was living with her.
With the Corona virus around, it led into me resigning my job, taking care of the funeral costs alone without being able to see her for the last time, filling expensive paperwork to become the caregiver of my brother, and fly him out asap to the country I currently live.
 Most of my native friends found out about how it happened due to it being on the local news, so almost everyone tried to give the best emotional support they could.
 The team at my old workplace called me in as soon as offices reopened, they understood the situation and offered me a lower position to put me back on my feet which I will forever be grateful for.
 However, despite all the support, I, for obvious reasons, still feel very drained. I struggle to do/understand daily tasks, but I am still trying my best. Both me and my brother are now on therapy sessions and I have started taking antidepressants to deal with it all.
 During the whole thing, I start to text back and forth with an old friend of mine.
 A little bit of a backstory if it helps; me and this guy used to ""fool around"" during college; that being almost a decade ago and never leading to actual sexual activities.
 He asks how I am doing, tells me that he has no problem with me opening up to him if I want to. I cut it short, and the conversation goes dead in a matter of days. 
 Last week he suggests, if not announces that he is willing to visit me on Friday evening. He says, quote;
 ""I miss hanging out with you""
 ""I want to lighten up your mood.""
 ""I really want to make you feel better."" 
 I have translated these messages the best way I can to avoid misunderstandment. 
 Out of good intentions I agree, thinking it will be best for my mental health to go out and have some fun.
 I then ask him where he's staying (for the night) he abruptly responds; ""Yours?"" 
 I quickly turn it down, say sorry and explain that after the incident my brother, who's living with me, does not feel comfortable around strangers.
 He completely understands and says he will be making reservations then.
 On Thursday I ask him about time and what hotel he has booked. He sends me a screenshot of the booking and his train arrival. I search up the location and agree to meet him at a nearby bar so that he doesn't have to walk too much. 
 Friday arrives, we meet up, greet briefly and set down at the bar. He orders drinks, invites me to drink too so I can feel better but I can't (meds).
 I end up being on the verge of tears, looking away from him so he can't see my glassy eyes and fake laughing at his jokes not to make him feel bad.
 This goes on for a while and then, out of nowhere, this guy starts nuzzling my neck and literally rubbing my private parts through my jeans. 
 I immediately pushed him off and stood up. 
 When I looked at him he was more surprised then I was. I took my bag and left.
 While running home, he tried to call me but I shut down my phone.
 I ended up taking a shower and crying myself to sleep, convinced that he took advantage of me and my situation. The messages I read next morning truly put me in denial.
 After texting me ""wtf was that for"" and three missed calls, he had sent a lengthy message about how he was ""sorry if he made any wrong moves"", that he ""didn't mean to scare me"" but what really drove me crazy was when he said that he ""thought we had agreed on it(having intercourse) (??!!)"".
 He mentioned how he had said that he ""wanted to make me feel better"" in THAT way, that it was ""obvious on the hotel booking screenshot that the reservation was for two people"".
 He had also taken note of the fact that I wanted to meet him near the hotel, hinting at the end, that I led him on.
 I am beyond confused, as in NONE of our conversations sex was mentioned, not by text, nor at the bar.
 I feel stupid, I am really doubting myself and re-reading our texts again and again to help  understand but I am at complete loss.
 I need help. I need opinions because my mind is not sane enough to handle and process all of this right now. I feel abused and guilty at the same time.
 I don't know what to do. Did I lead this guy on or is he crazy?",28Aug2020,1
109,"I tried to post this on r/autism but it got removed. I don’t really know the right way to ask this so I am sorry if I come across as uninformed and this might be long. I would just like some insight into my friend’s perspective. In a nutshell, sometimes he can be very intense and I don’t know how to react. I know you are probably going to say treat him like you would any other person but please hear me out.

So, I am a female in my early 20’s and a guy I went to school with has recently started messaging me again. He has autism and was generally made fun of in school because of it (this will be relevant later). We were never really close in school because we were in different classes, but I would chat to him when I saw him and he would often message me online and I thought (still think) he’s a really nice guy. He was kind of like a 50 year old in the body of a teenager. 

So here is my problem. When I spoke to him in person, everything was cool. However, whenever he messages me, it’s a little intense. He messaged me for the first time in years the other day and after the general hi how are you stuff, he sent me a long paragraph about how he’s missed me and loves talking to me etc. basically just a paragraph full of compliments. I thought it was nice but I didn’t really know what to say so I just basically said thanks, I enjoy talking to you too. Then he sends me another long paragraph basically saying “sorry, I’m probably being weird, it’s just I like talking to you and people were horrible to me in school so I keep myself to myself, I don’t have any confidence *crying emojis*”. The messages are a lot longer than this but that’s the gist. This happened within the first 10 messages. Now our conversations are basically a mixture of normal conversation, with these paragraphs thrown in every few messages. Basically it is a constant cycle of he will tell me how great he thinks I am and then profusely apologise for ‘being weird’.

Again I am sorry if I come across as uninformed as I know everyone is different but I don’t know if this is something linked to his autism or if he just happens to be someone who is very intense. Does he just need someone to listen? What does he want me to say? It almost feels like with the nice paragraphs, he’s trying too hard and not speaking to me like a real human. 

Now he’s asking me to go away with him for a weekend in a town that is miles away. To be honest, I would actually go, but my problem is I’ve never actually hung out with this guy properly and I feel like I don’t know his personality (I like when he’s talking “normally” to me but I honestly don’t know what to say when he sends these long paragraphs, I can’t work him out and I worry it’d be really uncomfortable if this happened in person ( I have an anxiety disorder, I’m not just being a bitch)). I know people are different but could anyone give me any insight into what’s going on in his head? I honestly can’t work it out. Also, how do I say to him “please stop being so intense and just be yourself, it feels like you are trying too hard”, without damaging his confidence even more?

Thank you",28Aug2020,1

I had to brace the metal scaffolding that holds up the canopy with my neck/shoulder and lift it simultaneously with my legs and arms. Doing so put a lot of pressure on my neck and I had to strain extremely hard to get this old rusty pole to move just a few inches. 

Once the pole was in place my legs locked up and my vision went very dark and I couldn't hear much. It was like I was underwater. I dont have a clear recollection of this but my brother told me I stumbled backwards, fell to the ground and supported myself with my arm. I was unresponsive to him calling my name. I was just staring off into the distance. The next thing I remember was pushing myself to my feet and my back and heck hurting like crazy. 

My boss saw me crying later due to the pain and just told me to take it easy for the rest of the day but when I mentioned I had hurt myself putting up the tent he just walked away. He ignored my explanation when I told him about it immediately after it happened.

We are severely understaffed right now due to covid-19 limitations and he has been stressing the importance of making sure we can work every day for the next two weeks in 9 to 11 hour shifts.

117,"So I (23f) recently moved into my first place alone away from home which comes with its own anxieties and difficulties. Once my job started, although remote, I started to adapt to everything and things started to get easier and I’ve been enjoying having my own place and being on my own. My neighbor has been pretty terrible with noise- blasting music with a bass speaker so it thumps my whole apartment which gives me mega anxiety cuz it sounds like when my heart beats in my ears and I can feel the thumping through my whole body no matter the headphones/fans/earplugs I use. Just to not be able to escape a loud noise makes me super anxious for some reason. I’ve been here for 3 weeks and he’s thrown a party every weekend where they play craaaazy loud music that shakes my apartment and everyone is basically screaming at the top of their lungs. Oh and this also goes on from like 4pm to 2am. My job is also working with kids and he’ll blast music in the middle of the day where I’m not able to concentrate which is super important. 

One night when he was playing music at 12am I went over there and knocked and basically before I could say why I was there, he was like “oh sorry I’ll turn it down” and was super chill about it. About a week later when they had a party, I didn’t wanna go over there with all the people due to COVID so I left a sticky note on his door politely asking them to keep it down. It was ignored. Finally I had to ask the property manager to get involved and they said that they sent him a notice and to let them know if the noise continues. That lasted for 4 days and then he blasted music all this evening. I banged on the wall a few times and nothing happened so I assumed he couldn’t hear me. A little later and no change, I banged a little harder and immediately he banged on the wall back at me then turned the music even louder. Now I’m too scared to face him because he seems volatile (he OFTEN yells on the phone and sounds unstable) and obviously doesn’t seem open to changing his ways. It sucks because I bet if I were a guy I wouldn’t have this fear, but since I’m a young woman living alone I need to be careful about stepping on peoples toes. 

I’ve lived in other apartments and can deal with noise since it evidently comes with the territory of living in an apartment, but the way he blasts music and the bass thumps and shakes my room just really makes me feel uncomfortable that I really can’t take it. When it’s during the day, I can’t focus on my job, and when it’s at night I can’t sleep. It’s affecting my ability to function. Our lease states that you can’t be loud and obnoxious and disturb other residents, but my goal is to not get him kicked out. It feels hopeless because I don’t see how we can come to an understanding since he obviously doesn’t give a shit about anyone around him. Should I just suck it up? Is this normal?

118,"I don’t want any biased answers here. If you’re not going to be helpful then exit. Back in June, my best friend and I were debating about the whole black lives matter movement. Let’s just say she found out I have opposing views than her and she was not happy about that. She had posted on her instagram that she was going to drop friends of hers who didn’t support BLM. I thought since she knew me for years she wouldn’t treat me that way. 

Anyways, after that conversation ended, I figured I would ask her a question a couple days after. She ignored two of my messages. I sent her a long heartfelt message a couple days later.  But to make it short, towards the end I said, “If I don’t get a response back from you, I’m going to assume you’re dropping me as a friend.” Two hours passed by and no response. While I was waiting for a response, she was posting on her instagram story almost every 25 minutes. So no excuse... I know she saw my message. After that we didn’t talk for a while until four days ago. 

Four days ago, I swallowed my pride and sent her a message first. I told her “we need to talk”. She replied saying she was at work. I replied back with explaining how I apologize for unfollowing her on social media, but how I thought she was wrong for what she did. She hasn’t responded back. Every time after we had a fight, we always responded back to each other. I think I’m losing my best friend of six years. I miss her a lot. Is she even a good friend for this?

He has a couple of nearly indestructible toys that he will chew on for a little while, but they just don't compare to chewing on a blankie. We've also tried the anti-chew sprays with no success.

I don't really care that he's tearing blankets up; I'm worried that swallowing the pieces will make him very sick. Sometimes he chews on them so much that he ends up throwing up and coughing. I've also seen pieces of blankets in his poop. I just don't want a piece to cause a blockage and end up with a trip to the vet, at best. He's my baby :(

I should also note that he doesn't chew on anything else besides his toys or blankets. He only chews on the blankets if someone is home with him. My boyfriend and I take the blankets away and give him a toy if we catch him, but this still hasn't stopped him.

Does anyone have any ideas that we haven't tried? He sleeps on the bed with us, so we can't put the blankets up away from him at night. How can we break this habit and replace it with something more healthy for him?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",28Aug2020,1
121,"We went on this trip with my moms friends family a month ago and this is what happened

About me: I’m 16M, never had a gf before, never even messaged a girl or asked for numbers because I’ve always been shy and haven’t had lots of crushes

Her friend also bringing her husband and two daughters (15) (18) (I’ll call them F1 and F2) I’ve known them since I was little and I would basically call them my sisters at this point because we known each other our whole lives. 

Anyways they unexpectedly announce that they will each bring a friend ( F3 which is 15 and F4 which is 16) ok, no big deal eight people in a small house for a week we probably already have Coronavirus. We are spending a week with them at this house on the waterfront. 

Since I’m shy and forgot my anxiety medication I don’t talk for like half the week. (This was my first time meeting F3 and F4) All of them are really sweet and great people it’s just that people aren’t my cup of tea. Us teens talked a little on the first day but I go quiet for 2 days and finally I break out on Wed halfway through the trip. We hangout on the beach and in this outdoor hot tub together all trip and talk about life everyone’s pretty calm and relaxed and we all have fun and like one another. 

Now F3 friend is really outgoing and always talking and laughing telling stories etc while F4 is more calm and shy like me (also good looking). 
A couple days go by and I’m starting to really like F4 (as a friend) even though we never talked one on one. Well suddenly it’s Fri the second to last day and by the end of the day I realize something. Do I like F4 or do I like like F4? She is super relatable, sweet, funny, shy, calm, good looking and essentially my dream girl (I would prefer to date a person similar to me). 

I wasn’t sure but what I was sure of was I was still nervous as hell to talk to her after a week. By Sat next morning we leave unexpectedly early without really saying goodbye to them but I did get the courage to ask for everyone’s IG and made a vacation group chat. On the car ride home they dm each other sending photos they took etc but F4 doesn’t chat really and neither do I. 

We go back home and by night time I realize I can’t stop thinking about F4, a feeling I’ve never had before. I’ve had small crushes in school and stuff but F4 is literally keeping me up all night thinking about her. I miss her already. I start to have thoughts about her (nothing sexual, which is weird for 16) like talking hanging out holding hands etc even though we barely talked throughout the trip. I think about her smile and how nice and perfect she was and by then I figure out maybe I love her?. 

A couple days go by and I get the courage to dm F4 on Instagram, nervous as hell I dm her however the conversation didn’t last long and I haven’t been on IG since (about a month). I decide that she probably isn’t into me since she did one word responses. We live in different states and I’ll see her next summer at soonest. 

How the hell do I stop thinking about a girl? I’ve tried different hobbies and keeping busy but nothing seems to work and it’s been a month. I don’t think she’s into me should I dm her a second time?",28Aug2020,1

125,"I’ve been seeing this guy for two months now and we always have a really good time when we’re together. 

Although, due to the pandemic, we obviously are separated a lot and have to resort to text and FaceTime.

I feel that he almost always contacts me at night and when I text him he answers with one word or doesn’t carry on the conversation. 

It hurts me to feel so desired when I’m with him and then so empty most of the time when we’re apart since he seems to put hardly any effort into talking to me. 

I have a pinch that he’s in love with my body and not me, but when I think about how I feel when we’re together it feels impossible to cut things off.

I feel like the best option IS to cut things off, but I just can’t. I don’t want to lose those sweet and loving moments:,( 

I’m just soo attracted to him whenever I see him, and just thinking about times we saw each other in person makes me want him with me. 

I also mentioned meeting up again and he was reluctant and made it seem like he didn’t want to.

127,"So I'm 24 and I've never really had major mental health issues. Never really been depressed or anxious. Entering adulthood I did struggle with drug and alcohol addiction but I'm sober now. I started therapy and it seemed to help with stress I had been feeling. I started feeling more stressed though. I started having trouble breathing randomly and now I'm terrified to be left alone. My boyfriend has called out of work for me. My boyfriend and I have a son together. He's 15 months old. 

A little over a week ago my boyfriend was exposed to covid at work. There is a major spike here. I couldn't breath and I was crying and couldn't focus. My boyfriend took me to the er and they ran test. They told me there was nothing physically wrong with me and it was probably a panic attack. We both tested negative so thank god for that. Even with that though I constantly feel on the edge of an attack. I can't eat or sleep. I have a constant fear one of us is going to die. I don't want to go back to work. I don't want to leave my apartment. My therapist gave me coping mechanisms but they don't work long. She recommended medication. I talked to a doctor about my options but there is one giant obstacle. I'm breastfeeding. My son does it a lot. She recommended one that was for sleep but it would make me dead to the world. Not an option co sleeping. The other one is safe for pregnancy but breastfeeding hasn't been studied as much. She said I can watch to see if my son seems different. I told her I would have to think about it. I need to get on with my life but I'm terrified all the time. Is there someone that would know more I can talk to? Can I call a pharmacists? I can't think. The only advice I get from my boyfriend is 'i love you and I support your decision' I can't focus enough to make a decision and he doesn't understand that.

128," First of all, I don't want to make her uncomfortable, and I understand being nice and engaging is part of being a cashier, but I feel like this may be mutual and is ok. This summer I've been working full time as a forklift operator across the street from a food market. During my lunch, I go over to the market and buy a sandwich and some snacks. At the market, there is one girl (18F) who is my age who also works full time. Every time I check out with my food she likes to be the one who operates the till. She will wave me over and tries to be the one who operates the till when I come over. We usually talk for maybe 2 minutes and once the manager told her to hurry up because we talked for a little too long at the till. I've gone to this market every weekday for the past 2 months and have talked to her every time. She is super sweet and has the prettiest light blue eyes. I've started to catch feelings for her. I feel like she also enjoys talking to me and perhaps there is some chemistry.

I was thinking of asking her out tomorrow. I was going to write a note that says, ""If you are interested"" followed by my phone number. I was just going to pass her this note while she gives me my receipt. I don't want to make her uncomfortable and I really don't want to make her feel cornered or anything.

I'm always saying, ""Oh, I'm just too lazy."" or ""I'm too tired."" when I face any sort of work, but deep inside there's this suffocating dread and hopelessness that just HURTS every single second of the day.

I really love her but it’s stressful being her friend. It’s awful randomly getting messages saying “I could fucking kill my self right now. No hesitation.”

To give you a better understanding of what I am talking about I was officially diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder aka Asperger's Syndrome at age 13 after I had a mental health breakdown one day and was admitted to my local mental hospital because I was a bit suicidal at the time, and originally I was told growing up by the school administration that I was mild mentally handicap with a communication disorder at a young age. Well because of this my mom had been declared my payee and have been on disability when I was in kindergarten as a result of that diagnoses and when I turned 18 the state made my mom my legal guardian should I do anything stupid, but to be honest I don't like being considered unfit to make my own choices. Anyway just a little while back with C19 happening I put on some weight and when I went to see my doctor I weighed in at 310lbs and that doesn't sit well with me because I lost 2lbs when I saw him and when I told my mom that she pretty much told me that I was going to have to lose that weight and that's what I have been doing and how did I do it? I run on a treadmill at first by burning 500 calories than it was 700 calories now today I was told by my mom that I was to burn 1000 calories in a hour and a half which to be honest I think that it's crazy because she's pretty much telling me that I need to be faster because I have a doctor's appointment that involves me to pretty much run non-stop so that they can monitor my heart because of some family history of heart disease on my dad's side of the family. So I pretty fell short by 200 calories because my caseworker had to leave and we already wasted enough time by doing some other stuff that we needed to get done then head to the gym and burn those 1000 calories in a hour and a half when the treadmill only lets you go an hour before a 5 minute cool down at the gym. And to be honest I'm pretty much not sure what to do anymore because my mom who can't really do much for medical reasons got mad at me for saying that she was off of her rocker for telling me what I was to burn calories wise when she can't even go upstairs anymore because of her lymphoedema and says ""I'm losing more weight than you fat ass"" which actually made me feel worse about my weight and my choices that got me to that weight. And to be honest she says she eats different foods than me and she takes meds for her own health problems and she also takes those apple cider vinegar pills on top of that and she pretty lives in her chair and some how I'm the one that gains weight for my bad eating habits. Sorry I just get so freaking upset at myself and my mom's way of thinking that I forget that I'm pretty much not going to be able to do much without somehow second guessing myself about me losing weight and my mental health and I also have to deal with my middle brother pretty putting me down when I have a moment and it makes me feel even worse about myself. So yeah that's my life in a long nutshell. I don't know what to do because every time I have a mental break I end up getting myself into trouble and showing my mom that she's right to treat me like a child dispite my many attempts to be better than her in a sense because to fair I'm pretty much an asshole for trying to get my mom to see things from my point of view and having my middle brother make me feel worse about the problems I'm sure that are stupid and not helpful. I don't know what to do anymore I pretty much gave up on myself by resigning to my fate and doing what my mom wants and whenever I try to rebel she punishes me by taking stuff away from me. What can I do in a legal sense to show her how much she and my middle brother make me feel like garbage? I really don't know what to do anymore at this point.

I haven't been doing anything recently. With covid happening, I tried to stay in contact with friends, but no one seems to want to talk to me (I guess I'm just irrelevant or something) and so I've been more lonely, and I've basically been doing nothing. I've literally been either lying on my bed, daydreaming, or, really, doing nothing. I made a resolution to try and begin reading books again (a hobby I had when I was younger), but I just never went through with it. I tried playing video games, something ive traditionally loved doing, but I haven't been able to do that either. I don't sleep until like 5 am, I'm not eating as much as I used to (ive lost a lot of weight, which isnt bad given i was fat, but i dont think ive lost my weight in a healthy way), and I have no motivation to do anything.


I was supposed to go to university this semester, but with covid classes are online, and so I deferred a semester so I could go on campus in january. I'm taking 3 community college courses to transfer over in the meantime. I can't even do anything for those classes. I try to push myself through it, but I just have no motivation. It's like I feel like I'm stuck in life, but any attempt to get unstuck doesn't work.



Idk, I feel like for as long as I can remember emotionally ive always felt, uh, not good. Like, unwanted, blah blah blah. I'm sick of this. I can't carry on doing this. I seriously can't. I fear my life will be over if it keeps on going down this track.



In all honesty idk what to do. My parents are nice people but when i tried to talk to them it feels like im getting lectured and so I stay quiet, but I feel like I'm going to burst. I feel like a pressure cooker. I've had angry outbursts before, and done things im not proud of, but I don't know, I just don't know what to do. I don't have anyone to talk to about my problems, so I feel like i have to bottle them up.



Idk what to do. I feel stuck. Like nothing is going to get better. I know complaining on reddit means nothing in the real world, but honestly idk what else to do.",28Aug2020,1

153,"Obligatory I’m on mobile.

Let’s start out at the beginning. I (M16) have an older half-sister (F19, now addressed as Linn) who I rarely got to see growing up. There was always bad blood between our two families, and we had many differences in upbringing. My sister’s family is very religious, mine is a very “choose your own” kind of place. That is fine, we respect their beliefs and they aren’t aware of ours.

Linn was brought up raising her siblings. Her mother treated her like a babysitter, and as a result Linn was never enrolled in school while she raised her six younger siblings. All of the rest of her siblings did, however, get to go to school. This has impacted Linn in many ways, such as her not graduating, developing social anxiety, and etc. She is also unvaccinated and as such is limited on where she can and cannot gain employment in the future (ie. No rabies, no polio, nothing). All of this is to highlight her past to give you an easier judgement at the end.

After a while Linn’s mother began to force her into thinking about employment in order to help her pay the bills (It should be aforementioned that Linn hadn’t yet been able to get her license as her mom hadn’t allowed her). It was at that point that Linn potentially realized her mother’s true colors and moved into our family. She has been here a while and has been enrolled into online schooling, sophomore level.

Recently, her mother came back into her life after a period of silence. As I said, they are very religious. This comes into play now. Linn’s mother has told her that it is the end of times, and as a result she has to come back home in case they have to leave. 

We have great reason to believe that her mother has ulterior motives. Recently, she has received a new job and has nobody to care for the kids. She also recently moved, just as we were planning to do, and as such believes us to be too far away (despite them having moved across the country at a time).

I’m torn. Is there anything I can do in this scenario except for let her go? Her mother might actually have the intent of traveling to a holy site in another country, or she may be looking for free child care. Either way I’m at a loss. So, Reddit, I turn to you for help: what should I say/do?",28Aug2020,1

I cannot STAND being milked like this. And the days I do have availability, they schedule me for 10hr days.

I’ve been talking and reconnecting with this girl I knew a while ago but lost contact with. We’ve been talking alottt for about several weeks now 


We were talking on DM at first for a couple days. Then she’s like “here’s my number if you’d rather text than this”   

The next morning I wake up to a text from her  asking me if I’d ever wanna go ghost hunting 

She hits me up everyday and we text everyday and talk all day about deep personal stuff and funny stuff and it feels nice. She asks me personal questions and send me memes and links to YouTube video she likes and sends me things she thinks I’ll find funny. She’ll text me about random things. She remembers previous things I’ve texted her about and will like bring them back up in conversation, it makes me feel like I’m actually being listened to. We’ve made plans to hangout soon 


Weird thing is though one time she was like “I’m free tmrw night and am having a party this weekend if you wanna come” but then she was like “I invited this guy I used to have a thing with but I kinda messed it up I’m surprised he’s coming haha he’s spending the night”


I asked my friends about it and they think it’s odd she’s spending so much time texting me if she has a thing with other people 


Then just tonight she sent me some deep romantic/depressing song lyrics she wrote....but then she was like “I’ve only shown a couple people i haven’t even close friends have seen it”

Why would she show me something so personal she doesn’t consider me a close friend lol

160,"I honestly don’t know where to begin. I don’t have the energy to explain it all, she’s wronged me a lot. But she is the first girl I’ve had love for and I’ve been with multiple women before. 

My life is exactly what you wouldn’t want it to be. Crippling depression / anxiety, PTSD, drug and alcohol addiction I picked up since being with her, thoughts of suicide on a daily basis but I really have no plans or thoughts of harming myself (or anyone). Getting out of my own head is near impossible for me, but I’m trying to change that. But I feel exhausted due to everything. 

I’ve never opened up to anyone how I have her, so I kind of feel stuck, especially with how pointless I view life. She promised she’d help me, by that just being more positive influence in my life, helping me get things together like maybe college, as she goes to one of the best universities in my state while I sit at my own place unemployed, uneducated, lost and empty. 

I guess that would’ve been the honeymoon stage, and I feel some regret for opening up to her and knowing so much about me. She consistently and constantly throws jabs at me like “Yeah, like you have anything to offer”. That was the last thing, and it wasn’t in the midst of a heated argument it was a casual thing. 

I’m sensitive, I’m not soft but I am sensitive. I’ve told her this, she said it’s okay and she likes that, but has also put me down for that and continues to do so. But because of that it just hurts me. I feel a punch in my chest. Then she’ll tell me she loves me. 

I really don’t know why I made this post. But as I said I just feel so hopeless in life that I just feel stuck with her. I almost can’t stand her yet the thought of life without her now drives me actually insane, and besides a brother I have no one. No real friends, parents as I just lost my mom, grandparents.

161,"I (24F) recently moved from the UK back to my home country, the USA. I was in the UK for years and I am now in the process of establishing residency in my state so I may possibly get in-state tuition. 

In the UK I had some hard knocks in terms of family related traumas. I was sexually abused as a child from ages 10-13 and because of this plus other things I've gone through, I have spent a lot, and I mean alot of time trying to piece myself back together. 

I attempted A-levels in the UK twice. Both times it didn't go well. I was having some serious problems with PTSD, Anxiety and Depression. I flunked out twice. 

I am really ashamed of it. I don't tell anyone and I have cut ties with most everyone I knew back then to avoid it coming up. It has made me feel like I'm completley stupid and incapable as a person. Like I couldn't hack it in the ""real world"". My Therapist at the time told me- when I was not doing well in school- that sexual abuse victims usually don't succeed academically and maybe I wasn't suited to do anything in university. That I should just seek employment and not worry about it. I dont know if she meant it to devastate me like it did- but it started to feel like I would never escape being anything but what happened to me. That I would never be ""useful"" as a person or have any success. 

Now, I really want to change this. I really would like to prove to my family (who do know I flunked) and myself that I can do it and that I could succeed in life. I have always wanted to persue a degree in veterinary medicine. My father is a veterinarian and my mother is a veterinary practice manager and consultant. I literally grew up in my Dad's clinic and I can't imagine doing anything else and being genuinely happy. All my work experiance has been veterinary related. I feel like if I just hadn't had the hard knocks and been so depressed I would have been okay as one point in school I was an A- A* (A+) student. 

Is there any point in going back now knowing that, if I persue my desired degree, I wouldn't graduate until I was 34-35 years old? That I would have a chance I wouldn't do well again? Would it mean missing out on other things like family and kids?",28Aug2020,1

A couple years after that she was diagnosed with a tumor that they thought would kill her, but has made a good recovery and is on her way to remission even given the grim diagnosis. 

She hasn’t dated much since her divorce and struggles with a mental illness. I want so badly for her to find someone but it seems unrealistic, which makes me even sadder. Being a housewife with no college degree for the duration of her marriage, she was only able to get a low paying job that she’s currently stuck in. I just found out the job has no retirement benefits and she has no savings due to all the medical bills and low wage. She does receive alimony but it’s not very much. I’m just terrified for her future and know that I’m very limited on what I can contribute to making it better for her. I’m working on paying off student loans and laying the very basic financial foundations for my post-college life, so I can’t even fathom setting aside the kind of money she’ll need.

170,"I’m so stupid. I think about this every shift I have. I had two job offers and I took the Lower paying one. I thought I would enjoy the lower paying job more and I thought the hours would be better. Instead, I miss working in a restaurant with a tighter team where I had to hustle for my money. I had deadlines and the better I did, the more money I made. Me and the other bussers vibed with each other and actually worked together to get shit done. Yeah the servers got mad at me sometimes and yeah I fucked some stuff up but this job just feels different. I feel bored every shift and when I get home its too late to do anything but too early to have that satisfaction of working late into the night and accomplishing hard work for good money. This is hard work but I just don’t feel the same satisfaction for some reason. It just feels different and I don’t know why. I know if I got another job I would regret working here and I would regret taking a stable $15/hr for granted. But I wish I took the other job and now I’m kind of stuck. If I took that job though I would have always wanted to see what my job now is like. I would have looked at the bad things in that job and wish I took this job despite the lower pay. I don’t know how to keep a positive attitude about this job. I miss bussing tables until midnight and coming home for the first time since waking up at 6am and cooking myself some shit for dinner. I usually say it sucked looking back on it but I kind of liked it at the time. I accomplished shit and I worked hard. I worked hard in school and I hustled for my money. 

Something just doesn’t feel right with this job. I’m not getting satisfaction. Maybe it’s cause it doesn’t have the wonder that a fist job holds. Maybe it’s because I’m working most days of the week instead of just weekends. How do I avoid regretting taking this job and thinking about it as somewhat of a pain in the ass to work it.

If you made it this far thank for listening to my thoughts and my reflection of this past year in my life. Just realizing now it’s about one year ago in a week from when I got hired at my first job. What a year it’s been. Here I am almost in tears after watching my childhood play in my mind as a movie, fleeting through my fingertips. All those satisfied nights. All those nights where I missed out on hanging out with people to hustle. I worked hard. All the stress from school and managing all my time. All those nights and all those days gone now. I really can’t let them slip by. I have to think about nights like these right now. In a year maybe I’ll be looking back on this night and thinking about the job I really didn’t enjoy but maybe it’s teaching me something. I should be so very grateful for that. Maybe it’s not the most fun or entertaining but I’m learning about myself and I’m learning what I enjoy. I’m building myself up. I’m making memories. I’m experiencing things. I’m experiencing different feelings that are normal to feel. I should be happy I’m feeling something. I should be happy I’m alive. I should be happy my job is stable. I should be happy I’m living. If nothing ever changed I would have just felt the same things and never learned, never truly lived. At least annoyances and regrets are experiences. I am trying something new and I FELT something. FEELING is an amazing thing. Maybe I will always regret that but I won’t regret undergoing experiences that make me a better person.

171,"Hey reddit.. 
My (19M) girlfriend (18F) and I usually have had a great relationship full of trust and communication. She has a little bit of trust issues from past boys, and other people in her life, so she is a little bit more investigative, we’ll say. I gave her my snap password a while back and today she logged in and was on it for a while unsuspectingly. Turns out she looked at all the saved texts from me and my ex girlfriend’s talks. She didn’t tell me so I was caught totally by surprise. Let’s just say they weren’t pretty. Keep in mind this relationship took place during my freshman year in high school, but needless to say many of the convos we had were immature and untrue but they really upset my current girlfriend. My ex was very persuasive and manipulative, I was gaslighted our whole relationship. She ended up cheating on me and somehow had me upset that we broke up. I know that that sounds dumb but my self worth was absolutely crumpled when we broke up and there was a rough patch afterward where I was heavily depressed and very reliant on drugs to make me happy. While I have made great strides in my mental health and I seriously love the girl I’m with right now, how do I even approach this. She saw everything and I think she thinks I did the same stuff in the last relationship that I do to her and feels hurt by it. While that’s untrue, how do I explain to her that those things mean nothing to me now and I was seriously manipulated by my ex, while also telling her that I’m not sorry for who I was back then, because it made me who I am now, and I love who I am now. I guess I’m just upset because those texts were out of my mind, I had forgotten they existed, and now my girlfriend knows basically every weird conversation I’ve ever had with my ex.

Well, a couple of days ago, he asked his friend to get my phone number. I was hesitant about giving it to him because I don't know him, but I was cornered into giving it to him by not only his friend but my co-worker that night. I gave it to him and that night, he started texting me immediately and he even called me that night as well. It hasn't been a week and he has sent me more text messages than most of my friends or family and he is even texting me at work. He will show up every time I'm working and try to talk to me, only like buying one thing, and just yesterday his friend came in and asked me if I've ""talked to my man lately"". I talked with another co-worker and she told me he had been stalking another girl and that he even came into the store asking her about me.

It honestly has me freaked out. 

I talked to my manager today about what happened and she's not happy with my co-worker because 1) she was my manager on duty, and 2) my manager is not thrilled with this guy because she thinks he is also creepy. She and another of my co-workers helped me on how to block him and tell him I'm blocking him.

So, I used to play DnD with a few coworkers and one day I  was high and I decided to flirt with a female coworker of mine that I  used to play with. I never meant anything malicious by it, but I can  definitely see how it was inappropriate. I stared at her which me being  high and being an idiot I interpreted as flirting, but I can see how I  completely messed up. I stopped immediately afterwards and gave her  space, but I can see how I could have appeared standoffish. I was going  to apologize about how I acted since I sincerely was trying not to make  her uncomfortable after the fact, but then COVID happened and I didn't  want to bring up this issue with everything else going on. Also, I  wasn't sure how to bring this up.

Fast  forward to now, I was applying for a position at my job and she was  there. I was told I was rejected and that the reason was that people  weren't comfortable with me being there. Now, I'm on decent terms with  the rest of my coworkers, so I don't know what issue could have led to  this other than what I mentioned. It is the only thing that makes sense.  I knew she and her friend were upset at me just based on their body  language, but I didn't know it was to the extent that they would try to  ban me. They never brought up the issue with me and I even asked one of  her friends that was angry at me if they were cool with me participating  and they said they were fine.

Anyway,  I sent an apology text to her for my behavior and if there was anything  I could do to make up for my inappropriate behavior and I got no  response. I also sent a formal apology to the committee for putting them  in this situation and that my behavior was inappropriate and that they  did the right thing by removing me and that I am sorry for any harm that  I have caused.

I started planning a business and was telling him about it. He started out fine with it but the more I talk to him about the business or stocks he gets super sour towards me and makes me overthink or doubt myself.

It’s something that interests me and he told me that the pay is amazing and the environment is great too. I applied to that job back in July, was told not to apply until August, and did so. 

Near the end of June, I got a job working for something similar. It’s good, the pay is minimum wage, I don’t have any complaints. I started working earlier this month after training. However, I heard back from the other job, interviewed, and was hired on the spot. (My friend told me that once you’re getting interviewed and they call you, the position is basically yours.) I accepted it, of course, because the pay is super good and the hours are in the morning which is most convenient for me. 

Here’s the problem: I’m a college student and everything is online. Although I don’t have to attend any zoom meetings, my classes are relatively rigorous and I would like to spend more time studying and focusing on school rather than my job. The job I currently have since June conflicts a lot with my studying time (they want me to work from 3-6:30 on mondays and thursdays) and the hours with the job my friend recommended me are good enough for me given the pay (the hours are 7:30-12:45 everyday). Although these don’t seem like they’d conflict, I know that I’d get tired early on in the semester and wouldn’t have time to focus on school given the classes I’m currently taking. 

I feel kind of bad wanting to quit the first job I have since it’s been less than a month (around two to three weeks) since I officially started working. Can I quit so early in the game?

Hey guys,
I just bought a house and some land from a family member. The home has not been occupied in almost two years. Upon entering the home before I purchased it, I did note that there was a ton of water damage to the roof and at least one wall will need to be replaced. I could not pass up the deal however. I saved up for about 6 months, put away my stimulus check completely, and added money to my savings from every paycheck. My uncle sold me the home and the land for a very cheap price, but it was all of my savings. ANYWAY, I am a single mom, and trying to think of ways to make money and save it up to replace the roof at least, so the house does not get more damage from rain. I asked my mom if maybe making a fundraiser page or something like that, would be a good idea; and using that money to replace the roof. I think I would only need about 3-4,000. What money I have now goes to groceries, daycare, gas and every day essentials. I don’t really buy things we don’t need. My mom said that it was a bad idea, but I have noticed that every time I take her advice, it always turns out bad; and I should have followed through with my own ideas to begin with. Do you think a fundraiser is a good idea? Also, what money raising ideas do you have, besides a Gofundme? 
Apologies for the length. Thank you!",28Aug2020,1

I want my friend to be happy, and I don't want to even slightly stand in the way of that, but keeping it in just feels so bad almost like guilt, and even though I know for a fact they'd say no, id is ok with that.

So when my car was shipped, the guy who shipped it to me was nice enough to put my temporary donut tire on my car. He parked my car in the front office my apartment complex. I safely drove my car to my parking spot. However my tire was making a wierd bumpy noise and it did make me nervous. I found a place to fix my tire and wheel that's 6 minutes away from my place. I want to drive it there since I'd rather not pay for towing. But I will if I have to. Is it safe to drive my car to the tire shop and get there safely?",28Aug2020,1
187,"Hello all,

I have always wanted to be a horse racing jockey. I have ridden since I was like 7 doing barrels and then later moved to jumping. These would always just be second best to racing though. 

Fun fact I am even related to Willie Shoemaker.

Thing is I never thought I could be a jockey and I am still like 90% sure it's impossible but I wanted to ask some advice on the matter. Typically jockeys are pretty short in the 4'11-5' range and typically weight about 106 to 118 lbs. Currently I am 17, I weight about 133 lbs and I am 5'9. I just recently looked up height limits on jockeys and despite most of my life thinking their was a height limit, there is none, only a weight limit. I have been 115 before and I am quite confident I could get there again even though that is slightly underweight for my height and gender. I know Red Pollard kept his weight down even though he was taller at 5'7. 

So do you guys think I could be a jockey or am I just out of it?",28Aug2020,1
188,"I grew up an only child so I’ve always been sort of introverted and self reliant. I had parents who weren’t really around and I kind of raised myself. I wouldn’t say I am a loner but I’m incredibly independent by default. I am dyslexic but didn’t get any sort of help or therapy as a kid so I had to pretty much overcome difficulties on my own. I’ve done a myriad of personality tests to figure out what my problem is and the one that I think matched best was Myers Briggs and I’m an INTJ.

I’ve been running into a lot of issues career wise because I have issues with authority and I’m looking for advice. I really tend to have high expectations for people in leadership positions at work and I realize it’s causing me stress and dissatisfaction. 

Generally, I have a hard time respecting people who don’t know what they are doing. The end. There’s nothing more demotivating for me when people don’t know what they are doing are directing me. I hate incompetence and inefficiency and pointless rules..  especially because I feel like due to my learning disability I’ve had to compensate by working extra hard, I’ve never been allowed to not work hard . I hate work place politics, I’m not good at it. I try to have my work demonstrate my ability and worth. 
I have a tendency to be untrusting of other people in that I doubt they value or understand me which frankly has been my work experience thus far. I started my career in the midst of the last recession and it hasn’t been easy going. 

Anyways.. all this stuff kind of gets to me. What happens is I start a job...I’m happy for awhile and then it all becomes too much when I inventively realize everyone is stupid and I get burnt out and angry because I struggle to get my ideas heard or get the respect I think I deserve. I am sure I come across as an asshole but it’s true. I get dismissive and frustrated because “everyone’s an idiot but me”.  I normally can’t go much longer then 3 years at a work place until I am “done”.",28Aug2020,1
189,"A little context:

I am now a sophomore in high school. My school has just started back up, and in a couple of weeks they are holding a socially distanced athletic reconditioning camp, and I feel like it is a good idea for me to go. I have always struggled with weight and quarantine has not helped. To do this camp I have to get my yearly physical from my doctor, but in order to do that, I have to do a mental health check and questionnaire. It asks me questions about feeling depressed or anxious.

This is my problem. It might be stupid, but here I am and I don't really know what to do so I thought that posting this really couldn't hurt. 

I have been depressed for an entire year, since the beginning of freshman year. I went to a new school where I didn't know anybody, and I got bullied for my weight, appearance, and even taste in music and clothing. All this has made me become even more introverted and shy than I used to be. The questionnaire asks me about suicidal thoughts and about being depressed, and I don't really know how to answer. I could either lie or be truthful. If I'm truthful, I might be able to get some help that I probably need, and some part of me knows that. However, I have been to a therapist before and I didn't like them and I don't really want to go back to one. This past year my grades have been the best they have ever been. I am taking all honors of enhanced courses this year, and last year I got straight A's with my lowest score being a 96. In the past year, I have gotten pretty good at suppressing all emotion and turning it into focus on my work, and the other part of me keeps saying these things. These 2 sides in my mind can't really come to an agreement. 

Again, this whole thing might be stupid, but I can't decide what to do and this is making me even more anxious than usual. 

**TL*****;*****DR** I need to fill out a mental health check and doing so truthfully would mean admitting my depression. In both cases, I don't like the outcome. I either admit to my depression and get help (which some part of me knows I need), or lie and act like I am fine (which another part of me wants to keep doing). What do I do?",28Aug2020,1

Anyways, we are really worried about her. We know if she wants to talk about problems or just hangout to get away from problems she can always come to us. We are confused though because she came to my wedding shower last year and then came to our other friends baby shower a month later. When it was time for my wedding my friends called her but she said like she was upset on the phone “i cant do this no more” and hung up on them. We haven’t heard from her since although I noticed a new facebook page of hers but she didnt add anyone from highschool but now that page is gone when I looked today.

To clarify a bit, when I came back from military duty, my dad offered to take me in. He said that he would support me until I got my bachelors. Naturally I went straight to college to get my degree. 

Ever since then, every week or two I would get threats to kick me out or why I havent completed my bachelors yet (because clearly I can get a degree over night). Ive constantly reminded him that he agreed to this. 

His only reason for needing to kick me out is: ""I didnt have a dad to do this for me, you should already be doing something with your life."" (Because being in the military to pay for going to college are two things im not doing with my life apparently).

Today I came home to him smiling like a maniac and saying ""Son. You're ready. You have 30 days. I know I wont need to call the cops because you'll do the honourable thing, but I trust you'll leave by September 30th.""

I didn't have the patience or the energy to argue, so I said alright, september 30th it is, and walked away.

197,"Hello. This post is going to be fairly long, just warning you. 

I moved into my first apartment a few months ago, and my former roommate and I wanted to celebrate a little, so we invited my friend, John, over to drink and play Monopoly with us. I had known John for over a year, so I felt extremely comfortable being around him. I ended up drinking quit a bit more than him and my roommate that night, so I was pretty wasted. We (John and I) went to my room to get ready to sleep. We were watching TV from my bed when John asked me if I wanted to have sex with him. We have had consensual sex in the past, but that night I wasn't really feeling like it, and I said no. He kept on asking me and bugging me, and I kept saying no. Eventually, I just got annoyed with responding, and I just stopped saying anything. He took that as a yes, and pulled my shorts and underwear off and proceeded to have sex with me. I still didn't say anything. 

The next morning, I kicked him out and sent him a message calling him out and saying that I was done with him. I went to the police soon after and filed a report. They told me that a case like that might take a while, so I would have to wait. I'm not a person who has many friends, and I get lonely really easily. I ended up being friends with him again about a month after it happened. We had a deep talk about it, and he told me that there is nothing he regrets more than that night and he wishes he could take it back. I told him I went to the police, and he was glad I did. Since we had that talk, we both just put the event in the back of our minds, know it would catch up to us eventually. He was called into the police department for an interview, and when I could access it, I read it. He told the truth about what happened. 

Since then, we've been hanging out quite a bit, only in secret though. If my family or anybody else close to me (who all hate him because of it) found out I was still friends with him, I might be disowned or cut off from them. As screwed up as it sounds, John is one of the only people I feel truly comfortable around, even after what happened, and I care about him deeply. Despite everything, I feel he cares about me too. Today, he found out that there is a warrant out for his arrest. I never dropped my case, but I never followed up with the police either. I knew they would contact one of us one day. He asked me if I was going to drop the charges. I don't know if I should or not. I care about him, but he still needs to deal with the consequences of his actions. I also don't want him to pay for the rest of his life for one screw up. Neither do I though. I just have a lot of mixed feelings about the whole situation. 

Am I being an idiot about this situation? Any input or advice is appreciated. Thank you.",28Aug2020,1
198,"I (23F) have had a chubby Russian blue (7M) for about 5 years now. He’s attached to me completely and sees me as HIS person. He loves attention from other people, he loves other cats (he’s sometimes too friendly), and in general is just a really sweet cat to have around. 

However, if he can even smell a dog, the hair stands on his back and he gets really uncomfortable. My friend has a German shepherd that visits and one time he swatted it in the face. He also sometimes bullied my old suite mates’ puppy. The only true success he’s had with dogs was when I was dog sitting my friend’s poodle mix, and even though it was rough for a day, he ended up sleeping in the bed with her for the rest of the week.

My roommate is moving out soon and taking her cat, so I will be staying in the house I’m renting with myself and my cat and I’d really like a dog. I have the time, money, and means for one and I even have a fenced in backyard, but I’m scared my cat will never accept this. Part of me likes to think of the time he got along with my friend’s poodle, but then I think of the other times he wasn’t okay with dogs. Im afraid to adopt a dog and it not work out. I just want both of them to be comfortable and happy.

Should I even try to adopt? Or has anyone experienced anything similar with a cat of their own? I think I might be overreacting a little but it’s such a stark contrast with how he behaves around cats.

202,"TW sexual assault 

When I was 16 I was friends with a girl who we will call Sarah. Sarah was one of those girls who was never actually a good friend, she would talk about you behind your back, try to steal the guy you were talking to/dating, spread rumors, etc. You probably know the kind of girl I’m talking about. I was never close with her, she was just in my friend group and so we were around each other often. Our other friends in this group were Hannah, Brittany, and Beth. (All fake names). 

So on the night of my junior prom the whole group plus their boyfriends and a few others were going to a lake house for the after party and to get breakfast the morning after. My date, let’s call him Daniel, couldn’t go with me because of strict parents, but he was going to attempt to sneak out and join me. Sarah had liked Daniel (along with a few other guys) for a while, but he had told her numerous times he wasn’t interested and so she was somewhat sour about him and I starting to date. I did talk to her beforehand and she said she didn’t mind, but behind my back told everyone I was a terrible friend and stole her man. Whatever. 

Hannah had invited her much older boyfriend (23) which everyone was fine with. However, he showed up with 3 friends all of which were older than him. His friend Josh (26) apparently showed an interest in me, but I didn’t notice because I was focused on texting Daniel and having fun with my friends. I did notice Sarah talking to him throughout the night though. I was drinking alcohol, but i had only one wine cooler and was working on my second when I misplaced it. Josh approached me and told me he had accidentally spilled my drink but he brought me a new one. I didn’t think anything of it. 

The rest of the night was a blur. One minute I was sitting on the couch. Then I remember waking up in a closet with Josh. It was dark and that’s all I know. Then I woke up naked in bed with Josh on top of me having sex with me and I could see people standing in the doorway watching. I tried to talk, but I couldn’t. The next thing I remember is waking up in bed next to Josh in the morning. I quickly got up, took a shower and got dressed. I gathered my things and asked Beth to take me home. 

I didn’t check my phone until I got home and got to my charger. I had countless text messages and missed calls from Daniel calling me names and asking me how I could “fuck around” on him. Someone had obviously said something and I didn’t know how to explain so I just didn’t say anything. Later I got a call from Brittany telling me everything that was being said about that night. It wasn’t pretty. Basically everyone saw and didn’t want to do anything about it because Sarah had been telling them I had been talking to Josh for a while and we had previously planned on having sex that night. Brittany and Beth didn’t know what was going on because they were in the hot tub and their own rooms with their boyfriends most of the night. And Hannah hadn’t done anything because her boyfriend told her not to say a word about it. Brittany talked to Sarah and apparently she had talked to Josh about me all night telling him I wanted him but I was too nervous to talk to him. She did this in the hopes that I would pick Josh over Daniel. She said I deserved everything that happened for acting like a whore and because I was a bad friend and “karma worked it’s magic”. 

Fast forward to present day she works high up at a place that helps abused women and women who went through sexual assault. I only found this out because I ran into Beth and she told me. I looked her up on social media and it’s true. She posts about the #metoo movement and how women deserve a better world. It made me want to puke. She basically set me up to get raped and said I deserved it because I had the audacity to like someone she liked.  

It’s been over ten years. I want to do one of two things, or possibly both. I want to e-mail her boss and give them a detailed account of what happened. I also considered calling her out publicly, but that has it’s downfalls. I have never publicly came out about what happened. I switched schools and never talked to her or Hannah again and just waited for the situation to go away. So more than likely I would just e-mail her boss. 

WIBTA if I did one or both? The devil on my shoulder wants to see her burn for what she did and see her whole world and reputation ruined. The angel on my shoulder says that it’s been over ten years and to just let the boss know and drop it. Under no circumstance do I think she should be working with women who have been abused/raped.

204,"I have a friend - someone who has been my best friend for eight years. In the past year, we've both had an emotional decline; I've been suicidal, and she has become reclusive. I made a selfish mistake of treating her as my earpiece; I would cry to her each time I had suicidal thoughts or worries about life, and I made her miserable. It culminated in an argument in which she told me to stop being manipulative about the statements of self-harm, which I never realized were manipulative and realize my problem now. She didn't speak to me for two days except to snap at me regarding things all over again, usually bringing up statements from weeks ago that I had apologized for previously but had evidently remained on her mind in spite of her insistence that it was fine. I did snap back, however, usually saying she was being mean and to stop being such a terrible best friend - I know it wasn't nice to share, and I know I caused a lot of this mess, so I should've been a lot more tactful instead of letting my emotions get the best of me.  

It hurt a lot, and honestly, now I just feel scummy, but also feel some frustration of my own with a lack of trust. I found out later that she had ranted about me to her friends, and then she had shared with them my past of health disorders and sexual assault - both stories I am willing to share myself, but somehow felt violating to hear someone else share. These friends had told her I was being manipulative, and I think that's what fed into the situation and probably fed her anger, and she and I both apologized eventually, but I'm having issues trying to trust her again. I know it's not her fault; I was wrong to place so much strain on her and should have worded things better, but I still feel some degree of hurt with everything. Pieces I was genuine about were treated as some ulterior motive, and while they were clarified, I still find myself uncertain of how to trust again. I already hold trust issues, so I don't know how to climb up from this hurt, as I want to trust my best friend again. I want her to be happy and okay. 

How can someone try to trust others? I am going to a counselor this Saturday so I can sort things out and not treat my friend so harshly, but are there any other suggestions for this? Is there a way to keep my pride from being so hurt over it?

208,"My husband died 2 weeks ago. We were extremely close, like actual best friends that never ran out of things to talk about and always resolved issues calmly. There was literally no topic we couldn't cover, even when we disagreed. It's relevant info, I promise.

I've always had depression and severe anxiety, so a little over a year ago my husband encouraged me to try therapy again (I had some shitty experiences as a teenager and was hesitant). He searched around for me and made an appointment with a lady I really loved! She was super kind and just seemed to get me. I started seeing her monthly and it helped, although to be completely honest it felt more like building a friendship rather than actually working through my issues, but I did make some progress (mainly from self growth and also talking about everything with my husband tho 😬 He gave amazing, helpful advice more often than anyone lol). 

I liked to run through my sessions with him after they happened (amusing to get his feedback and our marriage was solid anyway) and through the last few months he seemed to start to think she was taking advantage of me. We do laugh like friends, but it honestly has become just as much about her issues as it was mine, and also she started to dislike my husband once we discovered he had ADHD? It made me a little uncomfortable but I mostly avoided talking about him because we were always really good.

My husband was missing for over a day before being found dead, so my post was shared around a lot. She reached out to me online and asked what was going on. I explained, and she said ""wish he would've taken my husband with him"" which honestly hurt my feelings a lot. Then we found out he was in fact dead and she told me she was sorry and I could call any time I needed without an appointment and said she would be at his funeral to support me. She called once a few days after and I honestly didn't have a lot to say, I was just in shock.

She ended up not being able to come because she had to be out of town during the funeral, which was fine. I understood. I asked her if she would mind calling me whenever she had time if it wouldn't be an inconvenience, and she said she would, but I haven't heard from her in nearly a week and she doesn't respond to any of my messages checking in to see if SHE'S okay lol.

I still want to be friends, and I still love her. Her bf is an absolute tool and he’s terrible to her, but that’s another issue not related.

Here’s the thing: now, one of my other close friends decided that she wanted to date me as well. Problem: those two girls are best friends. And I like the second one as a person, but I can really only think of her as one of “the bros”. And I don’t want to hurt her, but a similar situation is exactly what happened between me and the first one who has a bf now.

Right now, my focus is on getting the first one back as a friend, because she means the world to me. I know that we never will be friends again but being stupid me, I will still try. However, going out with this second girl seems like a bad idea, especially if I want the first one back as a friend. And I feel like if we do start something, I’ll be too preoccupied with the first one that I won’t be able to give her any attention. But if I don’t, then I’ll regret it in the future. I always want to give people a chance and the benefit of the doubt, but I’m not sure if this will mess things up even more.

TL;DR: In love an ex-friend, current friend wants to date me. Dilemma of if I should turn said friend down or not, as I don’t want to be a bad partner for her or hurt her, but I also can’t bring myself to move on from first ex-friend",28Aug2020,1
210,"Hey, not really sure how to word this so if it seems my bad.

I'm in my mid-teens, female, and I've been home schooled for 4 years now. I'm so horribly lonely, I don't know what to do. I have a job, but the girls that work there are kind of ""girly"" and I'm not really good with that stuff (make-up, talk about boys, snapchat, dressing up, not really sure how to describe it) so I haven't really made friends with any of them. I have two friends from public school but one just seems like a pity friend (main parental figure died 5-ish years ago, depression they know about, ect) and the other is a sister to me so I guess my brain doesn't process it as social stuff?

I basically have no way of making friends, that's why I'm making this post. How do I make friends? I have online friends, I find it much easier tbh, but it just isn't the same. I'm tired of being home all the time, never doing anything, never going to parties, or any other normal teenage stuff. I feel like I'm going to be alone the rest of my life.

Does anyone have any advice for me? I'm a person that has severe depression and anxiety, so talking to random people is hard for me. I'm also not really attractive so idk if that has anything to do with all that stuff. Please give me advice. I feel like one more day alone and I'm just going to break down",28Aug2020,1
213,"Im new here and i feel silly for asking this when so many others have real issues but i don’t know who else to ask for advice. So long story short, im a 22 y/o f who recently (10 months ago) graduated with a mechanical engineering degree, while i was still in college i came to the realization that engineering was not really my thing but I still pushed through and got good grades and my degree, and not long after i got my first job in a big car manufacturing company. Now here’s the thing, i was really privileged growing up and had never worked before (yup, not even part time) and i guess I just don’t have anything to compare my job with, but I feel extremely anxious and stressed and always tired, I’m not officially part of the company since im in a “test period” for 10 months and i feel like I’m constantly trying to prove my worth and giving my ALL. I start working at 6 am and finish at arround 7:30 pm every day because of the large amount of work I’ve been handed (I’m doing the work of 4 people on my own) and I still don’t feel I’m doing enough, I’ve missed out on so many things because i have to work on the weekends to(not officially but if want to finish things i have to do this), I’m kinda sick of it but the pay is good and tbh it boosts my ego everytime I say I work at such an important company. But i don’t really like my job, idk if it’s because i really messed up when getting my degree and job in engineering when i already knew i didn’t like it, or if I’m just being too sensitive and extra milenial and this is what working usually feels like??

214,"We broke a year ago due to well, abuse (physical, emotional, and sexual) and a few months after I had the courage to speak up about all the things he did to me. Since I had proof of everything, a lot of people believed me and even some girls that used to be friends with him told me that he had done similar stuff to them, too. Anyway, that was a year ago. Right now, there’s this famous tiktoker with over 1 million followers who happens to be his best friend. She knew about all the abuse and decided to defend him. Now, she’s pretty famous, getting brand deals, all that, and it infuriates me that someone so influential could defend a known abuser and act like he’s a nice person, when I know he STILL does horrible things to girls. It’s difficult to see her fanbase saying she’s perfect and a role model when in reality none of them know how horrible she is by calling me a liar and defending an abuser. Every time someone talks about how amazing she is or how much of a good person she is, I get the temptation to expose her actions and her friendship, but I’m too afraid her millions of followers might come attack me and defend her.

216,"I have never grieved over the loss of a loved one ever. All my grandparents have passed away, but I was too young to feel grief over their deaths. As a kid funerals were not different to family reunions where I get to see and play with my cousins. All my parents and siblings are alive and I am scared that something bad happens to them.

Here's the thing. While I haven't grieved over the death of a family member, I also know that I don't handle bad news really well. When I found out that my ex was cheating on me I felt weird chills all over my body. I felt paralyzed but I was shaking. I also felt like I wanted to puke but I couldn't and for a good two or three minutes I heard a really loud ringing in my head. Many people would probably cry and get mad but I wasn't feeling anything strong emotionally at first, especially towards my ex. Everything is physical, as if I am being poisoned.

I have a feeling that if ever a family member dies, I would feel the same way except it would be much more intense. I fear that I would faint in public or get a heart attack.

My parents are both very old. I also don't live with them. My siblings have a habit of texting me for news and I fear that that's how I would know that one of my parents have died. I would be doing something, probably alone, or probably out with friends and I would receive news about the death of my mother or father so abruptly. It would be just a few vibrations in my phone before I find out.

Disclosure, she never smokes weed and has like no tolerance, and her friend made her eat 500mg worth of it. 

There were 4 others around all panicking. 

I’ve overdosed on edibles before so I know that hallucinations are a very real thing on high doses when you have no tolerance. That and between the panicking, dizziness and nausea, it’s very unlikely that any cheating went on but she says it felt real. 

What other evidence can I bring to her that cheating did not happen. I was also there in her hallucination but I wasn’t with her friends. She still feels bad. 

The cheating happened in a hotel room, they were in a field. It’s clearly a dream. Not even wishful thinking on my part because I was being called multiple times by her panicked friends to calm them down. On every video they were at a park.

We are still very early in the pregnancy and the option to end the pregnancy is open to us. This baby is very much wanted but I am not sure if I can cope with the years of anxiety watching it go through surgeries and forever wondering if it will have complications. To know it will never have normal health, may never have it's own children, may be more likely then other children to die before me. I also am not sure if I can bare the guilt of giving up on the baby when I know it could have some sort of life.

240,"Myself [17F] and this friend [17, gender obscured for privacy] have known each other for years. A couple years ago, they developed an eating disorder, but kept it well hidden. They did eventually tell me, and I at the time didn't really know what to do other than provide my support if they were struggling (but obviously not encourage their eating disorder) and just try and be a good and present friend for them. 

Only in the last year did it really start getting worse. Their parents did find out and sent them to a residential program at a center for treating eating disorders. They were there for two or three months, but when they came back they were not at all recovered or in a place where they were interested in recovery. Since then, their condition has only been deteriorating. 

Over the past few months, they've become a lot more reclusive. They are no longer as laid back or enthusiastic as they used to be, and have become very irritable, paranoid, and isolated from myself and our other friends. They also have picked up a habit of drinking and, if possible, seeking out drugs. It's to the point where I have trouble sticking around as a friend for them because they lash out and get angry so much. 

I just saw them recently and they've lost even MORE weight, to the point that they look ill and dangerously thin. They don't seem to have much energy or happiness in their general demeanor. I'm incredibly worried about them. It can't be healthy or sustainable to be consuming that little food/purging that much and losing more weight. 

I have the means to contact their mom, but they are not on good terms with her. I also know that if I told their mom, they'd likely get sent back to the treatment center, which seemed to be a very traumatic experience for them. They'd probably also know it was me and hate me forever. 

I also have the means to contact one of their relatives that they do enjoy and look up to. I feel that this might be the better option but would ultimately result in the same outcome. 

I think I'm at the point that, as a friend, I feel I have to do something to help. I worry that they won't be able to continue living like this. I have the option to consult my therapist for advice on this also. What can I do to help that doesn't involve getting them sent back to the treatment center?

242,"So here’s the background info: I’m an only child to two parents who are in a toxic relationship, and who I’ve lived with my whole life. The relationship has been abusive as long as I can remember. Last year I called the cops on my dad because he had been hitting my mom for years and I finally wasn’t afraid to speak up about it. Thing is, me and my mom financially rely on my dad because she hasn’t been allowed to work for years and my job only pays 15.50/hr in one of the highest COL states. My car that I drive is in my dads name(it was his car that he used to drive) it’s pretty old but still works fine, and I share it with my mom sometimes bc she doesn’t have a car. Anyways my mom dropped the charges against my dad so he wouldn’t lose his job cause then we all would lose everything. Lately he has been drinking and they’ve been fighting again so we’re back to square one but he hasn’t physically hit her, but it’s still a really nasty toxic environment and they just scream and insult each other for hours, needless to say I want out.

With that said, my parents won’t leave each other. My mother is convinced I “need her” and won’t leave the house until *I* do so I’m kinda forced out prematurely because I can’t watch them like this anymore. I still don’t know what I want to do with my life, I’m a full time retail supervisor currently and I was considering going back to school to finish my degree but in the meantime I’m pursuing my real estate license, in hopes to make more money so I can support myself and not rely on my parents and possibly even help my mom. The kicker is that I’ve been working my ass off since I was 17 so I have about $42,000 in the bank that I would like to preserve as much of as I can- I’m very “smart” with my money and don’t like to spend unless absolutely necessary. 

I was considering buying a 2018ish car for like $15,000 or less in cash, or putting a large down payment on it and that way it would last for years and be in my own name so no one can take it. I also know I need to pick up real estate as a second job. But what should I do about my living situation? Rent is very expensive where I am and even if it were me and my mom living together, until she gets a car and a job she has no money. I also might want to continue college in a few years to complete my bachelors, once I figure out what I wanna do haha.

The last detail is that I have a boyfriend I’ve been dating for a bit over a year(friends first) but I guess due to my past I’m terrified to live with him. He’s a sweet guy but there’s a few quirks he has here and there and I’m not sure if he would be the guy I’m going to marry tbh, but again he isn’t abusive we just might not be fully compatible. I’m practically in love with my coworker (we’re pretty close but we only see each other at work, and no foul play is going on, I’m not a cheater) but he doesn’t even know I gave a boyfriend, wrong of me I know but no one at my job does I just get shy about telling people. If the guy at work WERE to ask me out though I don’t know what I would do - we seriously have the best conversations and a great connection and he is also a sweet guy, super caring and realistically we probably do like each other but I’m his “boss” so that might be why nothing has ever happened even when I was single. So living with my boyfriend is an option but I’m just scared to take that step especially knowing what me and the other guy have even if nothing will ever come of it.

And to boot, today my family just found out that my dog has bone cancer and he has about 2 months to live unless we get it treated and even still the prognosis is only about a year maximum. Treatment would be 10,000 that my dad would need to take from me but with needing to get out on my own and help my mom and I, I’m not sure if I can do it even though I love my dog beyond words 😭

I’m sorry this was all over the place, anyone who is able to help I appreciate it so much!!! I’m so lost.",28Aug2020,1
243," tw// Hello, this is my second time requesting advice but times like these i just need another persons opinion. 
So about a few months ago when corona had just started getting really bad, i had a fallout with my old friend. Well not really a fallout, but they have a tough life and would constantly need my assistance. I dont mind being someones shoulder to cry on, but they would place so much on my shoulders while keeping me on a pedestal and it made me emotionally exhausted. There were constant phone calls at night, texts, and things that had me worried &amp; one time they triggered me into an episode by sending a picture. I had already placed my boundaries with them but they really relied on me, so i didnt have the heart to push them away and say it again until i snapped that day months ago. I dont know if theyre in a good space to talk, or if they even consider me anything in their life anymore (they were in love w me but i rejected them because i didnt feel the same) so that has me debating if i should just butt my head through their dms and express my concern and guilt. I had been thinking about them every so often but i saw them post about their situation and it hit the nail on the head. It made me go back and think about all the late night conversations we’ve had, jamming sessions, and how incredibly alike we both are. And im also moving quite soon so i dont want to do anything ill regret. It feels as if ive known them for more than my own lifetime, and I love them &amp; miss them so much.

I don’t know if I should give up on this friendship since we’ve always been together but it’s draining trying to help her every day. I tried enrolling her in programs but she never fills anything out or doesn’t show up. Do I give up? I love her like a sister",28Aug2020,1

247,"So I work at a restaurant in a state where masks are mandated via executive order. Last week, it was my job to stand outside of my restaurant and check guests in. In this position, I go over the rules for dining in with us. The first rule I always state is that masks are required anytime you are not at your table (think going to the bathroom, leaving the restaurant, etc.). Well, it was a Friday night, and we were on a wait, and I was already feeling a little anxiety just in general this day. (I am currently on medication for this as well.) A man on the wait list had attempted to walk inside (I assume to use the bathroom) without a mask. I hadn’t told him that rule just yet, so I kindly said, “Excuse me sir, but you cannot go inside without a mask on.” He replied, telling me that he had a medical disability that prevented him from wearing one. I told him that I was sorry, but no one can go in without a mask, no exceptions. However, we would be more than happy to accommodate his medical disability with a to-go order from our walk-up window, and I pointed to the window just behind where I was standing. He quickly became angry and raised his voice saying that I was denying him service based on a disability, and that’s illegal. He also began telling me that I was being discriminatory and saying stuff like “So you wouldn’t let me in if I was black?” I calmly explained (although my voice was shaking at this point) that I was not refusing him service and explained about our walk-up window. He then began asking me if I knew how laws are made. I told him that I am a pre-law student, so I am well aware of how laws are made. He then asked me who makes laws? I told him that the legislature makes laws, but executive orders can still be enforced like laws. I also, at this point, told him that ADA guidelines state that businesses may refuse service to someone with a disability based on that disability if accommodating that disability puts staff or other customers at risk, but that, again, I was not refusing him service, as he was more than welcome to order his food to-go. At this point, I was on the verge of tears and in the early stages of a panic attack. This customer was also starting to get physically close to me at this point. A nearby Door Dasher waiting on an order saw what was happening and stepped between the two of us, and said the customer needed to calm down, as I was just doing my job. This guy began screaming at the Door Dasher saying that he wanted to fight him. I finally had a second to radio for my manager, but she was out running an errand for the restaurant, so my coworker came out to my rescue. She sent me inside, and when my manager got back, she confronted the customer and told him that he can order his food to-go, but that he and his family were not welcome to eat inside. She then came to comfort me and offered me the rest of the night off.

After all of this, I find myself struggling to function at work. I constantly have the stories of customers who returned with a gun or a knife running through my mind, and I am worried sick that this man is going to return. Last night, as I was walking through the restaurant, I noticed a man away from his table without a mask. I kindly told him that he needed to have the mask on anytime he was away from his table. He replied in an annoyed/aggressive tone, “Even just to go to the bathroom?” The “yes” shook as it came out of my mouth, but he pulled his mask out of his pocket and put it on. I went into another panic attack as all of the feelings from the week before came rushing back. At the end of the night, I talked to my manager on duty and asked if there was anyway I could get trained in the back of house. He looked at me a little confused, and I explained that this guy really has me freaked out, and I could just use a break from customers for a little while. He said he would talk to our assistant general manager so that could happen ASAP. I just so happened to eat lunch there today with a friend, and my AGM had me sign a paper to move me over to food running.

While I’m feeling a little better knowing that I will soon get a break from directly dealing with customers, I still feel lots of anxiety going to and from work. I was okay today, as I had a friend with me, but it’s beginning to affect my performance. I have worked in restaurants for almost four and a half years and have never felt like this before. I LOVE my current restaurant, and I really do not want to leave it. Any advice on dealing with/moving past this event?",28Aug2020,1
249,"I don't think I want to try to be a bachelor.

I'm currently attending college, and I'm staying at the dorms despite what 70% of other people are doing. I'm stuck trying to make a girlfriend, let alone actual friends. My dorm mates are extremely cool but they all have a girlfriend of their own, so they sometimes don't have time to hang out with me. I'm growing homesick by the second, which doesn't help my situation either.

My problem comes from my ex, who I believe I am still stuck on. I met this ex in a sophomore P.E. class, at that time I was with my first girlfriend, yet it wasn't serious. I bugged her enough to want to be my friend, or I would just bug her more and more. Things between me and my girlfriend started getting dry, so we broke it off. Things between my ex and her boyfriend at the time started to get really iffy for them too, and my ex wanted to break it off, and constantly talked about kissing me and this and that. December comes along, and a certain event forces her to break it off, and 4 weeks later, we became a thing.

This was the first girl I loved, because if I didn't, I wouldn't have put myself through so much pain, of constantly choosing between my family who didn't like her, and her. The summer after we got together was shitty, my mom found out we were a thing and forced me to break it off. The next school year I find out she had kissed one of the very people I had an extreme disliking towards. This was also after she had sent her ex nudes on several occasions, and each occasion I gave her another chance.

That Christmas comes around, a few days after New Year's, and I couldn't hold it in, and ended up telling my mom we were a thing and I wanted to break it off because I couldn't put myself through the pain anymore. I break it off. She wanted to stay friends, but I couldn't do that, simply because I had just loved her too much to see her with another man. A few sobby nights later, things get extremely dry and we just stopped talking altogether. I ""move on"" and she ""moves on"".

A year later and she's dating the guy she kissed, and I'm with another girl from the dojo I am a student of. This ends up getting to my ex (which wasn't the point) and I find out later. I am actually happy with this girl, but eventually we break that off too. A few weeks before Spring Break, and she hits me up asking to be ""spontaneous"" and to meet her at a certain place she likes. I tell her I can't because my mom would know, which she wouldn't have, I just was smart enough not too. Spring Break itself rolls around and I'm down in South Carolina visiting my dad. We end up talking all of Spring Break, and all she can talk about it this and that and this and that of her and her boyfriend's problems.

I slowly start learning what she's trying to do, because she eventually starts calling me again, and the last night I'm there, we call until 4:00 in the morning. We go back and forth asking questions, and she keeps popping up questions about us. ""Do you think we would've worked out?"" ""How would your mom feel about us getting together?"" and ""How would we would've worked out if \[this\] didn't happen?""

I get home, my mom learns, pushes it but lets me know she doesn't care if we stayed friends, but she would be extremely disappointed because she knows where it would end up. So I tell her I can't be friends, and we go our happy merry ways.

She's still with her boyfriend, I know so because I stalk, just a bit.

I'm in college and I invited a girl over today to fool around with. I didn't like it simply because I like the bachelor life, or at least I think so. The more I think about it, it's been two years since we genuinely conversed as friends, and I'm still stuck on her, even after everything she had done to me. 

What do you guys recommend I do? How do I get past my ex and move on? Is the bachelor life good for me?",28Aug2020,1
250,"I was doxxed on discord about 3 years ago. They have a video of me masturbating (my face isn't shown). These guys are complete losers and still talk about me to do this even though I left 3 years ago. Every once in awhile, to be funny, they post the video of me masturbating and then delete it almost instantly after (I checked message history).

If he were to ever take it too far and send the video to my employer or distribute it outside discord, me and my family have our plan and lawyers ready to go, and will immediately take legal action (which will somehow make his life more unpleasant than in already is).

Yeh id like him to lose his account, but he can just make another one and its not a big deal to me if he has his account. Imo its just a pointless move.

Now this doesn't mean she likes mean but their is potential. I don't go to school with her and the next time I will see her is at our last track meet in a few days. My next move is unclear.  

I thought about texting her but this is where it gets complicated. I was texting her a few weeks ago and it wasn't going very well i'm just not good a texting. So I asked her to Facetime sense I have no problem when it comes to talking to girls. Then she told me her phone was broken and that Facetime was not working. I first thought she was lying to me and it turns out her phone was actually broken. I then waited a few days then texted her to start another conversation and she never responded. I thought if she was at least a little bit interested she would have texted me back but it turns out her phone is really old and sometimes texts don't go through to her so I don't even know if she got the text and the day I texted her was the day that she got into a big fight with her best friend.  

I was thinking I could just text her to start a conversation but If it turns out she did see my text and didn't answer its going to make me look really desperate if I double text her. Obviously I'm going to talk to her at the track meet though. I was also thinking about just full sending it and asking her out at the track meet but I think her parents are going to be their and it would be weird if I asked her out in front of her parents.

257,"I woke up today feeling hot and feverish. My nose was runny, along with a couple other symptoms. I got scared, and asked my roommates if they were available to pick up a thermometer from the store. They were not, so I spent the next hour contemplating what to do. 

They later texted me asking about my condition. I explained it and they advised I get tested. I mentioned how I was feeling depressed and scared. I have preexisting conditions that can be aggravated by illness, like Covid 19. I’m also in general worried about the virus, for myself and for my friends. I don’t want to get sick; so many people are dying, are being hospitalized, are becoming bedridden for months. I didn’t want that to be me. 

I expressed this to them, and they called me a little bitch. They told me I was the only one in the apartment that was worried, that my preexisting conditions weren’t listed on the CDC website, that my fears were invalid, and that I needed psychological help. At this point, I was more angry with them then worried about being sick. I felt so invalidated, disrespected, and unloved. 

After I went to get tested, I went to talk to them again to try and sort things out. I expressed how their concern for me didn’t come across as supportive/caring, and instead came across as critical. They responded by saying I’m over thinking things, I’m making it seem like they’re out to get me, and that I again need psychological help. 

I do have diagnosed anxiety and am seeing a counselor to work through my problems. But I have no idea what to do about my roommates. I know in my gut that it is not wrong to fear the virus, and that I’m not insane for being scared. They will not budge on this. They’re actions suggest they don’t care about the risks of leaving without a mask, seeing new people/other friends, etc. They admitted themselves that they don’t care. Yet they think I’m crazy for actually fearing it. 

What do I do? I’m so angry with them. I know that their treatment of me and my emotions is only making my mental health worse. They say that I need help, yet they’re unwilling to help or support me. What do I do? How do I get through to them?",28Aug2020,1

266,"So my high school had this student who copied and didn't credit a musician's pedal loop performance. They also performed it in front of the school in 2016 at assembly. They've already graduated years ago but never credited the original performer and acted like it was their idea, because I later found out that was the case. Since then, the music teachers have been showing the video of that student performing the plagiarised performance to many other students who study music and performing songs, and I don't feel like it's right for them to? Like I know they did change some small parts of the performance but if you have seen the original, it is basically a blatant copy of the original performance. I feel like I would be too nit picky if I do mention it now to one of the music teacher and it's not really a big deal??? Plagiarism is a pretty big deal, but then again this is high school and performing a song is a form of copying an already existing song. HOWEVER, I do feel frustrated for the artist whose unique performance was stolen and showed to a larger group of audience then theri own.

267,"We went on this trip with my moms friends family a month ago and this is what happened

About me: I’m 16M, never had a gf before, never even messaged a girl or asked for numbers because I’ve always been shy and haven’t had lots of crushes

Her friend also bringing her husband and two daughters (15) (18) (I’ll call them F1 and F2) I’ve known them since I was little and I would basically call them my sisters at this point because we known each other our whole lives. 

Anyways they unexpectedly announce that they will each bring a friend ( F3 which is 15 and F4 which is 16) ok, no big deal eight people in a small house for a week we probably already have Coronavirus. We are spending a week with them at this house on the waterfront. 

Since I’m shy and forgot my anxiety medication I don’t talk for like half the week. (This was my first time meeting F3 and F4) All of them are really sweet and great people it’s just that people aren’t my cup of tea. Us teens talked a little on the first day but I go quiet for 2 days and finally I break out on Wed halfway through the trip. We hangout on the beach and in this outdoor hot tub together all trip and talk about life everyone’s pretty calm and relaxed and we all have fun and like one another. 

Now F3 friend is really outgoing and always talking and laughing telling stories etc while F4 is more calm and shy like me (also good looking). 
A couple days go by and I’m starting to really like F4 (as a friend) even though we never talked one on one. Well suddenly it’s Fri the second to last day and by the end of the day I realize something. Do I like F4 or do I like like F4? She is super relatable, sweet, funny, shy, calm, good looking and essentially my dream girl (I would prefer to date a person similar to me). 

I wasn’t sure but what I was sure of was I was still nervous as hell to talk to her after a week. By Sat next morning we leave unexpectedly early without really saying goodbye to them but I did get the courage to ask for everyone’s IG and made a vacation group chat. On the car ride home they dm each other sending photos they took etc but F4 doesn’t chat really and neither do I. 

We go back home and by night time I realize I can’t stop thinking about F4, a feeling I’ve never had before. I’ve had small crushes in school and stuff but F4 is literally keeping me up all night thinking about her. I miss her already. I start to have thoughts about her (nothing sexual, which is weird for 16) like talking hanging out holding hands etc even though we barely talked throughout the trip. I think about her smile and how nice and perfect she was and by then I figure out maybe I love her?. 

A couple days go by and I get the courage to dm F4 on Instagram, nervous as hell I dm her however the conversation didn’t last long and I haven’t been on IG since (about a month). I decide that she probably isn’t into me since she did one word responses. We live in different states and I’ll see her next summer at soonest.

This past week I bought the Soundcore Liberty Pro 2, which are $150. When I told my brother, he said that they were really expensive and I probably shouldn’t have bought them. After a while, the thought had grown on me; maybe I shouldn’t have bought them and gone for something cheaper. 

But the main thing I was going for when I bought them was sound and battery life and based on reviews I had read and seen on yt, that’s what I was gonna get with these. It wouldn’t be a huge deal to return them either, I suppose, because there are more affordable options by the same brand that offer a (possibly) little less but close enough quality.

I have a cheap one he hasn't seen as I use it to grind weed, but he wouldn't approve of me smoking at home, and I thought that was a decent excuse.

I'm hoping he doesn't ask to see it again today, so I can go to a mates tonight and act like I used it for the first time there, but if he does ask to see it, I have no idea how I'd respond without seeming suspicious.

273,"Throwaway. Some small details will be changed for anonymity.

So, a couple days ago a coworker and I were looking at a computer screen. The screen showed each area of a factory we work in. Our area was being held up by the one ahead of us.

I'm not sure if he said it out of frustration or in a joking manner, but my coworker gave the screen the finger and said the N-word with a hard R. I was the only one who heard him because we were the only two in the vicinity.

He had never come off as racist before so I was really shocked to hear that. I feel gross and want to go to HR about it, but there are a few factors stopping me (for now) that I and a few others I've told have thought.

1. He's a 19yo kid. Kids say stupid shit all the time.
2. He has a newborn baby to take care of.
3. He didn't direct the slur at a person.
4. We are in/by the South (I am not from here). I've been reminded by many that it's a whole new culture here. 
5. I do not know if HR would take it seriously, even with the BLM movement going on. There are many people here who've used slurs and are still here.

However....

1. Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom from consequences. 
2. His ex and her mother are supporting the baby and there are plenty of factories around hiring if he gets fired.
3. Just because it wasn't aimed towards somebody doesn't mean it's okay to use. He may have not used it against someone, but he still used it.
4. I feel as though the whole culture excuse is just that -- an excuse.
5. The company I work for is an international one, so it's extremely diverse. With human rights protests happening in the US and world, I'd hope it would put HR under pressure to actively come to a solution.

My coworker seemed like such a nice kid. And incase anyone is wondering, he is White while I am Hispanic Polynesian.

I have already warned him not to say any slurs again. I was told by a few others that, although they disagree with his language, to give him another chance.

I feel guilty for possibly going to HR, but also guilty if I didn't. What do I do? Is it normal to feel guilty either way?

I should also mention, in case it's relevant, that someone I told ended up telling somebody else who is Black. That particular black coworker is now being passive-aggressive with me as I have yet to say anything, and to be honest I don't blame them.",28Aug2020,1

275,"Just three days ago I went to my immigration appointment (application to register for residency), and personally I thought the whole interview went well despite the officer who interviewed not knowing my case and constantly asking questions that my lawyer thought were unnecessary. Well anyways, today I received a letter saying that if I don’t depart from the US within 33 days, I risk being deported.

My mom along with my brothers had no issue going through the interview (they currently all are green card holders now, with the exception of one my brothers who is now a resident). I don’t know what to do. I’ve lived here all my life. I go to school here. And I’m honestly scared.",28Aug2020,1
276,"My husband passed away 11 days ago. He had cancer. Unfortunately, he experienced almost every negative side effect of chemo. Including chemo rage and chemo fog. Since his parents lived close to the hospital, and we lived an hour away, he stayed with them during chemo. They have never liked me, and he never had a good relationship with them because they tried to control him, and he disliked how they treated me. And since the chemo rage made him angry, and the chemo fog made it hard for him to concentrate, they were able to convince him of lies they were telling about me. For example, he came home from one treatment, and started screaming at me about how I never wanted his parents at our sons birthday parties, and I refused to allow them to come to his 2nd birthday party. After I calmed him down and got him to stop screaming, I was able to prove to him that not only did our son NOT even have a second birthday party ( my husband was away the entire month of his birthday, and I was dealing with suing our landlord so neither of us had time to plan one ) but I had photographic evidence that they were at all other birthday parties. Even though his mind was foggy, he was able to see that I was telling the truth, and told me “ my parents had me convinced that you wouldn’t let them come “. The next time he came home after treatment, he was again very angry, screaming about things that never happened, yelling at our 5 year old repeatedly for no reason, and even hit him. That was it for me. I love my husband, and I knew it wasn’t his fault. It was the cancer and the chemo. And his parents taking advantage of his confused state. I asked him to leave until he called his dr to tell him about his aggression and rage and confusion. I had to protect myself and our son. That was a Friday night. Obviously, he spent the next 2 days complaining about me kicking him out. By Monday, the rage started to calm down, and he called his dr. The dr was able to adjust his meds and he came home Tuesday night. He was devastated that he had actually screamed at me and our son, and actually hit him. I tried to tell him that it wasn’t his fault, I don’t blame him, it was the cancer. But he felt guilty until the day he died. He also was embarrassed, so he didn’t want ppl knowing about it, or about the chemo rage and fog. I love him, so I didn’t tell anyone outside of the drs and our counsellors. And no one ever visited enough to realize that he had been acting weird. Fast forward to his last hospitalization. He was dying. Covid meant that I was the only one allowed to visit him. So his parents threatened to sue me, tried to force their way into the hospital, called for updates 4 times a day ( my husband specifically told the nurses not to update them, and he ignored their calls ) and when that didn’t work, started telling everyone that he hated me, always has, and planned on divorcing me, citing the incident where I kicked him out, and things he said while experiencing chemo rage, as proof. The people closest to us didn’t believe it. Suprisingly, my dad does. So, eventually, my husband has a stroke. The drs don’t think he will make it the night. I’m a mom, so I ask the drs to call his parents and allow them in. This was the first, and only time he was unconscious in the hospital, so this was the only time it was my choice. The drs even asked if I was sure since he made it perfectly clear that he didn’t want them there. They never did understand that the only reason they were allowed to see him was because I told the drs to call them. Nope, they felt they were entitled to be there, and it was my fault they weren’t allowed their beforehand. The next morning, while they were getting coffee, my husband regained consciousness. When he found out his parents were there, he told the hospital to not allow them in again. He was a little angry at me for allowing them in, but he understood. A week later, he was much worse, and he had requested to be taken off life support, since he would never recover. I asked him if he wanted me to call anyone to be there or to say good bye. He said “ No, only you. I only want you. “ he said the same thing to the 3 drs and 2 nurses that asked him over the next 12 hours while they prepared a private room. I laid down in bed with him and he died in my arms. Despite the fact that he banned his parents and refused to say good bye to them, and that he only wanted me with him, his parents are still claiming that he hated me, and wanted to move back in with them. They have my dad convinced that I am the bad guy, and I won’t let them see their grandson, and I kept them away from their son. They only saw our son on his birthday, because they refused to ever pick up the phone and ask to come over, or invite us over, to spend time with them. And so long as my husband was conscious, I had no say over who could see him. Legally, it was his decision. My husband even left behind a short biography he did with his therapist, that was mailed to me, his parents and my dad after his death. In it, he says he was embarrassed by his parents, and how he had loved me since high school, and would always love me. It was done about 6 weeks before he died. That still isnt enough proof that he loved me. The multiple text messages a day saying I love you, and Facebook posts calling me the love of his life, apparently also doesn’t prove that he loved me. And now, my husband wrote his own obituary, called it in, and paid for it. I didn’t even know he did it. When I called the town paper, they informed me, and said all they needed was the date of his death. It was short and sweet. But, that wasn’t good enough for his parents. The next week, his parents put in a bigger obituary. Which would have pissed him off, because his main issue was with them trying to control him and not allowing him to make his own decisions. I know I should just ignore it, but he wanted to be remembered as a loving husband and father more than anything, and they are trying to destroy that memory. I am trying to mourn my husband, my son is trying to mourn his daddy, and we have to put up with all these rumours and lies. I just want to mourn in peace. So, how do I block all of this out ?",28Aug2020,1
277,"Moving around (across countries and states) since middle school, I never felt like I fit in anywhere. I'm now in college, studying accounting and I feel lost in nearly every aspect of my life. I don't really know what I want to do, I don't have a girlfriend, I'm not sure if I'm religious, and for fucks sake I can't even tell if I'm happy or not. I do have some close friends at school but I'm home for the semester because of COVID. The only thing I really seem to find pleasure in is painting, smoking weed, reading, making music, and tripping once in a while. 

Everyone around me seems to have some sort of idea of what direction they want their life to go in. And I'm just here mentally bumming out and I feel like I'm on autopilot while my life goes by. I worked an absurd amount of hours at a warehouse over the summer, and that gave me some sort of temporary purpose. But now that the school year has begun, I feel so lost and feel very nihilistic.

I think a big problem I have is that I'm afraid of getting close to people and actually developing a deep relationship with them because I'm thinking ""what's the point if this friendship is going to wither away at a certain point in my life?"" Because of this mentality, I've never been able to be in a serious relationship in my life (I'm in my late teens) and I feel pathetic because of it. I don't know where to go from here.",28Aug2020,1

279,"Sorry this is long

We are both 18 btw. So a year ago me and this girl worked in this same job and it was great. We would hang out and talk but never officially dated. I knew I was gonna be moving in the future so we didnt want to do that to each other.

I ended up moving and it sucked so much, we would talk still but It was hard. We went a few months where we didnt talk because I was hoping that would make me lose the feeling for her, it didnt.

We had recently started talking again and one time she sent me a pic of a trail we used to walk on saying ""remember this?"" She also had said ""Yeah, Qwerty why did you have to move? Now I've got nobody at (the job we both worked at) to hang out with"" we facetimed the first time a few weeks ago and that was the first time I could see her in over a year. After the call we were talking and she had said ""it was super nice to see you again"". She also had gave me her Snapchat a few days after that call (which she didnt have before because she wasnt too big on social media and didnt have it when I moved). A few days after this we were talking again and we were talking about a past coworker and she said ""maybe they are sick of me"" and I said ""nah I dont think that could happen"" she was like ""everyone gets annoying sometimes"" and I replied ""maybe, to certain people"" she then said ""you're too nice"" and also later called me a ""sweet chile"" in the convo

It sucks because she felt perfect for me and she actually cared for me and I for her. I dont know what to do and I dont even know if she still feels that way about me. She was also the first girl I ever got almost serious with so maybe I'm just being petty and clingy, idk",28Aug2020,1
280,"I (19F) have had mental health issues my whole life including substance abuse and trauma from sexual assault. I started drinking heavily at 15 because both my dad and brother are alcoholics and it helped me get over my ocd. I always had trouble making friends, and I had one close female friendship but it turned toxic and she is now addicted to meth. I met my boyfriend when I was 16 and he rapidly became my best friend and a completely codependent partner. 

I had very bad alcoholism issues and one day our drug dealer offered me alcohol and so I went with him and ended up being unable to see or walk and had sex with him. I actually thought he just kissed me but he told me that we had sex later. Something similar happened with another guy a year later. I would use Xanax or alcohol to excess to make my obsessive thoughts go away and then I would wake up and someone would tell me that a guy had sex with me when I was out. My boyfriend found out about one of these times because my friend told and I tried to commit suicide because I had ruined our relationship and nothing else mattered to me. 
  My relationship got somewhat better and then worse. He was very verbally abusive and I was drinking a lot, then he got a DUI. He moved in with me and my parents and I was supporting him and taking him to every single meeting and court appearance. While he was living there my drinking got worse. I would enter blackouts nightly and have no memory of what had happened. I actually made another friend but when I was in a blackout I sent her boyfriend nudes. I have literally no clue why I did this, I am not attracted to him in the slightest. I think maybe I was doing it to spite my boyfriend? I would message random guys and send nudes for attention. My boyfriend is basically asexual as well and rarely ever has sex with me and that would make me upset. My relationship with him was toxic and grew physically abusive. He would still show moment that he really cared though and I had no one else. 

  My drinking reached a really scary moment when my mom threw all my liquor away and I, in my blackout anger, threw her iPad and her clothes and phone in the pool in retaliation. My dad came in and held me down and was hurting me and left bruises so I bit him. The cops came and had to chase me down and I very narrowly avoided a felony. My parents told me I have to move so I’m working a shitty minimum wage cashier job now and saving up. 
  I have OCD and the guilt from the cheating was eating at me so bad. I knew I couldn’t move in with my boyfriend (he was talking about moving with me) and carry the guilt so I told him about the cheating and he says he feels like a retard for trusting me and he wants nothing to do with me anymore and that I’m a horrible person for not telling him. I feel like I have nothing. The relationship I built for years and the only close friend and romantic relationship I’ve ever had is done now because of stupid mistakes I made while drunk. I have nothing to live for. I am thinking about killing myself soon. I can’t keep working this horrible cashier job making barely any money with no friends or relationships. My obsessive thoughts and urge to drink is so strong. I also cannot stop self harming. I know everyone at work can see my scars but I can’t stop. How do I build self worth?",28Aug2020,1
281,"For a while now, I've been struggling with feeling extremely lonely. I have a very small group of friends, and I've tried many times to expand it to no avail. I haven't been sure how to possibly express my feelings to them, as I can't really tell if I'm being possessive and overreacting or not, so I rarely express these feelings. I'll list out my situations and keep my friends under aliases for the 1 in a million chance they find this.

[Friends A and B both have partners who they primarily talk to.]

-A has their spouse who they live with, as well as a decent sized friend group that they met through work. A was a childhood best friend of mine that lasted most of my life, and they recently moved across the country. Nowadays, A insists their spouse is always at work so they're lonely, but our conversations are often pretty dull since our interests and personalities have begun to drift apart more as years go on.

-B has a significant other (N) who they spend a majority of time talking to. Often, B will stay on calls with N and N's friend group and they'll play games together. I used to engage in those years ago, but I was always somewhat poor and never had the money to keep up when new consoles were released, so they simply hopped to a new system that I couldn't get a hold of. Outside of texts and memes, I don't talk all that often to B. When we do meet up or talk, B will usually talk about N or straight up call N and get them in. N and I get along, but I'm a bit awkward, so no significant conversation is ever really made.

[C, D, and I were originally a separate friend group, but C and D began drifting apart and now don't really talk on a regular basis.]

-I'm very close with C, the two of us would hop on a skype or discord call almost everyday for a while and talk, play games, and watch anime. However, recently C got into a certain fandom that I just don't have much real interest in, and ended up joining a server full of fans of that media. They made their own huge friend group within that server, and now a lot of C's time goes to their group of friends irl or the people in that server. I gave the media a fair shot, but it didn't hold me at all, and I joined the server and tried my hardest to engage with the others but they really only cared about the friend group they had established. They'd play games and basically exclude me (whether it was intentional or not I don't really know) so rather than making them friends of my own, they made me feel more like an awkward stranger butting into their fun. Now, when C and I talk, it's mostly silent since I have no interesting things to talk about that C would really care about, and all C has to talk about is that new friend group. We'll sit there for a bit, watch our anime in mostly silence, and when it's over C will leave and always go to that other friend group. Sometimes they'll straight out tell me that's where they're going, and other times they'll cut our anime watching short saying they're too tired, but proceed to stay up to ungodly hours with that new group. I've tried suggesting playing games that C is interested in that I have (I have to do the scuffed method of putting my phone in front of my tv, but I figure it's better than nothing and can still be a somewhat fun experience), but C will cut off our calls so quickly that there won't be any chance to do so.

-D is a strange case. D and I have cycles of talking for a good few days straight, and all of a sudden it'll just stop for a while. D and I usually play minecraft together, but D has a very loud, busy household full of a big family so it's difficult to ever understand them while we play, since there's always someone next to them watching another tv, talking to someone, etc. Sometimes, D will invite their significant other (K) to play with us, but K often stays muted and rarely speaks to me. So it's always me barely being able to understand D and barely being able to talk to K. It's fun when it's just the two of us, but D always tries to merge their friend groups, and it never goes well, so it's always a very awkward, not very fun experience.

-E is my older cousin who I only recently started hanging out with. We were both under the impression that the other wasn't really into the same things so we rarely interacted, but we came together and realized our interests kind of overlapped. Normally, E would be away at college hours away, but wasn't able to get a dorm with their friends, so they're essentially stuck with whoever is nearby, and that happens to be me. I enjoy hanging out with E, but E has their own job and their side of the family is very strained so they're having their own problems pretty often and that results in us only hanging out when E is free.

-Lastly, F is my significant other. F has always been the opposite of me in most ways. They're very well off, charming, good looking, and charismatic. F got into a great university and made their own group of friends really easily. Our interests are the same at a base level, but still relatively different. F plays harder games (think dark souls type games), horror games, competitve fighters, and competitive mobas. I play strictly casual fighters (not well, either) and mostly single player games like jrpgs or puzzle games and am way too lighthearted for most horror. F watches almost exclusively shounen anime like the big 4 or things like Hajime no Ippo. I watch short, easy to digest stuff with either a very heavy plot or near none at all. I try to engage with F's intersts, but F doesn't engage with mine at all. They'll put down the games I try to get them to play before they even get past a tutorial, will skip through the shows I try to get them to watch or sit there on their phone the whole time and call them dumb. I find it hard to talk to F about a lot of things, since it feels like they just don't completely care, and I can't really talk about my issues because it feels like they don't relate whatsoever.

I'm not sure what I should do. I feel like a toxic friend/partner at times because I just feel so protective over them. I never want to hold them back and am always genuinely happy for any successes they have in making new relationships, but I can't help but wonder if they'll get tired of me and leave in the end. I don't want to guilt trip them into staying with me. On the rare occassion that I've voiced my opinions, I've either gotten what feels like hollow responses that seem like they only say to keep me happy or nothing at all. I try to engage with other people and make new friends, but it's been hard. I've tried joining social media platforms and trying to get mutuals with common interests, but the mutuals have their own overpowering interests that I can't get into half the time because they don't hold my attention. I try to engage regardless and join servers, but more often than not I'm ignored because the people in the servers have friend groups of their own already. I don't know where else to turn.

TL;DR My small friend group all seem to be growing apart from me and making new friends hasn't had any success so far. Please don't hold back and give me your honest opinions, no matter how cruel they may be. I want to grow somehow from this and find some way out of this mindset.",28Aug2020,1
282,"Quite frankly I’m pretty irritated at this point and will take any advice. 

Basically my husband and I moved to a new state (WA) before the pandemic broke out, and struggled a lot since we lost our jobs almost immediately. We got back on our feet but also needed to find a new rental ASAP. There was slim pickings in our area at the time, and we found this tiny cute home only 2 blocks from my job. Huge backyard, remodeled kitchen, decently affordable. I was happy! But now that we have lived here for a few months, it was the worst decision in housing I’ve ever made and i don’t know what to do. 


So far our air conditioner has broke, we found mold inside the washer and dryer, found mice droppings in 3 of the bathroom cupboards, found a spider infestation in our entrance. Found spider nests INSIDE the air conditioner they provided us. The dishwasher broke. We have noticed a very large number of spiders all throughout the house, not just one or 2 here or there. We find like 10 a day. Now we have found that multiple rats/mice have been living behind our dryer. I honestly believe there to be either black mold or some other issue within the walls or something making everyone sick in here. Both my husband and I have been having health issues ever since we moved in here. My dogs have even been acting odd since moving in here. 

There are several miscellaneous things that have been problematic but not enough for it to be a reason to move out. There is major damage to the walls (they dressed the place up really nice for showings and because of covid were no longer doing walkthroughs before move in. The carpet was ripped up in our bedroom corners. The bathroom sink did not drain. The jetted tub needed to be fixed. The side yard was overgrown with weeds, and trash filled that they were supposed to clean up and never did. 

The leasing company had normal reviews and nothing too horrible said about it, but they’ve been horrid to deal with. Took them 2 weeks in the middle of one of the hottest months to replace our air conditioner. Decided to no longer clean the side yard that was destroyed and overgrown. I’ve called 3-4 times about the bug infestation and supposedly someone was supposed to come spray, but they’ve never sent anyone. We have spent probably $300 of our own money trying to resolve the spider/bug issue. Not to mention $500 to clear the side yard in which we were getting complaints about by the neighbors. Probably another $100 to fix the broken sink, broken tub, broken garbage disposal and broken dish washer. 

Oh not to mention, they also do not know how we pay our electric bill. Like I have literally called them probably 5 times specifically asking if I pay through a company, or if I pay it to them or the city. I haven’t gotten a bill or any response from them. So like are my utilities going to get shut off being they’re stupid? 

I guess it’s my own doing not having done my research about the leasing company, maybe if I would have dug deeper. I’m honestly always really anxious about these things, and thought this company was okay. It was definitely just the difficulty and uncertainty of being in an entirely new city, in a different state, not knowing anyone, in the middle of a pandemic with little to no options of companies willing to work with people without long work history within the town. 

I took pictures of all the damage once we realized it was there, tried to keep copies of receipts of what we spent, and wrote every small detail on our check in list. But if I’m being honest, I want out. I’m sick of finding spiders everywhere, and cleaning mice turds every day, and everything breaking and the company doing nothing about it. And literally not being able to breathe in my own house. 

Do I put up with it and try and get a reimbursement for what we have spent? Do I break my lease? Do I just complain? I would be willing to stay with the company if they could resolve the issues in the home or move us into a different property that didn’t have these issues.",28Aug2020,1

284,"The situation went as this:
During her weekly visits to her dad's house, my girlfriend's (who I will call Sarah) dad (who I will call Jared) was having an argument with his ex girlfriend (who I will call Anna), about their toddler son. Anna asked my girlfriend previously that if anything were to happen to her, if she would teach the child leftist views; my girlfriend's dad is a Trump supporter. This was brought up in the argument when Anna said ""Well, Sarah agrees with my leftist bullshit!"", And to that Sarah's dad looked at Sarah in her eyes and said ""well, don't anybody worry, I'm gonna be gone first, soon.""

Sarah, who has a past involving suicide and suicidal tendencies, was immediately triggered and impacted by what he said. I'm worried for her mental state, she has been diagnosed with depression and has been working so hard through it. She said that this has brought up memories about the time period where she was suicidal. She keeps thinking about how if he were to do something, it would be her fault. They don't have the best relationship, in fact it has gone downhill into crap slowly for the last 2 years. 

She talked to her mom about what happened, and her mom told her that when her and Jared would get into arguments as a couple, he would say similar things such as ""I'm not even gonna make it to 30"". The situation is obviously taking a toll on Sarah, she says she can't stop thinking about it, I would like to know if anyone has any tips on how to help or be a good partner in this situation.

285,"Warning very weird story lol….

When I was a dorky 17 year old, I was lonely so I went on online chatrooms. It wasn’t long before I started talking to a man who I thought was in his 20s… long story short we talked almost everyday and got along so well. We also had some type of flirty relationship, until a few years later when I grew tired of not being able to visit him and date him in person, so I told him to come on camera so we could talk, he had no choice but to finally tell me that he was a catfish all along, he really liked talking to me and didn’t wanna tell me who he was to scare me away. He was actually a way older man, married, with 3 sons my age. I was SHOCKED of course and considered ghosting him, but by that time, we were talking almost every day, he knew everything about me, he got me through some tough life events, he got me through a few mental breakdowns/suicidal thoughts as well. I barely had any friends and he was the only person I leaned on in my life. So we are still friends til this day. We don’t talk as much as we did before, and its way less sexual now, lol he still wants to see sexy pics of me but I haven’t sent them in years… 

I was trying to explain to one of my friends this story and he was like man this guy is a pervert talking to you and getting nudes from you while you were 17? Come on he only wants one thing hes a pervert. And one part of my mind says yes, that was shady of him to do.

Normally it doesn't bother us because we're at work but now that we have nowhere to go its becoming ridiculous. Generally I'm pretty civil and good at writing letters to people, but right now I want to turn his head into a drum kit. He's using his amp and while we have a pretty big house, no matter where we go in it all we can hear is the bass. He also has a tendency to idle his motorbike for 45 to an hour without driving anywhere. Every part of me just wants to ring the council and get them to deal with it, but multiple people have said I should give him the chance to stop before I get them involved. I don't want to go over there either because I'll probably just start yelling at him. My partner also has tinnitus so his mental health is on the decline because of the constant loud noise (he can't use headphones either) Any help would be appreciated.

290,"I'm 27. ive never had sex. Ive only been in one relationship, if you removed 3 or 4 days from my life you would remove all the physical in person interaction Ive had with a women romantically. I can talk to women fine, several friends are women and its good. but I just don't know how romance works.

I'm pretty religious at times. Don't want to talk about that AT ALL. But its relevant for the next part.

I started watching porn when I was younger. about 4 or 5 years ago I started talking to women online, sometimes sexually. I just feel so absurdly lonely that I don't know how to deal with it. I just want to feel a connection with someone.

I got to the point where I felt like I need to talk to someone sometimes. I'm super inexperienced sexually and sometimes I just want to say fuck it and fully immerse myself in sexual pleasure, at least as much as i can online. i try to find women who are willing to talk to me and basically just casually talk about sex in voice chat, share porn we like with each other, watch it together while chatting,ect .when seeking stuff out sexually online, people want kinks, or roleplay, or a performance. I just want to have a fucking conversation most of the time. Like I literally just want to talk about it not put on a performance or have one performed for me

That fills me with guilt. But then I have nights like tonight where I just a few days ago said ""i'm done"" and deleted all my accounts, and have this hole left, where I just want to hear a pretty woman voice tell me im not a horrible disgusting person for engaging in sexual desires. I just want to feel wanted, or at least not repulsive.

I don't know wtf to do, i'm tired, and i hate myself.

in a perfect world I'm looking for someone to help me get comfortable with being sexual. Like becoming friends with a woman but the friendship , while being a real friendship, more or less existing due to the sexual component. Someone who will voice chat with me often and talk to me about sexual stuff and who I can casually be sexual ""with"", what I mean by with is that she could talk, send me porn she likes, i send her porn I like, we talk about fantasies, she would encourage me to masturbate while talking with her, who really wants to help me become more comfortable with mysexuality and can handle the weird bits of guilt and embarrassment I have around it after I get off. She would almost be motherly but of course not in a weird way. I guess she would be emotionally ""warm"" for lack of a better word. Like she would be EXTREMELY kind and caring towards me without being condescending, but just truely wanting to help me get comfortable with sexuality

I know I'm not going to find that and I have no fucking idea how to even go about it.

Also:

I think one of my biggest frustrations is that, I feel like a creep by seeking out sexual stuff online. Whatever form that may take (interactive or not). I'm not sure how to seek it out without feeling a little slimy, even if I'm not actually doing anything wrong. I'm respectful, upfront, careful to understand and not cross boundaries. but despite all that there is a little bit of a feeling i get on sites like reddit or whatever when I'm seeking out anything, especially if it involves another person. I don't know how to shake that and thats actually what bothers me quite a bit. I know its not wrong to want to interact sexually, I know its normal, and I am very respectful in the way I approach it. But I always feel like I will be judged for it, or that I will be put in a box like ""oh he is just another guy who only wants in my pants"" even if I also want to know them as a person.",28Aug2020,1

302,"Here’s the context. My boyfriend (21M) has an adopted cousin that we’ll call Tom. Tom is 19 and was recently convicted, reason unimportant.

I come from a small city and Tom’s case blew up amongst the youths in our community, so everyone knows about it. There’s tons of evidence against him. Tom is in detainment right now since they’re still investigating the case and gathering all the evidence against him. 

Anyway, Tom’s adoptive parents are apologists who believe their son has done no wrong and have set up an altar for him, pray for him every day, and visit him to ‘comfort’ him in prison or wherever he is. The issue arises from my bf staying with Tom’s parents while he’s completing his mandatory national service, which is basically military training. Tom’s parents are bf’s distant aunt and uncle, btw- it’s not like they’re immediate family. 

Tom’s parents know that bf and I are dating, and have barred me from ever visiting their home to ‘protect’ Tom’s case since they have the altar and everything. They don’t want me to see it. On top of this, Tom’s mother is also forbidding my bf from leaving the house to see me or his friends, and disallows him from staying out past 6. She says it’s because she wants my bf to ‘spend more time with her’ and ‘get to know him better’. It sounds like she’s trying to project Tom onto my bf- she’s going beyond her obligations as a host and acting like my bf is her new son, even doing things like thinking about implementing a tracker in my bf’s phone to keep an eye on him. He’s 21, for chrissakes, and he’s a well-behaved polite boy. She has NO reason to be helicopter-parenting him like this. She even dislikes us playing PS4s online together, so we can’t have that (plus when my boyfriend does get to leave camp, he’s super exhausted and often doesn’t have the energy to game, which I totally understand). 

I only see my boyfriend once every 1 or 2 weeks now because I’m in my second year of college and things are getting very busy, and it’s affecting both of us so much.

My bf says he hates it too but can’t do anything because he doesn’t have anywhere else to stay during his military training. My home is out of the question since I still live with my parents and they would never allow it.

303,"I (28f) kinda feel like a dick for posting this here since it seems like there is a lot more serious post but shit I’ll give it a shot.

I’ve had shitty sleep and sleeping habits for the past 13 years. Ever since I got pregnant when I was 16. The twins sleep great but I don’t! I just need suggestions.

Here is what I know:
I can sleep pretty easily during the day hours, especially in the afternoon. It doesn’t take me long to pass out. 
I absolutely cannot sleep with someone else in the same bed. 
It doesn’t matter how tired I am at night it takes hours. 
My brain just won’t shut off. I think about everything at the same time. 
My job isn’t too stressful and I enjoy it
I am on depression meds and b12 vitamins.
I don’t really snore. 
I am a light sleeper once I am asleep. I wake up to any noise.
It is really hard for me to motivate myself to get up in the morning because I’m so tired and I feel like I just fell asleep finally. 
I don’t drink any energy drinks/shots. 
I don’t drink alcohol regularly or smoke weed.
I’ll have an occasional edible but that’s about it. 

Here is what I’ve tried: 
Cold room 
Hydroxyzine - go bumped to 50mg
No electronics for 1 hour before sleep
1 Benadryl at night
Weighted blanket 
White noise - rain noise
New bed
Fan on/off
Hot/cold shower before bed
Sleeping in different positions
Body pillows 
Melatonin
Masturbation

I do have insurance but I’m still worried about the cost of a sleep study.

304,"For the most part of my life I've been a fucking weirdo. I can't talk to people without having a panic attack. That wasn't much of a problem when I was a teenager, I could just sit in my room pretending I don't exist. Well I still do it, but I'm almost fucking 30, living with my mom. I only ever had one job in my life when I was 20, which I wish didn't happened. I was so glad to not be a fucking leech in my parents life anymore, I could help them pay bills and stuff. And I was good at my job, and I enjoyed it, I didn't have to interact with anyone. That didn't last long. A coworker screwed up, and me and other 3 people got the blame for it. I thought it was a stable job, so why couldn't I purchase stuff with a credit card like everyone else? So I just did what I always do. Pretend I don't exist and expect the problems to just go away. That worked, for a few years. Now there is no way in hell I could pay that debt, they are threatening to take away states in my name, which I don't have any because I'm fucking useless. I'll have to pay for lawyers with money I don't have. I could just ask my parents to make a loan and help me pay it and drag them with me to this hellhole, but I'm not going to.

So this leaves no option to me to just finally do what I have always pretending to be doing, just stop existing. I'm really really looking for any reason not to, but it's fucking hard man. I wish things turned out differently, I wish I was different, but it doesn't work like that.

305,"I’ve lived in this apartment for a little over 2 years now. The unit is apart of a fourplex, each apartment mirroring the adjacent. I share a living room wall with an young adult male, his female cousin(? not sure how they’re related but i’m p sure they’re cousins) and their 3 toddler to young child aged kids.  It’s. Fucking. Torture. 

Things were decently quiet for the first few months, but now it’s fucking obnoxious. Their kids bounce off the walls from 8am to 10pm, and at about midnight to 5am, they blast this godawful bassboosted music and heavy metal through their stereo system so loud that it physically vibrates our entire side of the apartment and beats into my very soul. It’s almost 2:30am as I am writing this and it’s like they’re purposefully scrolling through the loudest songs on their playlist one by one. It’s almost 2x as loud as it usually is. 

Now, I’m not some old boomer that hates loud noises and kids or anything, but after a while it’s just fucking tiring. It’s not just weekends, it’s almost EVERY NIGHT. 

I’ve tried calling the cops. I don’t think they even showed up. And if they did show up, it’s seemed to only make it worse. I connected to their system via bluetooth, fucked around on my own playlist just to see if it would make something click in their heads. I have my tv against their wall, and I watch the office late at night at about 50 (which is a lot louder than my taste, but i’m just pissed off at this point).

I would go to them in person, but from the very few interactions we’ve had, they are NOT pleasant people. One night I was trying to get sleep before work and they kept me up, so i banged on the wall. Music didn’t change. I connected to their bluetooth and played “Shut the fuck up” by Joji, and they came close to bashing my door down and yelling at me from our shared porch. 

My fiancé and I are both trans, and we live in a VERY right-winged area with f*g beaters left and right as well as Trump propaganda galore. 

I just want to sleep at night, not forever, if you get me.

Please someone help me get back at them in a preferably legal way.",28Aug2020,1

I went to talk to her friends and they also have no idea what's going on. She made an  online friend (we’ll call him Sam) and claims that they’re together, which is most likely not true. 
Her friends confronted her and told her that she is confused and delusional for thinking she is in a relationship with a person she talks to here and there. She did not respond well to this and threatened them. After threatening them, she usually says “I love you” or “Thank you for being concerned. You’re so caring” in a passive aggressive manner. 
I don’t think she’s entirely delusional, she seems to act the way she does for a reason. For example, she talks to Sam over text and has for a while, and when he said he had a girlfriend the other day on stream I think she thought he meant her.
Please give advice on why she’s acting like this, how to help, or if anyone here can provide insight on what she’s or saying or meaning to say, as her speech can be confusing and difficult to understand sometimes. She seems like shes ignoring any sign of help and i’m really concerned.

320,"So, over the past few months, I (20 M) have been talking to a girl (19 F). We hit it off really really well, and soon we began to talk everyday. She lives in a different state, so I can’t really see her and hang with her. But as we’ve talked more and more, we’ve gotten really close. We’ve begun to talk about the possibility of a relationship, but said we’d only make it official when we were together in person. 

I have her address and I send her gifts past S/Os would have gotten: hoodies, t-shirts, and the like, from my closet. So she was already pretty into me. 

She told me to call her pet names like “baby”, “honey”, etc. she was also down with me calling her “mine”. 

So we were already really close and comfortable imo, in somewhat of a relationship. Now comes the main issue. We were just FaceTiming, and she opened a package from me over the camera, in it containing an old sweater from me. We talked for a few hours and in a tired haze, I basically said the following: 

“I know we don’t want to make it official until we are together in person, but I want to say something. There is love between friends, and there is love between lovers and long term relationships. I love you more than just a friend, but not to the extent of a lover. You’re amazing, love ya!” 

Then she basically said that I was “interesting”. I asked her if she liked what I said (I usually do, and with everything else, she says she loved it.), and she said that it was interesting. Then I spent the rest of my time basically saying “I’m sorry, it’s how I feel, was it too much, too strong??” She would say no, it’s how I feel, and she was happy I shared.

After a while, we said goodnight. And she wasn’t super excited overall. Now I’m worried I fucked up what we had by being to strong, by apologizing too much after, or possibly even not being forward enough. In other situations where she would be upset with what I had said, I would just let the days take their time, and eventually things go back to normal. Now, she isn’t necessarily upset, but idk what to call this. 

Did I fuck up beyond repair? Or is there something I can do?",28Aug2020,1

While some of y'all may suggest not correcting them, I at least want to explore my options. First is a standard boob job. However,  from my understanding, while my areola will enlarge to some extent with a boob job, the ratio of boob to nipple will remain largely the same, not fixing the problem.  As for focusing on the nipple specifically, most places only offer areola reduction surgery, but that  is the opposite of what I want. I also stumbled upon areola tattooing, but that is typically only offered for breast cancer patients who are undergoing reconstruction surgery. In my situation, I just want to enlarge my areola a slight degree so that they look somewhat normal, so I was thinking of a ring tattoo around my nipple that looks like a natural extension of my areola. However, I have never heard of anyone doing something like this, or whether it is even possible for that matter. 

Have any of y'all had any experience in trying to correct your areola size? Were you happy with the results? Any advice for my particular situation would also be greatly appreciated.",28Aug2020,1
325,"A few months ago I uploaded a video to Facebook that I regret. The reasons why I regret it are not important....I regret it for personal reasons. It’s not super offensive or anything, but I wish I never posted it and feel like an ass.

In addition: I very rarely post to Facebook. It’s still the last thing I have on my profile, so as soon as someone clicks on my page, it’s the first thing they see. I just don’t like to post often.

Despite being uploaded months ago, the video is still getting views almost daily (I don’t view it myself so they’re not my own views). But if I take it down, people will notice and think (or even worse...*ask*) why did I take it down?

This has been bothering me for months. I realised something after posting it that made me regret posting it. Do I take it down and bear the cringe until hopefully it blows over and people forget about it, keep it up, or do something else?

Just wish I’d never posted it.",28Aug2020,1
326,"I wasn’t really sure which forum to share this in but I need some advice. 
Next door to my house, they have build a 6 bed living facility. A few years ago, there was a hearing and we approved it because we thought it was beneficial and a good thing for the society. However, now they want to expand to 12 beds and as a community we oppose this. There’s trash everywhere, cars parked alone the entire street, loud revving and music at odd hours, ambulances on our narrow street all the time, and countless other disturbances. My neighbors have emailed our councilman and he believes the best thing to do is have a meeting a the owner. We’ve already explained our complaints to the city and the committee who makes the decision. 

Do you all think it’s necessary to meet with the owner or will it be a waste of time and de minimize our opposition?

327,"I'm 19 and in my second year of college, but I don't want to be in college. I'm only in college because my mom wants me to and I'm majoring in business to satisfy her because she wouldn't let me pursue a career in art or at least major in it which was what I actually wanted to do. I'm a first generation college student so getting a good job with a degree is what my mom wants me to do since she struggles financially doing manual labor.

Ever since I started college I hated what I was doing, I dreaded every class thinking how I'm just ending up one step closer towards a career I don't want to be in where I'll work in an office cubicle for the next 40+ years, but I dealt with it because I told myself a career in business would give me a stable job and income. Now that I'm starting my second year, these feelings have just grown stronger and I find it almost unbearable dealing with college and feel like I'm in a quarter life crisis.

For some time I've been finding myself frequently thinking how everything would be easier if I just died. I don't know if I'm suicidal since I don't really think about harming or killing myself and never have attempted to, but I just think ""I wouldn't have to deal with all of this if I was just dead"".

But I feel like I could simply be overreacting or that my problems aren't valid since I have this privilege of going to college compared to others who have real problems that are worse. 

So I was just wondering if I should just go see a counselor/therapist.",28Aug2020,1

For some reason it's very hard for me to sit still and really focus on something productive even if I usually like doing it. Recently I had the house to myself so I didn't have any of my usual distractions but I couldn't sit down to write or draw even though I've been telling myself to do it one of these days. The only explanation I can think of is I'm afraid once I start my mind might start to drift and I'll get caught up in my own head to the point where I freak myself out.

334,"Bare with me I hope I'm making sense and this is not to jumbled or boring... 
For a while now and its building up more and more gradually getting worse I just can't stand people, my own friends and family included (for the most part).

I am avoiding people as much as I possibly can I find myself staying in my room for the most part to stay away from interacting with people.

Even my best friends, I can't even stand them talking to me, when they are speaking the whole time I am just thinking 'shut the fuck up' in my head over and over I barely listen to what they say only just enough to give a subtle reply like 'yeah' 'omg' 'wow' so they think I'm actually engaging with them and not a terrible person/friend.

My thoughts irritation and anger towards people 'bothering' me are escalating in my own head, from the outward I act normal smile nod say a few things I don't think they suspect anything (as far as I'm aware).

Literally the whole time someone is talking to me I'm waiting for it to be over, I literally can't wait for it to be over I'm pleading in my head thinking go away, stop talking, I can't wait until they leave, I try and end the conversations, or think of an excuse to remove myself from it or don't engage as much as poss so it doesn't continue.

I literally have the worst thoughts ruining through my head when they're speaking, friends might be telling me about their day, work, their family, a funny story or a rant about something silly that's happened and I'm literally thinking when will this end, they're so annoying, a constant thought is I actually don't give a fuck about this, sometimes I play over scenarios in my head about what I would love to say to them instead of pretending to care/listen its always mean thoughts like 'no one fucking cares' 'this isnt funny' 'you've already told me this before' 'I don't care about what your family and/or friends are doing' 'I literally couldn't care less about your sister and her boyfriend'

Sometimes my thoughts are shouting and screaming in my head, like they're a separate entity or person so angry and so unbelievably annoyed.

Honestly it's frustrating me alot because I feel like I can barely have a normal conversation with anyone how can I carry a normal relationship with any human being be it friends, family, co workers if this is how I feel all the time.
It kinda scares me too...

I'm wondering if this is just me? Has anyone experienced this before, something similar? Is there any cause of it. Any advice/tips/wisdom",28Aug2020,1
335,"Back in middle/high school I was a fucking loser who was bullied, I had no friends and didn't really do anything interesting, I had a drug phase and did some dumb shit. but that's probably the most interesting shit that's ever really happened in my shit life. 

To make my life sound more interesting, I started lying. I would lie/exagerate about small things to make myself feel better about my shitty and boring life that was going on at home. For example: I would maybe do acid one night, but tell people that I was taking multiple tabs instead...shit like that. 

As I got older I started lying and exaggerating less and less bc I realized it's pointless...It's not gonna make me feel better about myself and it's overall just tiring. I would lie about shit that didn't even fucking matter and shit that no one could ever give a rats ass about. 

I'm 18 now, but there is one big ass lie that I regret and w more time eats me up more and more everyday. I had an imaginary friend I made up in 6th grade, I would talk to him during class and would hang out w him during school. I contuined to have this friend up to high school, he was something I created for myself to talk to and do dumb shit w and not feel so alone in life considering I had a shitty childhood and shitty situation going on at the time. No big deal, right? Well, it got to the point where I convinced myself that he was real, but at the same time I knew he wasnt. I would talk to him and I would see him, but I knew he wasn't real at the same time. I could always see him and hear him, but it started to get to the point where I had to question if he was actually real or not...it started really escalating in 9th/10th grade I started bringing him up to friends, I would make social media for him, Photoshop pics of ""us"" together, my friends had him added on ""his"" accounts and everything. Fuck, one of my friends even ""dated"" him for a month it started escalating more and more to the point where I didn't even know if he was real or not and I'm the fuckass that created him. I would talk to ""him""/myself on social media it felt like it was a real person, I would ""talk"" to him face to face knowing he wasn't even there and wasn't real, etc.  Everytime i reminded myself he wasn't real to bring myself back to normality it's like I would almost go ""psychotic"" and would have to prove to myself and others that he was real.

I got scared and panicked, my friends believed he was real, everyone did and I scared myself w how much this imaginary friend in 6th grade has become alive to me and all my friends around me. I would take time out of my day and life to go ""hang out"" w him.

When I was 16 I decided it needed to end and I needed to bring myself back to reality...instead of being smart and honest what did I fucking do? Kill the lie w another lie...as if I wasn't being dumb and shitty enough I told everyone that he died. This fuck even became a friend of my friends and I made everyone sad and depressed and told him he killed himself. Why, why did I fucking do that? This imaginary friend was so real to me that I cried. I could see his death, I could hear it and everything,  I sat there and mourned his death like he was real, I created a sloppy ass sob story for how it fucking happened and of course I had to look like a victim. I wrote and still write letters to his/my fake accounts about how I miss him and I still literally fucking mourn this figment of my imagination. I even fucking cried to my therapist about his ""one year"" death I cried my fucking eyes out about his ""death"" how do I mourn myself?? Maybe it's bc this is something I actually saw and talked to, but i always knew it wasnt real...Ive been diagnosed w schizoeffrctive disorder and maybe that has something to do w it?? But, i know i can't blame it on that bc this is my own doing, he wasn't real so i know it was my own lies at this point. I feel like a horrible person, I've fooled Everyone around me, including myself almost. 

Everyone around me has forgot about him, which is probably a good thing, but there is something that makes me more sick about the situation. I have a boyfriend, me and him have only been dating for about 5 months and as cringy as this sounds he is one of the best things to happen to me. He is healthy for me, honest, funny, understanding, and very fucking smart. He has helped me come back from my eating disorder and has showed me that maybe I'm actually worth something. He takes care of me when I hallucinate/hear things and get paranoid and the one person I can tell all these things to bc he is my safe space. He will hold me and remind me that it's not real. He is the only person I've opened up to about my voices, paranoia, and hallucinations.

This lie has really started to eat me up bc although I have not created new lies, I've still upkept the old ones and that's still lying. I've brought up this imaginary friend to him, my boyfriend held me fucking crying when I mourned his death and I was in tears bc I missed my ""best friend"". Lately this lie has been fucking killing me bc this is the one man I want to be honest to...ive been holding back on telling him the truth behind this bc he relates to the suicide situation bc his dad killed himself...it was something we related on...i felt his pain, but the issue is mine isn't obviously real...im scared to tell him the truth bc this is something that's sensitive to him and he might leave me... I haven't told anyone this and this is something I could totally get away w for the rest of my life, but I feel guilty and disgusting everyday and need to come clean...i need to bring this up to a therapist, but I don't have insurance currently 

Im scared that he is going to leave me for this, but it's something i need to do and he needs to know bc it's something big.

How do I approach this situation and is there any chance of me even being a decent person after lying about something so fucking huge? How do I make up for this. 

I'll be deleting this account in a few days, but...i rlly need help. 

I know now he isn't real and I've been brought back to reality, but every once in awhile when I think about him or miss him I have to remind myself and tell myself he isn't real. I probably sound crazy and horrible and I'm sorry.",28Aug2020,1
336,"About 5 weeks ago, my (18) boyfriend’s (18) left thumb was almost completely amputated in a work accident with a radial saw. He had surgery within a few hours of the accident, and his thumb was saved. It’s been a month and a week and his thumb seems to be recovering slowly, but he’s gone through one heck of a trauma and is not exactly having the best time with it.

The main worry is that he is a drummer- a phenomenal one, he played for a combo of sorts, and was the marching band’s drum tech. However, we don’t know if he’ll be able to play with his left hand again, or if it will ever return to somewhat of a normal. He’s been pretty worried about that- if my memory serves me right, you can’t do traditional grip without a working thumb.

My question for you all is: how do I properly support him through this? We don’t live together, so I’m not with him, supporting him, as often as I’d like to be. We’ve had good days and bad days in the time between then and now, but all I wish I could do is quench his fears and help him through it. It’s extremely traumatizing to go through an amputation like that, and I’m worried about him facing PTSD in the future. I want to give him proper space and time to heal as well, but I want to make sure he knows I’m there for him- and this is a really tough balance. 

I’ve tried some things to brighten up his day, and just so we could spend time together. We’ve been to a museum, gardens (both were very large places with very few people, and yes we wore masks). He loves socks and I’ve gotten him a couple pairs, as well as some stuffed animals and candy. We’ve tried texting about it, but that doesn’t always help.

I’m looking for anything little bit of advice here, literally anything you throw at me. Thanks !!",28Aug2020,1

338,"I had a very close friend in high school and we pretty much went our separate ways after college. Haven’t really been involved in each other’s lives since, except for the occasional hangout with old friends.

Yesterday she messaged me out of the blue saying she needed someone to talk to. And I told her sure whatever you need. She basically delved into her struggle with self harm and suicidal ideation. She has to deal with job stress (she’s a doctor preparing for STEP 1 which is grueling) along with fibromyalgia (chronic pain). Everything just piled on, she fell down the hole and it just got worse. She said she didn’t know what to do.

I listened to what she had to say, and then assured her that it’s alright, she did the right thing talking to someone. I told her to seek medical help and therapy, gave my contact info and that of my own psychiatrist and therapist, and told her to confide in any family or friends (including me) about any stress or trouble she’s in. Told her I’m here for whatever else she needs. She thanked me for hearing her out and that’s about it, the conversation ended.

Now I’m worried about whether or not she’s actually doing okay on her own. It must’ve been pretty bad if she confided in me, someone she hasn’t spoken to in years. So I’m wondering what I can do on my end. If I try to talk to her I might make her uncomfortable, because she did say while we were talking that she felt bad and had the urge to end the conversation right there and then since she thought she was a burden. I assured her she wasn’t but I understand that it’s just her mental health talking.

If I try to meet her, her family might get suspicious of her condition (mental health isn’t really acknowledged here where I live, so families might not be as supportive. Not saying her family isn’t but I’m not sure how they’d receive it). So what should I do on my end to help her out?",28Aug2020,1

And it’s not like I would have known he did one or else I would have said something. But for the last few days at night, I’ll smell smoke and have to dose out the coals.

When i was hired I signed a piece of paper that waived my right to a 30 min break if I worked 6 hours. However, I only work 7-8 hours a day, maybe more. The only break I get offered is a 10 min like an hour before closing, so I basically go all day with no food or break. 

When I asked my coworkers and my manager “what do you guys typically do for lunch?” They just looked at me. I then said “You guys don’t take lunch?” Immediately they started suggesting I drink an energy drink or eat a granola bar or take a 10. I tried to ask “isn’t it mandatory employees who work over 5 hours get a 30 min break?” Again they just talked over me and explained how if one person left it would impact the flow of the whole kitchen and how I would have to work 30 extra min to make up the money.

So should I push this issue with my boss? I’m starving most of my shift and this only makes my crabby and untalkative with my coworkers. Or do I actually have it wrong, and I don’t have the ability to take a 30 min lunch break? I feel like if I left everyone would judge me and treat me as a deserter.

Hi there! I would like you to give me advice about whether I should drop out of university to pursue my dream. I’m gonna give you all the details so please bear with me, thank you.

**I want to quit university and start YouTube/Tiktok.**

I’m 19 years old; I live in a Middle Eastern country where YouTubers aren’t that common. I finished high school in 2018, went to university the next, and then dropped out in the same year. This year I registered in a different, easier major and finished it. I hate university with all my heart. I don’t have any major that I like. I went through a lot of depression and anxiety because of uni; I even had-for the first time in my life-anxiety tics that lasted for a week probably just because of exams. Btw I pay for uni with my own money, it is cheap.

Work:I live with my mom and siblings. We are very poor that’s why during the summer I have to work because I have to pay for my expenses (e.g. if I want clothes I buy them with my own money, if I wanna see a doctor I pay, I also work during the summer to save for uni..) and during winter, because of uni, I tutor students. I also hate working for other people, ABSOLUTELY HATE it when people boss me around**.** During the summer I work at a library. I’ve worked there during the summer of 2017, 2018, 2019, and I’m still working there (I’m actually writing this at work). I work for 9 hours from Monday to Friday. I get paid very very very little and most of the times I get asked to do things I did not sign up for. Not to lie, there’s not a lot of customers coming and going so that’s why I can film here if I want to start Tiktok and/or YouTube.

I wanna be a YouTuber so bad. It’s been my dream since 2015 probably. But, I don’t have the necessary gadgets to film. I just have my phone, I don’t have any ring lights, and my phones front and back camera are very awful (quality wise).

My plan was to do tiktok (it is an app that the probability of someone getting known is much higher than youtube) and then start youtube but as I mentioned earlier I really love youtube so I decided to do both (I started YouTube less than a year ago uploaded 2 videos then stopped uploading and deleted my videos  and I started tiktok afterwards I got some followers got unmotivated deleted my videos then I started again then deleted my videos basically I was very indecisive so now I deleted my videos and I have 184 followers and 1298 likes) my problem is that I literally don’t know what to do for my youtube channel and also tiktok. But I definitely want to make funny videos but I’m scared of not being funny enough or cringy… I want youtube to be a platform where I can express whatever I want and get creative.

I also think that uni is there forever but I can’t pursue my dreams at 30 years old, you know? Plus, the opportunities that I have right now might not exist 2 days later or even 10 years later. 

My mom would go insane if I dropped out so I talked about dropping out of uni and starting YouTube a year ago with her, she refused and called me uncreative, but I know that I have potential. The purpose of me saying this is to show that no one supports what I wanna do and I actually don’t plan on telling anyone I know that I have a tiktok account or a YouTube channel until I have a good amount of following. My mom was okay with doing uni and YouTube BUT if I want to do uni; I have to work a part time job so I won’t have time to do YouTube. There’s one time when I asked her if I had a lot of money would you still want me to go to uni and she said no, so her saying that means she doesn’t care about education, she just doesn’t want me to go broke or need people. 

**So, should I start YouTube/tiktok and quit uni? Or should I continue uni and never thing again about doing Yt/tiktok?**",28Aug2020,1

355,"So I recently got a job offer that I am super excited about and was planning on putting in my two weeks today. I wake up feeling kinda hot so I took my temperature and it says 99.4. So far I only have a slight headache, and no other symptoms. I’m worried about still putting in my two weeks in case my new employer rescinds their offer. I scheduled a time this weekend to use Wal-greens’s drive thru covid testing and in the meantime I was thinking about reaching out to the recruiter and seeing what she says, before putting in my two weeks. I’m stressed because of the fear of having covid and potentially missing out on what is a better paying opportunity. Any advice?",28Aug2020,1
356,"I didn't know where to post. If you know of a better subreddit for my situation, I'll crosspost there.

I'm 22F from France. Ever since I was in middle school, I wanted to be a teacher. That made my mother very happy, because she also wanted to become a teacher but her own mother never allowed her to go to university. So she decided to support me from A to Z in my endeavour. I was always a good student, I always had good grades, I never repeated a year, I never did drugs, never smoked, hardly drink any form of alchohol, I never got into a fight, never been arrested, or anything of the sort that could cause a parent distress. After I graduated high school in 2016 I went to university to get an English degree. I got it in 2019. I enjoyed most of what I studied, I met some good people. So I applied for a Masters degree in teaching so I could follow ""my dream"". But it never was a dream. It probably was just my mom's, I never had any convictions and I just made up arguments to convince myself and others what I wanted to do. The truth is, I don't know what to do, and it's eating at me. I had two internships of two weeks each, one at a high school and one at a middle school as part of my curriculum, mostly to observe a teacher and how they work, but also to give classes myself. And I did not enjoy any of it, I woke up with a pain in my stomach, I gave classes to the kids/teenagers out of obligation, and not because I wanted it. It felt like I was stuck in a role that I never wanted. But I lied to everyone, said I enjoyed it, and pushed through the term of my first year in my Masters because I did not want to disappoint people, even if I did not enjoy any of the classes pertaining to teaching (which did not prepare us at all for the job, either), and also because I did not have an escape plan. Even with putting minimum effort into the whole thing (I still enjoyed my English classes, and I had a blast writing a baby thesis on Star Wars) I still passed the first year with a very decent GPA (13/20). 

Classes stopped in March because of the COVID situation, and between March and May-June I was overwhelmed with work. I was supposed to take my teacher competitive exam in March, but it got postponed until early July, and only the written exams were maintained, which are not representative at all of whether or not you have what it takes to become a teacher. Because of all the work our professors gave us for the Masters, without giving us any online classes whatsoever, I only found the time to study for the teacher exam approximately 10 days before it took place. And I didn't study much, because honestly I did not want to take it. Stress was eating at me like never before. But I went and took it anyway, because I was afraid of what my mother might do to me if I didn't. I did not expect to pass, I failed one of the tests, and did not have time to finish the other. 

Late July we got the results. I passed. I felt like I had signed my death warrant. The whole paperwork started for applying to my second year of Masters, with my time being split between uni and teaching at a school for 9 hours. I was placed in a high school, teaching to three different groups. My mental state got worse and worse as the day passed. I cried (still do) a lot, am anxious and terrified constantly, but once again I was too afraid to tell anyone. I met with the director of the school, met with my tutors, and nothing they said alleviated my fears, reassured me or changed my mind. As I feared depression or a huge mental breakdown (and I've had mad over the course of this year), I said no more and told my mom. It did not go well at all. I told her about how bad this whole thing made me feel, that I had never felt this bad in my entire life and that I needed her help to figure things out. That I wanted to stop and find something else. She wouldn't hear any of it. Said I was just a coward who was giving up, that I was just a spineless little wimp who is scared of everything. Yes, because to her my crippling anxiety and mental breakdowns are because I'm afraid to start working. She thinks I don't want to work because I'd rather sit on my ass all day to play video games and watch series. She did not once stop to think that if I do this a lot is because they're my only escape from reality.

But she isn't so wrong when she says I'm scared of everything. I'm an only child, and was raised as what people would called a spoiled child. My mother gave in and cattered to my every need. Everything I wanted, I was given. But I don't recall having any extravagant needs. According to her I just had many temper tantrums. But I was a kid, I did not know any better. I'm grown up now. It's not a temper tantrum, I'm legitimately scared for my mental health and my future. My family created a bubble around me and everything was done for me. My food for uni? My grandmother cooked it. They wouldn't let me do it for myself because they said I wouldn't be able to do it and wouldn't eat if I did. And if I did not finish the food, my grandmother would escalate the situation and call me anorexic. She also made my laundry, hell, she wouldn't even let me make my own bed when I spent my weekends at her place. My mother is taking care of all my financial expenses, including my apartment at the city where I study. Insisted she wanted to do it, and that it's only normal to support me financially because she can. She also helped me with everything paperwork or legal related.But now she's lost her job, and she keeps reminding me of ""all the things we do for you and how ungrateful you are"". That all I have to think about is my studies, and I really shouldn't be complaining. All I'm asking was for some independence, and emotional support. But every time they remind me that I don't know how to do shit on my own. Because they never let me. They keep comparing me to other people my age, saying that they don't make their mother feel so terrible like I do. That I'll never find someone who'll care for me as much as she does. 

The other day, she said that if I were to stop my Masters to do something else, she'd cut me off completely and kicked me out of the apartment she's paying for. She knows full well I can't support myself financially, I don't qualify for scolarships, my dad can't help me because he's tight financially, all I receive is 170€/month (personal housing allowance), which is not enough to live, and won't be receiving it anymore once my studies are over. She insisted that I ""bite the bullet"" and finish my Masters and go teach and then I can do what I want. But I don't know if I can, I'm fucking exhausted and I'm really so done with all of this. Apparently I need it to have things my way all the time or I piss people off. That she's never seen someone with such a shitty behaviour and personality. Gee, I wonder where that comes from.

Yesterday is when things went to hell. We argued yet again about the whole thing, and my grandmother was listening in on the whole conversation. Once again it was insults and reproach. My mother blamed me for her own mental state, saying I needed to realise how badly I made her feel. That sometimes she wished she never had me at all, because she deserve a better child than me. She's been emotionally manipulating me for years now and I'm only beginning to realise. I ended up locking myself in my room. I could hear my grandmother call me a bitch and a nasty piece of work, among other things. My mother later called me, crying, saying she almost got into two car accidents because of the situation, and that I needed to stop thinking about myself for once because I was making everyone's life a hell. She then called my grandmother, ever the abuser herself, and cried. My grandmother kept saying very mean things about me, said that she was sick of me, that she doesn't want to live the rest of her life with me around, that my mother should just give up on her because she doesn't deserve such a shit daughter. She then knocked on my door repeatedly and violently, and threatened to hurt me physically. I couldn't take it anymore, and told my dad about it, who came to pick me up with my other grandmother, his mother. I grabbed all the stuff I could. My PC, my school laptop, my plushies, as many clothes as I could carry, my toothbrush and toothpaste, my consoles... because I was worried that they might burn it or throw it away, and I left without speaking a word to my grandparents or my mother, in tears yet again.

I spent the night at my dad's and I've never felt so terrible. I haven't eaten in 24 hours, my mother kept harrassing by text and phone at 11pm. Saying that she couldn't sleep even with swallowing two pills (apparently she pulled the same stunt on my dad when he left her) and that she needed to speak to me. I didn't reply, I didn't want to, and I couldn't. I was too fucked up. Then 30 minutes later she texted that she understands, that she hopes I find happiness in my endeavours, but that she doesn't understand why I left without saying anything. She added that she'll never contact me again, but that I need to contact them if I need them to bring the rest of my stuff back. I also discovered that she removed 8.6k€ from my bank account last night, which was money saved up for my future home... 

I'm completely lost. I don't know what to do. I'm at my dad's but I won't be able to stay forever, I can't keep my apartment without financial aid, and a lot of my stuff is still there. I can't go back home, at least not now, and I don't know if I can ""bite the bullet"" and go teach for a whole year. I'd have a decent salary but I need to think about my mental health, first. I'd love nothing but to find a job until I figure things out, but the sanitary crisis has left the country in an unprecedented state in unemployment, and my degree isn't worth anything to them. Even more so since I have no profesionnal experience whatsoever save for when I worked a summer part-time job in 2018. I know my worth, I don't want to work a ""shitty"" job"", because I know I deserve better. I will do it if it's my only option, but I want my academic journey to be acknowledged and appreciated. Maybe I'm too naive and ask too much, but I grew up with the mindset that my mother gave me that I could have anything and everything I ever wanted. That's not how the world works. We rarely do what we love, and we rarely get what we deserve. I just want to work a job that doesn't stress me constantly (every job can create stress, I know that and I'm fine with that) and I don't want to have to always worry about making ends meet. Honestly I'd rather not be alive right now. I would never do anything to physically hurt myself, but I honestly would rather not be alive. I feel like my whole world just crumbled on me and that my life is over. I'm supposed to go the high school I'm to teach at on Monday for a meeting with the personnel, and I have training courses Tuesday and Wednesday at uni. But I'm lost, I don't know what I'm going to do.

I need help but I don't know who to turn to. I don't know what to do. Normally my mother was here to help me, but I feel like we've hit a point of no return. She gave me until Sunday to make a decision and I don't know what to do. My whole future is on the line and I'm afraid. Afraid that I'll end up homeless, afraid that I'll never find a solution and remained unemployed, afraid that I'll be all alone. Afraid that I won't survive it and lose my mind. I've never been so afraid and lost.",28Aug2020,1

359,"Alright so first this is a throwaway account cus she knows my actual account and also my first time posting here.

So basically i met my friend here one reddit and we've been talking for about 3 months now. We've gotten pretty comfortable with each other that we are able to share some deep thoughts but recently things have felt different about her. She's a lot more sad to the point where her other friends have noticed. I've actually been asked to try and cheer her up by her friends who I've just recently started talking with. She's been sad before but this time just feels different. Her texts soind cheerful as usual but they aren't giving off thay vibe. I'm not good with all this emotional stuff. I feel like i should just ask her about it but i don't really think its the best idea. 

I know that she likes a guy and i feel like that might be the reason she's upset. She said she was a bit jealous that he was doing things with others. But then one of her friends said it might be their fault. 

Something i do not want to really go into is the possibility that she likes me. She's been asking me questions like if i am ""open for a relationship"" or ready to move on from my last crush. I don't really think anything of those questions but i think it's something i should at least mention. I doubt that she  likes me that way.

I have no idea what to do and i feel like the problem she has might be with me since her friends were asking me to check up on her.

I'm gonna leave this post while i sleep and hopefully someone can give me some ideas. Also i'm sorry if it felt like this was lacking in information all this just started happening and i just am worried about her.",28Aug2020,1
360,"About 7 years ago my then boyfriend, now husband separated due to addiction issues I was struggling with. During this time I met a man who enabled those addictions and also treated me to expensive dinners, ballets, gifts etc. He was prone to fits of anger and would break my things, throw my stuff out the window, scream at me for not picking up my phone, and then buy me something nice to say sorry. It really spooked me so I ended it and blocked his number and from all social media.When I ended it he ended up finding out my parents phone number and harassed them, and sent me multiple emails saying that I owed him money for everything he gave me and to pay it back or he’d sue me. I gave him the number of my lawyer friend and told him to take it up with her if he was seeking legal action. I never heard from him again. 

Shortly after, I got sober, and really straightened my life out. It’s a painful time of my life that I don’t like to think about. My partner and I rekindled a couple years later, got married, and have a daughter. I’ve been sober 6 years. 

This afternoon I received a text from him. “Hi &lt;name&gt; how are you doing?”

“Who is this”

“It’s &lt;name&gt; from &lt;place&gt;. Just saw your number in my contacts thought I’d say hi.”

I immediately blocked the number, but I thought I already had. I’m not even sure if I have the same number I did back then. 

I’m confident that this is some weird power game he is playing. My husband and I don’t talk about that time in our lives often, it’s quite painful and something I wanted to leave behind me. However, I’m afraid. I can’t help but think he’s up to something nefarious. Am I overreacting? What should I do?",28Aug2020,1
362,"My whole life, I’ve been very insecure about my appearance. Before today, no one had ever called me ugly, but I just hated what I saw in the mirror and ESPECIALLY in photos. Over the past few years, I was starting to gain more confidence because I was getting a good deal of attention from guys and a lot of people were calling me pretty. Internally, I still hated my appearance but the external validation served as a bandaid solution. 

However, today, a guy finally called me “unattractive” and I just can’t get over it. I know that everyone has different taste and what’s attractive to one person might be unattractive to others. I also know that this guy was just judging me based on a couple bad photos taken by my friend with an unflattering snapchat filter on. And I also know that he claims that he doesn’t like girls of my race (even though it’s the same as his). But despite knowing all of these things, I can’t shake the feeling that he was right and all the other guys who called me pretty were lying or wrong. I am very disappointed in myself after seeing how just one comment was able to completely shatter the confidence that I had been trying to build up. I feel very silly and immature.

How can I work on this? What can I do to feel more internally confident so that my self-image won’t depend on the words of others? I’m really shaken up by how badly that one little comment hurt me.",28Aug2020,1
365,"my co worker is a fraud

I'm resigning from my current job as I got an offer at a different company with better hours and a much higher salary. I've worked here over 7 years and my relationship with my employer is pretty good. 

About a year ago i got a gut feeling that my co worker ( shes not intelligent at all, worked here about 3 years now) wasn't really honest about her hour registration (we write down our own hours which we get paid) so i decided to see what times she left and what she'd write down in her booklet. And yes i was right, regularly she  adds a half hour extra which she has no right to do (nor do I have the right to check her registration, i snuck around to find out). she's always talking about how happy she is that she works here theres a really comfortable work setting and all that. She got invited by another co worker which has worked here over 10 years and they're good friends. out of work too.

So for now i feel like I feel like i have to tell my employer that she's a fraud but i've never had the courage to do so because i'll destroy alot (shell lose her job and probably her house, her friendship and the company will suffer due to no knowledgable workers when i leave aswell.) 

What do i do?
Tell my employer shes a fraud and destroy alot of things

Don't say anything and leave it all behind where it's not my problem anymore?

tldr;
i'm leaving my job, colleague is fraudulent which i've known over a year. will destroy company and her situation if i tell my employer.

1. I get disgusted at myself for me not being the person who did that amazing feat.

3. I’m jealous of every person’s achievements.

375,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this kind of question but for some background information, I started homeschooling in 7th grade due to social anxiety and other issues. I'm now in 10th grade, still homeschooled, planning on going back to regular school next semester assuming schools will be operating then. 

I don't have any friends and find it hard to make them because of social anxiety. For the past 3 years I've just stayed on my phone ALL THE TIME. No activities, no friends. Just scrolling through YouTube, Snapchat, Instagram etc for up to 10 hours a day. I'm doing online school which I get through in about 4 hours but I'm still addicted to my phone. I check it constantly, despite not ever having any notifications. It's not my parent's fault, they've tried so hard to sign me up for activities and anything to get me to leave my bed, but I always broke down because even the thought of being around people  made me feel nauseous. I feel like my parents have given up. 

Now, I'm still addicted to my phone but I've started doing other things too, reading and painting and taking walks. I take drama classes each week which is hard on my anxiety but at least I'm getting around people.

I'm just regretting the 3 years of my life I've wasted on a screen. I can't stop thinking about if only I'd just stuck it out at school, or been born ten years earlier to experience my teenage years without social media, if only someone had just pried my devices out of my hands and forced me to socialize and do hobbies. I would've hated that of course, but I've just wasted SO MUCH TIME. I literally don't remember anything from 2018/2019.

 I had so much free time and just wasted it, and now I'll have to pay for that. 11th and 12th grade I will just be stuck in my bedroom most of the time studying, then I'll go to college which will be stressful, then I'll get a job and be an adult and still regret the way I spent my teenage years in my room all the time.

Because of this, and because the last couple of years were really shit for me, I began to confide all of my feelings and emotions in her, and for the most part, she was the most supportive person I could have hoped for. 

We grew so much together, and apart from a couple of hiccups during our relationship, we were so so happy with each other. I loved her as well.  That is until I found out that she cheated on me, and I ended the relationship. It wasn't an ongoing thing, but it happened once and that was enough for me. She was very apologetic and came with a range of excuses, and after a couple of weeks of space, I realized that she still made me happy, I started talking to her again in the context of close friends.

For a while this worked, we were both happy to have each others' company and continued to catch up, and we eventually returned to a sexual relationship. Now, this is where the problems started. Some shit hit the fan for me this year, compounded by the lockdown restrictions where I live, so I began to feel lonely and isolated. I of course turned to her for support, however, it quickly became apparent that she was not interested, and blamed all of my problems on me. This was quite a shock to me, as this had never happened before, and I thought perhaps she was right, but when something happened in my life that definitely was not my fault, namely depressive episodes and panic attacks, she dismissed it and would not listen to me anymore.

I was so shocked, and as it turns out, she had began to see a new boy during this time when we were still being intimate, and their relationship had flourished. It felt like a massive betrayal to me, and she began to become icy cold towards me. 

Basically, my question boils down to this. I am in love with this girl, she hates my guts, but she has been the only person I can talk to about my problems which have begun to spiral out of control. How do I move on from this stage in my life? I know I can't continue to let my feelings towards her impact my future, but I can't seem to let go of her. Has anybody been in a similar situation? If so, how did you move on from this? I am turning 18 years old next week, but because of this whole situation, I find myself not looking forwards to my future like I used to.

378,"I won’t go into much detail over why I had panic attacks, but in short:
I was in class. I was told to pair up with the new girl. I had a panic attack because in hs my teachers always paired me up with my bullies and I now fear being paired up.

Second panic attack happened later in that same class. The boys would refuse to get up and do the work, so the teacher raised her voice. I have pretty bad experiences with being yelled at, so even if it wasn’t me who was being yelled at, I felt a panic attack coming.

I then asked the teacher if I could go to the bathroom and now here I am, and have been for the last 30 minutes. School is ending soon but my stuff is still in the classroom, idk how to get it. I’m afraid of going back to fetch it because the teacher will definitely yell at me for skipping class. 

The bus leaves in a few minutes so I don’t have much time. The next bus leaves at 4 (its 12) and I’m already feeling hungry. Mom will yell at me if I buy food. 

What do??",28Aug2020,1

382,"I met up with a women nearly double my age for sex. We got along well and became friends - she is a qualified psychologist so was able to give me some great advice on life, dating and everything really. 

She tells me she's been abused her whole life, from being molested as a child to being abused by her husband verbally and physically. She's been married for 7 years but never slept with her husband - they don't love each other and he beats her regularly. She's had 3 abortions, and is basically a prisoner. I've told her to go to womans' refuge but she feels she is trapped as her husband will screw over her family in India. 

It sounds mega fucked up and it is. She's on tinder cheating behind her husbands back. She likes talking to younger guys as she feels older guys and guys her age are bastards who just use people. One night a guy stood her up and I was the only one comforting her via txt. After sleeping with her once and talking for a few weeks she tells me she loves me. I told her I don't like her like that and that I'm not attracted in that way. 

I would see her every couple of weeks - she would get me off and just give me general advice, and really comfort me when I had bad days. We got along well and I honestly credit her for my change in perspective on life, how to deal with negative emotions and lots more. I cared for her - I really did. She picked me up from the hospital, brought me food and honestly was there for me more than anybody else was at times. 

 All was going well until we started arguing - we would fight almost weekly and it was horrible. She would get annoyed that I was using her and that I would just treat her like any other tinder girls.   I would say some rude and bad things when she annoyed me that would just make things worse. I would lash at her because I just felt she would get mad so easily. 

We probably argued about 7+ times before it all escalated one night when she got annoyed I slept with another girl without telling her. These arguments were bad - screaming, swearing, at each other for hours. My parents kept asking me who I was fighting with and eventually I told them about her. She wanted me to fuck her raw because she loved me and wanted to feel loved. She would get annoyed when I give other girls more attention or go see mates and not give her the time she wants. She would say some really weird things at times and just act super emotional and needy. I drove out to her that night and she pissed me off so much that when she tried to leave my car without explaining herself I grabbed her to restrain her, then I just pushed her out of my car. She hit her head on the seatbelt but was fine after. 

She threatened an assault charge but we worked things out. I regret laying my hands on her to this day. Shortly after another argument occurred and I would scream at her. I have never felt so angry in my life and my parents got involved telling me to cut her off. We did not speak for weeks but we talked again after I was admitted to hospital for appendicitis. We worked things out, but in the last month she got depressed after some guys fucked her then ghosted. She was going thru IVF with her husband and asked me to act as her boyfriend/emotional support person so she can cope with the pregnancy as her husband does not have any time for her. She also started mentioning suicide and ending it and it started to scare me. I wanted out. It was getting so weird. I started to distance myself and she noticed one day ignoring me for nearly 2 days and I legit thought she might have hurt herself. Turns out she was annoyed at me for not checking in and kept saying I don't care about her. I got really annoyed, said some horrible things and we decided to make a truce then end it. 

I have not spoken to her in nearly a month now but I keep thinking about her. I don't want her back in my life because it was a never-ending circle of happiness and absolute pain. I want to resolve this conflict and then part ways on good terms but I'm not sure whether I should reach out. I still feel bad but I know its best to move on. 

The times we got along I was so happy, but when we fought it was honestly horrible. I just keep thinking about her. I was never in love had any sexual desire towards her but we had an emotional connection - she would just understand my pain and know exactly what to say. I cared for her and only ever wanted the best for her. But the fighting brought out the absolute worst in me - I felt anger I have never felt before. 

It is really eating me up inside. I don't want to think about her but I do. How do I move on? What do I do? The whole situation is fucked up I know. I've def left out some other incidents",28Aug2020,1

384,"Over the past month I’ve been trying to live a happier life and it has gone very well and another part of it has been fuelled by helping people. Since last month I started giving to the homeless but I now start to feel really bad for wanting to give more because it makes me feel worse. The first reason it makes me feel worse is that I’m worried the more I give the more I’ll have to give in the future then feel more bad then for not giving that and the second is that sometimes the person will dive into what their going through right now and it’s usually quite a dark story. I dont want to say I don’t want to hear it or just walk away because that would feel very rude but it makes me feel so much worse after hearing it plus making me feel even worse that I’m not giving. I tell myself that if I want to be happier, I have to distance myself from negativity but then it comes back to me that they are probably going through a lot worse than me and their needs matter a lot more than mine. I’m scared of going into my local village in case I’ll see them and feel bad. On the other hand too my mum doesn’t want me giving much stuff because some could be faking and we “can’t afford to do it” which isn’t literal because we have a whole lot more stuff but on the other hand I see what she means and know she’s only trying to protect me. Then this makes me feel bad that I’m not facing my fears and going out of my comfort zone (which is supposed to help and does) but It just keeps sending me down the same spiral. I spend ages trying to convince myself that I’m doing fine and when I eventually do the same thought just keeps lingering at the back of my head saying “I can’t be happy yet”. I then confront this and question myself why and it just happens all over again. On top of all of this I’m going to do a marathon to donate to a homeless charity but my head just keeps telling me “I may as well give more stuff to them because it’s better than not”. The basic picture is I feel like I’m being selfish and not doing good enough for others and worried that the fact I’m not giving will mean I will stop wanting to be kind to others and the same uncertainty every time I feel alright that I’m not done with this thought yet. Any help would be appreciated at all and if not any other subreddit pages that may help too would be really appreciated. Thank you, love you 🙏🏼🙏🏼",28Aug2020,1
385,"Here's a bit of backstory. I have been talking to this girl since I was 12. She was there for me at points in my life where I had absolutely nobody. I was shamed for my weight, for my sexuality, for having 'different' hobbies as a guy and she was there for me. One time I had a manic episode and had to be hospitalised. But she was still there, cheering me on and being there for me. It is thanks to her that I have become the person that I am today.

But things haven't been going well for her, on the other hand. Progressively, her mental health deteriorated as puberty went on. She had severe depression and later got diagnosed with bipolar disorder along with some others. Her relationship with her family has been deteriorating, as her brother became addicted to weed and her parents generally stopped supporting her.

After some time when I first enrolled into uni, I wasn't aware of everything she went through. And I was absolutely shocked and depressed for what she told me. She started to run away from her house and not only that, but also got sexually assaulted by some guys in the streets.

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help her. I love her for saving me at my worst times. And I don't want her to suffer like this.

Any piece of advice would be appreciated.

tl;dr : my penpal told me that she was sexually assaulted and has been living in the streets for a while and i don't know how to help her or support her

391,"I had a very close friend in high school and we pretty much went our separate ways after college. Haven’t really been involved in each other’s lives since, except for the occasional reunions with old friends.

Yesterday she messaged me out of the blue saying she needed someone to talk to. And I told her sure whatever you need. She basically delved into her struggle with self harm and suicidal ideation. She has to deal with job stress (she’s a doctor preparing for STEP 1 which is grueling) along with fibromyalgia (chronic pain). Everything just piled on, she fell down the hole and it just got worse. She said she didn’t know what to do.

I listened to what she had to say, and then assured her that it’s alright, she did the right thing talking to someone. I told her to seek medical help and therapy, gave my contact info and that of my own psychiatrist and therapist, and told her to confide in any family or friends (including me) about any stress or trouble she’s in. Told her I’m here for whatever else she needs. She thanked me for hearing her out and that’s about it, the conversation ended.

Now I’m worried about whether or not she’s actually doing okay on her own. It must’ve been pretty bad if she confided in me, someone she hasn’t spoken to in years. So I’m wondering what I can do on my end. If I try to talk to her I might make her uncomfortable, because she did say while we were talking that she felt bad and had the urge to end the conversation right there and then since she thought she was a burden. I assured her she wasn’t but I understand that it’s just her mental health talking.

If I try to meet her, her family might get suspicious of her condition (mental health isn’t really acknowledged here where I live, so families might not be as supportive. Not saying her family isn’t but I’m not sure how they’d receive it). For now I’ve messaged her again today asking how she is and she said she’s doing okay and ended the conversation.

I (21f) currently live with my dad, step mom, and three siblings (all under the age of 10) in a city that I’ve grown up in. Recently, my dad and his wife had a baby boy and that’s when my relationship with them began to deteriorate. At the time, I was in the middle of spring semester and had just gotten back into college after spending a year to work and save up. I know as the eldest sibling that I should make time to spend with my younger siblings but I’m not the brightest and the classes I was taking were pretty difficult- especially after COVID hit. Classes were moved to remote learning and I spent most of my day in my room focusing on assignments and studying. My dad started getting on my case about not “wanting to spend time with the family” and how “you need to help me, I have three other kids to look after.” I explained to him what was going on in school and he denied it, stating that I was “being lazy and don’t want to spend time with the family” because I have a boyfriend. Ever since that conversation, my step mom refuses to talk to me and my dad is constantly giving me a disappointing look rather than speak to me at all. I began feeling hopeless trying to mend the relationship, but according to my mom and close friends, it seemed like my dad and his wife just don’t want me around anymore. 

At first I didn’t tell my boyfriend (25M) what was going on because I thought I could settle it and clear the air. But as weeks passed, nothing has changed despite me trying to reach out and have a serious conversation. I finally brought this up to my boyfriend due to frustrations and wanting to vent it out, which led to him offering me to stay with him at his place, which is about three hours away. I accepted the offer, however I just don’t know how to tell my dad and his wife that I’m leaving the house to live with my boyfriend. 

My boyfriend and I decided that I can move into his place in January, that way I can finish up my semester in my current city and transfer all my credits to the new school. We talked about everything in regards to me continuing school in his town and all the financial aspects, it’s just telling my dad and his wife that’s been eating me alive. 

I apologize for the long rant but I really appreciate any help or advice in this, it means a lot. 

TL;DR: When COVID hit I spent a lot of my time focusing on school rather than help babysit my dad and his wife’s three kids. My dad and his wife began to stop talking to me/ ignoring me making me feel hopeless and lost. My boyfriend offered me to stay with him 3 hours away, and I’m moving in January. I don’t know how to bring this up to dad and his wife, please help.",28Aug2020,1
409,"So I’m currently a high school senior getting ready to apply for all the universities I have spent all summer researching and am pretty happy with my odds of getting in and the quality of the schools. However, there is one school in the T20 category that I’ve always fantasized attending since I was 15, but my parents area strongly against me applying because they deem the option “unrealistic” and a waste of time.

410,"Hello everyone, for some backstory, my parents always have been happy together et and I (15m) was to.

Here is the problem : We can't talk to my dad anymore, because everytime we try, he finds a way to make use feel bad or ground us, so my mom isn't okay with that, which creates tension between them, but my mom has come to the point where ANYTHING makes her upset. Literally. We left 1 bit of dust on our desk ? She's upset. One small thing can make her upset all day. And because my dad isn't really careful about eveything like housework and dishes, as soon as she wakes up she's upset, and it backfires to me and my brothers/sisters.

I'm also so much afraid of divorce, bcs I know that this will make us live poorly, and when I confront my mom with the divorce, she says : ""We never thought about it, and will never."" but at the same time she keeps saying ""It's time for him to get back to work, I can't endure it anymore"", so I really don't know what to do.

It’s 3am and I cant sleep anymore without taking pills to knock me out. I’m up late thinking about all the pain and suffering I see surrounding those I love and so so so many others in the world.

I feel like I’m in the twilight zone. I ended a year long relationship with someone who I thought about having kids with (I’m fucking 20 what was I thinking) at the start of the year. 

Global pandemic kicks off and now I’m isolated at home. I try to escape through various hobbies but depression sets in and I lose interest in them.

Watching the news, all I can think about are the lives that are constantly being taken and ruined by those with power. I think about how so many take their security and their privilege for granted and silently let the rest suffer. 

I want to fight for these individuals. I want to say their names, fuck I want to scream them. But I can barely fight for myself. Everyone around me is hurting.

All my friends are victims of abuse, trauma, drug addiction, mental illness. All my friends suffer from anxiety and depression. How do I focus on the brighter side when I cant find it?

How do I turn my empathy away? How can I? How can I dare to be unavailable in the time where others need someone most? How do I escape? Should I escape? What’s the right choice and how do I just be happy?

416,"I have worked with a physician for the past year. In my position I have spent nearly every moment at work with her including being in the appointments. Now, I have seen a lot of questionable choices from this person, but I have not spoken up since I do not have the same training as them and felt that I could not reasonably speak up. However, I have witnessed a pattern of what I believe is highly unethical behavior and possibly illegal. This person has been taking medication samples from the clinic and using them on their own personal reasons. The medication is not a schedule 2, but it does require prescription and is very expensive. This has been going on for over 6 months and I did mention this to the clinic, but nothing became of it. 

In addition to taking samples meant for patients, I noted that this doctor began pushing this drug on to their patients because they had good results on it. They are pushing the drug over using non-invasive lifestyle changes. When they describe the drug, they never go into detail about the potential side effects. This physician is also in communication with drug reps and knows when they are coming to give samples. They have a one-on-one meeting with the rep at which point the samples are given directly to the doctor. This doctor then pockets some of the samples and then logs a few for the patients. They have taken thousands of dollars worth of this medication at this point. 

Again, I brought this to the clinic, but I do not believe that anything has become of it. I have discussed reporting this doctor to the medical boards with my family, but have been encouraged not to do so as it may get me in trouble. I am currently working toward a degree in the medical field and they are worried that I may struggle with getting a job or getting into a graduate program if my complaint were to blow up and get the clinic in trouble as well as the doctor. Also, I have already reported the doctor multiple times to the clinic and they suggest that I let them deal with the doctor. I really do not know what to do. Knowing what I know, makes my skin crawl. This person has abused their position for their own gain and is pushing a potentially harmful drug on people. I suspect that the clinic is given more samples if more patients are on the drug. So this person is trying to get patients interested in the drug, so that they can collect more samples for personal use.  

Just to be clear, this drug is not something that someone gets high on, it is used for weight loss.",28Aug2020,1

I feel like I'm not interesting person or I just look not good enough.

I just don't like living in a dorm and I'm scared that I'm there alone and lost. I don't have no one to talk at the dorm about how I feel or what's happening with me.

It's her private account, we're not following each other and she doesn't know that I found her account. Her tweets are all full of lies, for example: she often tweets about her job in grave details (like how tired she was, how she just got out of a meeting, etc), even though I know for sure that she currently isn't working any job. She also lied about the smallest stuff, for example: I told her about how my taxi fee was so expensive, then she retell the story in her tweets as if she was the one who experienced it. Before I came across her twitter, I also have been suspecting that she's sometimes lying because some of the things she said don't line up. For example, she used to say that her online business just got over thousands of order, but then she borrowed money from me and my other friend almost right after. When I asked her about it, she just dodged the question. But since I had no definite proof then, I wasn't able to conclude anything. She's one of my closest friend and I love her. Apart from this, she's actually a good friend.  I know that most of her lies are harmless, but I can't help feeling a little weird about it.

AITA for moving out of my moms house only after 3-4 months.

Info regarding story that’ll be important later; 
*mom works from home
*Gf and I been together three years
*Mom just got engaged to her new bf
*gf is an introvert 
*we pay my mom $400 individually, clean the house, buy groceries, etc 

So here’s some back story. 
A few months ago my SO (F19) and i (M20) moved in with my mother after living w her folks for a couple years. Things were seemingly alright at first but quickly went downhill. Things got negatively set in motion when my mom came up to me (not the gf) and assumed my gf didn’t like them bc she stayed in our room throughout day before she went to work. But the reason is bc my gf works nights and my mom works days. My moms job requires her to take calls and she works in the center of the house so gf stays in room, as to not disturb her. But my mom insisted on playing the victim role and turn it back around on her to make it seem like gf is doing wrong and doesn’t like them (happens often). Soon after, my mom became increasingly inconsiderate and passive aggressive. 
My mom and her fiancé don’t include her in “family things”, they talk to her THRU me (never directly), my gf does so much for them but they still find a reason to complain. Now they only talk to her when they need something and still don’t talk to her if they have a problem, they talk behind her back. The other week my gf put up Halloween decorations, three little decorations. It was a sparkly tombstone, one of those ghosts that hang up outside to flap in the wind, and a skeleton. My mom comes inside and yells my name. She had ripped the decorations down without asking us, and said we were making them look like devil worshipers. This sent my gf over the edge. ever since then, when I come home from work things seem worse than the last time. Before we moved in, my mom had asked us to stay 10 years. I said no and told her 5. Which is obviously not happening anymore. Gf said she can only take a year (also didn’t happen). Mom complains about bills all the time and said she needed our financial help. But I want to do what makes me and the gf happy and get our own place. But for some reason I just feel guilty for leaving earlier than I said and letting my mom struggle but this is taking a toll on gf and I’s mental health and relationship. My close friends and gf said I should NOT feel guilty at all. But I just can’t completely shake that feeling like I’m doing something wrong for doing what makes me happy. I don’t know.

For some reason looking at just my lower body in girls clothes but with a penis and rubbing the bra like it’s my nipples made me ejaculate. I have no idea why and I don’t know if this means I’m trans. But as soon as I looked at myself in the mirror, with my face attached I immediately lost all attraction. Does this mean I’m trans?

Wee had spent 5 years married and 8 years altogether together and we had started planning for a baby before I found out she was cheating on me. I feel like I wasted 8 years for nothing.

After that I took a year to focus on my self and my job, A couple weeks before thanksgiving I meet my now girlfriend, She has three kids from a previous relationship and they are honestly are great kids I love them.

My now girlfriend has very much made a positive impact in my life, our sex life is great and definitely has been more amazing since I have been staying with her during the pandemic, I honestly feel like she has changed me drastically, And I know I won't be leaving her anytime soon. She is definitely someone I can vent to, when I need to, my ex wife never really cared what I had to say so mostly I kept everything bottled up and was constantly stressed.

Recently my ex-wife reached out to me and wanted us to start over, she keeps telling me how sorry she is and has grown up since cheating on me, I down right told her no, I was happy with my girlfriend And she cried.

A couple days later I started getting texts from her family members about how much of a prick I am and how I should leave the ""slut""(their words not mine) I am with and consider counselling for my wife.

I'm sorry but me being happy with who I am should not be something my wife can assume she can just try to rip apart, and no matter how long we have been together I love her kids to.

435," Most people don't realize how much they're beloved. Sometime it's hard to tell someone how much you love them because how obvious this feeling is for you but the most important words are often the simplest to say yet we forgot to say them out loud. 

Perhaps even more for men to men. The stigma on vulnerability and masculinity can make sharing emotion with one another a struggling experience. Nonetheless to share your appreciation of somebody is probably one the most beautiful and satisfying thing human being can do.

Sometime the very line between life crushing loneliness and joy can be determined by the simple act of opening up to somebody. To tell your friends you love them, to tell your family you cheerish them or even some random person you've shared a tiny moment of grace with.

438,"Title says it all. I'm in the Midwest, US. Pretty big, liberal area(not political myself).

I am disabled after a truck hit me, and get a check but it's only 56$ a week. I am finally blown through all my savings. 

I need to work. I need to find a job. There's no other way around it. I have been running into the following issues that I am seeking out a little bit of advice on each or as much as you can would be highly appreciated! Thank you in advance(I would have posted this on a job skills or finding sub but the questions go through q few different topics so I thought general advice would be great to cover as many as we could, thanks again)!

1. A record. I have a non violent, non sexual, felony on my record from about 5 years ago. I am shown as the same as a violent person or sexual offender when I pop up as ""felon"" on a background check. Do the background checks that jobs perform list the individual charges because I remember calling and speaking with those people about it remembering them mentioning something along the lines of 'the employees there at the background check company can view the individual charges, but the employer does not, they just see I'm a felon out of a different state(maybe view the date 2015), gave them my time, paid my money, everything was over with and I am still getting raked by it.

2. Resumes. I have an electronic version, a PDF and a word doc saved to my Google docs. I do not own a printer or know anyone who does. If I wanted to to drop off a couple resumes to the few places that are still open locally, what should I do to print them out? My usually go to is the library. I would save up 40 cents and print out a few copies, but since the libraries are closed, I am not quite sure I can think of anywhere else I could do this at currently? I'm not quite too sure about how I feel sending my resume to a stranger over the internet either, sorry this makes it a little more difficult.

3. Transportation. I am disabled. I do not own a car nor could I ever think of even affording one let alone insurance or even gas. I have been taking public transportation when I absolutely need to go somewhere and have the money for fare. Are there any alternatives to think about when needing to travel or go somewhere whether it be a hour or ten minutes worth of driving? I would like to think of something I can get for myself to use whenever I need that doesn't cost much that is operable without hurting myself

4. Getting overwhelmed. Lately I've been dealing with quite a decent amount of pretty heavy issues. This has caused a lot of things, even, and maybe especially, amplifying the stress caused by the littlest things. I feel like I can't breath I'm always trying to catch up. I feel unable because I don't make as more progress than what's required to deal with these issues. What are some steps I can take to start getting ahead, let alone stay afloat.

Edit: I haven't edited anything yet but I am reserving this space for any more questions I may think of that I need advice on so I don't have to make another post, thanks!

439,"Two years ago I met a girl and we became best friend pretty quick. After a while the contact unfortunately became weaker and then she got into a relationship with another guy and the contact ended.

I tried to contact her two times in the last two years. The first time was on a social media platform. It went like that:

*Me: ""Hey""*

*Her: ""Who are you""*

*Me: ""Hey it's me Daz, how are you doing Abby? We haven't talked in a long time. ""*

*Boyfriend: ""This isn't Abby, it's her boyfriend.*""

I then asked him if I could write with his girlfriend. He gave me her number. I texted her another ""Hey, how are you doing Abby?"". I then got a voice message back from her boyfriend insulting me. 

Back when that happened I was dealing with some personal shit so I was just mad at him and didn't think much about it. I thought he was being overly jealous and/or Abby just turned into a bitch and thought it was funny that her boyfriend insulted me.

A few months later I tried to contact her again on another social media platform. This time it went like that:

*Me: ""Hey Abby, last time we didn't really get to talk. Just wanted to know if you are doing alright.""*

*Her: ""Hey Daz yeah I'm doing good! How are you doing? Are you still in contact with..""*

So we basically just texted a little bit for a day. Then suddenly it get's weird.

*Her: ""I'm working in the city you're living in aren't I?""*

*Me: ""Yes I think so, why?""*

*Her: ""It's weird that we never met each other even though I'm working in your city. Or have we met?""*

*Me: ""Uh no we haven't, the last time we saw each other was years ago.""*

*Her: ""So you haven't see me since back in \[Another city\]?""*

*Me: ""No I haven't""*

*At this point I was kinda weirded out. Then it goes:*

*Her: ""Where do you live again?""*

*Me: ""\[City name\]""*

*Her: ""No I mean what street and house number?""*

I tried to turn the conversation into another direction because I didn't want her (or more likely her boyfriend) to know where I live, but I didn't get any answers after that anymore. 

Like.. maybe I'm biased but I feel like something is wrong here. What can I do?",28Aug2020,1

\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
 21 year old human, central america, Panama. Photography has been my passion since 15 years old  


  
Nature lover, always has been. Cant live without it.   
When I finished high school i left home many times to work outside the city in hotels to be in nature. Peacefully in tranquility.... but tranquility left at some point whenever i went back home. Family telling me about studying and how important it is.   
I always understood but in Panama there is only one public university in the whole country ( Panama is small ). It has a mediocre art career and i said to myself that i wont do that. So thinking about what others have done... If I make enough money, i can leave this country and study elsewhere ! Good art education.   


I always lived with little money on my pockets and not much material things. Just camera and music. Never had health problems. So I thought it was going to be easy. Dad and mom did the best they can for me to have good high school education and health. Im good with languages so nothing to worry. There are countries in Europe if you learn the language, education is cheap ! LETS TRY IT !  
   


PT II   


  
OOOoooo nooooooo, making such an amount of money while trying to have a tranquil life in the country is almost impossible... Damn... Friends where I work gave me some advice to go back to the city and find jobs with high salaries.    
Hmmm, Ive been there before, office work was awful for me. I needed to be jumping around, and running everywhere with camera in hand. Clicking here clicking there, but instead i was fighting against the wind.   
City jobs are hard for me. Never liked them, hope i never will... I was always fantasizing  in photographing landscapes and the people who live by.. Like a photojournalist. Living the dream of a national geographic photographer. Also going back to the country and learning new things with farming, ecology, music etc.    But one day Dad walked to me and told me... kid... i see you're in trouble with life getting the money.    


\-Myself never accepted any help from his because of arrogant me so he told me to hush .... ¨Son, Im going to pay you university, you're going to study photography ¨ .... Oh my....  


It was December 2018,  


In March 2019 i left to Lima, Peru... I took as many pictures as you guys cant imagine.  I was jumping like a kangaroo from place to place and running like a hush. All my favorite black and white, classic photographers were living in my blood every time i pressed the shutter. I was alive again, city and I became friends. Such beautiful times...    


2020 came and a virus came to say hi and fucked us up pretty bad... I came back home in Humanitarian flight some months ago. Doing virtual classes since March.  Im slowly collapsing like a plant with no water. Bending like a sick tree. ..  I NEED NATURE. I need my feet on soil...On sand.  Can you guys believe here in Panama there is still quarantine ? 6 months in quarantine... You can only go out twice a week, and no way out of the city, unless you get a job.   


Oh Dear redditors. I´m starting to do little freelance photography jobs that I hate ( maybe i should be more grateful ) . I feel ashamed because I cant help dad with paying university nor collaborate with money at home...  semester was REALLY hard for me on virtual way and had no time to find work because they are all virtual now.   


Hours of virtual clases + hours of editing on computer + hours of studying on computer  and then having a new job on computer ???? FUCK NO. My back , hips, body, health , eyes, brain. This is no good, modernity in this way is no good.   


 Friends this is where i need the advice. Semester starts again in September 14.  
 Dad is making an effort to pay me studies, im not sure if quitting is the option.  I thought that :  


1. Try to get a job in nature and manage to study at the same time.   


2. Keep studying and find my way in the city with the freelance jobs with the   
purpose of saving the money for when quarantine opens I can manage to rent a small house in   
nature while studying ?      


   3. Getting a job as a photojournalist in the city and say BYE to the fashion shootings and have a   
a better time here .   


  4.  I have two years of travel photography in negatives ( 2018 -2020 ) that i haven't been able to   
digitized.  This text is actually a visual story in photographs. If I Focus myself on this, it can be a   
great project that can make my way out.   Working on my social media, actually uploading my   
photographs. Making my work value..while studying and doing the freelance jobs ?  


I think number 4... 

I just need a way to make money for buying my own equipment and not adding any weight on dad. I was thinking that studies are holding me back from being free but maybe thats the wrong way of seeing it. If i finish studies first I can go to nature FOREVER    


  
Thankyou so much...

441,"I (19F) moved into my first apartment earlier this week in preparation for my second year of university beginning mid September. Last year I lived in a dorm so while I was on my own, I still was surrounded with the hundreds of other kids in the same building as me. This is my first time living genuinely alone and I am really struggling.

I have very intense anxiety and just not great mental health all around and this summer I had 2 serious mental breakdowns. I have been doing much better up until this point, but more than anything I think my anxiety is being triggered by homesickness. I lived at home  with my mom and 4 younger siblings. We quarantined together since March so we spent A LOT of time together and grew closer. Now I am just alone, just like that. I have pictures everywhere of my family and drawings that my 6 y/o sister made me to try and make it feel more like home but every time I  look at them I just start crying. School doesn't start for a few more weeks and I just want to be back home. Even when school does start it's 75% online (COVID) so I won't even see actual people very much.

I hate being here alone with nothing but my thoughts. I miss my siblings and I miss my mom. It's pathetic but I feel like I can't do this. Any shred of advice would be greatly appreciated because I'm seriously considering taking a cab 100km just to go home and hug my mom.",28Aug2020,1
442,"So my best friend moved back to California. She didn’t tell me. I found out on the Fourth of July because her kids and sister ratted her out. Now when we talk she ignores her messages half the time. She lied about getting a job, she outed herself on Facebook when someone had asked her how come she moved back and I heard your working here now. I’ve been trying to do a FaceTime with her and the kids, and she tells me give me a few minutes I’m doing this or that. I patiently wait, I text her an hour or two later no response. So last night I asked if everything was ok because I felt like we were being pushed away. Her response which surprised me was yes everything is fine, we miss you guys too. I’m at my wits end, we’ve known each other over 20 years and we are super close, and I’m not sure how I should handle it from here.",28Aug2020,1
443,"I have friends I guess but with lockdown and shit I’m always the one trying to organise shit I’ve been asked to talk or play a game or do anything a handful of times. 

I get the feeling that people are avoiding me I’m not sure 

If I was them I probably wouldn’t want to hangout with me either so I guess I understand 

I’m kinda lonely and I’m probably being overly needy wanting to be able to talk to anyone who isn’t my immediate family a few times a day 

I make a fool of myself for attention because I saw it work for some other people a few times I guess 

Which is why people don’t want to be associated with me anyway 

Anyone have any advice on how not to feel lonely?",28Aug2020,1
444,"Made a throw-away account for this. I'm hoping I'm just delusional, but I want to put my mind at ease. This thought has been on my mind for a while and I'm too afraid of asking anyone for help. I do have a psychologist who I see cause of my clinical depression and social anxiety. I could reach out to them, but I'm afraid of my suspicion being true and my therapist taking some sort of action, and other people hearing about it. I apologise in advance for the long paragraphs - I just really need to vent. If you want to skip it go past the last paragraph with the square bracket.

[I'm a 23 year old  guy. My childhood has been very iffy because my father constantly fought with my mother ever since I could remember. He would verbally abuse her and gaslight her. Got desensitised to it by the age of 12. My older sisters and I were always close to mum. Mum favoured me cause I was the youngest and was the only boy. Grew up in a very Catholic and ethnic household. My mum was very strict with my siblings and I, in terms of socialising and studying. To give an idea how strict she is, my eldest sibling is a fully qualified dentist, who  is engaged - still has a curfew. So back to my parents. Since my mum and father doesn't get along they've been sleeping separately ever since my eldest sister was born. My sisters and I slept in the same bed as our mum from when we were little kids. When they became teens they slept in their own room, but I still stayed with my mum even after becoming a teen. I probably stayed with her until a few months prior to meeting my girlfriend last year. I know from a normal person's perspective that seems really weird, but for my culture it was relatively normal - but it's always the girls staying with their mum. Withheld this information from everyone. I knew since I was a kid I knew it's not common, let alone considered normal.
Mum was always more strict and overly protective me because I was her ""baby boy"". I only released this when I met my first girlfriend last year. Sometimes I get really bad anxiety when I'm on dates with my girlfriend because if I spend more than 5 hours with her my mum will start blowing up my phone and start screaming at me.A few months into our relationship, my girlfriend told me that she wants me to spend the night with her. She said we wouldn't do anything because she knew I wanted to take things slow and because I haven't been intimate with anyone before. I instantly said yes because I wanted to just cuddle and just be comforted by the thought of waking up next to her. It would be a nice change for once considering what I was used to. Long story, short, before I went to her house I thought about what would happen if my mum found out (despite me not having any intentions of having sex with her). Had a panic attack and started crying. Tried slapping myself out it, but I was still on edge.
When we got to bed, we started making out and she decided to get handsy with me for the first time. As soon as she got handsy I got uncomfortable. Not because I felt like I was rushing into things or because I wasn't ready, but because I was having these uncomfortable thoughts. They weren't images of words, but feelings which painted a picture in my head. I don't know how to verbalise it but - I felt small, and felt like I was involved with something not right. She sensed that I felt uncomfortable and asked if I was ok. When she did that she snapped me out of it and I felt safer because I felt more present in the moment.Fast forward several months later, my girlfriend and I come back from an event. (This part is TMI). We start kissing, and have some foreplay, but the vibe is different. I remember her breathing heavy, holding my hands tight and saying ""I want you"". It was my first time. Thought I'd feel nervous or anxious like I what happened when I first spent the night with her ages ago. I was fine in the moment, and it felt right. The next morning I was driving back home from her place and out of nowhere I those uncomfortable thoughts again. This time they felt like something I experienced a long time ago. I felt violated. Was crying a lot when I was by myself. Tried to suppress that shit as much as I could so I could get on with my studies. Tried not to think about them but they've been popping up every now and then.]



**A while ago I randomly remembered something from when I was 10 years old. My mum was pregnant. I remember my father starting a big fight over it. He thought that she slept with someone else. They had a DNA test and it said that the DNA matches his. Everyone was puzzled. I also remember hearing that the child had a deformity. My mother had an abortion. It was a very strange and odd moment, but I didn't think much of it till recently. After the little episodes I had after being intimate with my girl, and the fact that I've slept in the same room as my mother till probably last year made me jump to a conclusion which I wish I could erase from my mind. Is it possible that she did what I fear she did. Even though the DNA test said it matches my father, is it possible that it could've matched mine as well? I really hope it's not true. I would rather hope that it's my imagination being erratic, or even me possibly going schizophrenic. I seriously need some perspectives on this cause I don't want to experience another moment like I first slept with my girlfriend. I can't stand that feeling. It feels like I'm drowning",28Aug2020,1

My(14f) parents got a divorce last year but didn’t tell me until this year. At the start I’d live mostly with my mom and then go to my dads house every other weekend.
I have two older half siblings, but they’re both in their twenties

Around March my dad told me about his new girlfriend(M), but it was weird. Especially because I know her kids. We lived in a tiny town(760 people) so I went to the same school as her kids for 4 years. It was a really bad school in a really bad town, and I was bullied real bad for the six years I was there, and I even after I left I would have big breakdowns that could last for days, when I saw anyone I knew from that school. 

My dad kept asking asking if I wanted to meet his girlfriend, and I said no. He kept asking. For two months. Every day, multiple times every day. I finally gave in said ok ok sure.

That fact that I had met her didn’t stop him from asking just as much if not more. But this time he wanted her kids to come. yeah sure whatever. After that it was about going to a beach house with them. Sure fine. Except he said we were gonna stay one night and then when we got there he said three nights. I told him that I couldn’t do that, He said I was being silly and that of course I could be there for more than double time that I had prepared for.

It was hard but I did it. And when we came home i spent 3 days in my bed, and that made my dad real mad because I was ‘sleeping the day away’.
I told him many times that I physically could not get up. He didn’t believe me. I was just lazy and silly

And here’s the thing: I’m autistic. I didn’t know at the time but he did. He had know for a year. My parents kept my diagnosis from me for a year. And neither of them understand why I’m still upset. They even told my siblings about my diagnosis last year.

I blame my dad for his own behaviour, as I should (?). if he didn’t have experience with both having a teenage daughter and having a nerodivergent child (my brother) AND an autistic grandson, maybe then I could dismiss it as not knowing how to handle it. 

I can’t forgive him for dismissing my ‘bad’ autistic traits as me just being ’lazy’ when he knew. And I can’t forgive either of my parents for keeping it from me for that long.
He’s alway understanding when my nephew has a breakdown but when I do I’m being silly and whining. I’m also being silly when I don’t eat the dinner that he knows I can’t stand the texture of, but when my nephew doesn’t eat it for the same reason it’s fine

He has been sending me texts saying that he misses me and our dog(I take her with to his house)

It’s been a bit over a month since I saw him last. My mom says I’m not being fair and that he’s trying to change and I don’t believe it, because he’s said that a thousand times, and then he’s a great dad for a week then it goes right back to normal. I told both of them that it’s not that I never wanna see him again I just need a break.i don’t know how to forgive him if that even possible right now. What should I do??",28Aug2020,1
446,"As the title states,

My best friends, some of the most ambitious people I know are moving full-fledged into some of these BS anti-science and woo woo kind of things. 

Some examples are Joseph Mercola’s wild anti-vax and EMF theories, The Law of Attraction (aka “the Secret”), biohacking, etc. 

I have once been gullible and fell victim to these types of new agey thought processes and they literally ruined my life at the time. They had me constantly in stress, depression, or even just lazy (Law of Attraction states we “wish” everything into our lives). 

Either way, this kind of stuff is really damaging to still have “lingering” bc I have to constantly hear about it. Or worse, be lectured on why I should be doing certain things.

Been going through a tough time in life feels like this is pretty much my lowest, what’s been getting me through is journaling my thoughts and decorating the shit outta those pages. It reminded me of back when I had friends and I would write them letters because it was so fun to give it to them! 

Since I’ve been in my lows I kind of cut connections with everyone I know but I’ve been in the mood to write those long/cute letters filled with inspiration and advice where I’d decorate it with stickers and drawings etc. my friends loved receiving it because as they’d say “whenever I have bad days I just look at your letter and it reminds me to keep going”.

So it hit me
Why don’t I start a business on Etsy where customers can give me a little info of what they’re going through and I write them heartfelt letters???? Kind of a stretch I know but god I miss writing to people and trying my best to help them out, I also love decorating like crazy...

But basically I’m asking you all 
Is this a good idea???
A business where customers can share personal/whatever they need a letter on and I write them a whole ass letter and if they wanna keep the relationship going they can request more letters??? Kinda like pen pal but they get charged like a small fee?

451,"Obligatory I'm on a phone so formatting is crap, I practicallyjust woke up so its going to be a scrambled mess, also please don't use this story on any youtube channels, keep it strictly on reddit. Some people probably aren't going to listen, but atleast the honest ones will.



Now the advice that I'm looking for isn't what y'all might think. I'm (22) still saying with her (18, lets call her Jenny).



On our second time hangin out she admitted to sleeping with her (now ex) boss (lets call him Bill Cosby, that way the story has some comedy, somewhere in his 40's, little bit pedophilic ik and I've already voiced my opinion to her, also they're neighbours) because she didn't want us to get too deep into a relationship just for something like that to ruin it. Now yes I was a bit shocked when I found that out, but here we are in a committed relationship of only a few months.



Since we started going out though Bill hasn't given up trying to get into her pants again. She hasn't told him directly that its over because she hates confrontation and most people should know that it was over when she got into a relationship. And I don't want to confront him on it because it's supposed to be a secret between them. So if he knows I know then idk what to expect, because I don't want to see her or her parents hurt (screw her brother, lets call him Cosby jr. he comes into play.)



Now her brother (19) knew what was going on between her and Bill (Bill told him) and instead of helping her out of it, he is assisting Bill and blackmailing her by threatening to tell her parents if she does something he doesn't like. Now idk what jr sees in Bill (he works for him, underpaid for the type of work that he is doing aswell.) But whenever Bills wife isn't home Bill gets jr to relay that info to Jenny. (Bill has an open relationship and his wife already said no to him sleeping with Jenny because he asked her if it was ok). And whenever Jenny and Bill did anything he got her drunk. The first time it happened she was hammered and she didn't say no (but she didn't say yes either) and she was blackmailed her job and reputation to keep it secret. And whenever he wanted anything he would tell jr to tell Jenny that she needed to see him and get her high/drunk before he tried anything. 



Now we aren't sure how to handle the situation completely as we've discussed several different approaches. I've suggested telling Bills wife first then Jennys dad (her mom is super impulsive so we don't want her to know right away until its absolutely required, her dad will probably be mad, but won't do anything rash without thinking.) That way its Jenny telling his wife directly about the sexual abuse (that's how I see it) which should wreck his home and he should be bankrupt within a bit. But I'm not sure if he gets violent or what and I don't need her and her family abused. 


Or another thing we were thinking, is telling her dad in private about it and coming up with a way to handle it with him and so he's finding out before anything rash happens. Now I'm expecting (hoping) he tosses jr out of the house for not helping her when she clearly needed it.

It runs in the family, I don't even think there's a specific name for what we exactly have. No doctors have been able to diagnose it right.

Hi! So I’m not sure if anyone else has had this problem or found a solution, I sent a email to team Snapchat about this but won’t hear back til the morning.

Currently I’ve tried: 
•clearing my cache
•clearing the conversation 
•logging out of snap
•deleting snap 

So I texted my boyfriend and about 30 mins later, it says he’s typing. I click on the notification and his bitmoji popped up, it says he’s typing then he stops and leaves. I check and it still says I’m on delivered and he says he sent me a message but for some reason I’m not getting it and it doesn’t even show that my message was opened. Also, the messages I did send during this time period are no longer saved, tho I saved them.

458,"This is something that has been on the back of my mind for a while, and I'm still not 100% sure what I did was wrong and the only people who can answer are the people from said culture.
Let's start of by saying I'm not from the US, and I am an ESL teacher in my country. The school I work for has different parties and gatherings all the time (not during the pandemic of course), and the theme of one of the parties was countries/nations. We all had to dress up representing a country, there were food sponsors as well and overall was very fun. Now whenever something like this happens, where I have to choose a country (whether it's a school project or whatever) I always go for China. I'm not Chinese (I'm actually latina) but I lived in China when I was younger so it holds a special place in my heart. So I was inspired by mulan's bridal look, and I went after the fabrics and it looked similar to hers but I also did some research and decided to do a traditional bridal  makeup, not like hers in the movie. I also  added a parasol and fan we brought from china. My intentions were pure of course and from a place of admiration, but I don't have a say in that, Chinese people do. And I don't want people to feel that I am obsessed with and fetish oriental culture.
That being said I want people's opinions on whether what I did was right or not, bc we've all recently seen  people dressing up in these cheap costumes and going to parties and Halloween.

461,"Hi there,

So I am not much of a marketing strategical person at all. I generally keep a low profile.

I am participating in The Durrell 2020 Virtual Challenge in which I have to run 13k in my hometown to try and support Jersey Zoo. This is a hard enough feat within itself. Normally participants would fly to Jersey and do this, but COVID says no.

My towns pretty sketchy and I don’t have many weeks to do this in. But it’s for a cause very dear to my heart.

Jersey zoo is the only place on the island that supports and helps endangered animals. It has taken a hit during the virus and needs more support than ever in looking after the animals. 

I have to raise £600 on a justgiving page in order to support my run. Now I have posted on Facebook, Instagram, Reddit and even made a silly Tiktok.

I have had some good responses don’t get me wrong, but I’m trying to outreach to a wider audience and raise the money by the 27th September.

I only need around 106 more people to donate around £5 or equivalent into the cause to meet my target.

But I feel like I have posted everywhere and can’t generate enough of a response to get the money donated. I’m not Bob Geldof (thank god..) 

Any ideas on how to raise some money for this? The only play by play I have had is that Henry Cavill is taking part in this run. So I have posted in some Reddit’s to do with him and so on.

Any advice would be appreciated![The Durrell 13k Challenge](www.justgiving.com/fundraising/lucy-bambury)

The page is linked directly to the challenge so all proceeds go straight to Jersey Zoo.

Thanks for the read.",28Aug2020,1

463,"People often complain about forgetting stuff,I wish that was my case since not only do I forget stuff but my brain actually makes shit up,for example not too long ago I remember when I thought I took my meds and cleaned the dishes afterwards,only to have my mom yelling at me for leaving the meds and the glass in the bathroom for some odd reason,I didnt know how to explain it to her I had no recollection of going to the bathroom and the only things I could remember is drinking the meds and washing the dishes,which is something that didnt happen,not only that but last week I was waiting as usual putting episodes of the show my parents watched in a usb so they can play it on the tv,only to find out twenty minutes later that Ive already transfered the files and hooked the usb to the TV,I had no memory of that,my mom confirmed that I actualy got up and hooked the usb to the tv and brushed my teeth,but all I could remember is sitting infront of my laptop waiting for the episodes to transfer,fast forward to today where I clearly remember going through fourty episodes of a show only to find that it only had sixteen episodes,I dont know whats happening to me,and I dont even know whats real or not at this point,Ive managed to know that these things arent true because others confirmed it,but what about the things others cant confirm,how do I know if my mind isnt making stuff up?

467,"Background: I’m 19. I’ve gone through three serious relationships. My last one gave me trust issues and my past makes me refuse to believe in what I want to happen, but expect the worst to cushion the pain if the worst does happen.

My issue is, id just love to get a boyfriend. I’m tired of people telling me “it’s just not meant to be” and whatnot when I also know at times it can be me. Due to my pessimistic tendencies I tend to refuse to believe any guys I’m interested in like me back unless they blatantly say it because I’m afraid of getting my hopes up and being let down. That being said, I apparently don’t get very flirty with them either (according to my mother and sister). When it comes to guys I’m not attracted to at all, I can tell instantly when they like me. Typically I try to brush it off as me overreacting and being full of myself but 99% of the time I’m right and they like me. 

But again, the problem is I can’t do this with guys I’m interested in. They could say so much shit to me that makes people say “he likes you!!” But as a result of my trust issues and overthinking I come up with various scenarios of “if he likes me why hasn’t he asked me out yet,” “if he likes me why doesn’t he act like this,” and I kind of rule out the fact that maybe I don’t reciprocate that flirtyness to hint at my own interest. And, clearly, I can’t take a hint unless I blatantly know they like me. (ffs a guy said he’d date me but I live too far yet I still question if he ever even liked me)

I’ve gone through my phases of learning self love. It’s not something I’ve entirely mastered, I have my days but I understand my worth, so that concept is out the window. I just hope for the worst and create fake scenarios of the worst in my head which backfires. People tell me I need to start being ballsy and just saying I like people, but I feel like that’s off-putting because they may see me as rushing into it. 

I feel so embarrassed. I’m 19 and can’t land a guy because I overthink, am too pessimistic, and can’t flirt back or take a hint as a result. Does anyone have any advice on how to go about this? 

TLDR: As a result of my pessimism and trust issues I find it hard to believe any guy I’m interested in might be interested in me as well. My family says I then don’t flirt back because of how guarded I am to not let my hopes up that they might like me. I’d like a boyfriend, how do I fix this major bump in the road to that path of getting one?",28Aug2020,1

469,"Hoping for some help on this one. 

We have just moved to a new house, a few weeks ago. We share a wall with our neighbour meaning we can hear when there’s shouting etc. 

Our neighbour has a 7 month old bulldog puppy. Hes the sweetest thing, very jumpy etc. However my neighbour doesnt seem to like that. When we first met them she grabbed the dog by its ear quite harshly and dragged it back.
Through the wall (honestly not even trying to listen) she’s shouted at the top of her lungs, telling the dog quite aggressively to fuck off and screaming at it to get in its bed etc. These noises are sometimes so loud and abrupt they make ME jump, so i can only imagine how scary it is for the puppy. 
I can also hear her slapping the dog quite frequently (at least twice a day), it must be hard as i can hear it through the walls. Ive heard it whimper a couple times after which really breaks my heart. 

Im not a dog owner (yet, actually due to get my own puppy in a few weeks) but i dont think this is acceptable behaviour to treat ANY animal. 

I want to report her but i have no idea how to without it being obvious that I’m the one thats reported them. We are the only neighbours that attach, i dont think it would be plausible that another neighbour could hear them and report them. 

I just feel so so sorry for that poor baby, but I also do not want things to be sour when we have literally just moved in. I feel like this is the type of neighbour (you know the kind) that would make our lives hell for meddling in their business.

471,"Hi,
I’m new to Reddit but recently felt the need to ask for advice from people with a fresh perspective. I’m 19 (M) years old and live with my parents and also my brother whom is 23 years old. My brother is mentally disabled, he is incapable of taking care of himself and requires attention, so someone has to always be home to watch after him. Once my mom wanted to go buy an new iron for our clothes, and I asked my dad if I could go with her since he was home and could watch after my brother, ( whom was also sleeping at the time and basically required no attention). He asked me why I wanted to go with her and I said I just want to go out with my mom for fun, we don’t get to go out together often. He refused to let me go out with my mom even though it wouldn’t take much time to buy the iron. He has done similar illogical parenting, like not letting me go out with friends more than once a week when I was younger.
I’m not sure how to deal with my father, his always been very micromanaging, and a bit selfish and emotionally distant that I don’t have any conversation with him besides the ones that touch up on my education, needs and work I have to do for him.

I’m planning to graduate from University and move out ASAP.

I feel like the mother is mooching off of us rather than getting her life sorted out as she doesn't have a job and has no car.

473,"So, because of covid and everything, I will work from home at least the next couple of years.

I work in IT (software developer) in a pretty big company, so it's pretty safe. The amount of time that I actually work is really small. I would probably get away with working 2 days/week. The salary's pretty good and there isn't a lot of stress. 

And here's the thing - I'll have so many days in which I'll be free, and I'd like to use that time to earn some extra money. 

Apart from coding, I'm not sure about what marketable skills I have - I can work in almost every environment (I already tried and I was ok with physical work and/or working under stress). I'm open minded and I'm willing to work for what I want.

Some of my ideas were:

 \- buy a small flat in a very touristic city, here in my country, and rent it on airbnb or something like that. I could do all the cleaning and everything. I also know a thing or two about redecorating a home, what to buy/not to buy, and also real estate.

 \- open a coding school for kids or people that want to change careers. I've actually taught more than a few of my friends how to code, and most of them have really good coding jobs now. I was thinking of applying for some European funds that might get me started.

I'm still thinking about those ideas, but I want to ask for some extra opinions before I make my mind.

I find the people that I have more respect for now are the ones that didn't try to make an effort because those people come across more genuine while those that did it seems only really made an effort in public or so they could earn points and gossip info with other family members.

478,"I feel like when I'm talking to her she doesn't know how to really listen to what I'm saying.  Its gotten to the point where I just avoid being around her because she just makes me feel like shit all the time...

For example this morning I decided to try and talk to her. I had a rough morning with a very poorly behaved student and was just feeling stressed.

 I asked her what she was up too, why she was up so early, then mentioned that I had a student that was just terrible this morning, and how it was really frustrating or something like that. She instantly replies ""Well the student didn't make you feel that way, you chose to feel that way."" 

I tried talking more and she just goes ""Mhmm... which earrings do you think go best with this top?"" 

Its like this with anything I ever try to say to her. I used to call her on the phone, but it always ended with only her talking. Literally I would call to tell her something, but she would tell me a bunch of stuff without giving me a chance to speak, then hang up, when I'm the one that called.

She never seems able to show me any empathy. She treats me like im just choosing to feel a certain way when things happen. 

When I broke up with my bf of 10 years, lost my home, my dog, and came home in tears she legit told me. ""I liked it better when you were saying you could be strong on the phone....""

We went to play tennis and I broke down in tears in front of her. I was trying so hard not to cry cause I knew I would feel embarrassed and ashamed if she saw me that way. She just gnored it and pretended like it never happened. I feel like she doesn't care about me. Sometimes I just wanted her to tell me its going to be ok. 

Yet when she has problems with a guy she started dating recently. She tells me how hard things are for her    I listen and give her advice.

This probably sounds like such a non-problem, but I can't really put how it feels in words. I feel like even though she tells me she loves, she despises me deep down. I feel like she's always passively putting me down, or just does not give a shit about my existence until I can be beneficial to her.

Idk this probably makes no sense... I just wish that sometimes she could listen to me and empathize. 

I've tried talking to her about it before but its like I don't know how to put into words how I'm feeling. It also doesn't help that if I ask her to be a little nicer or something she gets super defensive.

It makes me question everything and idk I feel like its all my fault for bringing it up. Idk. Maybe I am just crazy...

484,"Hey, I'm pretty new to Reddit and mostly just lurk for advice or tech help so if this isn't the right sub I'm sorry.

I've recently started streaming an MMO I play after work and an IRL friend I have (let's call her Sue) expressed interest in the game. So I suggested we do a let's play where we progress through the story together. 
On the first day she eventually became so overwhelmed that she stopped responding to me and wandered around saying how she had no clue what is going on and will just aimlessly wander around forever. NBD tho cus I was expecting it to be hard for Sue anyways and we eventually get everything figured out and the next day she took my advice, learned on her own how to navigate and apologized for her tantrum.

Fast forward to last night. I have started gaining a small community who not only are helping us, watching me every day but are also super active in chat and are very nice. Sue has been having 1-3 tantrums every day and becoming increasingly negative. Even I am losing my patience with Sue. One of our friends wanted to help us clear a bossfight and I thought it'd be a fun group even. Friend one tapped the boss and while I was pogging out Sue rage quit the party and teleported out of the area. She was mad that an experienced player ruined the fun of the run.

We had to spend half an hour convincing her that we would just run the dungeon again in normal mode so that Friend would be weak like us. While we talked her down I lost half my viewers and the stream was basically held hostage.

After the dungeon Sue had to log out so me and Friend hung out a little longer. Apparently Sue has been doing similar things to Friend when they were alone so Friend blocked her on discord.

I'm considering stopping the full let's play with Sue because I'm getting sick of not being listened to when I'm just trying my best to be a patient teacher, I'm sick of being accused of playing ahead (which I don't do) and leaving her behind. But most importantly i really don't like her being disrespectful of my new friends who are helping us both. The issue is I know her IRL and she may use something in our private lives against me. Knowing how volatile her mood swings are, what do I do?

TL;DR irl friend is being disrespectful to me and it's impacting my viewers and new in game friends. Should we stop playing together?",28Aug2020,1

486,"Hey everyone. One of my best friends is currently going through a rough time (and has been for a while), so I had devoted most of my time and energy these past few months trying to help them out of the state they are in. I am the only person they trust so my role in their life is quite significant (or so I’m told).

They are currently a mess over their ex not wanting to get back together with them. So they cope with this by dealing drugs (they even got arrested for prescription fraud), consistently doing hard drugs, hanging out with dangerous people, etc. Due to this, sometimes I feel unsafe even being around them.

I’ve cried to them, stayed up trying to give advice to them, begging them to please try another way to distract themselves of the pain they are enduring and they are not progressing. This has taken a serious toll on my mental; I cry for their problems more than I cry for my own. I have mentioned a few times that all of this was gonna push the last few people away from them, but I don’t think they got the hint.

I am emotionally drained... This person only comes to me for help and guidance but never takes it. Is there a way I can be there for someone but set boundaries?

491,"Hey guys, first off I want to say this is my first post on reddit and I have no idea if this is in the right place, but I just wanted to know what others think about my small situation.

I've been living in the same apartment for the past 7 years and I always have parked in the same spot under the communal car shade thingy (idk what it's called), each resident can park one car under the shade and there is enough spaces for each unit to have atleast one car under said shade.

Lately for the past week she has been double parking, I mean litterally parking on the line blocking both my spot and hers effectively taking up two spots of the car port shade thing. This forces me with two options, park on the complete other side out of the way of my unit into someone else's shade spot, or park outside of the shade spot again in an inconvenient spot. I had spoken to the owner of the car and she was very non negotiable about it. I had asked her kindly if she could just leave some space for me, and she kept silent, I then had asked her why she parks like that in the first place, and she says it's because the other car who also parks hnde rthe shade next to her dings her car all the time with there door. Imo that is not my problem. I have yet to speak to management about it because I don't want to turn it into a huge issue and would rather solve it independently.

One thing to note though which is the entire reason for my post in the first place is that my car is pretty decently loud, I wouldn't say obnoxiously loud, but loud enough for some people to notice when I start my car and leave, not so much coming back to park though. I try my very very best to not disturb any of the neighbors by revving etc etc and just being a nuisance to the other tenants. I believe she has a disdain for me because my car is this way. Hence why she may have been so uncooperative with me.

I would really like to know what you guys think I should do! Thanks!",28Aug2020,1
492,"So my friend (F22) lives in Montreal and was looking to make some money during the summer and she has been working as a babysitter for a few people. Recently she worked for this guy with who she agreed for a hourly rate of 26$ then 20$. This week she did 8 hours for 2 days and the guy tried to renegotiate the price just for these days since he realized it would cost a bit too much. She agreed to lower her rate to 15$/h for these days. Yesterday he told her he would prefer if she could keep these rates for the time being, to which she replied that she can’t since they already agreed on 20$/h before that. Now the guy becomes aggressive, sending her a bunch of menaces like « I’m going to report you to the Canadian revenu agency since you’re working undeclared » « we don’t need strangers to take our works » « I hope you’re allowed to work here because I’m going to report you ». Now my friend is scared because she has a study permit, she’s allowed to work here but she’s still worried since it’s undeclared. Now we told her to block him and stop answering and to keep his messages as evidenced for the future. What else could she do to protect herself ?",28Aug2020,1

495,"I've recently graduated and today I got my certificate through the post. It was damaged slightly because the post woman had shoved it through the letter box but nothing big, my mum wanted to take a picture of it and put it on the table where my sister had just bee eating messy Chinese food (I didn't realise this). My mum gave it back to me and she was so happy big smile which is rare because she has depression and woke up bad today. But then I looked at my certificate and it was ruined there was a stain on the back of it that was seeping through to the front, I managed to wipe of most of it but the main damage was already done. 

I just burst into tears and started making horrible sobbing sounds and my mum just sat there looking at me like I'd kicked her happiness into the grave which just made me cry more. I really upset my mum even though I didn't say it was her fault she told me I had made her feel like it was and she doesn't want to talk to me now because of my overreaction to situation as the stain and bent bits wont show once it's framed or I can just get another one.

I have emailed my university and am hoping to get a new one printed and sent out, but I don't know if I will will have to pay for or how long I will have to wait and I'm not sure that the stain can be hidden by a frame.

I'm really upset and but now I feel like I can't show it because it will just make my mum feel worse. What's worse is I told my family I was receiving it this week I don't know how I'm going to tell everyone who asks to see it no without crying again.",28Aug2020,1

499,"Yesterday while exiting the store I came to the stop at the edge of the sidewalk with these two other women. I was on the left, one of the women in the middle and the last one on her right side. 

The woman in the middle was older than me, maybe mid-30’s and she had a kid with her. I’m bad with ages, but he had to be kindergarten at the oldest. He looked healthy, clean and his clothes were nice. He had a mop of curly blonde hair and it seemed like he was well taken care of. He seemed really happy at that moment, too.
The mom had a cart full of things and then a basket on wheels full of stuff. She was struggling to wheel both of them and when the basket toppled she seemed to lose her cool. 

The kid was on the right side, beside the cart and the mom was just a few steps in front. When the basket she had toppled, she turned to him and...I wouldn’t call it yelled, she spoke low and angrily. She roughly grabbed him, put his hands on the carts handle and told him “stay here. Keep your hands here” as he started crying.

The woman on the other side and I made eye contact for a moment, I think we both weren’t sure how to help? But the other woman asked if she could help the mom and the mom instantly was like “no, it’s fine. I’m just frustrated and I don’t even know where I parked”. The woman asked again, I assume to be sure and the mom still said no thank you. 

We all started going out separate ways, but when I was about halfway to my car, I heard the mom again “you have to behave.” And other things. Nothing too bad had been said yet, but her tone and stuff reminded me of my mom when I was a child so I did keep an ear out. I got to my car and assumed, maybe it’s over and she’s calmed down. I start loading my things when I hear her yelling at him about embarrassing her.

Her vehicle was parked right next to mine. I froze. She was starting to have more venom in her voice and I started listening as I loaded my stuff. I could hear her berating him, she said something along the lines of “it’s your fault you didn’t get any toys. And look at all of these toys I get to give away because you’re so bad!” And the little kid was fucking crying so hard. He wasn’t even screaming, just tears streaming down his face. It kept going, she said things like “now you’re acting like the victim.” “You made mommy look crazy, don’t you feel bad?” and she mocked his crying, in his face and going “boo hoo poor you” her voice was full of so much venom.

I went to take my cart to the holder beside her, because I wanted to check the poor kid and take note of stuff. She had him in a decent looking car seat, he had snacks and stuff all around. But the kid was curled into himself, crying in the car seat. My heart fucking broke.

This whole thing was about 10 minutes. I got her plate, her car make and model and I think I can describe them both decently. But what can I do? I don’t have any audio evidence, the static in the audio recording covers her whisper yelling at him

Before it’s asked, I’d like to explain why I didn’t take action at the time. I didn’t step in at the time because I was that kid at one point and things only would be worse in private after someone said something to my mom about her screaming at me. She never physically touched him besides the rough grab.

I didn’t call the police because of very obvious reasons. I also know in this area if it’s not physical, our police don’t care. 

If there is a good way to approach this, please tell me for next time. I wanted to ask “how can I help?” But she was already making snide remarks about /me/ to her son, so I didn’t know how to approach her. I’d personally like to just sit this woman down and explain to her that her anger and frustration isn’t normal. I know it’s not, I experienced it from my mom and i have tendencies myself (I don’t and won’t have children). I want to help this kid like I wasn’t helped, but I don’t know what I can do. Or even if there is anything I can do. CPS is the route I wanted to go, but I just don’t know. Any advice would be nice, especially on how to help when it’s happening.",28Aug2020,1

Her husband passed away within the past year, and she's quite lonely we suspect (COVID certainly hasn't helped).

This woman's reasoning for wanting to room with our family member is her house is under construction, but we've seen no evidence to suggest that's true.

We were told no one might get a raise this year due to Covid-19, and they got rid of our ""holiday pay"" without telling us, however we just hired a new worker (maybe two I'll see on Monday) Does that mean I can assume theres enough in the budget for me to possibly get a raise because I've been struggling to make ends meet?",28Aug2020,1

512,"Good morning guys. Hoping to hear some advice or perspective on potentially starting to change my career or more. 


Tldr. Not fond of my field  but it pays too good, it's the easiest job I've ever had an needed no experience so I am scared of losing what I have for nothing potentially. Trying to go get higher up in my certificates but am not motivated. On top I feel like I have imposter syndrome everyday as some of the people around me are extremely smart and I'm like a fake or something.


Hope that tldr made sense. Little bit about myself.


I'm a 33y/o male in Canada. Married to my beautiful wife for 4 years. I was a late bloomer, had no direction or ""career"" until I was about 28. I was going through an early life crisis and out of a whim took a power engineering 1yr course at a college mainly because I heard it paid good and had engineering in the title, so had to be good right?  Somehow passed the 2 exams I needed to get my 4th class certificate (4th to 1st class is the progression) despite really not having any interest or passion for the type of work, I just happened to work at a hockey rink for a few years so was around some of the equipment related to the course.


A couple months after I was certified, I ended up getting a job paying 90k a year, which was absurd to me, as I've only ever made minimum wage before that. The job is very easy with great benefits, RRSP through the company, unlimited OT, etc. I literally record numbers every couple hours which is why I am struggling mentally with changing careers. If you want an idea, I literally have Homer Simpsons job. I figured recently that I would start studying for my 3rd class exams (it's 4 3.5 hr ministry exams) and am finding it very hard to be motivated to study the material. I see people around me at work that are just so into like running a boiler is their life goal and I can't compete with that.


 I 've now worked here for about 4 years, have a house in a HCOL city, 2 awesome dogs and a lovely wife who works in the public sector. 


I feel like I need a change but am having a hard time, I feel like if I ever left this job I would never find a better one. I think about it everyday. Going from depressed nobody (I'm probably still depressed but it's kept at bay because I can afford the things I want to live a comfortable life and am trying not to have everything come crashing down) to almost 6 figure job is too much sometimes.


My wife and I don't really have an hobbies, were very much introverted and home bodies,  have like no friends (don't really know how to make any either, all my childhood friends live far away as I moved across the country when I was done high school).


I feel like I am just venting or rambling, did this on a whim and haven't really collected my thoughts. 


If anyone had an perspective or advice or just wants to say anything really, I'd greatly appreciate it. This probably isn't even the right subreddit for this.


Thanks for listening.",28Aug2020,1

They baby trap mens when they get tired of their toxicity and cheating and then screw them in court with crocodile tears.

I've been with my BF for 2 years now. He has OCD (probably) but won't get a real doctor/psychiatrist diagnosis. I made him talk to an online therapist a few months ago, who said he probably has it and treated him as if he did. His OCD became a burden on me when it got really bad for a few months last year. I got sick of hearing his disgusting thoughts and his worries about being a sexual deviant or bad human or worries about whether or not X woman we know is hotter or if Im the one. Some of it really hurt. I've cried over some of the stuff, I was sick or reassuring him. My trust was pretty damaged but he got a lot better and rarely confessed  for 8/9 months.   For the last 3/4 months I've suddenly become scared ""what if"" he doesn't have OCD and is just a terrible human who used it as an excuse. I asked him for reassurance over and over and tried to trick/ test him into admitting he is the terrible things his OCD seems to want him to be? While the OCD was never gone totally, I made it much worse and he told me that. No matter what I wouldn't accept he had OCD , I kept pushing. Not a day went by for 3 months without him confessing something OCD related that disturbed me and me asking him once more if he *really* has OCD. Resentment built on both sides. If he genuienly has OCD (and ir does seem like it), I must be a genuinely terrible human being for the way I've acted and played victim a lot. I stopped this 2 weeks ago, I felt too bad and I've apologised lots since.

I asked a question about our relationship on another sub and a comment told me I was the worst and probably have BPD. Am I a toxic person? Does he deserve better?",28Aug2020,1
525,"So my dads from India and his family back their is rich, not wealthy but have a big house and lots of land. All of my family money/land is in India.

When my Dad and mom got married in 1999. They moved to Canada in 2001. Leaving everything behind. 

Now every since my Mom has been a housewife that stays home and takes care of me and my brother since my grandparents are in India and we needed somebody to stay with us when we were little. Ever since they have left India my Dad has worked at one construction job for over 15 years. Our family doesn’t make much, my dad is the only earner in my family and only makes 55k(After taxes) a year and works 6 days a week. We can’t really live on 55k yearly anymore, we aren’t struggling it’s just things are getting harder. I’m going to university and have Tuition fees, My parents are reaching 50, my little brother is starting to grow up. My mom wants to change houses and move into a newer one since they are getting older. 

The problem is that my Dad has a lot of land in India with his name in it. What makes me mad is that we are struggling and we could have such a better life if we just sold some property. So here’s alittle about my dad. He has worked at a construction job 9-5 for 15 years despite family members telling him to start his own business he refused, they told him this 10 years ago. Couple years ago his boss offered a company car and he refused and said to give the offer to somebody else. What? He commutes nearly 2 hours each day. He literally complains on how much gas cost. He then was offered a higher paying job a couple years ago as a supervisor and even refused that. I don’t know what it is about my dad. I honestly don’t why. He literally refused to start his own company and even refused a higher paying and easier job. What’s even worse is that he has 3 other brothers in India. One day they called and needed my dads papers since they were selling some land that had all the brothers names in it. His brother literally said “ we are selling some land and need some papers, is it okay if we sell it. And he said yeah and that he doesn’t want his share of the money. He would have gotten atleast 200k.
He just refuses to ask for his share and just lets his brothers sell the land and take all the money. My dads brothers son needed to buy a townhouse and they selled land in India and sent him 200k and I am worried when it’s my time to buy a house my dad isn’t even going to bother selling the land. I tell him about it and he says “ it’s fine, they live in India and take care of it, they can do whatever they want”

I honestly just want to call My relatives in India and demand them to sell the land with my dads name on it. My family is literally struggling, dispite all the land my dad has in India. Meanwhile his 3 brothers are selling the land and giving the money to their kids. I didn’t get shit and I probably won’t get anything in the future because of how my dad is. I honestly don’t why he is like this, all of my other relatives and told him to ask for his share and he just says. “It’s fine” and waves it off. My dad literally took a loan of 10,000 to give to a relative that needed money and they haven’t even given it back and it’s been 10 years. My dad just doesn’t seem to care about money. But we literally need money and it would make our life a lot easier. My dad is the only person I know that doesn’t sell their property and use it in Canada to make our life easier. even though they sell land with my dads name in it, he hasn’t received a single penny.all his brothers just take his share along with their own share. My dad doesn’t get shit. They are constantly selling land and sending in to Canada for their sons to buy cars and houses. And my dad can’t even say “Hey! when you sell the land, just send me my share” They probably wouldn’t mind but my dad has never asked. It’s my dads land too, it has his name in the papers. 

I need advice on what to do, Every time i talk to my dad about the land he says it’s okay and just moves on. Hopefully you understood what I am tying to say, sorry if I didn’t type it out well.

Literally all of his brothers are selling the land and sending them to their sons to make their life easier and My dad can’t demand his share and make our families life easier. Hopefully you guys can help. I’m literally so mad and just think about how easier my life would have been if he just asked for his share. And I’m only 17. To clarify My dad still have lots of land that hasn’t been sold. Land worth millions with my dads name in it. What should I do.",28Aug2020,1

528,"Hi. I need some help, and thought maybe getting opinions from others might give me an idea. 
I don’t know why I do this. It’s what ruined my chances at high school and I thought I had worked past it, but now it’s ruining my job too. 

I keep calling in, claiming I’m sick when I know I’m not. I did this in high school so much that it completely ruined my grades, I ended up getting a ged instead. 

I have no idea why I even do this. I KNOW I’m ruining myself. I know I shouldn’t be doing it and staying home. I feel so incredibly guilty afterwards and keep asking myself why the hell I feel the need to keep doing it. Am I just lazy??? Depressed?? I don’t know. Staying home isn’t even worth it because I just spend the day feeling awful for calling in in the first place. I’m falling back into the loop I was in in high school, where I’d call in so much that I’d feel terrified of the judgement I’d get from teachers if I went back, so I just stayed away. I don’t want to fall back into that again. I thought I was done with that childish time of my life. Please, I’d really appreciate some advice.

532,"So I have depression, I’ve had it for almost 2 years now I’m 14f and things just are not getting better. There’s nothing else I can try but I’m looking I’m advice on how I can improve from feeling shot or just be more positive or something 

When I talk about depression people say: Go talk to a therapist, go talk to your parents or tell a teacher or something but I’ve already tried all these things before and I still feel the same way

January-February 2020 was hard I was dealing with really bad anxiety taking over my life and panic attacks etc almost every day. When I went to school I couldn’t learn properly had too much stress on me. Started failing tests, had depression then and I struggled to get motivated for anything. I struggled to even socialise with my friends to the point where I started to dislike everything about everyday

March 2020 I stop going to school because of the pandemic and my friends don’t keep contact with me because they’re all fake and don’t even see me outside of school. Then I start talking to people online and put my trust into online people too much

July: Trust issues, depression, anxiety and stress. Person I’ve put trust in and spent 2 years talking to online has gone out of my life and I start feeling lost without him as he experiences the same things as me and relates in everything the same so I just felt less lonely but then I get left and my life starts to fall apart from there

Late July: I tell my parents about my anxiety, depression and all the stress I have daily and all I get from them is “I don’t want to be in this situation sorry” and they leave me alone. I don’t even have my parents to try and help. I can’t even eat properly anymore because I don’t feel hungry and my parents shout at me and say they’ve given up because I’m not trying. So that’s another thing I get depressed about.

June: I find out that someone in my family dies. Someone used to be such a massive part of my life, the last time I ever got to see her was when she gave me a kiss on the cheek and I still remember that until this day. This shit hurts so much and I cry every night

Then after I hear that someone I love is about to kill himself by suicide.

After all this shit I have no motivation for anything and I can’t even try to improve my life as I know it’s just gonna get fucked up again",28Aug2020,1
533,"This all started about a week ago when I found two cats in someone's front yard. I take night walks and began feeding them every night when I would walk by. They were so skinny that I decided to also feed them in the morning. when I finally saw them in the light of day, I realized that one had a severe jaw injury and couldn't close its mouth. No wonder it was so skinny!

I decided to knock on the door of the house they were in front of. A young girl answered the door and claimed that the cats were theirs, but assured me they were being fed. I went to ask her about the cat's mouth, and an older woman came sprinting up to the door and screamed in my face that ""THE CATS ARE FINE."" She looked like the word ""cigarette."" Sorry- that's mean but I can't stand animal neglectors.

I came back the next day to feed the cats. Yet again. when I was feeding them, the young girl (late teens) who initially answered the door walked out of the house. I waved hello. I asked her if it was okay that I continue to feed her cats. She said yes. I asked her if I could take the cats to the vet. She told me then that they ""aren't really our cats"" and her family had released them outside 5 years ago and the cats had just hung around ever since... I then asked her explicit permission to take the cats if I found them a home and she approved. 

Meanwhile, I posted the cats online to a local animal group. I had been told by several neighbors that the house frequently had animal control called and had even neglected two dogs to the point of malnourishment and death.....I started getting messages from the group online from people who lived in the same neighborhood telling me that the house was really a bad place for both  the children there and the animals. 

Yesterday was their vet appointment. I had been crowdfunding to raise money for their care, and I went to go pick them up and put them in cat carriers. a man then came out of the house, yelling at me and calling me every cuss word under the sun. He told me he was going to call the police for stealing his cats...I assured him that it was not my intention to steal anyone's cats and told him that his daughter had given me permission to take them. He got angry, and I've been told he's an alcoholic... But he insisted that they were his. I apologized for upsetting him and asked if he would be okay with me taking the cats to the vet anyways since they were already in my car, since we are neighbors (I'm one street over), and since I had already made a vet appointment. 

He agreed and softened, actually admitting that he was worried about one of the cats who was very thin even though it was eating. We had a civil talk and he said he lost his job due to COVID. I told him I would be back to update him on what the vet said.

After the vet appointment, the vet told me that part of the reason the cats were thin is because the fleas were taking so much of their blood that they were not able to eat enough to replenish the calories needed to restore their red blood cells. Because of this, the vet recommended that they stay in a flea free environment. They got a flea treatment, dewormer, and the mouth injury was treated (deep gum infection, needs a tooth removed...) 

I know their yard is infested with fleas. I went and knocked on the door and his daughters answered yet again. I told them about the cats' situation. they both agreed that not only was their yard infested with fleas, but their house was as well and would not be a good place for the cats to stay. I left them with my name and phone number, intending to get permission from the man  to foster them temporarily until they recover. 

He never called... I stopped by the house again later that day and yet again he wasn't there. I talked to the daughters and reiterated the situation, making it clear that I was not taking their cats away from them, only trying to figure out what would be the best move from here. they gave me the man's phone number, and I told them that I would reach out in the morning if he never called me.

Morning rolls around, I called him and left a message. Still no word from him. This is today...

what do I do? I'm knocking on their door, the daughters want me to take the cats, the man claims the cats are his and is frankly very angry about the fact that animal control gets called on him all the time. I don't want him to feel like all the neighbors are pitted against him, but I want him to understand that there are people willing to help him with his animals when he's in over his head. I don't want to release the cats into the yard without briefing the man on their health needs as they need to be on wet food until the one with the mouth injury heals. I bought them a large case of wet food. I also want him to know that the vet wants to see them in three to four weeks, and I'm happy to take them to their vet appointment. I also don't want the fleas that live in the yard to continue to attack the cats and further drain them of red blood cells..... Do I keep calling him? Do I keep knocking on their door? I don't want him to see me as a thief, but if I need to find these cats a home, I want to get started because I already have three animals and can't handle having these ones at my house, too... :( Obligatory animal tax included:

http://imgur.com/a/IpOMwGC

TL;DR:  House claims ownership of neglected cats, then denies ownership. I was given permission to take the cats by two members of household. Took cats to vet and was yelled at by man in same house claiming ownership. He agreed to let me take them to vet with intent to return them afterward. Now I can't get a hold of him to update him on their vet needs and return them properly. What do?",28Aug2020,1
534,"So I may have worded that wrong but the guy (26M) that I’m (20F) seeing can’t remember certain information about me. We’ve been hanging out constantly for a couple months. We’ve had a great time so far, he come over and we have a good time together it’s great. Last night he came over we were talking about him tattoos he talked about his favorite colors which I knew. He was able to tell me mine which is the same as his lol. But he wasn’t able to tell me what I’m birthday is or my middle or last name. Or any other little shit that I’ve mentioned. I can tell you a lot of shit about him. His birthday, his siblings names all of that shit. Maybe I’m overreacting we haven’t been hanging out long. I’ve gotten a weird feeling about him thought he’s been real distant and not communicating very well and he used to be somewhat consistent. Ik communication is a big deal when talking to anyone but it’s been very sparse between us, i was showing a friend of mine how we shared a total of 5 text messages in one day. He says it’s hard for him to keep a conversation going and that he been trying to stay busy. But texting him has become a chore and I’m getting annoying by it. We are having sex and we do when he comes over now I’m starting to feel like that’s all it’s gonna be, he told me that he doesn’t want me to go anywhere and that he wants to keep talking but he hasn’t told me what he wants.

535,"I've always had problems with my sister. I love her dearly but saying she's troublesome is an understatement.

She ALWAYS gets her way with things, either by guilt tripping people or by making them feel stupid. She then tells my parents that my brother and I are their favourites to their faces in front of us after they do something nice for us.

Fast forward to two years ago, I was moving out for uni so of course the question of her having my room came up. I wanted to keep it at first for selfish reasons but realised after a while that I genuinely wouldn't have space to store all my stuff for when i'm back at home for the summer. This stuff including two guitars, one bass, pedalboard, keyboard, drums, a gaming PC, a literal bookshelf of games among many other techy kinda stuff. 

My parents said it was my choice whether or not I moved so I said i'd rather stay, much to my sisters dismay.

I think it's important to mention that I intend to stay back with my parents after uni (one years time) whilst I get some money together to move out properly.

She'd constantly make jokes about her having my room and then after a while of these ""friendly jokes"" she just suddenly burst at me after I said no and called me a ""selfish cunt"". She then wouldn't properly talk to me for weeks and even after we ""made up"" she was still really off with me for months.

Shortly after that she started telling sob stories to my mum about how she doesn't have enough room for her clothes and that her wardrobe is breaking. A wardrobe that my parents bought for her only a year ago. I've said to her many times I have no problems with her storing clothes in my room but she shoots me down straight away every time. My parents have also since completely redone her room for her so that she was more happy with it but it hasn't stopped her constantly talking about the room. Like literally once a day.

Fast forward to today and she brought a whiteboard for the fridge and wrote a to-do list with ""URGENT (me) gives (sister) their room"" and text it to me with ""This is the new to-do list. No objections? BRILLIANT"" I replied under the white board with ""The fat controller laughed, you are wrong"" underneath. she then put ""i'm not the one who's in the wrong, bud""

This frustrates me because its all a joke whenever she plays along but as soon as I comment it becomes something serious.

I then text her saying I was only joking back to her.

I then sat on that for a bit and the annoyance of the situation kind of festered in me. This is a repeated thing that she keeps doing and I feel like she does it on purpose to try and guilt trip me into a decision I don't want to make.

After about 10 minutes I texted her again saying she can't text me saying she's trying to get over it to then making half jokes towards me with the intention of me giving her the room.

From there we kind of blew up at each other, horrible things were said by both parties which included me saying that she tries to guilt trip both me and our parents and her saying that i'm a lazy loser, selfish asshole. 

This culminated in her saying ""we're done mate"" I said ""(Sisters name)"" and she said ""no. done."" and then followed it with ""I am not going to get over this. Completely changed my opinion on who you are. Selfish"".

She's now blocked me on everything and haven't managed to get a word into her since.

I'm aware i'm in the wrong because I should have just given her the room but I didn't just want to give into her demands like everyone ALWAYS does. I just feel like she manipulates people into situations and its not fair to anyone else.

This isn't an AITA because I already know I am. I just need advice with where to go from here. Do I just give her the fucking room? I had a feeling this argument might've ended like this and i'm just not really sure what to do from here.

537," Hi r/Advice

My fiance (30s) has been having a sexual affair with her primary care physician (50s) all summer.

He  has been treating her for approximately 3 years and helped treat her though a health condition, regularly scripts meds, and most recently this spring we went in and met with him to do fertility testing and get advice about starting a family.

We  are in a rural area and have some mutual friends with the doctor. I  think that made it feel like a less professional relationship. My fiance and him have had each others' cell phone numbers for a while and she  would even sometimes text him medical questions. This summer they started hanging out one-on-one and began a sexual relationship... she has feelings for him...

I  just found out recently what was going on. Nobody else knows. Obviously I am upset just being cheated on. But I am also dealing with feelings  of betrayal that her doctor, who felt like our doctor going in together and being our support for fertility help, would do this when it seems to clearly go against his position of trust.

My  fiance believes the doc did nothing wrong and there's a line in the  sand between his medical treatment and relationship with her. He's a  ""nice guy""  and she ""told him we weren't together anymore"" so he didn't do anything wrong. She hasn't ""used him as a doctor"" since they started  sleeping with each other a few months ago. She says lots of doctors date  and marry people and give them medical advice and she's not like a  ""real patient.""

I feel like some  of his medical decisions in the past prior to their affair (scripting her out as much xanax as she asks for etc.) now seem colored by his  attraction to her. He even came to our house to give her a personal COVID test. He knows she has mental health conditions. I don't know if I  can trust him as a professional at all. Which is the problem.

I  am a social worker, and I think partly because of that I am really  struggling ethically and morally if I should report him. Social work has VERY CLEAR ethical boundaries. My understanding is if even if she initiated and consented, sleeping with a current patient is a  license violation. To my knowledge he has not done anything to end his  care. I don't know if he has done this with other patients or if it is a  pattern. To me if it was public knowledge it would erode the sense of safety anyone would need to trust their physician or the trust the clinic would need to feel he was providing appropriate care.

I  am also hesitant to completely ruin this dude's life and don't want to  act rashly and overreact because my fiance cheated and lied with him and continues to see him and that super sucks and I'm very mad. I will honestly feel guilty if he gets fired or his license suspended and it will be major small town gossip. Many people love him as a physician. I  do believe he probably hasn't seen her clinically since they started  sleeping together and maybe it's just something to let go because life is messy. I don't even know if there is a legal grievance here. I don't know.

Hoping for  some advice from people who have more context for how inappropriate this is and how I should handle it. Thank you!

p.s. I left her.",28Aug2020,1

539,"My friend - let's call her Mackenzie - (F19) has a really abusive boyf - let's call him Douche - (M23), they met each other around May of 2019 and at first he looked pretty normal, she had just gotten out of another abusive relationship and everyone in our friends group was happy for her
here's the catch...at the time, he was a drug dealer
he didn't do anything else
his ex was also a close friend with Mackenzie and when she found out they were together she freaked out and punched Mackenzie in the face at a local bar
it was madness
after a few months the red flags in Douche started to appear, he starts to be really jealous of Mackenzie, controls her phone and social media and eventually she finds out he was texting other girls, so...he is an abusive cheater
they break up for the first time 
after a few weeks they get back together and the abuse gets worse, he is even more controlling and it eventually grows into physical abuse 
he also insulted her in many ways, calling her a sl*T, he started insulting everyone in her friends group as well (making homophobic remarks towards our LGBT friends and calling every girl a sl*t) 
but every time they break up, they get back together
the abuse got so bad that even her became abusive and toxic towards him, she slapped him in public and screamed at him, started waiting at his door for him to come back home even if she had to wait 4-5 hours etc
the last time they broke up, I thought I should introduce her to another boy that I met at a party
so I texted her a picture of him and tried to encourage her to have a fling, no feelings attached
she said she didn't find the boy attractive and I playfully (but believing every word) said that Douche wasn't t better than him
after this conversation they got back together and a few days ago Mackenzie calls me at 3am crying and begging for me to tell over the phone that she didn't find that guy I met at the party attractive, on the line, was also her boyfriend, who stole her phone while she was sleeping and read our conversation, screaming at me, calling me a sl*t, ugly, saying I would end up alone etc.
my friend hung up, but I heard everything
she then came to my house trying to apologize and crying saying that she was tired but she couldn't leave him, she felt empty and that he sucked the life out of her
I was so mad that I screamed at Mackenzie telling that she needed to find a psychiatrist and tell her mom about the abuse or I would, and that everyone in our friends group was done with this bullshit because it was starting to affect us as well
as guilty as I feel I don't want to be friends with Mackenzie anymore, her relationship is killing every single bit of respect and love I have for her...she really is a shell of her old self and she is becoming a toxic friend also, blaming us for not understanding her part in this relationship and screaming at us when she's mad
we convinced her to tell her older sister what's going on, and her sister said that if she finds out they are together again, she will call the cops

540,"Last school year, I had studied and tested for health, which is a class needed to graduate. At the time, my friend and I had both gotten C+ (my score was a 78), but we still passed and believed we would get the credit.

Fast foward to today, I got an email from the counselor saying I would need to retake the test, and that I had not gotten the credit. Friend got this email too, now we are both being told we needed an 80 or higher for credit.

Back when I took the test, my mom asked me what I had gotten and I said I had gotten an 80 (dumb, I know) because I was afraid of disappointing her. She still was disappointed hearing I had gotten such a low grade on an easy class, but she wasn't too upset.

Now I have to figure out how I can break it to her that I didn't get the credit. I don't know if she remembers the score I told her I had gotten. I can't take the test without her knowing, because I need her signature for the form to take the test again. I know she'll be upset no matter what (asian mom, woohoo) but I want to do it in a way that is not only truthful (I'm afraid of lying) , but also doesn't make me look like a failure. The best I have is telling her that I have to retake the test, but I'll be able to get a better score on my transcript. Although I know her response will be asking ""I thought you studied for that?""

No, I'm not one of those people who is paranoid about the crap in the tap. But I've never been able to really enjoy the taste of tap water. At least at home, there's always sort of like a somewhat soapy taste to the water. Now I know that's from the minerals and fluoride but I just can't get used to it so I just drink from our water dispenser thingy (you know the 5 gallon jugs). I know most restaurants that serve water use tap and most of the time I have no problem with that. But even if I use a Brita filter like when I'm at college, I find myself thoroughly enjoying the clear taste or lackthereof of Poland Spring or Aquafina.

546,"I started my first job after graduating college a few months ago. It’s for a big company that has me teleworking through at least the first few months of next year, so I haven’t actually “met” any of my coworkers; I’ve only communicated with them through Skype and email. 

There’s one guy on my team who misspells my name upwards of 75% of the time. At first I thought, “I’m new, he’ll get it eventually,” but he hasn’t gotten it yet. No one else on my team has this problem. 

My name is correct in my email signature and my whole Outlook/Skype profile, and he gets it correct some of the time, so I know he’s capable of copying it from my signature.

It’s starting to bother me that I’ve worked with him for three months and he still can’t spell my name correctly. How do I address this with him?",28Aug2020,1
548,"We went on this trip with my moms friends family a month ago and this is what happened

About me: I’m 16M, never had a gf before, never even messaged a girl or asked for numbers because I’ve always been shy and haven’t had lots of crushes

Her friend also bringing her husband and two daughters (15) (18) (I’ll call them F1 and F2) I’ve known them since I was little and I would basically call them my sisters at this point because we known each other our whole lives. 

Anyways they unexpectedly announce that they will each bring a friend ( F3 which is 15 and F4 which is 16) ok, no big deal eight people in a small house for a week we probably already have Coronavirus. We are spending a week with them at this house on the waterfront. 

Since I’m shy and forgot my anxiety medication I don’t talk for like half the week. (This was my first time meeting F3 and F4) All of them are really sweet and great people it’s just that people aren’t my cup of tea. Us teens talked a little on the first day but I go quiet for 2 days and finally I break out on Wed halfway through the trip. We hangout on the beach and in this outdoor hot tub together all trip and talk about life everyone’s pretty calm and relaxed and we all have fun and like one another. 

Now F3 friend is really outgoing and always talking and laughing telling stories etc while F4 is more calm and shy like me (also good looking). 
A couple days go by and I’m starting to really like F4 (as a friend) even though we never talked one on one. Well suddenly it’s Fri the second to last day and by the end of the day I realize something. Do I like F4 or do I like like F4? She is super relatable, sweet, funny, shy, calm, good looking and essentially my dream girl (I would prefer to date a person similar to me). 

I wasn’t sure but what I was sure of was I was still nervous as hell to talk to her after a week. By Sat next morning we leave unexpectedly early without really saying goodbye to them but I did get the courage to ask for everyone’s IG and made a vacation group chat. On the car ride home they dm each other sending photos they took etc but F4 doesn’t chat really and neither do I. 

We go back home and by night time I realize I can’t stop thinking about F4, a feeling I’ve never had before. I’ve had small crushes in school and stuff but F4 is literally keeping me up all night thinking about her. I miss her already. I start to have thoughts about her (nothing sexual, which is weird for 16) like talking hanging out holding hands etc even though we barely talked throughout the trip. I think about her smile and how nice and perfect she was and by then I figure out maybe I love her?. 

A couple days go by and I get the courage to dm F4 on Instagram, nervous as hell I dm her however the conversation didn’t last long and I haven’t been on IG since (about a month). I decide that she probably isn’t into me since she did one word responses. We live in different states and I’ll see her next summer at soonest. 

How the hell do I stop thinking about a girl? I’ve tried different hobbies and keeping busy but nothing seems to work and it’s been a month. I don’t think she’s into me should I dm her a second time?",28Aug2020,1

So last night, around 8pm, my mom heard a loud bang on the apartment door. I thought it came from downstairs since lots of noise comes from them all the time. 

Well that wasn't the case last night.

Today morning, my mom was going out to get the mail or something, but saw that our door had been egged (although only 1). 

I have never had this experience in all my life living here so this comes as a big shock to me and my mom.

558,"TL;DR - my older brother lies about the length of his military service as a Marine in order to curry favor amongst his friends and put others down. I'm about to call him out on it. And I have proof. But I'm not sure I should. 

My oldest brother and I are about 19 years apart in age. Yes, I was the unplanned one. Our parents have been dead for about 20 years now and because I was still at home when the last of them eventually passed, I have most of my parents old documents. 

My brother was a Marine and he makes sure people know it. Very pro-Trump, anti-Kaepernick and BLM, makes a lot of callbacks in his Facebook posts to his time in boot camp, the Marine brotherhood, etc...

(mind you - all his pro-military brouhaha, which REALLY started around the time Obama forgot to salute a Marine while getting on Air Force One - boy, he went apeshit) 

Me? I'm a liberal. I haven't always been, but after a bunch of business trips overseas in the late 2000s and seeing how other people live in Europe, Asia and Africa, my perspective has changed. I'm not anti-military but I am against what I perceive to be needless foreign wars. I don't believe ""supporting our troops"" involves making sure they have people to shoot. 

Needless to say, he and I argue a great deal. Both my dad and my brother were in the military and he uses their service against me in arguments (""I can't trust someone who didn't spend years in service to their country to tell me how to (insert politically charged issue here)"")

In 2015, I made a concerted effort to start categorizing/digitizing/shitcanning all my parents' old documents. I've got LOADS of them and I've always been scared to get rid of them just....coz. 

The intent was to distribute all that ""stuff"" amongst my siblings - there are four of us. Birth certificates. Old family photos. My dad's service records. My mom's naturalization papers. And.....

...my brother's service records and correspondence between him and my parents. 

As it turns out, my brother finished boot camp. Prior to signing on to the Corps, he was promised a specific assignment. After boot camp, those slots weren't available so he was given a choice - stay and get assigned somewhere randomly or leave the Corps. 

He left the Corps after 16 weeks. He came back home for a while, which is why those records are scattered amongst my parents' records. I guess he was around for a bit while I was a baby, then he was gone again. 

This past week, he's been on a tear. Marine-related memes on Facebook. Some comment he made during one of our family Zoom calls (""what do you know about being in a firefight, huh?""). To that last, I almost said ""about as much as you do"", but I've managed to keep my mouth shut about his lies about his service. Four or five years now. 

I've considered just EMAILING him electronic versions of those documents. ""Hey, bro, found these amongst Dad's old shit. Thought you might want them"" and leaving it at that. Just so he knows I know, and maybe give him the opportunity to dial back his rhetoric. 

Not sure what to do. We're not close. I know if I burn him, I burn what's left of our relationship. But he's wielded his service like an axe at times to promote himself and embarrass others and that really pisses me off.",28Aug2020,1

She stopped cooking for us kids when I was young, she gave up on christmas around the same age, she hooked up with one of my friends a year back. Among other things, she has a habit of leaving urine everywhere, due to having a poor bladder after having 4 kids. I will wake up to a trail of urine leading from our kitchen (by her room) all the way downstairs to our bathroom. I almost always walk in it, and because she never cleans after herself I cannot have friends over. The whole house smells awful. I have told her (very politely) that it isnt fair on me that she doesnt clean it up, and she gets very angry at me when I bring it up because she thinks it isnt a big deal. When I bring it up it creates a rift between us for days because she gets so angry about it, although sometimes it seems she is always angry. I suggested perhaps she should swear adult diapers to bed or heavy duty pads, and that its nothing to be ashamed of, but itll help the issue at least slightly, when I do this she brushes me off.

565,"CA - Crazy Aunt

UH - Unfurtunate Husband

Thelma - Oldest daughter of CA

Daphne - Youngest Daughter of CA

Me - deathcioud

Clay - Probably a Nigerian Prince or something.

So a little backstory. My CA used to be the sane one in the family. She went to school, had three amazing daughters, who are the best cousins I could ask for. Two are active in the Navy, one is the mother to my godchild. Anyway, over the past few months, my CA has been .... well going crazy.

She's attacked her UH, knocking him out multiple times. Shes hit Daphne in the face, giving her a black eye and causing her to move out of her house. She's been on Paltalk, on camera rocking back and forth, yelling, screaming the works.

She recently ""Fell in love with"" this guy on the internet, after abusing her husband.This guy is so amazing. He's a farmer in Pennsylvania, who owns 100 acres of cornfields. Filthy rich, and owns his own company. She talks about him all the time, even going on weird rants on facebook about him. (He doesnt have a facebook by the way. As a matter of fact, she doesn't have a picture of him, his ""cell phone service"" is bad so he cant call her often, and no one in her Paltalk group (Where she claims to have met him and talked with for a long time) have ever seen or heard of the guy. He also hasn't told her his last name. But he's rich, and will buy her a car, but doesnt have any money right now.

So, I dont get on Facebook often. The one day I do, I see a large post about this Clay guy. I was confused about it, because that's not UH's name. I messaged her asking her whats going on (That thread has like 100 comments of people concerned for her health, because unbeknownst to me, this wasn't the first facebook rant about this strange man-gift from god she received.

I message her asking her whats going on, and she calls me. Here's the transcript that I typed up as she was talking.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

CA: Thelma is living in her own fucked up world. It's really really bad. She (Thelma) proved how much of a selfish bitch she is. (No clue why she started by saying this, what an introduction to a phone call)

CA: (mumbles) I called her that in a text too, a selfish fucking bitch.

CA: But he (Clay) is my big daddy, he makes me happy happy happy happy. (She says this with a slight crescendo, the last happy sounding like a Barnie chant or some shit) Big clay gonna get you and your wife a house wherever you want! (talking like a child actually)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: How'd you meet him?

&amp;#x200B;

Her: Online (Paltalk)

&amp;#x200B;

She starts babbling about a big black truck. (She actually does sound insane here)

She doesn't have a vehicle but ""Clay"" tells her he will buy her one.

&amp;#x200B;

CA: And he told me he can't wait to have me ride him on his tractor (Laughs like joker)

Talks about doing him in the cornfield field and whatnot.

CA: Look up Saint Elmo island...  THAT is where I want him to take me for my birthday something something anchor. It's a thousand dollars a night!

(Sounds insane as f)

&amp;#x200B;

Now keep in mind, none of us have seen, or heard from this ""Clay"". The people she talks to on Paltalk all the time have never seen this guy either.

Doesn't have a Facebook apparently, his phone doesn't have service all of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

She then tells me this story

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

CA: We get on Paltalk.

CA: Daphne (the last daughter that lives with them)  Comes with us every day in the room. its a music room, weed room we smoke a lot of weed. and uhm we turn our cameras on, and you can see whoever has their camera on, you can SEE them! You're not looking at a picture or something, this is a live camera.

&amp;#x200B;

CA: This is how me and UH communicated when he worked. Well, Clay used to date my ex-friend. She's the reason why me and UH couldn't save our marriage because when she dated Clay, she fucked up his mind. She got him to the point where our friend, he was being mean to our friend. I didn't like him at this point because I didn't know him.

(This story is useless to me, but you guys get to suffer too, I had to hear this over the phone)

&amp;#x200B;

CA: These last 3 weeks I've been going through hell. Imma gives you an example of this mother fucker did. He (UH) spit in my face with Daphne watching him.

Me: Why would he do that?

CA: He was mad at us because we wouldn't let him smoke. (mumbles) Cuz he was mean to me (in the voice a child would have while tattling)

CA: And then he has the nerve, THE NERVE. Daphne was yelling at UH for spitting in her face. I didn't do that he said. He went up to her stuck the bird finger in her face, and said you see this you can take it and shove it up to your ass, and you and Thelma can go live in your own little sick world. Daphne was so hurt. I fucking lost it and Knocked his ass out. Let me tell you another thing he did to Daphne.

&amp;#x200B;

For context again, Daphne has denied every story she's been telling people and has since sought shelter at a friend's house.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

CA: One morning we get up... Daphne was about to leave, so she decided to smoke with us, but she didn't have much left. He finally wakes up at this point, and she goes to her car. He took off, mad bc we smoked without him.

CA: Daphne comes back because she forgot the rest of her weed, asks wheres the weed. Its not in her jar. He took your weed and left!

CA: What's wrong with this muddafukka? (Sounds like the FUCKING ACCUSER woman here. No lie I had to mute my phone to laugh)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

CA: If Daphne wouldn't be here he would have shot me dead. I would have been happy I was dead cuz I'm going meet God, I know I am cuz I've been in hell. HE BROUGHT ME HERE AND KEPT ME, HOSTAGE. blah blah blah.

&amp;#x200B;

CA: Enough about that mother fucker. I found someone to love me, unconditionally. He IS real, I'm going to take a picture to show that he is real. But he's HOT, he works in the field all day long. He promised today I can show a picture of him to show that he's real.

&amp;#x200B;

He's got the most huge dimples I've ever seen. Nose to chin that's how big they are. And I can't wait for everybody to see what my husband looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

You know me, would I post something on facebook that isnt true?

&amp;#x200B;

So she doesnt know his address, his last name, and the name of his huge company. lol

&amp;#x200B;

I ask her real questions about him

&amp;#x200B;

she starts talking about my mom and baby brother who both passed away, then she begins hyperventilating.

&amp;#x200B;

She told her entire family that she believes trusts her that she will buy a house for them.

&amp;#x200B;

CA: God has my back, and Clay by my side, so everything will be okay.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Second call

&amp;#x200B;

landlady and landlord called her they wanted to come to inspect the house and stuff

Superintendant came and brought her a letter: She got fired because of what she posted on Facebook. Was excited about this because that means

She's going meet Clay this week now, (laughing maniacally)

&amp;#x200B;

This was two weeks ago. Spoiler alert, still have not seen or heard from ""Clay"". Daphne denies ever seeing him.

&amp;#x200B;

CA just recently tried to go into a bank, and then caused a scene because Mark Zuckerberg promised to send her money.

&amp;#x200B;

I was fed up by the second call, so I didn't really type it well. Sorry, its gonna be authentic.

Anyway, she's obviously fell for a Zuckerberg scam, and no one believes this ""Clay"" guy is legit.

She needs help. Thelma has  tried wellness checks, and the cops said nothing was wrong. But there is something wrong, we're all worried about her, but she lives 8 hours away. What can we do?

I have copies of her facebook posts, and have video recordings of her episodes as well.  


Today we found out that she won 10,000,000 in a Totally Legit™ Facebook lottery! (The scam she fell for and yelled at the bank I mentioned earlier)  
This is going beyond crazy at this point. EVERYONE on her facebook is telling her shes wrong, shes getting scammed but ""NO ONE BELIEVES"" that this Totally Legit™ Lottery is Totally Legit™",28Aug2020,1

570,"I got into some trouble with the law and has my children temporarily placed with my mother in 2011. I lost everything while in jail, my home, all my possessions and my job. When I got out of jail, I had to start over from nothing, with nowhere to go. Being in the legal system and having an open case with CPS, it seemed like everything that could go wrong for me, did. I ended up surrendering my parental rights, and my mother adopted them. Eventually  I did get back on my feet, and was always there for my kids, I never walked away. My mother has had a drinking problem for the past 25 years. Functioning alcoholic? Maybe. She held a job for a while, but with addiction comes toxic behaviors. She quit her job and relied on the check from the state to pay her bills and feed her addictions (which became pills and alcohol) And eventually stopped paying the bills all together, mind you, doing this with me in the blind. Everytime I ever gave her money, it was spent on alcohol, cigarettes, whatever. She ended up losing her apartment.

In 2016 she moved in with her fiance. He owned the house, all bills in his name. He passed away unexpectedly, and even though he wanted to put the house in her name, he never got the chance. She paid the bills for awhile, and when she got too far behind on the electric bill, she tried to call to get an extension and they red flagged the account when they asked why she was calling instead of her fiance, and she said he passed away. 

Long story short, the lights were turned off until she could prove that legally, she could stay in that house.  She lost all hope, shut down, moved in with a friend of mine. I left the state to work with my brother, to bring in a bigger income to help her. While I was gone, she fled to Nevada (from Florida) because a friend from high school sold her a false ass dream.

It's been nothing but problems since she's been gone. Attacked by this friend's daughter, smashing her face into a dresser, shattering her face. She's broken both of her legs (her bones are brittle from years of drinking, and not eating) multiple times, she's now unable to walk and is basically stuck in a recliner 24/7. Among other things.

She got remarried in 2018 and it's come to my attention in the last week that her husband has been making sexual comments and making it clear that he's been looking at my 3 teenage daughters. He's even sent them text messages clearly sounding like a pervert m They've all expressed how uncomfortable it makes them, and my mother is making excuses and defending him. I told her I will drive 2500 miles to get them all, and she's refusing, saying they're fine, while my 14 year old has called me everyday crying over this. 

I dont know what legal steps to take to get my girls home. Do I literally have no chance in fighting for them? 

I'm fully prepared for any negative comments about giving up custody of them. I live with it everyday. I know I beyond fucked up in more than one way.

Sorry about the long winded post.",28Aug2020,1
571,"Hi all,

I found a suitcase outside of the office I work at. I don’t really want to approach the suitcase as I’ve heard some creepy trafficking stories with women being abducted when approaching an animal/suitcase/item. To make it worse, there’s nothing but cornfields behind it and a parking lot infront of it.

I peeked outside of the window to see if anything had changed twice now but still see the suitcase and nothing weird/out of place. 

Should I report the suitcase? Could it have been dumped as garbage or is something inside? My friend and I joked about treasure but my mind immediately went somewhere dark as I initially saw it in the early morning with nobody but an empty lot. Suggestions? I’ll try to post pictures after work.",28Aug2020,1
572,"Hi everyone. I'm not very familiar with copyright issues so I need some help.

I recently developed a short game, uploaded it online and posted a short gameplay video to Reddit. A user pointed out to me that a YouTuber (I won't name him yet) stole my gameplay footage for a video. The video is in Turkish so I can't understand, but as far as I know I can't find any credit to me. Some people in the comments are even claiming that I stole from the YouTuber, despite the download link is clearly not his.

Thing is, I don't even fully own my game. I used someone else's music (which I credited on Reddit and in the game files), and some of the graphics were not designed by me. Although the YouTuber has every right to play the game (since I made it publicly available), it is still frustrating that he used my footage without consent. 

Is there anything I can (or should be doing) in terms of copyright or content claiming? I wanted to ask for help before jumping to any decisions. I'm also not sure how much I should reveal in terms of the identity of the YouTube so I'll just leave him anonymous for now. I can provide more info or links if you may need it to better assess my situation. Thanks very much, your time is very much appreciated.",28Aug2020,1
573,"So there is this girl I like. I know her before she joined the school. I follow her on ig and she used to follow me but stopped following me some time ago. She's really nice and makes sure to say hi to me and I do see something going on between us. Now the thing is, I added her on snap an hour ago and she didn't accept yet (she's really active on the phone). Now let's just assume she will. Another thing is, there are 2 guys who are like the biggest simps of the whole grade and basically ""steal your girl"". I don't f/w them and I wouldn't like to. It always worries me and pisses me off when that happens, in fact, when she talks to a guy in general, I tend to overthink and just not feel that good about the slow progress I make.

575,"I guess I've always known but they said something really blunt lately that took me by surprise.

Context: I have a great relationship with my parents and I am an only child. We get along like friends and I've never been a troublemaker or anything like that, we have fun together. That being said they've always said I'm not allowed to date black people and while saying they aren't racist or homophobic they have made jokes in poor taste about both. Also they are Christian and I am atheist but we never shove it on each other.

I forget how it got brought up by my mom said if I got pregnant she would make me have the kid. It took me completely by surprise and when I started getting a little upset she acted like I was overreacting and said she would just strongly try to convince me to. Then not long after my dad said that girls shouldn't be allowed to get abortions and that if they did it should only be in certain circumstances and with consent from the guy involved. I was appalled and it stirred something inside of me. It hurts to know all of this and despite how great our relationship is their love definitely feels super conditional now. My dad also always talks about how ""our generation"" is too sensitive and how back in his day racist jokes were acceptable cause they had ""thicker skin"" and things like that.

As much as I love them, they believe a lot of terrible things and I'm hurting a lot. They act like I'm stupid and overreacting but am I wrong to feel this way? I have never needed an abortion or anything but just knowing how they would react, not supportive at all, makes me feel really bad.

579,"Hello, this is my first ""actual"" post on reddit ever, and I am using a throwaway since I don't really want to involve my personal life with my main account.

Ever since I was young, my parents were very strict. I always was monitored on everything I did and owned, and looking back on it I can understand why they did it and I appreciate them for it. Whether it's screen time limitations or choosing what age-appropriate video games I can play,  I genuinely think that what they did was the right move overall. I'm glad that they raised me the way that they did, and I have never questioned it before until recently. 

When I was younger, they had a reward system based off of my academics and I genuinely think that was smart for me, especially since it encouraged me to do well in school and study to get a reward. Whenever I would get bad grades, things would be taken away. It encouraged me to do good in school so it worked overall. I also was rarely allowed to go outside or visit a friends house, which was limited to once a week for some reason that I do not know. I didn't question it much at the time, since I didn't really care back then since I enjoyed playing Minecraft and other wacky games like that.   
Once I hit the 8th grade I was given a laptop to use for games and such, and it came heavily locked down. Which, I can understand considering I was still in middle school at the time. All access to my computer was restricted, needing a parents password to be able to download and run executables. Buying a game required my parents, adding it to my account requires a parent, adding a shortcut to my desktop requires a parent. My steam account is also moderated heavily, to the point where I cannot change a profile photo at all, which I thought was strange but I didn't really care since it wasn't that big of a deal. Purchases and such were also limited, whether or not it came from my own money. I wasn't even allowed to download free games or play them since they were still following the reward system from Elementary school. Whatever, I was satisfied with what I had so I never questioned it. 

I turned 16 recently and am going into my Junior year of high school. I still have all my restrictions that I have had since elementary school, and I have expressed to my parents that these restrictions are ridiculous but they refuse to change them. They argue that they are staying in place for my own safety, and I have said that my own common sense should be enough since I was raised knowing what is safe and what isn't on the internet. I still cannot buy things or download stuff without my parents permission, whether or not it is from my own pocket and cannot download or play free games. 

I have more friends that have been moving to computers, and they have been asking me to buy games and play with them, but I can't because of all the hoops I need to jump through to actually do anything. It's gotten to the point where people have actually said that my own devices don't actually sound like my own, and that's when I started realizing how restricted I actually am. It's gotten to the point where things that I actually do end up buying don't even work because of the restrictions I have. It's ridiculous and I was extremely disappointed. Similar restrictions are applied on my phone and iPad, however there have been some oversights that allowed me to work around said restriction. I still cannot download anything on them without a parents permission though. I've also been trying to hang out with my friends more however they are reluctant to letting me out if I already went out that week. 

I've realized now that I am unwilling to challenge myself because of the reward system. Academic excellence has been drilled into my brain so I know how important it is to do well in school. I have been consistently been doing well for the entirety of my life. Because of this, I don't bother taking AP classes since I know that if I do poorly I will end up having my privileges taken away from me. I also don't bother trying to branch out and try new things because if I end up causing some disaster it will end with me losing things. 

As a kid, I never really thought or questioned these restrictions but now that I am 16 I think they're unnecessary. I would greatly appreciate any advice that will help me gain more freedom, and I will be happy to answer any questions I get.",28Aug2020,1
581,"Yo I'd like your opinions on this.

There has been a girl and her friends staring at me for weeks at the beach. 

I have caught them staring at me hundreds I can say times.

I started liking her too, she was giving me signals, but my nervousness did not let me approach her. I was shaking when she was passing or sitting next to me.

So i decided to do the Instagram thing and followed her, but she did not follow back.

She follows 2000 and is followed by 1200.

She follows back anyone or anything that follows her.

Out of all the accs she is following, she excluded mine (probably on purpose hehe, guess I'll never know)

Im not gonna complain why she didn't  follow me back, its her decision.

But today i saw her at the beach and she literally ""ate"" me with her eyes.

What am i missing here? 

Why does she keep staring at me in a flirty way? 

What am i missing here?

 Am i oblivious about something or what?

Hi, I just turned 18 over the spring of 2020. I am a female. I have noticed that I don’t have a womanly figure. I am 5’3 and around 120 pounds. I have big arms and big thighs. I have a small chest, a 32 B. My butt looks weird, it pokes out but it is not round because there are no hips to connect with it. When you look at my butt from the back, it looks like someone took a big scoop of skin/fat out of the sides of my butt. I exercise 5 days a week. I would think with the weight lifting that I would have more curves. My waist isn’t that defined either, I can fit into 26 inch waist pants. However, from the waist it just goes straight down from there, no hips. My mom told me that she did not develop hips until she was 19-20. Do you think it’s just genetics, will I follow my moms pattern, getting hips when I’m 19? I wonder if there is anything else that could be affecting my body shape, maybe diet or wrong exercise? When did you start to develop hips?",28Aug2020,1
584,"This going to be a long read but here goes... 
 
  I’ve been with my girlfriend for roughly 10 months. She’s been my girlfriend in title for eight or nine of those. It has been rocky at times getting to know each other, figuring out what we will and won’t tolerate. 
 In my previous relationship the girlfriend would always make wild accusations and break up with me when we had any altercation. I never got used to that and one day just had to move on (plus old girl was banging another dude while taking thousands of dollars from me). That’s when I met current girlfriend.
 I was shy and shell shocked from the previous 3-year self-loathing disaster. It wasn’t easy, I had planned on being alone for a while but we met and I like who she is. 
 Unfortunately new girl would break up with me during fights as well. And one such time, right before the pandemic, I figured I’d go to my local bar and have a few drinks to sleep off. I ended up meeting another woman and we hit it off right from the start. Nothing sexual though.

 My girlfriend told me that when she breaks up with me she does so because she wants to “beat me to the punch” but I’ve told her that it’s more of a punch in the gut or just a general beating to my psyche so we’ve gotten better. 

 I’ve never told my girlfriend about bar girl. Some nights when I probably could’ve been hanging out with my girlfriend and her kid I’d be on the patio with the bar girl, just hanging out. Nights when girlfriend was hating on me or with her friends I’d be hanging with bar girl. Bar girl made it known early on that we are just friends and I’m alright with that but I never told her I had a girlfriend. Until a couple weeks ago.
  
 This is where you will think I’m shady but I had my reasons. 

 When I would hang out with bar girl it wasn’t so I could vent about my girlfriend behind her back it was so I could be occupied and not have to worry about my girlfriend who I know is fine. But the previous relationship I had been in made me wary of wanting to tell my girlfriend about this other girl because I met bar girl several months after being together with my girlfriend and after a fight we’d had. So I understand that it wouldn’t be taken so lightly.
 However after telling Bar girl that I have a girlfriend she starts acting all weird. She wants to meet my girlfriend and hang out and all that. It’s not a bad thing but it seems to come from a resentful place. 
 Yeah, I know I should’ve been upfront with both of them. But I also like the idea that my girlfriend has her friends that she hangs out with while entertaining the idea that I have my own friends that I hang out with. Bar girl makes it sound like she wants to be friends with my girlfriend and me but when that happens I will no longer have a friend of my own that I can go hang out with.
  
 So I guess where the advice would be asked is how do I go about telling my girlfriend about my bar girlfriend and not lose the relationship that I have with my girlfriend because I’m afraid bar girlfriend is going to tell my girlfriend about herself before I can tell my girlfriend about her and no woman wants to hear about something regarding their boyfriend from another source than their boyfriend.
 
 Truthfully I find both of them attractive but I really care about my girlfriend and her crazy, high-energy brat of a child. Like love-sized care. I figured bar girl would’ve just faded away but she would always reach out to me and we can talk about stuff and I thought we had a really good friendship but of course we never telling her about having a girlfriend didn’t help. But I don’t understand why if we were only going to be “friends“ from the beginning? 🤷🏻‍♂️",28Aug2020,1
585,"So, for reference, I've never been able to date, and I don't tend to connect ""romantically"" with women ever, and I've had a tendency in the past to develop feelings for women I considered to be friends because the bond between us made me attracted. Needless to say, that's never worked out for me, and it ruined those friendships.

This current girl is probably the best and closest friend I've ever had, more than anyone in the past. I've known her for over four years. I honestly never thought much about her beyond that because she's been in a relationship the entire time I've known her, and I assumed she'd always be unavailable. I'd even grown to be on pretty friendly terms with her (now former) boyfriend.

A couple weeks ago, their relationship ended, and this infatuation with her crept into my head. I started wondering if maybe there could be potential for something more (though obviously, I was going to give her plenty of time to move on, if I pursued anything at all). But, in reality, I'm quite certain she doesn't see me as an option, nor will she ever.

And in all honesty, that's fine. I really like the way things are with us, and I don't want to ever say or do anything that could ruin that. When it comes down to it, I'm mostly just very open to the idea of us dating, if she ever had that interest, but if not, I don't want things to change. As the best friend I ever had, I'd be quite upset with myself if I ever pushed her away.

So, I have no intention to pursue anything. For the most part, I'm good with that. The problem is that I don't know how to silence the small, but very noisy voice in my head that keeps saying ""What if?!"". The logical and rational side of me knows that nothing I say or do will make her see me any diffently, and that I need to just accept that we're good friends and nothing more. But the less logical voice inside keeps asking ""What if""s. What if I could convince her. What if I could discuss it with her in some way that doesn't ruin the friendship. What if she just thinks I wouldn't be interested and therefore doesn't consider me.

I don't like that I can't make that voice shut up, and I'm worried that I won't be able to fully make it go away. And I don't want to feel bad when she inevitably starts seeing someone else, and gets married, and whatnot. And I certainly don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I might've missed out on something. But I just can't pursue it when every piece of logic indicates that it's just not possible.

So, I don't know how to stamp out that last noisy part of me that wants to keep pushing the issue. I could really use some help.",28Aug2020,1

In the last two months; things with my (F17) friend (F17) have been very nice. I have felt much better as I’ve taken up exercising regularly, I’ve been eating well, I’ve gotten into Buddhism, I’m opening a freelance tattoo design business this fall, and I’ve also been pursing my hobbies again. I am also soon going to start seeing a therapist regularly. I did all of these things because I wanted to take care of myself so that my relationship with my friend would be healthier and I would feel less dependent and she would feel less pressure to care for me. My own health and relationship with my friend has been a huge motivating factor for me.

A couple of weeks ago I checked in with her again to see how we were doing; and she told me it’s been lovely when we are together, but in groups I still make her uncomfortable. When I asked why, she just pointed out things like how I was invading her personal space because I had accidentally touched her knee when we were with friends one night, or that I talk to her too much (which I felt was a bit bizarre because I treated her the same as everyone else) and just mentioned a bunch of things like that. I was distraught. I care about her so deeply and it hurt to know that I was making her uncomfortable by just being myself. I cried and felt awful— as I’ve been working so hard but it feels as though that wasn’t acknowledged and she has been nitpicking everything I do. I can’t help but overthink when I’m with her because I’m scared I’m going to do something that will upset her.

Today for the first time I got angry. I rarely experience anger— I usually just get sad. But today I was home alone and I sobbed, I cried out, I yelled and I just felt completely like a lost child. I’m angry that I’ve been wallowing in guilt for everything that I’ve done and working so hard on our relationship and it feels as though she isn’t trying or acknowledging it. I’ve given her everything she’s needed and I’m angry and think that it’s ridiculous that she was mad that I accidentally touched her knee. She is my best friend. She told me before that by needing constant validation I had made her feel like a bad friend— and she never was, but now I feel like she is. I understand that she needs time to forgive me and she never has to if she doesn’t want to, but I wish she could recognize how hard I’m trying and work with me. I want her to recognize her mistakes too. I hope this isn’t too selfish of me.

I’m disappointed because I thought we were better than this. Nothing happened this morning that caused me to throw a tantrum, but I just felt myself unload everything I’ve been keeping pent up. The last two months have been a lot of me looking in the mirror and trying to remind myself I’m a good person. She means the world to me and I just want to make things okay. I don’t know what to do about this.

Any advice would help. I think I am going to talk to my therapist about this on Monday and I really just want things to be alright. I am tired of jumping around the bush and I want things to be okay again.",28Aug2020,1

596,"I (29M) really need advice, god knows I dug myself into this hole and I can’t get out of it alone. Before I get into the content of my problem, let me just run through a few points that might agitate some folks. 


1) I have a fantastic job that pays wells and I absolutely love it 
2. I’m well respected by the staff, colleagues, and very well liked by my executives
3) I have two bachelors and a masters, with about 30k left in student loans. This is the only debt I have.
4.) I have comfortable living arrangements (for the time being) 
5.) I have not been impacted by covid or the economic downturn 
6.) I’m healthy, in decent shape, and have been favorably compared to Chris pine (I don’t see it though) 

Despite having all the wonderful things above, I am miserable. Genuinely miserable. I am not an alcoholic, but I have a very noticeable drinking problem once I pick up a bottle. I am extreme workaholic, working 70-80hrs per week. This alone has ruined 9 relationships in the past 2 years. 

Finally here’s the part I have never spoken to anyone about since it’s genuinely horrible. I’m gay and I really hate it. It’s not internalized homophobia or anything, I just have a lot of unresolved anger at myself and my family. When I came out they fully accepted and supported me, but for years while I was in the closet they were clearly homophobic. That’s the only reason I stayed in the closet. Little did I know they would have an instant change in values. 

I don’t know what problem is the root cause of my unhappiness. It’s starting get out of control and very worrying. I do have a history of depression and suicide attempts and ideation. I even ballooned up 270lbs before really getting into working out and dropping to 128lbs in 10 months. I work too much, suck at relationships, drink heavily, chain smoke (left that one out), and have nothing to do in my down time other than special projects at work or studying. I haven’t taken a vacation in years since I have nothing to do. All my former hobbies no longer carry an interest for me. I’ve ghosted all of my friends for the past year and most don’t want anything to do with me anymore and I blocked from my life. I can’t even remember having a good laugh or really enjoying a moment for the past year. 

I don’t understand how I can be so fortunate and still be miserable. Anyone else every dealt with these issues and how did you find something to be happy about?",28Aug2020,1

Will my Diploma affect the course I need to take? What course should I take? Can I apply for a scholarship and how likely am I to get one?

So I guess my main concern is fees, I'm not from a well off family and I don't think we can really spare alot of money so the first choice of places to go to study would be Australia. I read that Edith Cowan University has a Major in Animation but I couldn't find anything on their website.

599,"I'm 13f and I've always have been forgetful.  I tend to just forget little things like a chore here and there, verbal instructions, or times.  However, my forgetfulness made me mess up so humongously that I can't stop thinking about it.

My mother was gardening outside when she had to get something from the garage.  My other sister and uncle were in the living room, he was watching them both while making lunch.  So, mom called me from outside to open the garage through the door that connects the garage to the house.  Fast forward to about 5 minutes later when my mom enters our house to get a drink (garage still open btw).  She sat down for a minute to cool off when I hear her scream, ""WHERE IS THE BABY!?"".  

I come to find out that I hadn't fully shut the door connecting to the garage, which was also open.  Luckily, my baby brother (1m) had stayed in there just touching stuff.  Had he been out for another two minutes, who knows what could have happened...

My mother screamed at me saying I almost killed her baby.  I suppressed my tears, finished my chores, and ran upstairs.  I ALMOST KILLED MY BROTHER!!!

I don't know what to do.  Just a few days ago, I saved him from being crushed by a highchair he pulled on himself (he's quite the troublemaker).  My uncle is sympathetic for me, but mostly staying out of it.  I hate being this forgetful, it's slowly ruining my life.  My mom has cooled down, I don't blame her if she still resents me, I won't ever live this down.  I was having such a good day too...

I feel like such a fuckup.  I can't do anything right, not even keep my siblings out of danger it seems.  I don't think I'll ever forget how teary eyed my mother looked as she stared at me, holding my brother in her arms.  That cold stare, it feels like she told me she's ashamed of me.  I can't stop thinking of all the ways he could've died, how I risked his life with such a stupid mistake!

How do I get over this extreme guilt?  Or make it up to my family?  I feel awful...",28Aug2020,1
601,"Hey guys,

I just wanted to vent a little and maybe get some advice from you guys.

I'm a 21M Dawson college student from Montreal Canada and I've been attending there for about three or four years now. I was taking general social science for a while and transferred to a different program roughly one year ago. This new program has alot to do with media arts like Photoshop and video editing. It's called A.L.C (Arts literature &amp; Culture). It's a pretty fun program and I think I finally found which area I want to be career wise.

Last semester was really rough for me mentally. It was partially my fault because at the time I had just started smoking weed and was really digging it and the corona thing was just around the corner too at the time. So when shit finally hit the fan and everything shutdown my consumption of weed increased and so did my anxiety. So much so that I couldn't focus on my courses and eventually fell behind in my work so much that I thought the best course of action was to do an authorized withdrawal from my courses. This wouldn't affect my grades in anyway and my sponsorships I get from going to school and being First Nations. So I did that. And spent all of my quarantine with my parents. It was really boring and unproductive the first two weeks I think. But eventually I got into working out and was on a really steady routine. I slowly cut down on my weed consumption and picked up a book about starting healthy habits. The book is called Atomic Habits and it really helped me keep myself busy. I recommend it. Anyway, as time passed and was really getting used to my new quarantine lifestyle I took a flight up north and landed in my hometown where I would get quarantined again upon arrival. For two weeks I was in quarantine so I continued my workout routine and kept reading. After my two weeks was up I applied for work right away and got a job at the town's Cultural and tourism department. I film and edit anything that has to do with my people's traditions and culture and make promotional videos for them. And we post them on our Facebook page. (I'm Cree First Nations from the James Bay area). Before I left to my hometown I promised my mom that I was going to continue my college studies next semester and comeback bro Montreal. But now that the next semester is coming up and is still only available online I'm doubtful that it'll go well for me so I decided that I would stay in my hometown for a while longer and continue what I'm doing rn until EVERYTHING is opened up and not online only. But since that this decision is last minute I still have to talk to my guidance counselor about how I'm gonna do this because I'm registered for my online courses still and I arranged travel back to Montreal but I have to find a way to cancel all of it. My classes start in three days which means the college and the Cree School Board (My sponsors) are still expecting me to attend the classes. I told my parents about my decision and they support me but they're as worried about my studies as I am. I think this is one of my first attempts at making an adult decision by myself and so far it's not really going well... Lol.

Anyways, I just wanted to get some input and maybe some advice from you guys about my hasty decision making. Sorry if I was rambling.",28Aug2020,1
602," After 3 years of trying to convince my dad of getting a cat, he finally said that we could try to get one. After however, talking with my dad again today he said that we cant get a cat because my 13 year old sister (who is slightly autistic (\*this is not used as an insult\*) ) wants a dog, and he said that if i got a cat she would get jealous and want a dog and then my parents would have to refuse because a dog is too much care and that would make her upset. I am 16 years old and i feel i am a little too old to be affected by shit like this, i can care for a cat myself and i think i should have it. How do i convince them that the reason they are giving is wrong and my sister has to understand the fact that a dog is simply too much care for our lifestyle?(The problem is they might tell me that because my sister is autistic that she wont understand the reasons and simply be upset , but i think she is capable of understanding...) anyway any advice is welcome , thank you.",28Aug2020,1

607,"As a sophomore in high school, this 2020-2021 school year, there is a lot one would think about.

My family wants me to do a fall sport like cross country or soccer. I have done soccer for about 3 years but I'm hesitant to do it a fourth.

I am more like an arts kinda guy. I love doing the musical and the play.

I am a little guy, but I want to strive to be a big guy (ripped). Many people do that by doing sports but I think I could achieve my goal with a workout plan. My metabolism is pretty fast so I am grateful for that.

Whenever there is a mention about sports it feels like my head is on fire. Maybe its anxiety or a tension headache, I have no idea.

I also have a fear of being injured. Maybe I'm a wuss or just being too girly, I just need some advice.

I like hanging out with the boys also.",28Aug2020,1
608," Long story short, I have an IPhone 5s for about 6 years.

Last year in July, I got my first repair for it because the charging dock was damaged. Not only that, I even changed the battery as well which charged me extra. Please note that it was a third party.

Everything is fine until around the late-October, something wrong with it as the screen keeps flickering. It turns out that the battery was swollen.

So, I brought a new IPhone 7 but it still kept the IPhone 5s. The 5s still works until around early November, it stopped working anymore.

I always check my damaged IPhone 5s until March where my online class starts due to the COVID 19, I check it and found out that the left side of the screen popped up not so much.

However, I still kept it because I still have some data in it. It was currently placed in a huge plastic container with other of my family’s stuff.

So right now, I’m planning to get my IPhone 5s repaired very soon as possible.

Unfortunately, there are few reasons about it.

1. I’m Autistic and I can’t go outside unless I have a guidance with me. Because, my mom was very worried that go somewhere far or doesn’t know the direction.
2. It’s currently summer as outside was still hot. I need to put some small cool container in order to prevent the damaged phone from the heat.
3. Usually when I want something, I sometimes ask my mom’s permission first. But, I don’t know if I can ask her about the phone repair.

So, please. I need tips where I can get prepared so I can start getting my IPhone repaired very soon.

Thank you.",28Aug2020,1
610,"Honestly I don’t care if she dies. Cuz she made my life a living hell. Just because she’s my sibling doenst mean i dotn have to say rude things. She treats me like shit and her dying would be the best thing for me. She yells at me over the dumbest stuff. If I’m just chilling in my room she will find so something to complain about even tho I’ve done all the chores. She’s just like a school bully. 

Cuz everytime we are together, she ends up being a bitch to me. She finds every little thing to complain about me. I literally stay in my room and bother nobody. But she comes in mad my energy is fucked. She says how I’m miserable all the time. I feel myself when I’m alone. But once they come in I change. And have to be someone I’m not, only to please them.

My family wonders why I wanna be alone. She asked me to help her with something, but her boyfriend can help her with it when he gets here.

613,"Not really asking for advice, just your thoughts.

I’ve always been an average student. Hated studying, fooled around quite a bit, didn’t have good relationships with teachers. I was a C+ student at most during the entirety of elementary and middle school. Things looked up in high school since I started to actually work. I take IGCSEs for my school, a really important indicator to see if we can get into the final two years of high school. Ngl, worked my ass off, thanks to supportive parents and a good support class. Good grades ish (5A*s, 2As, C) that allowed me to go to boarding school. Since I kinda knew what studying strategy worked for me, I slacked off for the first year. I was going to take A levels and get into an England uni, and the best way was to (I thought) just focus in class and do notes and do really well in the finals. So I slacked off, bombed my class tests because I didn’t bother studying for it since they didn’t matter in the end. My mocks were decent but I didn’t try lol. Now because of our amazing friend covid, I couldn’t take the final A level exams (which I was relying on) and the exam board would decide the grades for us. The problem was that my studying strategy didn’t exactly put me in a good light.

Long story short, a lot of tears were shed because I thought I didn’t get into uni since the exam board fucked up and gave me shitty grades (predicted A* AA and ended up with ABB but then turned back to A* AA cause of changes to the system) I ended up getting into my first choice uni, and a rather prestigious uni at that (top 10 in the world but not naming it). 

This made me feel so many mixed emotions. I was relying on my final exams to prove my teachers wrong, to tell them I do deserve to get into a good school and I’m not just a dumb and lazy piece of shit :,). I knew I would work my ass off two months before and would probably be able to get the grades into my first choice. But I didn’t get that chance and I feel like I was just handed this place at this amazing uni on a silver platter. I’ve seen so many of my classmates being so diligent their entire lives, straight As throughout their entire school year, 10A* s for IGCSEs, but fucked over because of not being able to take the finals due to covid and couldn’t get into their first choice unis. 

So this made me think, do I really deserve this?",28Aug2020,1
614,"I’ll start by saying I am 18F I started my first year of college last fall and lived on campus until half way through the second semester everyone was sent home due to COVID-19 and fully transitioned to online classes for the rest of the semester. Those classes transitioning to being online weren’t too terrible. It was slightly frustrating but it quickly got better. Now this starting semester on the other hand.... is god awful. I changed colleges since I did not plan to live on campus and this new college allowed a much quicker commute as well as finishing my degree in 4 years instead of 5. So, last Wednesday, the 26th I started my online college courses and I’ve already had a mental break down each day and I’m losing my mind I want to drop out. Luckily my mother is paying for my college but problem with that is she will not allow me to drop out since the classes are “more lenient” now than ever before. My problem is, I have 2 classes that are doing online meetings and 2 that are not and fully online. After all my classes, I have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHATS GOING ON!!!!! I have emailed professors that I had online meetings with and kind of get a drift of what is going on but still confused and now I’m finding out I have already missed deadlines for my other classes because the organization of the websites we are using is HORRENDOUS and I’m really struggling to adapt and I just really want to wait until classes are on site again. I don’t know what to do because I tried taking to my mom but I don’t think she took me very seriously since it was in the moment of me being frustrated that the $135 BRAND NEW book I bought FROM MY SCHOOL somehow has a code that is already in use and I spent 4 hours on the phone with customer service for them to fucking hang up on me. I can’t focus on these online meetings either because I feel like I have slight adhd or something although I’ve never been diagnosed I STRUGGLE to focus with the screens and need to be there in person absorbing the information, writing things down, being given CLEAR CUT instructions now Mumbo jumbo of unorganized messes. &gt;.&gt; idk what to do",28Aug2020,1

619,"I'm really new to Reddit, and this is actually my first post so I'll get right to it. I've always felt underestimated by my parents, particularly my father for some odd reason. I'm constantly compared to my sisters, one who is doing a PhD in Neuroscience at UCL and the other is about to finish her masters in neuroscience. I'm only 16 (and a boy), and I'm constantly being put down - no matter what I do. My sisters are smart, and I'm proud of them. Yet everyday, my dad finds it reasonable to say ""I don't think you'll get to University""...

To put this into context, I got my GCSEs and scored 8 9s (9=A\*\*), an 8 (A\*) and a 7 (A). I understand we didn't do exams this year, but even so, my mock grades were only slightly lower. I enter for the UKMT Maths Challenge every year, and achieve bronze-silver certificates. I speak at assemblies at my school. My teachers have love to teach me, according to them. Aside from school, at home I do everything I'm told to if it's reasonable. I wake up at around 7am and sleep at 9:30pm.

Family drama is shoved in my face, when I honestly couldn't care less. My dad tries to pit me and my sisters against my mum, but acts all sweet to our mother's face. My mum hits me for unreasonable things (e.g. using my phone after I've finished all my homework). She usually backs this up by the excuse ""you don't need to use your phone everyday"", when she herself watches Youtube for a good 3-4 hours/day. I'm not allowed to work after 8pm, so we can all have 'family time' - when that's just watching TV. As far as my experiences go, I haven't bonded significantly with anyone by watching TV. 

I think what hurts me more is my dad's words. As I said before, he tells me about how I won't get to University - but when I work he tells me to stop and relax. It drives me insane to say the least. I don't care about his words, people can say anything at the end of the day. What confuses me is that I WANT TO WORK, but I'm told not to. Everywhere else, I see it as the other way round. I genuinely want to learn and I find exploring and applying concepts fascinating. I   rarely get distracted whilst working, and keep my phone away from me when I work as well. So when I work, not to complete homework but just to learn something, my mum or dad come with the 'watch TV' excuse. If I don't budge, my parents turn off the lights and shout at me for working too late, bear in mind the time would only be around 9:00pm. 

I'd gladly go to them, if we could actually talk to each other with no facades, on positive topics. If you're South Asian, I'm almost certain you know about the negativity in TV shows - the drama and just the overall pessimism.

This sounds bad but I feel nothing when my parents make promises or say anything to me. Wow that was a big jump between topics. They're usually always broken so I decide to keep the promise in mind, but not invest myself into it. I was supposed to get a new phone, because I've been using my dad's old S5 for the past 3 years - they suggested it, not me. That didn't happen. I've also been waiting for a new coat, since my old one was getting small (I've had it since I was 12). I asked last year, they said to wait a year and I agreed. A year passed and I get the classic shrug or sigh - the one that makes you feel like a liability. Then the next day, I get the ""others don't have parents as good as us"" just because my father doesn't smoke or drink. As cruel as it sounds, I'd rather my dad drink alcohol and believe in me and nurture me, than live through our current situation.

\[Oh and my parents are Indian. And, if this helps you get a better picture of them - they believe dentistry is a scam....\]

625,"So I am eligible to study medicine in a university in the European Union. If I study in English, it will cost me 12,000 euros (or 14,400 usd) a year.

626,"Over the last 8 years (I think this process started roughly when I was 16 years old although I am not sure) I have become increasingly less empathetic towards people. This reached its peek when I was about 19 or maybe 20 yo. It's pretty fuzzy and hard to pinpoint when the shift happened. Anyways.

I am going to spare you my background story but, after for the longest time believing that my lack of romantic interest in girls and empathy in general is caused by my lack of self worth and depression, I finally got a new perspective through the bunch of neurobiology books I read recently. 
This perspective is the llack of oxytocin which can be caused by lack of physical contact (which I have close to 0 off) as well as the stress hormon cortisol (which I have a lot of).
Just after reading those books it hit me that my problems don't just lie in lack of romantic interest and empathy, it's way more than that. 

I don't miss my friends or family no matter how long I don't see them, I never look forward to seeing them, and if I would never see them from today I probably wouldn't care. I know how this sounds but I am not doing this on purpose. I like my friends and my family, I just don't have this emotional connection. I used to have it though, I remember a time in middle school were I cried because my best friend had to move away, or in highschool how badly I missed my best girl-friend over summer vacation.
But nowadays I feel nothing.
Yet I yearn so deeply for such emotional connections, even the bad sides. I want to be love sick, I want to miss people, I want to feel their pain. 

I know I am grasping at straws here but is there anyone who experienced something similar? How do I get my emotional self back? I allready thought about going to massages regularly, maybe get some more oxytocin but I don't think that would be enough to Kickstart a change.

When ever I go up to the shop, the business owner always wants me to do something, without pay.

""I can't pay you, but can you do something for me?

Now I have a really hard time saying no, so when she asked me to take on a project, I say ok.

This project that I'm on now is a nightmare. When I agreed to do the project, there was no mention of a deadline, just a whatever project.
But now all the sudden there's a deadline, a short as fuck deadline!  I can only work with what I've got and there ain't shit to work with.
The project is too big and requires attention to detail and there's no way I can get it done, especially when they keep changing the game plan. 

So should I blow off this project and leave them to do it themselves? Or should I keep stressing over it and get as much done before the deadline, knowing that it'll be an incomplete project?",28Aug2020,1
629,"I finally stumbled on a possible employment. Tbh I really don't like the job despite it being good and stable... Quite scared too with new people possibly becoming part of my life. But I know I have no choice but to accept it because I really need to start working right now. It's been too long.

Missing my college friends, acquiantances so much as well, but pretty sure they don't miss me anymore. We all had our own paths after graduation. Everything's not the same anymore. Everyone's busy. We grew farther and farther away... But still I just can't remove them in my heart for some reason. I'm still longing for them so much even though most of them may have moved on enjoying adult life. We don't talk online anymore and it pains me so much. I have no other friends. I'm literally just talking with my family althroughout this quarantine. I know being with your family is a huge blessing, but there's just this feeling that I crave for some nonfamilial bonds and relationships. I'm not super open with my family btw.

The pandemic making me miss life before pre covid... The busy streets, traffic, going everywhere you want without worrying. Nos it's different. Your every move is limited and it starting to make me crazy.

I don't know how to explain what I feel right now. It's like a mix of frustration, fear (possibly having a job and meeting new people) and pain (attachment issues with my student life and memories). I feel so hollow and my heart is so heavy. I want to vent but I don't know who to talk to. I just feel emotional on everything...",28Aug2020,1

So the thing is, it's currently 12:52am now and I still HAVEN'T gone to bed.

Thing is, I started being tired at about 11:30pm until now but somehow I just continued using my phone to watch more videos or just browse through social media apps.

I don't know why I didn't put my phone down and sleep despite being tired. I don't want to keep being sleep deprived.

I know the phone gives off some light that makes my body think it's still day and slow the production of melatonin but in this case, I DO feel tired but my mind is just somehow not allowing me to put the phone down and actually go to sleep.

This sounds dumb in so many ways but yeah. Is there a way to resolve this? I tried not using my phone before bed but it has literally become a natural habit so I really can't.",28Aug2020,1
631,"I’ve always wanted to live off of my creative talents. Specifically, I’ve always wanted to be an actor. I live in LA. I have experience living in NYC. I currently have an agent. I’ve been in lots of indie projects including a feature length movie that I starred in and is now making its rounds at film festival circuits. SAG Eligible. Never been on TV nor in a commercial. I’ve been put on avail for many, many commercials (aka the final round before being confirmed by the client as “booked”)

A lil about me: I’m a woman, South American heritage, I specialize in comedy and I’m good at it! 

I remember being told at one of my internships that up until the age of 25, my category of women is the most competitive in the business. After 25, people start quitting their dream and the pool becomes a lot smaller. Well, I’m 26 and I still can’t see myself doing anything else other than acting.

I’m also at a place in my life where I’m in a pool of people that are very talented and some of them are booking huge Netflix, Comedy Central, etc. shows. These people are becoming stars before my eyes. They’re freaking making it. I can’t help but be proud and insanely jealous at the same time.

I want to have integrity while also making the most of these budding connections.

For example, I am on a long-term project with someone who is in a very famous series on Amazon, gets interviewed by magazines weekly, has close to a million followers on Instagram now and is a few years older than me. I’ve voice-acted alongside them many, many times. I wouldn’t want to ask them to recommend me to his representation. (Aka a way better agent and manager than I have now) because I fear putting that person in an awkward position where I look like I’m using him.

I have these people in my orbit that are doing “it”, people!

What should I do?

How can I leverage these orbiting friends while not putting them on the spot?

How can I make the most of my career?

How can I finally start living my dream too?",28Aug2020,1
632,"I had gone through some things in the past that caused me to struggle with being touched ( both non sexually and sexually) and my brother is extremely physical. He likes to hug people and touch them in general (non sexually) which makes me uncomfortable when he tries to do these things to me. Most commonly he tries to hug me, but there have been times where he tries to lay his head on my lap or rest his head on my shoulder and I hate it very much. I've tried telling him no before, but it just isn't getting across that I'm being serious. After telling him I don't like it, he keeps taking it as, ""I hate it when only you hug me and touch me,"" and causes us to get into arguments. How could I tell him that i don't like being touched in a way that he knows I don't hate him and gets it through to him so that he might try to refrain from touching me?",28Aug2020,1
633,"I have trance like obsession with stuff that is beautiful to the senses. 

When I smell something nice, I can sit and absorb that smell and intensely, emotionally react to it for hours at a time

When I touch something that feels nice, I want to squeeze it and mentally absorb that feeling and continuously replay the sensation in my mind. I even get aggressive and feel anger at myself, that I can’t absorb this thing hard enough 

When I am around my girlfriend (24F) I can caress her, affectionately cuddle with her and gaze at her for hours and hours while she works, and I feel utterly captivated and struggle to do something else. 


Basically anything beautiful to sight, sound, touch, taste or smell, I get fanatically entranced by it and intensely, vividly play that sensory experience over in my mind and DO NOT GET BORED OF THESE EXPERIENCES 


That’s what worries me. So much of my day is taken up by intense, spiritual focus on every little pleasing thing I experience, I wish I was more mentally free to just experience stuff and then move on with my life and not obsess over it.

634," Hey, I am a student in India, currently in high school. I've been trying to decide on a college major for the past 3 months and I couldn't make a rigid decision. I could either take **engineering** or **economics** as my college major.

So, here's the thing. I wanna start my own factory or get into the renewable energy industry in the future. If I have to do that, I will have to take engineering. But, the thing is that I don't feel comfortable with physics. It makes me feel really anxious and depressed; plus I don't think I like physics that much and I'm not really good at it either. A lot of people who took the engineering subjects in my school, scored low grades (there are some exceptions) and ended up in bad universities.

I was considering taking economics because I actually like it and I have a passion for it. I'm also confident that I'll be able to score really well and go to a good university if I choose economics. But, if I take economics, I won't be able to start my dream factory and I'll end up taking over my dad's business - which I'm not really interested in.

So, I believe that you see the pattern here. I'll be happy in the short-run if I take economics, but not really happy in the long run. On the other hand, I'll be happy in the long run if I take engineering, but sad in the short-run. I encourage all of you to comment your opinions on this, it would really help me make a decision.",28Aug2020,1

I had fun after a long time when I joined them playing the game ""Among us"" with microphone on. Finally after being alone for a long time because of the pandemic I was able to get along with people again.

Everything is fun until there is this toxic girl in game who just keep cussing and verbally abuse anyone. Everyone in game don't act like that and I know that its just a game but she just makes me very uncomfortable. I really want to call out on her so she could be aware that she makes me uncomfortable but I'm just new to that group. I was anxious that they will just team up against me.

Theres that first time she cursed at me and called me an idiot even though we're not that close, I just brushed it off and not care about it.I have to add that she also curse at everyone when she talks for real. I'm actually glad she dropped out now.

Just a moment ago she cursed at me again and it made me really sad and I felt very hurt that time. I went silent and my other classmates started noticing it.

638,"My dad is really annoying at times. He has literally zero respect for other people. Every single time we eat dinner together, my dad always eats with his hands. He grabs food with his hands, and he burps and farts like 400 times when he eats. It's so disgusting when he does that. He also slouches at the dinner table, and he eats way too much of the limited food that is supposed to be for everyone. When we get like a cake or something, my dad slices 90% of the cake for himself, while leaving everyone else a tiny sliver. Each time we eat, my dad is shirtless, and I hate having to see his gross breasts and fat potbelly. He never shaves his armpit hair, and it's so disgusting. He looks like a barbarian, mostly because his face is ugly and has gross whiskers growing out of it.

My dad also drinks a lot of milk. He takes a jug of milk and drinks straight from it, and then he rips out an enormous fart that rings for half a minute. I try so hard not to freak out when he does that. I just want to yell at him when he does that. My mom stopped buying milk a long time ago, but my dad still goes to the grocery store and buys milk for himself. The milk makes him fart all the time, and he doesn't even seem to notice how disgusted everyone else are.

He also spends a really long time in the bathroom. When he takes a shower, he spends close to an hour in the shower, listening to stupid news reports the whole time. I swear if he stopped bringing his phone into the bathroom, he would spend a heck lot less time in there. He scrubs his whole body with the sponge, and he even scrubs his rear end with it, and it smells horrible afterward. Then he just throws it on the shower floor. He leaves his dirty underwear in the shower, and he farts non-stop in the shower. He toots around 10 to 20 times every minute. He is definitely lactose intolerant, and he doesn't even take responsibility for his actions.

And he uses the bathroom around 20 times a day. The most times he ever used the bathroom was around 90. He never flushes after using the bathroom, and he makes a mess in the toilet. It smells horrible afterward. Sooner or later, someone will have to plug up their nose, plumb their toilet, sanitize the whole bathroom, and put air fresheners in the bathroom. He eats a lot of food, and he never exercises.

My dad has no manners at home. He always puts his feet up on the table in the kitchen, and he squeezes the nastiest farts. I can't tolerate him at all. He also sits on people's beds and farts when sitting on them. The worst part is when my dad gets angry. When he is angry, the whole house is like a war zone. First, at home, he stomps up and down the stairs aggressively, screaming the whole time. He gets really gassy when he is mad, and he burps and farts way too much. He kicks down chairs and tables, and he smashes the wall with his fists. He takes a book and smashes the kitchen table with it. It's so frustrating, because some of the books he abuses are library books or textbooks the school loans me. Every book in our house is deformed because of him. 

When my dad is angry, he is super ugly. He is already ugly to begin with. For example, he has puffy hair, round eyes, a thick unibrow, a huge nose, elephant ears, invisible lips, a fat, bulgy torso, thick thighs, jiggly calves, and a heck lot of gross hair growing everywhere on him. When he is angry, his eyes bulge out, his face turn red, his yells super loud, and his hands turn into fists, and he tends to have bad breath as well.",28Aug2020,1
639,"Hey guys, so like the title says I’m not sure if I was molested as a child. Something happened to me that I still remember today, and it wasn’t until probably sometime last year that the memory came up again and I thought about it more deeply.... I’m not sure if this was a one time occurrence of molestation by my dad. 

First to give some background, my dad grew up not receiving much affection from his dad, I don’t know much about it but I know he was beaten and stuff. I’ve never really had the typical father daughter relationship with my dad probably due to this lack of emotional availability and affection as well as him having to had travel a lot for work, I saw him maybe once or twice a month. He was a good father in terms of financially providing for me, but honestly I’ve never felt emotionally attached to him. Even when he was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, (he’s cancer free now), I barely batted an eyelash.... I feel guilty feeling this way towards my dad but I mean it’s not because I want to, he just never really showed much emotional support or affection towards me. Anyway, now for the incident. 

I’m not sure how old I was at the time, I was probably under ten years old but I remember we were at home in my parents bedroom (I don’t know where my mom was, she was probably somewhere else in the house. I don’t think we were the only ones home) and I was alone with my dad in the room and my friend’s dog. I remember laying on my stomach either reading a book or drawing. Sorry my memory is a bit hazy about the details. I remember that he put his hand down my pants and was rubbing my butt. I don’t remember if my pants were pulled down and they were exposed or if his hand was just under them, either way I know for a fact he was touching my bare butt. I remember not saying or doing anything because I didn’t think anything was wrong... I think maybe I was confused because 1. My dad doesn’t show affection including physical so maybe that was his messed up way of showing it, and 2. I feel my dad is kind of aloof and clueless about some things.. I can’t really explain it but he doesn’t seem to have common sense in some situations... and I can never tell what’s going on in his head because he’s not an expressive person. Anyway, it didn’t last for that long and he didn’t do anything else. I remember leaving after, not sure if it’s because I was starting to feel uncomfortable or because I just wanted to leave in general. Nothing like that has ever happened before or since. 

I am now 23 years old. My dad has never really shown any deviant sexual or weird behavior towards me or my older brother or sister. I do remember a long time ago I think it was his car, I found porn videos in the back trunk. I don’t know if he watched those or what but I just remember that. Ive been struggling thinking of this memory and I’ve never told anyone because I don’t want to jump to conclusions and paint my dad as a bad person because that was the only time that happened. I’ll probably never bring this up to him bf he probably won’t remember or probably deny and think I’m crazy bc it was so long ago and nothing like that happened since. I don’t know if it was inappropriate behavior... I literally was googling if touching a child’s bare butt is considered assault. I really am confused and even if I didn’t know what was going on at the time, looking back I am hurt and confused and feel that was wrong. 

What do you guys think? What would you guys consider that act as? And do you think that people who do assault children know what they’re doing? Could it be unintentional? I feel giving the background of my dad is important because I don’t think it was malicious intent at all but I don’t know. Please, only serious replies. Thank you.",28Aug2020,1
640,"We both met at gaming forum and we started to become friends. He told me he likes me but I told him I’d just wanna be friends at first. We texted for like 2 weeks and then he wanted to call me. I told him several times that I’m scared and that this would be scary for me. The phone call went quite bad with me being mean and cold to him because I was uncomfortable. Later I tried to talk to him about it but he was super nice and friendly but just didn’t really wanna continue the conversation. I left him at that and after a while bought it up on text saying that he seems off after the conversation and  if he still wants to talk to which he responded “no we are very much good, I’ve been busy playing this new game”. I kinda thought maybe that’s the reason and went along with it but he kinda didn’t text much after that. My gut feeling said it’s the call that changed things so after another whole week I messaged him asking us to call, to which he responded flirty and before the call we were texting for a bit in which he told me he asked me if I like him to which I said I do kinda like him and he said he said he’d prefer to be more than friends. We didn’t discuss beyond that.
The second call went considerably well, he mentioned that I seem a lot more comfortable with him now. Then  the next day he was back to normal texting me etc and then he asked me to call me to which I said okay. This call was okay, but not as good as the second as I am not good talking back to back with the same person and usually need some time to refresh. There was a little snapping here and there from my end  and to the end he even mentioned that he feels I’m not comfortable with him even if it’s been our third call. He also mentioned somewhere during this when asked about the game he was playing that “he doesn’t  play that  game often“ and said “oh yea we were on a break for 2 weeks” (although I had no idea he took one from me? Cause he kept saying things are ok and pretended it was okay)

After that the next day I messaged him to which his responses were a little dry so I just didn’t bother to keep it going.
Few days after that he tried starting a new convo about “how my bday is coming soon” and I texted after 4 hours cause I was busy and about to sleep to which he didn’t continue the conversation.

Then his birthday wish to me was kinda dry, just a normal happy birthday with a gift emoji. I mentioned I’d be partying with my friends for two days so I couldn’t respond to him and only responded to him a whole day after my birthday and sent a pic me and one of my cake along with thanks! To which his response was super dry like “oh cool :)”.
I later tried starting another conversation with him to which he was dry but polite. I asked him if he wanted to talk to which he declined and said perhaps tmrw, I texted “sure up to u” to which he responded saying “sorry I’ve just been busy for the past few days” 

I got the vibe maybe he was just avoiding me but doesn’t know how to say it so I texted him a very  nice paragraph saying it’s okay if he didn’t wanna talk to me cause not everyone vibes with everyone and I get that. He responded to that jokingly saying “but I still wanna give you my time! I have two exams coming up next week and I’ve been busy with that”. I kinda didn’t want us to slide over this because I do feel that there’s a communication GAP between us that I wanna talk about so I just messaged him saying “I’m not sure if u understood what I was tryna say? Along with all the best for ur test”. I didn’t wanna let it slide cause the last time I asked he denied there being a problem but later I got to know there was and he was avoiding. This time I really wanna clear things from my end and ask him what’s up.
The thing is I take a Long time to warm up to new people and be comfortable 100%. Because of that I come off as closed, a little mean and a cold at times and that along with the fact that he is the first person I spoke to online on call also made me more scared which translated to me being a little cold. I wanted to mention this and kinda apologise and state this behaviour of mine  that I need time to warm up.

So far he seems the type who warms up quickly on calls. He mentioned he’s into online gaming along so that could be why. He also seems non confrontational and I’m not sure how to get him to admit what’s going on. Also, we only have added each other on snapchat so we could easily delete each other so I’m not sure why he wouldn’t just cut me off if he wanted too?

Should I give him time? Does he even like me or want to talk to me? How do I confront him?

Any and all feedback is appreciated! Please don’t inbox me and please respond via post :) 

TL;DR Not sure what is going on between us?",28Aug2020,1
641,"My uncle and aunt got divorced not too long ago, they have 2 kids, one of them is married and the other one is 17 y/o. They had a nasty divorce, he kicked her out of the house and sold it and kept more than half of it.

My uncle is direct family (my dad's brother) and he's always been immature and a compulsive liar. He's never been able to provide for himself or his family, and gets money from my grandma and other relatives. It seems like everyone thinks my aunt is the bad one in the equation, but my mom's really good friends with her and she knows my uncle lies about where he gets money and how he spends it.

About a month ago, my aunt had to be hospitalized while their son and my uncle were out on vacation (during the pandemic, so stupid). My uncle practically disappeared with his gf because they got a great deal at a resort or something. I know for a fact my aunt pays for the entire insurance, but my uncle told my dad that he covered it.

My cousin is going through a rebellious phase and went to live with his dad for a while, but he complained that my uncle said they didn't have money to keep him there while he hung out with his gf smoking weed. It's insane because he gets loans from my dad and others and is able to afford a private sports club and other hobbies.

Thing is, I don't really know how to help her. She said she wants to sue my uncle because he legally owes her money, but I think that would make things worse.

648,"I'm in my late 20s so maybe this is a stupid question, but still.

In my family when we have serious fights we don't talk (and we live together). In my life there were times when I didn't talk with mom or dad for months.

Anyway, I'm really tired of this. I want to go back to normal. I really didn't want this to happen, I really wanted us to go back to normal from the start, but for some reason it just happened.

Tensions are high though. I can't just go and ask my mom to make up ( usually things resolve themselves after months someone just makes a joke or something and we go back to normal slowly).  I cant' do that this time cause she told me cruel things like she wished she would have killed me while I was in her belly, or that I'm better off getting covid and dying in prison than being the waste of life that I am now. But it sounds worse than it is, it escalated to that point. It started with her usual angry monologues where she'd say how careless or useless I am (although here she has a point), but I didn't take it anymore for some reason this time so I told her to shut up and it just escalated to the point where she said those things and I was saying to her to shut up you fucking stupid retarded animal. Wrong on my part too, but things got heated and I don't think well when I'm angry.

Anyway, dad won't forgive her, mom won't forgive dad. Dad has a point, he can't start the making up process cause he's the victim this time. Mom just freaked out and started her monologues on him for no reason, and he doesn't take that shit. She did it cause she feels like my dad doesn't clean enough and that he leaves too much of a mess after he cooks. He used to do most of the cooking, and he'd clean all the dishes and stuff after him, but she felt that after washing he'd splash too much water around and that ruined the cupboards and stuff. And that there was too much grease in the kitchen in general after months of his cooking, So she freaked out on him and she won't talk to him and he won't talk to her.

Anyway, that's the gist of it. I think my only option is to wait for her to initiate something, but that can take months and idk how serious it is this time it might be over for good. Dad definitely won't start the making up process. I'd like to do something but tbh after she said it will be hard, especially because she thinks I wronged her despite what she said. So for me to start it would feel really, really shitty for me. I guess I just gotta wait it out and hope it works out.",28Aug2020,1

The exam is tomorrow, and I would’ve driven 30 minutes at 6 am to a test center to take an extremely unfair and useless exam, that costs 50$.

It’s CEO makes 700,000$ a year. It’s roughly 30 top executives make 360,000$ a year. The company makes literal profit and don’t have to pay any taxes. And they milk the students of America for money, creating extreme gaps in sat scores between wealthy and poor students. (It is a linear relationship, I wrote a paper on it for school, you can look up info about it if you’d like) I don’t know how to go about starting this, but if someone has advice I would appreciate it a lot.",28Aug2020,1
652,"Hi! Sorry it’s absurdly long one. But the TLDR is my roommate moved her boyfriend in (he’s not on the lease) and if we truly were splitting it 3 ways, which is what the three of us  agreed on, my roommates are shorting me about $50 each every month on rent. 

So I (28F) signed a lease with a friend (29F) almost a year ago (I will not be renewing with them.) She initially was an okay roommate, we had our ups and downs and adjustments like anyone else moving in together.

A few months into this year her boyfriend (22M) we’ll call him Mark, started staying over a lot, which was ok by me cause he kept to himself and I never saw him. I also started dating someone and I spent a lot of time at my own boyfriends place, we hardly came to mine cause my boyfriend despises Mark (he calls him the homeless man living in our apartment).

After him staying here 30 days in a row (I kept track) I said to her, “okay, he never went home this month, not even one night, I expect him to start paying rent and doing his part around the apartment.” 

We live in upscale apartments, and they are expensive. He had been renting a cheap room from his boss on one of his bosses properties. After some back and forth, she and I agreed it’s only fair to split it 3 ways.

That month, my roommate gave me a check for exactly 2/3 rent. Cool, no issues there.

Then, they both quit their jobs. Mark actually no-called, no-showed and when they called him to check on him, he basically was like “yeah I’m never coming in again” 

Mark obviously lost the room he was paying for because his boss was pissed. So now he has no place to live, no where to go, and it actually is counting as an eviction so he can’t even get a place of his own until he pays his boss back. Chalk it up to being young and dumb and not thinking ahead.

My roommate proceeded to quit her job too. She did similar work to Mark and basically said to me “well If it’s not good enough for mark, it’s not good enough for me”. I obviously begged her not to until she had something else lined up but she assured me she had savings and it would be enough until they could get jobs.

Then COVID happened.

They obviously were unemployed a lot longer than they expected. I’m sure she was borrowing money from her parents, putting things on credit cards, and doing odd jobs to make ends meet. Rent from them was consistently late. 

I did what I thought was the generous thing and I would let them do odd jobs for me-things I would have to pay for anyway-and give them $20 off rent here, $40 off electric there, in exchange for their labor. One month I also offered to give them a loan until they could get jobs because I noticed she didn’t even have enough money for groceries but she refused and the next day she had loaded up on groceries (I’m guessing courtesy of mom).

Soon, as several months have gone by of this, my own savings depleted from constantly covering their shortages, it would take every dollar I had to pay the bills on time and then I would have to wait for them to scrounge the money up to pay me back so that *I* could buy groceries.

They both are now employed. My roommate paid back her debts and actually made enough to completely pay her car off so I thought everything would be fine this month with rent. 

However, I get the rent check from them and this month and it is $100 short.
 
When I got it, I kinda gave her this look like “what the hell?” And she told me it’s everything she has, it was her whole paycheck. I asked her when she or mark gets paid next and she got a little offended and said that it hasn’t been a problem before, that’s how much she made the check out last month. Last month they both did chores and errands for me that were worth $100 in my mind to get done. I work weird hours and stores aren’t open right now with COVID on my time off. I ended the conversation noncommittally because I know how upset she gets about money.

However, I don’t want to let this one slide. They already depleted my savings. Me covering this one is literally going to leave me $10 until my next paycheck for gas and groceries. I am HURT-ING.

I also took a pay cut for a job I LOVE and they know this. 

Our lease is almost up. I will be resigning without them.

What I need advice on is how to approach this with my roommates. I don’t want to let this one slide. They are short $50 each. I find it hard to believe that she can afford to pay a vehicle off but can’t pay me the proper amount in rent. 

My boyfriend thinks I should just let it go because I’ve already been so lenient with them and he says pushing them for such a small amount of money will just make living there unnecessarily difficult and I don’t have much time left. My boyfriend has offered to pay the shortage, but he shouldn’t have to. Neither should I, in my opinion, now that they are both working. 

Reddit, what do I do? Do I let it go and buckle down on my budget until they leave? Do I confront them? 

Im considering sending her a text like “hey just let me know when you or Mark can get the other $100 to me!” Good or bad idea?

I KNOW I have dug myself quite the hole here, so I’d appreciate just constructive advice about how to move forward. 

I have obviously learned my lesson HARD about living with friends/lending money to friends/etc, etc.

Thank you for reading if you made it this far (yikes)",28Aug2020,1
653,"I know this sounds very stupid, the whole situation is very weird.

I (18/f) have always been rather thin. I live in a country where healthy food is quite cheap and accessable, so my family eats very healthy (not quinoa-avocado-chia-healthy, just high-quality food and stuff). During the lockdown, I lost at least 10 pounds due to stress and other factors. Now, I'll have a surgery in a month and if I want the recovery to be as quick as possible, I need to have more than just the minimum weight for my size. The last 3 months or so, I tried to gain weight, but it hasn't worked.

I talked to some friends who have the opposite problem, and I always thought that I was eating more than them. I started to track my calories, and it turned out that I eat much less than I always thought. I also have a quite big frame (I'm 5'9 and not very ""fragile"", I have wide shoulders and stuff), so the minimum weight is too less for me. I tried to eat more, but it somehow just isn't enough. I often forget about food because I'm barely hungry. I have ADHD and sometimes get so invested in things that I forget to eat almost the whole day. I tried to have a schedule, but whenever something happens that collides with it, I forget to eat or eat way too little.

Another problem is that I have a very low self-esteem. I like the body that I have now from the way it looks, but I feel the negative impacts it has on my health. I want to gain weight to be more healthy, but I don't want my body to change. But since I know how much better it would be to gain a bit of weight, I still want to do it.

I posted about this some time ago, but took it down because people were calling me fatphobic. I am not. I don't care if you're overweight, it is your body and you should do whatever makes you comfortable. I know that many people whish they wouldn't gain weight and I acknowledge that I am lucky with my genes. This post should not come across as bragging about how thin I am. I am also not underweight, just a bit too low for what my body needs to be. 

How can I gain weight in a way that is healthy for my body?

Tl;dr I will have a surgery in a month and need to gain weight. Nothing has worked so far.",28Aug2020,1

655,"Hey guys,

Im a graduate student at electronic and computer engineering,and I despise every second I spend learning for my course. Dont get me wrong,Im actually good at it,although my grades arent the best I still pass my courses without problem and I still adore thinkering with electronics and programming. 

But the problem is,when *I have to* do something like learn a subject to pass or make a project I just cant make myself interested. 

Also I dont care going deep into how thing work,I cant stand abstract thing and theory,my reasoning is if it work it works,dont care how and why.

But learning for my subjecta isnt the only problem. I also cant stay interested in anything for longer than two months. I take up boxing,get bord within three months,take up new programming language and also get bored,go out with friends (who are great,and I find them interesting so they are not the boring ones)and and I zone out quickly,start learning new instrument,boom,now im bored again.

Describing myself I would say im pretty average. I can master EVERYthing quickly but I also dont have any special talents. My attention span is horrible,I need 30min to bring my concentration up,and any minor thing will distract me,my mind just wonders off.

All of this made me wonder is there anything seriously wrong with me,everybody else talks about their hobbies and passions and then there is me that finds everything interesting but cant commit to anything.",28Aug2020,1

657,"My mother and grandmother felt that vomiting was basically like wasting well cooked food that they spent time making. Although my parents abused me in other ways, I don't think this specific thing was intentional. They just taught me to swallow vomit before it came out of my mouth. Sometimes even if it came uncontrollably, they'd stop me midway, make me drink water and swallow the rest. I have been doing that all 27 years of my life. 

Now that I'm an adult, and even now I'm unable to vomit if I feel like it. Unknown to myself, I swallow any vomit that rises up my throat. I realise it only after swallowing. I don't know if this is a psychological thing, or a medical thing, or if it's not even a big deal. I'm ashamed to tell this to anyone, as I might get judged for swallowing vomit. 

Today, I ordered food from outside for dinner. I think some ingredient didn't agree that well with me, and I felt vomit rise up my throat. But before I could realise I had swallowed it and I feel so disgusted with myself. I had to wash down the taste of my own vomit with some water, as I was taught to do. 

For other unrelated mental health issues, I recently started online therapy with a psychologist, can I bring this issue up with them? Will they be able to help me? Or should I go a doctor? I have bad experiences with many doctors here, with always dismissing what I have to say. (example: when I went to a doctor due to excessive period pain, she told me to suck it up because my uterus is announcing that it's ready for a baby. Example 2: I went to a doctor due to fever, and the first question she asked me was why I am fat). I don't feel comfortable going to a doctor unless I'm really sick, and I'm afraid I won't be taken seriously for this issue. 

What can I do?",28Aug2020,1
658,"This will be a big read, please bear with me.

It's really difficult for me to put all this into words, but I'll try my best. I graduated a few years ago with a degree in business management from a state school. I've taken on various jobs since then, mostly in sales and administrative/office management work.  I quit sales because it wasn't a good fit for me. I've taken a liking to admin work because I'm good at it and it pertains to my personality, even though working a 9-5 in general makes me sad. Unfortunately, I was laid-off from my last office management job due to the economic impact of coronavirus. It's been 2 months and unfortunately my unemployment hasn't come through yet.

My family tells me I need to find more sustainable jobs than what I've been doing that are more stable and less likely to lay me off. But the truth of the matter is, I don't want to take on that extra responsibility because work makes me miserable and depressed no matter what. Yet I can't keep relying on my family for financial support whenever something goes wrong. I want more than anything to become a stay-at-home mom but that's a longterm thing. I want to raise children and serve my future husband and have an impact on society that way (even if my sister thinks I'm a loser for wanting this). Every woman i know in high-level positions that leaves her children to daycare, or has to juggle work and childcare, is miserable. I've seen what's happened to these women and I don't want to become that. It's why I used to practice coding and stopped.

In terms of my interests outside of work, I love drawing and writing, but fear turning that into paid work will make me resent it.

What are my options? What can I do? I need to find more ""sustainable"" work, but i don't think *any* job is stable nowadays, except if at an established corporation if that. Massive thanks for any advice you can provide.",28Aug2020,1

She gave him a therapist to help him get over his fear of using the toilet, but it still didn’t work. Now he holds it until he almost pees or does pee himself. He’s very passionate about science and when he gets really into to studying, I don’t think he even realizes he’s squirming around with his hand in his crotch.

HI i am a 19 year old 6'5 M and i've been working out for about 3 years now. Most of my routine was about body recomp as i was about 300 pounds but now i am 200 and i am the fittest i have ever been. When i first started working out i just focused on doing push-ups and nothing else. Those alone really helped me to lose a a lot of fat and put on a little muscle. My diet at that point did not change, i would mainly eat home cooked nutritious food so there's that.

Basically now i eat as clean as possible and can consider my self to be shredded but i would like some advice. I get daily exercise rather it be weights or playing my sport.... but i dont know how i should be eating. I dont usually eat anything fried but if i do go out i do (is that ok?) . I also dont drink my calories, and i do eat a lot of nuts and healtyish carbs for fuel. I know there is no thing as bad or good food but today i ate fired chips which i dont usually do.

I want to move out but I’m trying to stick this out lol and save as much £$ as possible so any ‘just move out’ responses won’t be applied for now :p  I really wanna know exactly why she does this and what would get her to chill



I have various streams of income/am self employed but no “proper job” or  “career” which I think is what she wants. I just tell her I prefer to work from home or I make money online or I sell things, I keep it vague. I’m a pretty private person but when she breaks me and I finally tell her private things or something random about my life or shit I don’t want everyone to know, she tells EVERYONE and makes it a huge deal. I’m very introverted and don’t talk about my life much or post on social media etc. Tbh I don’t trust her atall and i don’t enjoy telling her about my life or my future and things im excited about. I tell people I like but I have no interest in telling her things to make her “proud”



Currently I don’t have a “normal” full-time day job and we are moving house in 2/3 weeks so im waiting to get another job there for extra income. I’m really not fussy what job I get, a barista/waitress or warehouse gig will do. My mum stopped asking annoying Q’s and being rude to me about 2 yrs ago [I think she had depression or menopause and would have severe mood swings - calling me nasty, selfish, lazy, miserable, tramp
etc. none of which are true] and I thought she had finally decided to leave me alone but the questions have started again - she just got a job as a teaching assistant at my old college she used to work at and, as she has told me before, I suspect she’s “embarrassed” that she “doesn’t know what to tell people” when they ask what her daughter is doing [work wise ig?]


She’s a very insecure and sensitive person she worries a lot what others think, I just find that pathetic and not my problem atall, I would never think or say that about her , it’s no one else’s business (including mine) what my family is doing - or their relationships or living situation etc etc. - unless they’re bringing something to the table. Half the time idk what my mum is doing either so I just say I’m not sure. she’s always telling me to have a “plan” when she doesn’t have one herself and work makes her miserable and she comes in moody af lol why would I wanna do that



She is always asking me “what do you want to do?” “what’s your plan” “why don’t you talk to me?” “are you secretly rich?” “are you a secret millionaire haha?” “why don’t you be an engineer?” “why don’t you do a painting and decorating course?” “you should do nursing” “why don’t you go and work with the penguins abroad” — The answer is always .... Because I don’t want to? I can almost feel my energy draining from my body when she asks me a question haha and I’m exhausted


I’ve told her an hinted to her dozens and dozens of times to stop asking and leave me alone, but she never does . or she just calls me defensive and starts arguing. Obviously because I have to live with her and always listen to her complain and never be satisfied with me being myself and being happy.

Basically my boyfriend and I have been dating for about a half. Our one year anniversary was one week after we were forced to come home from uni because of lockdown. I had made him a present - it was a stack on big cards (because we love card games and games in general) with 52 reasons why I love him written on it. Ik it sounds cringey or whatever but my bf and I can be a bit soppy at times and I thought it was going to be a good idea. For the record - we aren't soppy in public I don't tend to show emotions to people unless I'm drunk lmao. We reserve our soppiness for when we're alone.

Anyway, I had made it but brought it home with me because I wanted to give it to him as soon as it was safe to see him. However his gift STILL hasn't arrived because he ordered whatever it is from a small company and they have been closed because of ya boi corona and he can't cancel the gift because it's been over 3 months since he ordered it. Because of this, we're sorted of just agreed to give each other the gifts when his one arrives because I didn't wanna make him feel bad for not having a gift. 

So I hid the gift in my bag because I didn't want my mum or brother seeing it. However one day I find my bag to be empty and I start stressing and see that my gift has been put on my desk in plain sight. My brother was in Nottingham at the time so I know it wasn't him so it had to have been my mum but she hasn't mentioned it at all. I have no idea whether she read it or not and it freaks me out!!! She snoops in my room a lot because she likes everything to be clean and apparently I'm horrendously untidy and has found countless secret diaries when I was younger so it was a bit silly to just leave it out.

But there were private things in the gift ya know. Things she doesn't ever need to know and it pisses me off that she must have read it knowing her. But she hasn't mentioned it so I don't really wanna ask her about it but I also want to have a go at her for looking through my stuff.

My BIL found old phones with old text messages that confirmed his suspicions.  My sister worked with this man she was cheating with for 8 years. Went to company parties together, same work social circles. My sister and her husband even met up socially with her cheating partner and his wife.  All the times she was working late, working on Sunday’s and asking me, my other siblings and my parents to watch the kids were not to help her with her job, but to help her cheat. Her youngest was born during the affair. Even had my other sister take a picture of her in the NICU with the baby which we found out was to send to her boyfriend.  DNA test confirmed it’s my BIL) baby.

Looking back, everything we thought was true all these years wasn’t. It’s heartbreaking. They destroyed not only their own families, but broke the hearts of my parents and her in laws. My parents were devastated to learn their daughter was capable of this. They were depressed and still are to a degree this day. My father will never be the same. He says he will go to his grave with a broken heart for her part in this. He can’t believe his own daughter would do this.

Anyway, two years later still dealing with this shitshow. Nasty divorce, custody issues, financial issues (lots of money involved). She is now living with him and getting married next month. Asked my parents for their blessing lol. My father said “you did what you wanted all these years without my blessing, now you want it? You’re not getting anything” I want nothing to do with this wedding, but I feel bad for her children. I also have two daughters who do know what happened (15 and 13). Feel like I am setting a bad example to go celebrate this with them. Her kids have not put the pieces together and don’t realize what really went down. I don’t acknowledge him or their relationship.

She thinks this man walks on water and wants us to accept him. I can’t. We love our brother in law and still keep in contact with him, which angers her. Am I the asshole for refusing to go to my sisters wedding?

I am currently working as a full-time teacher and applied to do my masters; the plan was to initially quit by September following a one month notice period since the program begins in October. Due to the lovely Miss Corona, the university has offered a virtual alternative, where I can attend my classes virtually, I thought it was a win-win, that way I can keep my job, save a little bit more until I leave in December ... Also that way I wouldn't be putting the burden on my students if I will have to leave. The real problem is, I haven't told my job that I will be leaving and I am low-key terrified because the school also has a penalty of paying two months worth of salary if I decide to leave in the middle of the year, the school is already facing a deficiency, my students are going to suffer because of my decision. When would be an appropriate time to tell the admin I am leaving with the least possible impact? How do I tell them I will be leaving, again with the least possible negative impact?

In 2017, I landed a good job (govt job, which means that now I have a safety net for life). However, the post is clerical. Earlier when I joined, I had ambitions to get a better position and move out from this city. 

However, as time passed, I realized that I was content. I earn sufficient money to cover all the necessities and fun (for a single person). 

Taking a better position would mean leaving this city. Prior to this job, I had been moving to different cities every 3-4 years. Now I don't want to know. This city feels like home and I want to put down my roots here. 

The trouble is that I fell in love with a guy who is not right for me. From the beginning, we were not compatible even a little bit. But I decided to forego the compatibility in favour of love I was getting. I was his first girlfriend and he treated me so good (just like I dreamt about). 

However, one day, he got a misconception that I was cheating on him. This was six months into the relationship. Ever since that day, he has treated me horribly. All the textbook signs of abuse. Plus he became an alcoholic. 

But I stayed because I thought that once this misconception is cleared from his mind, we will be back to how the relationship was in the beginning. That never happened. 

Then I made the worst mistake of my life so far. I married him. It was a typical North Indian wedding with much fanfare (meaning my dad spent tons of money). 

Here in our country, it is assumed that once a guy gets married, he becomes more responsible person. However in my case, that didn't happen. In fact, the abuse became more severe. 

After some incidents, everything was uncovered and both of our families got involved. His family blames me for everything. My dad thinks that he lacks maturity and is an arrogant piece of shit. 

Now here comes my dilemma. My dad insists that whether my marriage survives or not, I should get a promotion and get out of this city. He has 2 reasons. 

First, if I end up divorced, I would have better chances of second marriage in a bigger city and bigger position. 

Second, if I don't end up divorced, being in another city will give me space from in-laws and earning more money would mean that I would have a more secure future. 

I on the other hand, secretly want to get a divorce and live right here in this city. I want to get a dog, grow a garden in my balcony, study to become a psychologist and volunteer with NGOs. 

But I am terrified. Of being wrong. It is easy to be optimistic when we are young. But what happens when I get older? 

Chances of me getting married again are very slim if I stay here (I don't want to + small town mentality). There is no such thing as dating here. No dates, no casual hook-ups. Maybe as I grow old, I will find the money to be insufficient. Maybe one day I would no longer be able to tolerate the mocking of this small city society. 

Today I am young, so I have the courage to face everything - the loneliness, the mocking society, the limited money. 

But what if I don't have the same courage as I grow old? 

Getting a promotion and moving sounds the safer option, but everytime I think about it, I get teary eyed. My heart is not in it. I want to nest now. I am tired of making temporary friends, tired of never getting attached to places or people, tired of not being a regular at cafes. 

I am so lost. I don't know what to do. 

If you have read this far, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for taking time out for a random stranger on internet. 

I would appreciate any and all advice.",28Aug2020,1
678,"I'm a junior in highschool and I'm in the IB program. I also play varsity football. I used to love playing football, but a lot has happened recently and I feel cheated by the coaches. 
Instead of telling me straight up that they want me to move to O-line (I used to be on D-line), they lied and promised that I would be playing both O and D-line. They also changed my jersey number without telling me, I had to find that out on my own. That might not sound that bad, but I have major anxiety and depression and I feel like the coaches took my identity from me (new position, new number, etc.) 

On top of not trusting most of my coaches, I am in IB and have A LOT of homework. I am always under pressure to be great in football and get good grades in one of the toughest highschool curriculums in the world. IB will better prepare me for college and is more likely to get scholarships than football. While I don't want to close the door on football (If I quit now, I'll never be able to play again), I no longer love playing the sport. I hate going to practice and my anxiety goes through the roof on game days. I just need a break. My mental health is shit and I can't see myself balancing football and IB anymore.

679,"Growing up I've been very shy and quiet. I remember I was so talkative when I was a child until age 5. At that point, I was more reserved and I was too uninterested to communicate with people. I also never really had anything to say. I've only had one best friend throughout my whole life since Kindergarten who I remember connecting with very well and we have been friends for 16 years. 

I remember many teachers thinking that there was something wrong with me, and even wondered if I spoke a different language because I never really talked. I was just always more of a listener and observer. My parents are also the same way, and don't have any friends. We don't really have fun conversations together, and they were never affecrionate towards me (saying I love you or giving me hugs everyday). However, for me it takes forever to open up to people and be myself. I kind of blame my mom because she was too overprotective (and still kinda is), and never let me go out to meetp new people outside of school.

As I grew older, I feel like I lost passion for everything and even now in college. I don't even know what I want to do in my life. 

The only thing that keeps me going is my boyfriend (who is very extroverted, a people person, and confident). I'm still not sure why he is with me because I'm so boring and I have no passions. He got me into lifting weights at the gym, so at least I only have one thing going for me that I'm interested in. 

But still I feel hopeless and sad that I'll be this way forever. Help.",28Aug2020,1
680,"My BF (M20) and his mom (F48) appear to have been pretty close until a year or 2 ago. His mom has  always been super welcoming of me. She makes these amazing meals whenever I come up, buys the wine I like, puts in a huge effort and buys me lots of stuff for Christmas and my birthdays. However, she keeps making passive remarks when I'm not there about how my BF prioritises me so much and that he doesn't care about her/the family anymore. When I'm staying over (I stay over every 2 weeks because we live an hour away), she will say passive things like ""it's great the way Amy calls/texts  her mom when she isn't home"" or ""it's great the way Amy goes hiking/swimming with her family"". It makes me feel so awkward. She *tests* my BF by not texting or calling when he stays at my house. If he texts first she'll reply, but if he doesn't text she won't at all and won't talk to him when he gets home? He hates being tested. She works 9am-5pm and he works 3pm-10pm and is often in bed by the time he gets home and it makes her mad he doesn't hang out with her. Any day he is off work, he hangs out with me.

His younger brother Alan (M17) is autistic and horrible. They treat him like an angel despite hime never leaving his room and being hostile 95% of the time. Alan yells ""fuck off get out of my room!!"" if my BF so much as offers to make him food or will play his video games at full volume at 12/1 am while I'm there. He runs after my BF with a knife/hammer every so often for the last 8 years and spits on him if he ever argues back. He will steal my BF's stuff just to annoy him and does things like tell the family what sex toy my BF uses on me/condoms (he looks through his stuff). The irony is that he seems like a nice guy and has friends and his teachers like him, he is just a dick at home. Dude has nearly 100k subscribers on YouTube, makes no sense.

His mom won't talk to him *at all* for the last 3 days cos he called Alan ""piggy"" for stealing sweets I got him. I feel really awkward cos MY mom booked a meal for both our families halfway between both our hometowns yesterday. His mom texted my mom thanks and she'll ask her husband about it first.

691,"Short backstory: Ever since 8th grade, I’ve been addicted to hentai more than anything. Spending hours on end searching for drawings I liked and saving it into a 3 gb folder full of pictures (no vids or gifs). At the start of 9th grade, I started spending even more times scowering the internet for nudes and amassed another 2gb folder (with vids) and started even download several Eroges which takes hours to finish (Eroge = hentai game but with stories). I’ve calmed down ever since getting a great gf at the start of 11th grade. 

Actual issue: The pandemic lessened my general physical contact with her so I regressed into my old porn habits and now with the added routine of going on unmod omegle video to find other girls to watch me jack off. I spend hours on that, as well. I feel like utter shit for doing such things especially since my gf also goes on omegle but just for makig friends. I’m basically cheating on her with several strangers on the internet. I hate mysef for giving in to it. On top of everything, it’s affecting my school life since online classes for college started but I spend a large amount of time on porn even if I should be doing homeworks or writing notes. I oversleep as well due to the fact that was a jacking it thte night before.

I hate it. I hate everything about it. I hate myself for giving into it.

I’ve tried cutting these things off from my life. I deleted my previously mentioned nudes folder and basically locked my hentai folder away and began to distance myself from websites (especially newgrounds). My libido calmed down to the point that even my gf is kinda sad about it. The lack of physical contact with my gf and in general seems like an excuse but I just tell that to myself because I’m afraid of the actual implications of my actions.

For those who used to be porn addicts, how did you manage to get out of the funk?

For those tech people, is there a way where I can basically block myself from accessing a website?

And to everyone, I’m sorry for my actions and I’ll make sure this time, I’ll get rid of it.

Please anything type of help is appreciated.",28Aug2020,1

694,"Hello. Before anyone feels out and shits on me for what I’m about to say, please understand this is an actual cry for help. Do not mistake anything I say as an excuse for my own ill mentality. I see myself slipping into a dark misogyny. It starts when I was young and only my dad was around to be a caretaker for me and my mother subjected me to every one of her abusive boyfriends. I’ve been thrown down stairs. I’ve been punched in the mouth. Been whipped until my ass has started bleeding and locked away from the outside world by their hands. This happened until I was 18 when I moved out. At that point I’d been in a few decent relationships but seen my share of betrayal at the hands of the women I dated. I was in rough shape at that point. I joined the navy and was able to free myself of much of my misogynistic thoughts. But I got married to someone, and it didn’t go well. She cheated on me with 3 different guys because I was not participating in a kink she never told me she had and because I was working two jobs that left me with 5-7 hours of free time. It left an awful taste in my mouth. We finally separated on my 21st birthday. I severely burned myself with a heated fork because I didn’t know what else to do beside that to keep my urge to off myself at bay. That night was the closest I’d ever been. Ever since that time, I have had incredible issues fighting off the misogynistic hate that continually shows itself to me.  I understand that the mistake of one women is not the mistake of all women, but it ridiculously hard for me to erase the thoughts from my head. I’ve heard that people like me will never change and I just don’t want to accept that as reality. I’ve tried so much therapy. It doesn’t seem to go far. I’m at a loss and I’m losing sight of reality. I want to be normal again.",28Aug2020,1
695," My best friend and my girlfriend are both Indian women who speak Hindi. I'm white and don't speak a word of it. When they first met, they really liked each other right away. They text each other in Hindi as well. That's fine. What annoys me is when they sometimes speak it in front of me, especially when they seem to be making sexual jokes.

The other day I was with the two of them when we started talking about certain movie stars and my friend gyrated her hips and said something in Hindi and they both laughed hysterically. When I asked what it meant, she said ""Nothing.""

Another time, my friend said something about us having been friends since high school, and my girlfriend said ""Why just friends?"" My friend said something in Hindi and they both were rolling on the floor laughing.

There have been a few incidents like this and I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to sound insecure that they might be saying something bad about me but it's really annoying. I asked both of them separately why they speak Hindi in front of me, and they both told me some things are just easier to say in Hindi.

Background- I just found out that I am getting paid the base for my position at my employer. I was hired a year ago. I did not have direct experience with the position but I had 10 years of experience in the industry and had a degree higher than what was required.

Since then, HR has approved a new job description and new pay grade. I'm not doing different work now, my job description just better reflects the work that my team does. 

We recently had someone leave and have an opening, so the position was posted internally. With all internal postings you can see the base pay for the job. A couple days before this position was posted, I was informed that my position was regraded and I would be receive higher compensation. I was ecstatic about this. That is until I saw that my new pay now matches the new base. 

I found out from a coworker that he is also making the base despite having even more experience than me. I'm now assuming that HR just adjusted everyone to be the new base regardless of other factors. I'm hoping I'm wrong though. I know my worth and it's at least more than the minimum.

Any suggestions on how to tackle this? I figure I can go to HR to see if they will explain how they came up with my pay, or even go to my manager. I've just never been in a position like this before and don't know what is appropriate to do or even what might be successful.

I think the best thing a victim of bullying can do is to never give their harassers what they want. Don’t give them any form of reaction. Not sadness, fear or aggression. This is very hard to do, but I think it has a tremendous payoff. 

There is no point in going fishing if the fish can see through the trap and know not to bite. I think this same logic applies to bullying. When they start giving you a tough time, you give them the blankest stare possible and walk the other way. They’ll shout horrible things to try and get your attention, but don’t ever give it to them. 

I believe that physical force and involving a teacher should only be used if you believe that the bullying in question is posing a true threat to your physical or mental wellbeing.",28Aug2020,1

711," I’m posting this at the risk of sounding either entirely creepy or perhaps reasonably concerned. 

Early last month in July, my husband and I started talking to a couple who were local to us off of a platonic friend making app. We all got to know each other over the course of two months and eventually decided to meet up to go to the beach.

Everything was fine when we went to the beach, just the normal awkwardness. After that day, we continued talking normally in our group chat until I made a comment with a jokingly sexual undertone towards the girl about her body. They were silent for hours until they came back with the paranoid assumption that my husband was either influencing me to send that message or sent it through my app himself. This was the first time that something like this happened.

After apologizing for any discomfort caused and attempting to explain that their assumption was misguided, they remained silent thereafter. We had all talked about our lifestyles and preferences early on, and this comment shouldn’t have seemed off-character for my nature, but it is understandable that it could have been taken the wrong way. The assumption part of who actually said it was the big issue. Since we were patient and gave them time to respond yet they continued to ignore us, we decided to just disband the group and move on. 

Of course, even when people move on from our lives, we still think about them from time to time. This just being recent as well, I was still wondering what really went wrong and why they went with the paranoid assumption after apologies were extended and the situation explained. It seemed like something more was wrong with the situation, and there were hints prior to her fiance being a bit controlling and domineering.  

Well, today, I read a headline that a small plane crashed near our area. This is the exact type of plane and exact location where the guy was doing his weekly training flights that he had been talking to us about. Since we are not in contact with them anymore, I have no idea if it was he who was involved in this accident or not. I don’t feel like it’s my place to contact them again and see if everything’s okay. The news hasn’t yet released any identifying information on the bodies found. It is doubtful that his fiance would’ve been on the flight because he would have to have been with an instructor, and the small plane only fits 2. 

If it ends up that they identify the crash victims as one of the people we were talking to, would it be appropriate to reach out and try to offer support and comfort? Or better to leave it be? 

I’ve never done a post like this, so I’ll be prepared for judgment. Thanks in advance for any advice, though.",28Aug2020,1

714,"For the second time in a row, my shift partner has called in an hour before we start.

I started a new job a few months ago and a month after that, another girl started . To say the least, we don’t really mesh well together for various reasons, but i’ll skip over those for times sake . She and i work together two times a week in the afternoon 

Last thursday she called in “sick” an hour and a bit before her shift started. The morning staff had to find a casual to come in last minute. yesterday, i arrived to work and was told she called in 40 minutes before and wouldn’t be coming in and i would have to work alone. one of the AM staff ended up staying a few hours OT so it was only for 3 hours and i felt comfortable.

That being said, i did have more to do that normal in those last few hours . I work in a mental health facility and no one got escalated last night, but it could have happened.

The first time she called in sick at the last minute i gave her the benefit of the doubt but since it’s happened again exactly a week later, it’s hard to buy. We start work at 3:00 pm, so there was plenty of time to call in earlier unless  she wakes up in the afternoon. Her weekends are on tuesday and wednesday so it’s also not like she needed a day of rest in between her week.

It’s flustering to have an unreliable shift partner and go into work wondering if i will have to work alone or with a random person. I am wondering if i should speak with her and tell her this or just let management deal with it. Maybe she doesn’t like the job, maybe she has other stuff going on. I want to give her the benefit of the doubt but she should also know how much it affects everyone when she calls in 1 hour before shift",28Aug2020,1

717,"So...sorry I lied a bit but he’s not officially my fiancé yet.  But I’ve picked the ring, we’ve had the talks about marriage and having kids and what not, but the talks recently have taken a concerning turn.  We are kind of a hippie dip pie couple, so we had always talked about our wedding being a bit different, definitely smaller and more simple than a big white wedding.  But I wasn’t super aware of how fixed he would be on having a “goth” style wedding.  For all intensive purposes...I am not goth.  Never was goth.  I’m pretty I’m as far away from goth you could get.  And he really isn’t either.

The first weird thing was when we first talked about engagement rings.  He showed me a few he picked out...all of them were black metal with black or red stones.  I told him that wasn’t really my style and though I didn’t want the typical solitaire, what I did want was still more classical engagement ring if you will.  I asked if we could work with a custom designer and because I shot his idea of the black and red ring down he basically was like ok, you decide with the designer what you want then just send me the info.

Now as we have started talking about the wedding and looking at pictures on Pinterest and what not, he always picks out the very gothic styled pictures.  I told him I don’t mind getting married with a dark color scheme and maybe do a masquerade type theme, but he is picking stuff out that is like, really hit you over the head gothic.  For example, he liked the invitations that had skull hands on it, he liked the coffin ring box and his favorite cake was a day of the dead themed cake with a skull head topper.  I told him when things are that blatantly “gothic” it starts to look like a halloween or kids party, not a wedding.

He is also pushing very hard for a black wedding dress.  I may do some color in my dress, I may end up with a light pink dress, but I’m not getting married in a black dress with a black veil.  I told him I could see changing into a black dress later in the night but certainly not for the ceremony.  But if I got chose a black dress I would be putting on a costume to please him and not because that’s what I really want to married in.

I’m going to be honest...I don’t really get where this is coming from.  He’s not a “goth” either.  He is into the techno scene but we’re both big hippies so to have this whole dark “till death do us part” dramatically themed wedding just doesn’t suit us as a couple.  It feels like he’s creating a wedding for some other bride or something.  He is also really into nightmare before Xmas stuff and he always pulls out anything that references the movie (like a NBXmas cake with jack and sally on top) and we’ve never even watched the movie together.  I would sit and watch it with him if he wanted to, but I’m not planning our wedding around it.

It’s really weird and I know we need to compromise but he gets totally butt hurt if I say I’m not a fan of his ideas.  I don’t think this bodes well for the future.",28Aug2020,1
718,"Just in case i get put under a radar, i want to preface this by sharing that this account is newly created as a throwaway of sorts because some of my friends and possibly even one family member who is close to my parents know of my primary account. 

I also sincerely hope that i can get some serious advice / replies on how to proceed forward with this plan without constantly having to contend with my parents - also mostly because i will need to make proper arrangements in advance before the next year, so it is quite urgent. Thank you so much in advance for your patience and help! 


A little bit of background info for clarity :

- i'm 18F, and i live in one of the southeast asian countries. I have been for two years now, studying for my A level examinations and will be taking the papers in about 2 months' time. The examinations will officially end in late November this year, and the educational path that lies ahead is entering university (only starts in late september next year). 

- My grandma in question lives alone, is in her late seventies but still very, very much healthy, alert and independent (she's even continued to work out of contentment, till quite recently since she's finally decided to retire).


Now for what's happening (thank you, sincerely, if you're still reading and for your patience, im going to try to keep this as concise as possible) :

Over the past 2 years, my kinships with both my parents have very unfortunately deteriorated to the point where i no longer have any ounce of desire within me to engage in any conversation beyond the important &amp; mandatory with them. Though they've never been physically abusive etc, I've increasingly felt and still do feel that they constantly discount and degrade my emotions and input, to be frank I've even started to question whether or not they are perhaps even emotionally abusive to a certain extent. I've tried countless times to talk through all these unresolved tensions and outbursts with them but my efforts have 90% of the time, ended in no fruition - they just relentlessly find reasons to guilt trip and blame me without attempting to acknowledge their own flaws, and even using the guise of 'care and concern' to know certain information of my ongoing life i have no desire to share with them. I've been deeply hurt by them, by their words, and on their side they've made it blatantly known to me that they feel the same way even though they haven't made further efforts to reconcile, as i've endeavoured to, until the past 2 months (i haven't verbally conversed with them since)

It is having to wrestle with so much of these aggravated arguments and passive aggressive outbursts within the four walls that least to say i feel so insidiously stiffled in; the home, for me, has become devoid of the attachment and fondness i once felt towards and is now only a place for my material well being and shelter - and to cut it short, after much deliberation, i've decided to make plans to live with my grandmother in her apartment, once next year begins. 

To make clear, the other major reason why i'm especially looking forward to living with my grandmother is because we share a very close knitted kinship, and i've made the conscious effort to stay with and spend time with her every year during the school holidays (for 5 years now) because the moments spent with her are very precious to me - as with time as an entity, since she is also growing older. 

My grandmother lives a few apartments right below my aunt's (her daughter) My aunt is a lovely, earnest person and is married (so yes my uncle lives there too), and they have a young toddler who's 3 this year. I am especially close to / share a very close relationship with my 3 year old cousin, and have promised him that i'll get to spend more time bonding with him after i finally complete my A levels this year. This is something he's (and i, too) been very much looking forward to for some time now. Staying with my grandma will mean that i can more conveniently get to see and spend time with him, since he lives just above my grandma's.

For these three reasons and a few minute ones that i wont be sharing here to avoid unnecessary details, i want to stay with my grandma for the rest of next year, until university commences in late september 2021. 

So my aunt, who bought the apartment for my grandmother (she could be, has been renting out one of the 2 rooms to a tenant for awhile now). Just for the sake of some clarity, my aunt is pretty well-to-do financially, and could very much afford not to have a tenant stay in one of the 2 rooms in my grandma's apartment, which was the case until this year. The room was rented out this year because my grandma didn't want the house to be / feel too empty while she was out working, so my aunt was alright renting the room out to a tenant. However, from what my grandma has told me, the tenant isn't staying indefinitely. This also isnt the first and only tenant since most of them who've stayed have only done so for a few months on end - so there definitely have been short periods where there were no tenants staying.

This was honestly not a problem that i thought i would face, until i very briefly brought it up to my parents a few months back (regarding my plans to stay with my grandma next year) and they blew up calling me ignorant and inconsiderate for not thinking about the fact that if i were to live with my grandma, the room (currently rented to the tenant) would be taken up by me which will mean that my aunt will not be able to collect the monthly rent, since my plans are to stay for months on end. They related to me how ""bad, embarrassed"" they would feel if i were to go because they know my aunt will definitely welcome me to stay with my grandma as i have for the past few years, albeit only weeks at a time during my school holidays (short term), and that she would certainly refuse my parents paying any of that rent to her in place of the tenant since i would be staying in that room. I partially understand their point of view, and i sincerely have never and dont in any way intend to mean that i am entitled to move into that room without ""paying"", just because my aunt is financially well to do - which is why i dont quite know how to continue. 

My grandmother has, and always has welcomed me to stay with her at anytime, so she's not part of the reason i'm posting this to ask for some advice. 

I shared that even though i am quite certain my aunt would be alright with it, I have yet to at length talk to or ask my aunt about this, because i havent quite gotten the chance to just yet. I'm certainly planning to soon, since i feel it is only sincere and right to go ask my aunt directly since she is the person who bought the apartment for my grandma. 

However i am just at a loss of what to do if my parents still ultimately disallow me from staying at my grandma's - even if my aunt allows me to.

Any advice on how i should progress with this plan would be truly, truly appreciated - this is something that has been on my mind for awhile now, because i havr made up my heart, and am determined to stay elsewhere from my family's house once i am finally done and dusted with my current and final tertiary education. I want to finally be able to live my day to day truly at peace, away from constantly having to contend with my parents.

Thank you, if you've read up till the very end, i truly appreciate it and wishing you a good day ahead, wherever you are :)

TLDR : planning to live with my grandma next year firstly due to the stiffling r/ship w my parents, the suffocating atmosphere within the house and secondly because i want to spend more precious time with my grandma, (whom i share a very close relationship with) since i'll have lots of free time next year - but the apartment my grandma is staying in is bought by my aunt, her daughter, who's financially well to do - one of the two rooms is sporadically rented to tenants on a short term basis, and because money isnt at all tight my aunt never thought of renting it out till this year upon my grandma's request. Issue lies with my parents who feel bad that my aunt wont be collecting rent if i stay in that room, in my grandma's apartment. At a loss of what to do because even if my aunt is completely alright with it, my parents might continue to disallow me from moving in w/ my grandma.",28Aug2020,1
719,"This is gonna be a long one but I really need some advice. My best friend has been in a really bad state as of late and I'm not sure how to handle it at this point. We both were brought up in different ways, with me always having a strong support system and her coming from an emotionally abusive household. We met each other 6 years ago and her mental health and emotional stability has been declining steadily since then. She has always been and still is a kind and sweet person, but she has continuously involved herself with people that do not have her best interest at heart. She was in a very abusive relationship in the past which has left her with some deep trauma. She is promiscuous, which I don't have a problem with on its own. She's an adult and she can be with anyone she wants. However, each of these relationships or flings never end well and she is left upset by the end but will let these people back in to her life rather easily (bad friends included). She is very forgiving. She goes out drinking and partying a lot which she has admitted to me is a problem.

Recently, on one of her nights out during quarantine she was sexually assaulted by an acquaintance. Her mother and father declined to come to our state to support her and the police have not even talked to the other party. This coupled with her financial situation has been extremely difficult for her to cope with. I had to clean her room out in her apartment because she wouldn't get out of bed. Right after this she started booty-call type relationship with another guy.  Which I expressed concerns about, given what had just happened. I brought up the emotional rollercoaster she goes through with each of these not serious relationships and how I think she should be alone for a while. But it seems like she physically cannot not hook up with someone after a certain period of time. She doesn't have insurance to pay for a therapist and had been trying before COVID. 

Flash forward to her birthday, I bake her a cake, get her some gifts, and we go to a dinner with just the  two of us. I ask her what she wants to happen this year in her life and she gets upset saying she doesn't want to talk about it. But then proceeds to go into detail. We get into the relationship conversation again and I bring up that I wish she would make a plan for the future that involves a stronger support system. She says that she is happy in herself and the relationships she cultivates and I didn't argue with her because I didn't wanna ruin the night. It went along smoothly after that and we had a goodnight overall, but I wake up to a text from her the next morning stating that what I said at dinner last night upset her and insinuate that I wanted her to settle for someone that doesn't improve her as a person or sync with her life. She said that she didn't feel that she had to change at all because she likes herself. In no way did I think that what I said would come off that way.

She wants to have a long conversation about this with me and I'm worried that she is trying to create drama to push me away. I have always tried to support her and comfort her, but this feels like a real slap in the face because I am trying to be a good friend and am going to tell her the truth. 

I don't want to lose our friendship but I feel like if I'm honest with her then she will cut me off and say that I'm just being super judgemental of her. How should I handle this?",28Aug2020,1

722,"My mom was a hairdresser at one point, she cut people’s hair to support herself and my older half sister when she was only 18 (she was a teen mom.) Her career didn’t last long though. A “Karen” once walked in her store and as she was cutting her hair the lady flipped out saying how disgusting my mom was and how she couldn’t and shouldn’t cut hair. Ever since that day she only gives hair cuts to people who ask for it and only people she knows, and she has never been confident with herself. 

I needed a haircut, my hair has been growing out since June and it had gotten to a point where it was becoming hard to keep up with, so I asked my mom, and she agreed. She was nervous about cutting men’s hair, it wasn’t her specialty, but she still did it anyway. I asked for it to be really short on the back and sides and keep it long at top, and I wanted it to still look messy and fluffy

The result was everything was even, short, and straight down, and as she showed me the final result I broke. I struggle with confidence and seeing myself without the vision I wanted made me feel so much emotion at once, and I couldn’t handle it. I had a panic attack and ran to my room as fast as I could crying, screaming, and hyperventilating (a panic attack.)

723,"I'm the 3rd in a family of 4. I have a very stable family, with successful (mum is a doctor, dad an engineer) and attentive parents. I was considered a pretty ""gifted"" kid, did great in high school, etc.  
The catch ? My two older sisters were VERY gifted as well, and now are good at their jobs and very responsible. My brother is also doing pretty good in school and has great social skills.   

My 26F went to the top engineering school on France and got a MS in financial maths in ICL and now makes serious bank at her finance job in London. 
My other 29F sister also got a masters degree in finance to a top college and also makes €€ working in Luxemburg. She owns her own flat and is so good at her job, she's already been promoted twice in fice year.

My brother is also following the same path : he is in a prep college to get into a grande ecole (it means a top finance school in france), already has his driver's license {the minimum age to get it in France is 18}, lives in his own flat alone for his studies, also makes money from renting it during the holidays (last month he made like 800€ = 950€, he used it to buy the latest iPhone. I had to save for 8 months to buy myself a guitar that is worth 40% less).  

And what about me ? I wanted to get into med school but I failed the exam, instead I'm in pharmacy school which is waaaaay less revered, I make less money than my brother as I make barely over min. wage working in retail pharmacy (my brother has earned twice as much as me these last two months lol), I can't drive at all (failed the exam, never took it again), still live at my parents who actually monitor me more than my brother - like I can't just say ""I'm staying overnight at a friend's"" if its not planned in advance.  
I constantly lie to get some ""freedom"" but it backfires since my parents don't trust me, I don't have a lot of friends (one real friend), I'm clinically depressed (getting better but I'm really ashamed of it) and I feel really fucking stupid, like I have no practical skills and I think and speak like a teenager.  

_Example : my brother and my parents will have a conversation about bank related things, his flat and how he rents it, his driving, and I'm just there. I try to talk about what I saw at work bit it's not interesting enough to form a conversation._   
My sisters and my brother don't even know what year I'm in. I've caught my father lying by omission when some people ask if I'm in med school. The same people expect me to be out of my parents' house now and are surprised when I tell them that it's my brother who is.

729,"This is my first post as a member on reddit, I apologize in advance if I am not properly adhering to specific etiquette. I am stuck in purgatory, a quagmire of choices and the drastically different life outcomes that come along with any of these given pathways. Im a 25 year old male, graduated community college and then a bachelors with honors in a major I created and termed Technology, Entrepreneurship, and the Global Food Landscape. My plan was to add value to society by way of invention in order to help evolve the food industry.

I worked corporately a year after graduation for Kraft-Heinz company as a salesman with a $200 million territory in Illinois. I did well but lacked enthusiasm for any element of that position, whatsoever. Before graduation, I had developed a niche, in-home personal training service in an affluent area. The service, which I still operate as the owner/operator, nets around $30-40,000 a year and only commands 12-15 hours a week. I also cook and deliver health orianted meals to some of the households. I had been training clients since 19 years old but was pushed to go to school and ended up enjoying learning and such to the point that i fulfilled the prerequisites to become an occupational therapist ( since it seemed related to my prior work as a trainer and potentially provided a sense of entrepreneurial possibility all while hosting a level of altruism).

Corona hit and I was accepted into a decent program but grew disenchanted with waiting an additional year as I was missing one, off, prerequisite. I rescinded the contract. The clients I train are internationally recognized businessmen, lawyers, judges, and doctors. They have told me not to enter law because pathways to partnership are hard to come by and the work is often times dull. I went into a law class (invited) and had a great time but grew weary as I knew a riff existed between law school and practicing law, most likely not similar. On the other hand, I know I am well built for business, yet, I would like to ascertain a goal or a path and have at it, this is where I'm plagued with ambiguity. In the meantime, my physician-client helped me apply to a premed program and I got in (Northwestern). Should I enter medicine ?

It would take me a year from now to finish the MCAT and apply, I would start in the fall at 27 years old. I have no specific yearning for an early family or anything like that. My biggest dilemma is sacrificing the time and money to become successful in that capacity relative to doing the same as an entrepreneur, what I have been my entire life, in varying capacities. I have decent savings, no debt, and I am also a licensed realtor. A better way to express this question : I do enjoy altruistic work and helping others, whether its through business, law, or medicine. I don't want to be micromanaged in a corporate setting, it would be ideal for me to open my own practice or business in any set discipline. Money is important to me ( first generation, single mother and younger sister to help support).

If you were 25, had $100,000 and no debt and possibly knew wealthy people that would invest in you or could leverage a decent SBA loan, what would you do ?

730,"I’m really ashamed and embarrassed because what we were doing was weird, so I don’t want to talk to anyone about it. Basically he was fucking my thighs, like i was on my side and he was behind me. I asked him to stop because I heard people approaching the car and he didn’t. It only went on for a minute or so but I was panicked and confused. I was scared they’d see me, and I was confused because I didn’t understand why he didn’t stop. I didn’t think he’d ever be that way to me. He’s so sweet and loving and gentle. A week later (today) I asked him why he didn’t stop and he said “I didn’t want to” but recognized it was wrong and apologized to me. I don’t know how to feel about it.

731,"So I have this really good friend, we’ll call him Jordan. 

Jordan and I used to text everyday during quarantine. And admittedly, there was a period where I had a small crush. Though it didn’t last very long, because we were better as friends imo. 

Us texting basically every day helped me a lot with quarantine. And he’s one of the funniest, coolest, people I know. 

He’s actually the reason I got Reddit. We got Reddit together 

But one day he decided to take a break from social media. He was off for a month, which is fine, he should focus on his mental health. But his imessages were still open and he said I can text him through there

Slowly, we started to drift. The guy I used to text everyday, became someone I went weeks without texting. I didn’t really iMessage him a lot. And now I regret it.

I tried texting him more again. But it was kinda awkward. And I just kinda let things go with the flow and/or our conversations are short. He doesn’t text me much anymore, which is 100% his choice. I’m not offended or clingy about it. 

But I kinda miss how our friendship used to be.

732,"My brother and I are looking for an apartment and I want to get a husky/malamute mix in the near future. Huskies are on the most aggressive list at #10 and malamutes at around #15 and a lot of places don't accept more aggressive dogs (though they stop after the first 10) I was wondering if I would just have to get a different breed or if there was some way around it. I've looked into registering it as an emotional support animal but I would be getting the puppy while I lived there so there would be some obvious problems with that. I've also read that if it's the landlord's choice rather than a ln insurance policy for them, that I could discuss it with them and have them meet the dog, but again it would be a puppy and mostly untrained when that would be possible. I've taken dog training classes recently, too, because my younger brother got a silver lab that I did a majority of the training for before I moved out of my parents' house so i would be taking the training seriously and I am professionally informed. I don't have an apartment in mind yet, I would just like to move as soon as possible and that limitation would definitely slow us down.

There’s a girl (let’s call her Katy) that’s been here for awhile. She was not my or my store managers hire. katy originally had my job but got demoted due to numbers and not knowing how to do basic things. I was an assistant manager at another store and got moved to this one and didn’t know she was ever a manager. Since my store manager (let’s call him John) started he said he knew this girl wasn’t a right fit for the store. katy was very disrespectful to me when I started and treated me like a child. This did not make me want to fire her, I’m very compassionate. Just figured she needed time to warm up. But John has said she’s disrespected him as well but not given me details. Over the past few months her numbers have been getting worse. She has a terrible attitude. Uses her phone in front of customers. Doesn’t listen when I tell her to do things. We have tried different approaches. Giving her a week off. Being gentle, being firm. Even weeks her numbers ARE good (few and far between) her attitude sucks UNLESS she is working with both me and my store manager (I don’t know why it improves then but it’s not feasible for us to both work with her each time due to limited hours). But I do like her as a person. She’s a person like any of us and no one is perfect. She had something traumatic happen to her a few weeks ago and we were gentle on her and her attitude and her ability to be easily distracted held strong but I understood. It was a tough time. My store manager wants to fire her and I agreed although expressed doubt. I feel terrible because I know she’s a person no one is perfect and she doesn’t deserve to be out of a job. I could probably stop her getting fired as it was a mutual decision. I am very torn. She could always improve. Having trouble coping with this decision. Any help appreciated.",28Aug2020,1

740,"Now I suppose I should explain that I’ve posted here before about this problem, and despite attempting to apply that sort of routine in my life, I struggle a lot with it. I’m living with my Mom and Dad and in general, I’m reaching a breaking point with them due to me not really doing anything. And that makes me sad and seriously frustrated, as I don’t mean to do that to them.

But I just... don’t really know. I struggle with basic self-help like shaving and cleaning and only do something because someone tells me to do it. I do external things in my life not because they would make _me_ feel good, but make _others_ feel good. Pleasing others and my fear of maintaining a bad image ironically leads me to lie or not really do anything on my own because I’m afraid of what they would think of me if I wasn’t presenting a good image. People’s thoughts on me is a massive way for me to stop doing anything.

And that’s _extremely_ frustrating, because I have the knowledge. I’m not mentally disabled, I smart, but I both have vice and a genuine lack of impulse to do things for myself and rather do it for others. I can’t instinctively think or “see” what can be done around the house; it’s like I’m blind to what can be done until somebody points it out. Between that and me generally doing things on basic impulse, I can come off as a parasite in the process when... I don’t mean to be like that. I _hate_ being a parasite, nor do I want to be that way. And yet, I genuinely cannot “see” things to be done like others can, and feel most comfortable when others direct me and give me an impetus for doing something. None of what I do is self-directed, and that’s seriously frustrating for one reason: *I don’t know how to become self-motivated.*

And I don’t mean “cheesy self-help books”. It’s literally in a state where I need somebody to help tell me what to do, because I don’t know where to start or what to do. I need companionship I can count on, friends I can rely on, and me struggling so much with knowing what to do is _*extremely*_ frustrating because I’m well-educated, I have good social skills, and I even have ambitions and dreams. But all of it is stemmed with how people would see me. Absolutely nothing came from impulse from me, and without somebody guiding a structure, my life is a mess.

If anyone knows what my problem is — be it a character flaw, a genuine disorder or something else — that’d be extremely helpful, because I’m scared I’ll have no one because I don’t know how to start by myself rather than start with friends.",28Aug2020,1

Hi everyone , 

I really need some help and I don’t want to reach out to friends or family. My mom found out about my recent addiction and smoking / drinking habits. I’ve been sober for 6 months straight because I promised them and myself I would try but I reached my breaking point and broke my sobriety ONCE. I still live with them hence since I’m 19 and my siblings seen me high. They kept it a secret for me for a month and a half but one of them started snooping around my things and he read my personal journal. He then told my mom everything. 

My households really toxic since February they’ve been flip flopping between kicking me out and letting me stay. She has threatened to kick me out once every week for the past 6 months. Therefore I can’t tell if she’s serious or not. However all of this plus the constant shaming, mental, and verbal abuse is really taking a toll on my mental health. 


If I had the financial funds to support and stand on my own I would but I’m depended heavily on them. I’ve saved almost 6,000 because I knew this day would come. Anyways sorry for the long story but

752,"hi again! by writing here i feel like i’m talking to a close friend, so i will continue doing so. i’m alexis, and uh i’m currently venting from my windowsill because I don’t actually have the balls to sit on the roof ledge right under me and also the fact that my parents could probably see me there. today’s grand topic which caused me to have multiple breakdowns and panic attacks while doing mundane and mandatory tasks is the image of my future. ive never exactly known what I want to do, what I want to achieve but i do have role models and an idea of who I want to be, how I want to grow and improve as a person. here comes the first issue: my dream is to work from home, creatively and doing something I love-even if it doesn’t make me a millionaire. my definition of success is being able to provide for my living expenses while doing something that ultimately, i can wake up in the mornings and say “wow, i am exactly where I want to be on this rainy ass day, and i am fucking proud of that.” 
 
of course, I understand completely that it isn’t going to be easy. nothing is easy- and i am more than okay with that.  i just want to give it my best shot, take opportunities, meet people, kinda just suck the feeling of existence from the air and make it my own. i want to do a lot of things, express, speak, interact, explode in the atmosphere of being alive. neither of which I am doing right now, in fact I have eaten 4 chocolate bars today with the added nutrition of spicy peanuts and two ripe bananas. and half a mediterranean pizza, which is besides the point.

anyways. since a pretty young age ive always been drawn to the creative arts, ballet, dance, trad art and digital art, singing, acting, writing, composition, music, fashion, designing and embroidery. and skateboarding which is incredibly irrelevant but (yay i can ollie i’m cool now). back to the point, i don’t want to be working an office job. i want to just go fuck it and (AFTER getting an education because I know how important that is and would never give it up on the sole purpose of ‘chasing my dreams’) do something I have a passion for. probably my biggest aspirations are to become someone influential on the many social media platforms such as YouTube, instagram etc. and yes, it’s not going to happen overnight. it takes years for any channel to grow and achieve anything great, and you know what? I’m willing to put in the work to get my outlook on life out there, I want to be genuine, and real and honest and while that’s all fine and dandy one thing stands in my way.

my parents. traditional asian tiger parents, probably both with chronic mental issues but won’t admit it, under the stress of chasing their idea of success for their children. (working a 5-9 job, doctor, dentist, lawyer, engineer, professional musician, all that jazz.) everyday is just the same, waking up to just want to disappear and not wake up-ever again, dealing with their shitty rules (such as NO RELAXATION, every subject is useless unless it’s maths or science, no hair longer than your shoulders because it’s ugly, no friends because they’re pointless, no fun) and also standing up to them about their intense homophobia (hello, gays. i’m dad. (kidding, I’m a closeted bisexual) and racism. I CANNOT TAKE A SINGLE DAY of this bullshit without ending that day by sinking into bed at 4am because the night is the only time I get to myself crying until my eyes go dry and i fall eventually asleep. then getting up, being screamed at and wishing I wasn’t there.

fun fact: my parents hate the education system because apparently all it does is teach kids to rebel and be disrespectful to their family. and example being the school giving an important talk on how your mother may post that one picture of you which you aren’t comfortable with going public and becoming self conscious and anxiety driven about it. in which case we were taught to respectfully approach the adult and explain to them what’s going on, why you don’t want this certain portrayal of yourself on the internet for the whole world to see. 

i thought that this was perfectly reasonable, but my parents both think that as parents they have the ultimate control over my life, what I want to do and what I enjoy and like.

The very idea that I’m no longer good at the things I spend all my time on makes me feel plagued by thoughts of failure and dissatisfaction I don’t even want to try anymore.

I had such an ambition and now every time I try and do something competitive my mind is plagued with these thoughts, I become numb kind of in the mind and really irritable I caught myself being a lot more aggressive and angry at basic things and feel like I’m never going to be good enough again and I’ll forever be a declining average person.

756,"I’m 21, my dad passed away when I was 16. I loved him dearly and we were very close. He was my biggest supporter and I miss him every day. 

One thing that was left to me was his 1988 Chrysler LeBaron. It’s in great condition for its age, the interior looks almost new, he left me a brand new convertible top that only needs to be installed, but the problems under the hood feel unfixable. 

To be clear, I love this car. I have plenty of fond childhood memories in it from before I could even pronounce “convertible” and wish things were different. 

I’ve probably put close to $5,000 into the thing, even though it’s probably not worth anything. I’ve replaced countless parts and even paid for a transmission rebuild. It throws codes and because it’s so old I have no idea of finding out what the actual issues are. The transmission also shit out in less than 50 miles and the guy who repaired it is ignoring me. 

My dad loved cars. He had plenty and went through dozens. But he always held onto this one. It was my grandmothers and she gave it to him as a graduation present. It meant a lot to him and it means a lot to me. He was also a mechanic for pretty much his entire life, and could make anything with wheels and an engine run (even if he was jerryrigging it) 

But I’m at a loss for what to do. It’s been through two people and a Chrysler dealership, and every time they hand it back and say they don’t know, too many people have messed with it, and that they’ve done what they can (if anything.) 

I’m still young and moving around and finding a place with a garage for a convertible that doesn’t run and hasn’t been registered in 10 years is more than difficult. I would need a garage because it can’t be in normal parking spaces or it would obviously get towed or reported. It would cost a significant amount of money to store it somewhere and the truth is that it would likely continue to sit, because I’m lost and don’t know what to do with it. 

As I said, it’s probably not worth anything. It’s unlikely I’d be able to sell it, as it’s not popular in the car community or anything like that. (Which makes it harder to fix as well because there are not many forums) I can’t think of anyone else in my family that would want it or be able to store it. 

But taking it to the scrap yard just feels disrespectful. It feels wrong, I know it’s just a car and my dad is gone but I don’t want to do that. I feel guilty for considering getting rid of it at all. What do I do?

TL;DR - My dad passed away and left me a car that doesn’t run and likely may not ever. It’s hard for me to carry around and find a place to live that will accommodate it. I’ve spent a lot of money trying to get it fixed because it meant a lot to my dad and also to me. It’s likely not worth anything and would be impossible to sell, but taking it to a scrap yard feels disrespectful to my dad. I’m lost on what to do.",28Aug2020,1

We have been through so much together. And it just doesn't make any sense to me.

I asked my friend his reasoning when he first told me that our mutual friend was his best man. He told me that it was due to having to make a speech. It is understandable, as I am a pretty shy person until I get comfortable with those around me. However...

Today I found out that our mutual friend, the best man, straight up refused to do the best man speech. So my best friend, the groom, asked me to do it instead. This is frustrating because it contradicts his entire thought process. 

I realize that being my friends best man really isn't that big of a deal. But this still feels like a massive punch to the gut.

I have not confronted my friend, the groom, about this, because it isn't my place to make his decision for him. But that doesn't change how confused and honestly hurt I feel. It isn't about the title, its about the principle. It hurts a lot more than I ever would have expected thinking that he feels he is closer to our mutual friend than he is with me. I am not sure what to do, or how to feel about it. 

What should I do? Am I overreacting a bit on this? Should I still do the speech?",28Aug2020,1

765,"I (17) have a brother (12M), and when he was 10, I noticed that he would barely respond to questions other people asked him, including simple questions like ""What's your name?"". At home, he's incredibly intelligent and a great kid, but he would completely shut down when he wasn't with close friends and family. 

During a trip with a group of his friends, they joked about how the Earth was flat. However, my brother is obsessed with space, history, and geography, and he didn't know that they were joking, so he lashed out (verbally, he didn't hit them) and screamed at them, and he later told me that he wanted to punch them. I talked to him, and he said that he couldn't recognize when people were joking or not and he doesn't seem to be able to recognize social cues. He has also had a hard time making friends without our interference, and he adheres to a strict routine. When he was 8, once I told him to brush his teeth before showering, because I wanted to shower first. Since then, it's been impossible to get him to shower first before brushing his teeth, and he gets extremely frustrated if we tell him to shower first. And like I said above, he's also obsessed with space, history, and geography and he can name the capitals of every single country, so sometimes we joke that he's secretly a Google Home device since he knows everything. All of these symptoms fit the description Asperger's Syndrome, which I suspect he has, plus the fact that it runs in our family.

When he was 4, my mom had taken him to the neurologist for his mild Tourette's Syndrome, and the neurologist said he was more concerned about my brother's unresponsiveness and stutter rather than his Tourette's. While I didn't know it at the time, my mom has been fighting with my dad for nearly 10 years over this issue, because he absolutely forbids her from getting him any sort of professional help. He threatened to kick us out if we ever did, and while my dad is usually pretty chill and isn't abusive or anything, he's adament about not diagnosing my brother because he doesn't want him to be labeled as ""handicapped"" or ""mentally incompetent"" since he thinks my brother is perfectly fine (that's not what I think of people with mental disorders or other people with disabilities at all, but it's the reason why my dad doesn't want my brother to be diagnosed). 

We're completely forbidden from talking about it or mentioning it to anyone, and once my mom got really mad at me because I told a friend that I knew someone with Asperger's. I have a family member with Asperger's, and they've been stigmatized by other family members for this issue, so this might also add to why my family doesn't want my brother to be diagnosed. However, my mom's been trying to get him to be more social by secretly asking his teachers to try to help him and organizing playdates with other kids, but his lack of social skills and his stutter are getting worse. He can't socialize with anyone outside of a few people at all, and I think it's hard to survive in a society that emphasizes on communication when you don't know how to communicate. He won't respond to people's questions, and he won't stand up for himself. When he was 5, he got bullied by a group of boys in his class, but we never knew until the teacher told us because he never talked about it. I'm worried about what will happen to him in middle school and high school, since people aren't always so understanding and accepting.

Splitting up the family is out of the question, but my dad refuses to let him be diagnosed or get a therapist. What should I do? I don't want him to just get worse and worse, and we can't always be for him, especially as he's getting older. Is there anything we can do to help him?",28Aug2020,1
766,"I am 21 (M) living at home with a what I say is a controlling parent. My dad (61 &amp; 6’7”) is an enigma to me, I don’t understand how he thinks at all. I am currently going to college for engineering and have had a 3.8 gpa until last semester when I failed 3 of my courses. I’m not even sure what I am trying to ask or if I just want to vent. 

This semester for college I am trying to do online classes from home so I can save money and avoid COVID, but my dad tries to control every aspect of my life. I don’t currently have a job which makes my dad call me the laziest piece of shit on the planet. Now to him i can see how it looks that way, I do all that I can to avoid him because every time he talks to me it is in a negative attitude which upsets me. 

I want to know why he wants to control many aspects of my life, he tracks where and when I go places, he throws water on my when I am trying to sleep and he verbally threatens with abuse but never has actually acted on anything. 

I know the easiest answer is just for me to move out and get my own place, but I still want to be around my mom and my younger sister. I just wish I could talk to my dad and figure out why he does what he does. 

One thing he hates is my sleep schedule. Because my classes are online I can watch my lectures and do my homework whenever so I like to stay up till about 7 am so I can see my sister before she goes to school then I wake up around 2 (ideally). My dad works M-F from 3-6pm before this job he was self employed for 30 years and did not do much work other than ordering inventory for his store. 

I didn’t give the full background how can I without talking for hours, I almost didn’t make this post because I don’t want to make my dad seem like a super bad person. He is like bi-polar or something because he can go from talking all happy to a friend on the phone to sternly condescending in an instant.",28Aug2020,1
767,"Hello there, apologies if this is the wrong place to post this I’m a bit overwhelmed rn.

I used to get a school bus to school. It was a small mini bus with about ten girls on it (private girls school). The driver was a lovely man named Phil. Phil lives in the same town I do and sometimes pops into the coffee shop I work in to say hi since I’ve finished school and am off to uni.

Phil came in today and told me he had some bad news. He has terminal cancer. I am absolutely heartbroken. This man is quite honestly the kindest and most compassionate man I have ever met. He would always have a chat with you, ask about your day and do everything to make sure you had a good day. Before the Christmas break he would buy everyone on the bus a big bar of chocolate. If he found out it was your birthday, you’d get a card from him the next day. Him and his wife often pop into my work to say hello and get breakfast. They are the kindest couple. 

He has eight months to live and can’t go to work now. Driving the bus was his favourite job he told me, and he’s had so many interesting and odd jobs throughout the years, and he seems so upset that he can’t work anymore. He also asked if I could let the other girls on the bus know what was happening as some of them are going back to school in September and won’t know what’s happened. I agreed and I told them, we’re all upset. We also want to do something for him but are all quite lost as to what to do. We want something to show him how much we care and that we support him but we don’t want to patronise him. He’s an older man, probably late 60s. 

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what we can do for him in a way that isn’t patronising or drawing too much attention to his eventual death?",28Aug2020,1

769,"Hey all, this is going to be kind of a wordy post, I need to vent mostly, Id appreciate any tips.

I’m a nineteen year old guy, I’m about to start my second year of college online. 

I just lost my first love/highschool sweetheart about 2 months ago. We were together for over 2 yrs. She broke up with me after a long period of her neglecting our relationship, ignoring me for entire days, etc. I gave her the benefit of the doubt that everything was fine (like she said) and tried to communicate but she clearly didn’t love me anymore. I’m still pretty heartbroken and I miss her every day. I did everything I could but she just doesn’t want me anymore. 

I’m starting my sophomore year of college soon and I’m pretty bummed out that it’s going to be online. i probably won’t meet any new people until it opens in february. Most of my friends from high school have gone their separate ways and I lack any real close relationships with anyone except for my dad. 

I spend the vast majority of my time alone, I’ve only been working part time at my job since being there just makes me frustrated (I work in retail) and depressed. I am on academic scholarships so I don’t need the money anyway. I have a lot of hobbies, I play a few instruments, I go to the gym every day, I surf and skateboard, cook, paint, read daily, journal, really anything that interests me, I will do. 

Despite all of the things I do to try to occupy my time, I am miserable any time that I am alone with my thoughts. I miss being close with my friends and my ex girlfriend and I am struggling to make new friendships. I talk for hours and laugh a lot with my coworkers but any time I make an effort to see them outside of work they aren’t interested or say they’re busy. 

A girl who I was close friends with in highschool recently texted me out of no where and we talked about school and stuff like that, and then she just stopped answering me, she hasn’t even opened my last message now for 3 days. I don’t know what happened but it really hurt to have someone be interested in talking to me and then just ignore me.

My self confidence is pretty much ruined. i feel like i will never find another girl who’ll want me, especially not someone who is as gorgeous and smart as my ex girlfriend. i try to spend as much time with my few remaining friends as i can but everyone has their own lives and i feel like i’m more of an annoyance than anything, no one ever texts me first. i try to be kind and thoughtful and generous to everyone but no one shows any interest in me ever.",28Aug2020,1

Why are people better looking than others? And not only that but why so drastically? It feels like the average guy it´s just not really physically hot to pretty much all women. Why is everything so horrible?

&amp;#x200B;

We dont live in the Middle Ages anymore. If it was like back then when you married a random girl when you were 16 and that was it fair because who cares about looks in that situation? But now our society is hypersexualised, we are bombarded with pronographic images since we are children, we consume porn sincethe age of 11. Women are ""sexually liberated"" (not saying it´s a  bad thing, I am just stating facts here). Even if you wanted to marry early you probably couldn´t. Most marry at 30-40. Good luck finding a life partner at 22 as a guy. Plus you probably have to move to a different city or country multiple times when you are young. It´s not realistic to have only a few serious relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

Dating around is important now, if you cant do that you are going to be miserable there is no way around it.

&amp;#x200B;

Well what kind of people can date around with much problem? Women, attractive guys. What about normal looking guys or belwo average guys? And even if you can because you are charismtatic (that´s a nother one, can everybody become super charismatic? idk) you still not very physically attractive.

777,"So to be brief my education history isn't great. I did a software engineering degree, dropped out. I felt quite ashamed of not having some kind of degree so I eventually did a Computing degree only graduating at 35. I'm now 38.

I really wanted to be a programmer and I realise now I should have done A Levels at 16, followed by a Computer Science degree at 18, grad job at 21. Lately I've been trying to network and apply for jobs. It's really bugging me that everyone I meet and every job I look at has ""Computer Science"".

I thought to myself, well, too late now, no way you can go to university at my age and I wouldn't be accepted without A Levels anyway and no way I want to put myself through A Levels. So I figured might as well forget it.

I know it sounds silly but I kept seeing CS everywhere. I try and forget but e.g. I watched an action film and there just happened to be a scene where Will Smith recommended his clone should do a CS degree. I was browsing through Reddit and someone posted about starting a CS degree and it was an online degree that would consider work experience/performance which seemed perfect for my situation. 

So possibly I could start a CS degree part time in September/October. I'm not eligible for a loan but it's only £10k which is actually not bad for a degree. It pains me to think I'm putting myself through the process all over again and I'll be in my 40s by the time I get my desired degree. Although I could also be in my 40s realising is have the degree by now if I'd just applied. 

I think the real drawback I need to think about is that ageism is definitely widespread in CS. Jobs either want young graduates or experience. So I could do all this for no benefit. I could just take a chance and hope for the best or maybe I'm really wasting my time. I did manage to get a couple of job interviews so maybe there is some hope.

The other thing that bothers me is that I've already gone through the pain of a degree and it's like that was a waste of time. 

I think deep down I'm just really upset about my career situation and I'm looking at ways of fixing it. In the short term I can still apply for jobs using the degree I have and portfolio I've built. In the long time I could eventually have a CS degree.",28Aug2020,1

Today I decided to Google how many calories I actually need. I use lifesum to track my caloric intake and all that stuff(it says I need about 2100) but I wanted to see other options. They all said similar things so I decided that's what I'll try to reach. I also did some research on how to improve my metabolism. Turns out I've been doing everything wrong. I've been working out everyday for at least an hour(mostly cardio). I used to be quite an active person before quarantine so I thought that's what I needed to be able to increase my calories. When I found that out I decided to calculate how much I ate on a regular before I developed an ED and just lived a regular life. Turns out I ate around 1400 cal and had been undereating for the longest time. I thought I ate a lot but I just had big meals since I only had time to eat once or twice a Day.

She also gets mad if we stay up in his room for more than an hour or so but then Alan his brother, gets mad if I'm in the living room (I've heard him tell his parents he feels uncomfortable if I'm there and he has to wait until I'm upstairs?).

His younger brother Alan (M17) is autistic and horrible. They excuse his mean behaviour because he's autistic and my BF is the scapegoat. Alan yells ""fuck off get out of my room!!"" if my BF so much as offers to make him food or will play his video games at full volume at 12/1 am while I'm there. He runs after my BF with a knife/hammer every so often for the last 8 years and spits on him if he ever argues back. He will steal my BF's stuff just to annoy him and does things like tell the family what sex toy my BF uses on me/condoms (he looks through his stuff). The irony is that he seems like a nice guy and has friends and his teachers like him, he is just a dick at home. His mom won't talk to him *at all* for the last 3 days cos he called Alan ""piggy"" for stealing sweets I got him. I feel really awkward cos my mom booked a meal for both our families halfway between both our hometowns yesterday. His mom texted my mom thanks and she'll ask her husband about it first. My BF has asked her if she wants to go to this meal in 2 days time cos my mom wants an answer but she won't give it. How do I fix this? It's getting more and more tense?",28Aug2020,1
786,So I’m 15 and a female. I’ve been working as a cashier at my job at a pizza restaurant. I absolutely hate it. I have been so stressed and depressed since I started my job.

789,"First off, I have tons of Conservative Christian family members. Though unrelated to the question I’m asking, I’d like to say that since I started ‘coming out’ as someone who believes in different things than my family does, I’ve noticed a severe drop in communication, aka nobody wants to talk to me anymore because I believe in something different from them. Kinda culty. Weird.

Anyways. Here’s my reasons for wanting to leave Facebook.

1) Family members posting racist propaganda. 

2) My great aunt is old as shit and yet has become a mogul between her elderly community on Facebook when it comes to trying to “end abortion”.

3) Anytime I post something that backs my side/opinions, I get a comment from my step mom who publicly talks to me like a child and tries to manipulate my words... For example: If I were to say I support the idea of some police reform, she will say something along the lines of how I support looters and rioters. 🤨

4) Shortly after posting anything that goes against their beliefs, I will see family make posts that directly counter the specific subject I posted about just prior.

5) I am trying to focus on therapy and grieving, not getting upset at posts on Facebook. It just distracts me, and leaves me always feeling worse than I did before.

6) I unfollow people left and right, but the never ending tsunami of misinformation and hate is hitting harder than ever and I just can’t escape it on Facebook.

7) I say I use just to keep in touch with people, but I look at my messages and history shows this isn’t even true anymore. I don’t really talk to anyone on Facebook that I don’t talk to on my personal phone.

8) Division between family and friends, usually having to do with political issues. I’ve always tried my best to love and accept everyone for who they are and what they believe in, but unfortunately many people can’t do that simple thing because they just can’t see past their own hate, whether they’re aware of it or not.",28Aug2020,1
790,"I (20F) have been with my boyfriend (18M) for almost 2 years now. It's been great, but our relationship has been rocky recently. Last week he put his hands on me. We were arguing about something very dumb and I said I need to have some alone time for an hour or two just to calm down. I got in my car and started it up and he stood behind my car so i couldn't leave. 

     To me this is a red flag and very manipulative of him to do. I got upset and rolled my window down to tell him to get out of the way. I was very upset. He came around, unlocked my door and tried to take my keys out of the ignition. I immediately grabbed my keys and he grabbed me, wrapped his arms around me and dragged me out of my car. I almost fell on the ground. I told him we need to break up because I was super upset and long story short we talked about it and now things are fine. 

    My grandma was on the phone when it all happened and she told my dad and my dad told me he wanted to fight him, and on top of that my dad messaged his mom, who frankly did not care that much. So a lot of people know about it including my 2 friends whom I've told. And one of my friends told my boyfriends brother who also told their mother. Now my boyfriend is fine, even though he still doesnt quite understand why me and a lot of others were upset about what happened. 
     

   He wants to do something this sunday and said maybe myself, him and his friend from work can get outside and ride our bikes. My boyfriend has been working on fixing my bike up while I'm at work. At first I was happy and looking forward to it but now I'm paranoid. My boyfriends friend at work is known around town because 5 or 6 years ago he was charged with watching child pornography. He was around 16 when he got into trouble. He seems like an okay person and seems like he is making an effort to better himself. He supports his family by working 3 jobs, but now I'm paranoid that they are both plotting to kill me. 

     I know it's silly and I must sound crazy. I've never been afraid of my boyfriend or had any reason to feel afraid, especially for my life but I've been having horrible anxiety about a bunch of stuff in my life right now. Sometimes I get paranoid where I feel like someone is following me in my car, or that people I know are on a phone call with me but i dont know it and they are listening in on me. Sometimes i feel like when I'm at the store talking to my friend whoever's I'm talking about will be in the aisle over listening. I've also been paranoid about driving crazy. Especially after a car accident I had. I worry that I'm gonna get myself killed even though i drive perfectly fine, especially at night. What should I do?",28Aug2020,1
791,"okay this is a long one, so pls bear with me.


i have been friends with 3 people from my last office since June 2017. We used to hang out every day after work - go dinner/ drinking, etc. Even Sundays sometimes. Literally best buddies - we smoked together, got drunk together, the whole deal. I decided to quit that company on Dec 2018 and moved to another city for work. Still remained the best of friends - video called almost every week and played video games with them. One of them had a birthday in October (2019) so I decided to fly in to surprise her for her birthday party.

Fast forward the surprise, the cake cutting, I got super drunk. After getting out of the pool I went to lay down in one of the rooms only to realise that all the rooms were full so I had to adjust ( which i didn't have any problem doing). There's a bit of space in one bed in one room where the AC was on full blast and a girl and a guy are already sleeping there (they were not dating) so I decided to place myself there and cover myself with the blanket. I don't know what happened after this because I blacked out. I wake up the next morning, no biggie, I talk to the girl, she was pretty chill, and we go on our separate ways.

I flew back home the next evening. I was super busy with work so didn't talk with my friends much. About 10 days after the party I just message my friend (the birthday girl) just asking how she was, what she was upto, you know normal stuff - doesn't reply for like 2 days. I try calling her, no reply. So I text my other 2 friends asking what's up - even they don't respond for days. I try getting in touch with them again, no avail - I'm being ghosted (I don't know what's happening so I start freaking the out and anxiety kicks in) I try to get in touch with other mutual friends, same thing. no reply.

I literally haf to beg my other 2 friends to at least tell me what was wrong and then they tell me that I got super drunk on the night of the birthday party and said some things to the birthday girl which got her super upset. and I also tried hooking up with her friend with whom I shared the bed that night.

I'm in shock. Now my side of the story is, that I absolutely don't recall what I said to the birthday girl that night. As far as the hooking up part goes, I do remember sharing the blanket with her and being close to her because I had just came out of the pool, drunk as fuck, didn't have a towel to dry myself even, and didn't have a change of clothes. I was also told that when the girl sleeping beside me wanted to face her back to me and sleep, i didn't let her - I hugged her tight and dozed off ( I don't have any recollection of this - i must have done this in my sleep may be because my body was wet and cold and hers was warm) and I grabbed her tits in my sleep. ( i do remember this but i thought i was dreaming) I'm at fault, no getting around it.

It's been 10 months and nobody wants to talk to me. I tried sending gifts, cookies, personalized letters, everything ( i tried for about 3 months after this incident happened) I think about what a stupid fuck I was that night and curse myself everyday for it. Anxiety kicks in every fucking day and I'm a miserable fuck all the time because I can't forget about it. I want them back in my life but don't know what to do. We were really close and I'm so lonely without them. My life has been a wreck after all this happened.

It was fatally injured, so my dad decided to put it out of its misery. However, later that night, we noticed that our dog was over in the same area where it killed the first bunny. Upon further inspection, we discovered that there was a nest containing three baby bunnies. They didn’t appear to be fatally injured, so we put them back in the nest and covered them with a light layer of grass. The bunnies are still sitting in the nest today, and we decided to remove the bunnies to better inspect for injury. For the most part, they looked fine, other than being a little slow.

Private renting, our landlord hired a handyman for odd jobs including our bath needing re-enamelling. 

Handyman said we would have to leave bath for 24 hours when landlord requested he re enamel it, fast forward a year of excuses later he is now saying we will have to vacate the property for 3-4 days.

Aforementioned year of excuses and unreliability have meant our landlord is looking to replace him and we don't know if he has caught wind and if this is the cause of the time increase (he has already been paid and has just taken a large project nearby) or if it is a reasonable time frame.

He's kind and funny and I like talking to him so I don't want to be told to break it off just because we are having trouble conversing.  We're both a bit awkward and I think thats what makes talking a bit more difficult 😅

We are both 18 btw. So a year ago me and this girl worked in this same job and it was great. We would hang out and talk but never officially dated. I knew I was gonna be moving in the future so we didnt want to do that to each other.

I ended up moving and it sucked so much, we would talk still but It was hard. We went a few months where we didnt talk because I was hoping that would make me lose the feeling for her, it didnt.

We had recently started talking again and one time she sent me a pic of a trail we used to walk on saying ""remember this?"" She also had said ""Yeah, Qwerty why did you have to move? Now I've got nobody at (the job we both worked at) to hang out with"" we facetimed the first time a few weeks ago and that was the first time I could see her in over a year. After the call we were talking and she had said ""it was super nice to see you again"". She also had gave me her Snapchat a few days after that call (which she didnt have before because she wasnt too big on social media and didnt have it when I moved). A few days after this we were talking again and we were talking about a past coworker and she said ""maybe they are sick of me"" and I said ""nah I dont think that could happen"" she was like ""everyone gets annoying sometimes"" and I replied ""maybe, to certain people"" she then said ""you're too nice"" and also later called me a ""sweet chile"" in the convo

It sucks because she felt perfect for me and she actually cared for me and I for her. I dont know what to do and I dont even know if she still feels that way about me. She was also the first girl I ever got almost serious with so maybe I'm just being petty and clingy, idk",28Aug2020,1
799," 

I just can´t deal how unfair and cruel life is. I know that there are worse problems but for whatever reason what touches my nerves is the topic of beauty. Why are people better looking than others? And not only that but why so drastically? It feels like the average guy it´s just not really physically hot to pretty much all women. Why is everything so horrible?

We dont live in the Middle Ages anymore. If it was like back then when you married a random girl when you were 16 and that was it fair because who cares about looks in that situation? But now our society is hypersexualised, we are bombarded with pronographic images since we are children, we consume porn sincethe age of 11. Women are ""sexually liberated"" (not saying it´s a bad thing, I am just stating facts here). Even if you wanted to marry early you probably couldn´t. Most marry at 30-40. Good luck finding a life partner at 22 as a guy. Plus you probably have to move to a different city or country multiple times when you are young. It´s not realistic to have only a few serious relationships.

Dating around is important now, if you cant do that you are going to be miserable there is no way around it.

Well what kind of people can date around with much problem? Women, attractive guys. What about normal looking guys or belwo average guys? And even if you can because you are charismtatic (that´s a nother one, can everybody become super charismatic? idk) you still not very physically attractive.

It's common in the town and job to watch other's dogs, take them out and walk them and I've done it for others and others have done it for me. Date is quickly approaching and she texts me saying she wants me to sleep at their house, take care of the plants, mow the lawn. I told her I was both taking classes remotely, working my own job, and taking care of my dog that couldn't be around her dog. I suggested coming over multiple times a day and taking him out to eat, working on my things in the house, and letting him stay in his kennel over night.

I disagree with my friends on some political topics and although I try to avoid the topics so they don’t argue with me about it. I also don’t feel like my friends really care all too much. I am left out and I find if I don’t talk to them they often don’t talk to me. They also can be really harsh, espically if I don’t look or do the things they like. As an example there is this kid who constantly wants to talk about politics, got mad when I didn’t know the political statement of democratic candidate and aggressively asked if I supported Trump. I said no, as I don’t and he acted harshly for the rest of the day becuase I didn’t know his favorite candidates political statement. I am a teenager, I have very little interest in politics, and tahts okay becuase I don’t have to vote. Another friend judge me for my weight. I used to be a good bit chubby and my friends would poke at me for it. Only one said something about it directly but the others would look at my food weirdly or act weird when I ate something that they didn’t think was good for me. One friend even joked while we were on a two hour scavenger hunt running around the city and I complained about being hot about my legs being to big and that it will help them, she also called me fat once. I also have migraines and when I began going there I got MUCH more than I had at my previous school I went from one to two every other week to about three every week. They also assign a TON of a homework which isn’t that big a deal because I can handle it but something that should be accounted for. On the other I have much more freedoms at the school and on the few good days it’s a lot of fun. I also have a lot better chance of getting into a college with a full scholarship if I stay and that would really be helpful becuase  I want to become a vet.

My (F16) friend owl (F17) and I are both freshly seniors in high school. Owl doesn’t live near the school, and she doesn’t have a ride home. Both her parents work until five.  

Me being her closest friend, told her she can come stay at my house until her parents could pick her up. Well, she asked me to ask my mom if it was alright. I have a big family and my house is pretty full so we never really hang out at my place ever.  

Now I regret asking my mom because i hate having owl over. She just lays in my twin bed and distracts me. On Wednesday she even had her sneakers on my white sheets! I told her to get her shoes off my bed and she told me they weren’t on my bed. That really pissed me off cause that’s disgusting. I sleep there and I told you to take them off. Anyway she has no car no license or anything. So she doesn’t have a way to get home herself. 

I don’t have any problems with her, except for the fact that if I spend too much time around her I start getting really annoyed with her, and even start despising her for the time shes around me. We are friends and have been for a few years. I don’t know why i cant spend extended amounts of time around her. But her personality just really starts to irritate me. Maybe we just aren’t compatible?

Basically I don’t want her at my home intruding for 3+ hours a day. If the time were less it would be easier but its too long. I can’t even focus on homework in my room like I want to. I cant focus when I’m with my friends on academics.

I don’t like the intrusion of my space. It isn’t something I enjoy. It’s so frustrating because I feel like I can’t relax having her here. I don’t want to deal with anyone after my school day is over. 

She doesn’t have much options but I am not her parents and I don’t wanna feel responsible for making sure she has a place. 

I want to try asking my friends with cars privately if they mind taking her home on certain says of the week so I don’t have to be around her. But then I would just be shifting the burden into someone else, costing them gas money, time, ect.

I feel bad that I feel so upset about wanting her out. But I just need to be away and have some private time for myself. I really never saw myself as an introvert Because I really enjoy spending time at others houses, or a day out to the mall or park. I love getting boba or coffee with her. Though I don’t like spending much more than a weekend at her house. She always asks me to come over though. I don’t know whats so different. 

I feel if I understood why i feel like this maybe it would change my outlook on it or even make it easier for me to talk to her about it. 

Please leave any advice or if you’ve been in a similar situation what you did to handle it.",28Aug2020,1

I remember being approx. 110 lbs most of my late adolescence life. I’d like to first get to that and then eventually work my way up to 115-120 lbs which is my ultimate goal.

836,"A little backstory, i will remove a few details because i worry they'll see this post, idk i'm a little paranoid. but the important points are there. 

So i'm a guy and my guy best friend (we're very close, we've been friends for years and we know everything about one another and are aware of each others' traumas and mental health issues and so on) took advantage of me. i was getting drunk and he got prescribed xanax pills (that he said didn't have that much of an effect on him anymore - imp for later), we were having fun and i want to mention i don't drink much so it was supposedly a safe space. 

i trust him a lot, i really do, so what happens next came as a shock to me.

we were on the same bed and supposedly too tired and were going to sleep. i was sobering up and remember every detail. so suddenly he kisses my cheek. i was taken off guard because we're not affectionate in any way, only sometimes and it feels awkward because we both have intimacy issues and are aware of the others' issues (as mentioned). 

I have to mentioned he confessed to me about feelings he had for me but i said that i don't feel the same way and made it clear (he used that later on to say that maybe i didn't get what he meant but i did and i was clear that i'm not on the same page). it wasn't so weird, because we're close and comfortable with each other and value our friendship.

anw he kisses my cheek suddenly and i pretended it didn't happen, and he asks if i'm aware of what happened and i pretended that i'm too drunk for this (which is important now that i think of it because he thought i was drunker than i already am and still took advantage which made things worse for me). i said we talk tomorrow and he was specific to say that he didn't want me to be thinking straight (i'm rephrasing this). 

Not that it was out of line enough, i said more than once that no i want to talk tomorrow when my head is cleared, he goes and kisses my cheek again. and it's very affectionate and i feel disgusted every time i recall it. it makes me so angry because it was selfish. 

i turned to sleep and he wanted to snuggle as well, so he snuggled my arm and i didn't push anymore. a little later i got up and stayed on the couch because i couldnt sleep and i was so bothered (he was sleeping)

we talked about it the next day, he was sure i didn't remember but i said i did and he assured me he was ok that i don't feel the same way. im a very nice person and suck at confrontation and am a people pleaser so i didnt want to talk about what bothered me but i pushed myself to say that i didn't like what happened yesterday. he apologized. we talked again later and he kept apologizing and saying he wasn't in control (bearing in mind the pill doesn't have that much of an effect on him anymore, this isn't an excuse)

he also said he kissed me on purpose at the moment because he knew what he was doing was wrong and he didn't want the both of us to be aware of it.  

i feel like this is so wrong and it's assault and i felt taken advantage of. i get angry every time i think about it but i told him it'll all be okay but i need a little time and space. 

i don't even know if i want this friendship to last, i kept questioning it all. but i have a history of cutting people off and i want to be better (i go to therapy). but at the same time i don't want to invalidate my anger because it was all so wrong and i feel disgusted. i also feel guilty that i'm holding a grudge but idk what to do. 

a huge part of my brain is telling me to cut him off because it's fucked up. and another part of my brain is telling me it's not that bad, but i always put other people's feelings before mine so i'm not sure what to do about that anymore. 

any help is appreciated. am i being unreasonable? was it assault as i think it was and do i have the right to be this angry?",28Aug2020,1

After an hour or two I started having hallucinations - it started off with the campfire seeming to move in time with the music. Then I was seeing my friends in stop motion freeze frame jumps, and their voices weren't in time with their lips. I got a bit freaked out and went off to the edge of the campsite, and for a while was quite entranced watching the fairy lights seeming to twinkle in time with the music. 

But then I kept smelling gasoline really strongly, yet my friends couldn't smell it. Earlier that day there had been a few minor explosions from faulty gas cannisters and people at the campsite had been injured and I was quite anxious, and it escalated into a panic attack. It felt like my heart was pounding in time to the music, and that I was going to have a heart attack and die.. I was lying in my tent and it felt like I was in a long tunnel with my feet in the real world and a garden behind my head that was drawing me in.

840,"So here's what happened so that you know why I called corporate and for background I'm a very white passing native American who grew up my entire life on the rez and recently moved to a very white state and it's a bit of a culture shock. 


So I went into town and stopped at the grocery store for a few groceries and while I was there I figured I'd pick up a few of these yummy frozen alcoholic beverages that I like to call grown up capri-suns.

I went to the checkout line and when they asked for my ID I handed over my tribal ID. One because I always use my tribal ID for stuff like this because there really isn't much use for it and Two because I had lost my drivers licence because I haven't been driving much (I think it's somewhere in my car maybe). Also for clarification if you don't know, a tribal ID is an official government ID that I can even use to get on airplanes and not pay sales tax in my home state so it's a real ID.

When I handed over my ID they looked at it funny and didn't believe it was real, I was stuck in the checkout line for ten minutes while they handed it to ten different employees and then took it away to show more employees because they didn't think it was real. And during this the cashier asked me questions like ""do you even really have any Indian blood"". The whole exchange was embarrassing and uncomfortable and made me feel dirty and like I did something wrong. 

Eventually they gave me my tribal ID back and let me finish checking out.

I was really upset and it may have been an over reaction because it was shark week but I was shaking and cried in the car. I told my freinds about it in the group chat and they were outraged and insisted I call corporate and even wrote out a script for me to follow. About how the experience was not OK and a little racist. 

The guy from corporate was very apologetic and said it was not OK and he gave me a 15 dollar credit and said that he was going to call the store and make sure that something like that didn't happen again (I'm guessing like some sort of ID training) 


I feel really embarrassed that I called corporate and a little bit like an asshole. I don't know how I can go back to the store because now I'm the person who called corporate because I was embarrassed for 15 minutes. The thing is they are the store with my favorite bread and the only store in town that has real alcohol like Jack Daniels. Should I just not get the good bread, and travel to the city if I want alcohol?

844,"A woman and I live far from each other, so therefore we can’t see each other in person. We have video dates roughly once a week where we most of time just talk and enjoy each other’s presence. Other times we’d play some games online together when we run out of things to talk about. I haven’t asked her to be my girlfriend or anything, but I eventually want things to progress to that point.

The only times she does contact me is if I tell her to get back to me or if she has to reschedule our plans. Despite this, I contact her once a week and make a video date. So far we’ve had around 8 video dates over the course of these last 2 months. 

I want to see her in person, and I believe she does too. Her mother asked her if she wanted to see me and she told her yes. I then asked her if her mother was going to follow through with that statement and she told me, “The world may never know”. That was on our last video chat. Also during this video chat, she had to leave an hour earlier than we usual do. Most of time I end the calls first but this time it was her and she made note of that. I told her to call me later. She said that she would. 

But here’s the main problem, it’s been 5 days and I haven’t heard anything from her. It feels like we’re strangers or something. Is she waiting for me to contact her or is she just getting bored? Why would she say that she would call me when it looks like she’s not going to? I’m just so confused by her actions, but I don’t want to send her a needy and weak text asking her why’s she’s not contacting me. I know she’s interested in me since she’s always happy to hear from me and always makes definite dates with me.

847,"To begin with I would just like to clarify that I hate change. I get extremely anxious and worried about it and it can cause me to break down in tears from the stress that it causes. 

So next week I’m starting year 12, which is the first year of sixth form. I’m staying at the same school and at first I wasn’t worried about the actual transition, only worried about how difficult the work will be. I had an older brother who went to this sixth form so I felt confident that I knew what was going to happen, the usual day and what not. However, I didn’t take into consideration that they are going to make changes due to COVID. 
Yesterday I found out that we would be having only 2 lessons a day, each spanning about 2 and a half hours. So my head goes, okay, this is different, I was told I would have free lessons everyday for study in periods 3 and 4. I don’t see how that’ll work. I was also advised by my brother to use these free periods to do homework so that I would have free time at home.
Then today I find out that we will be having a day at home each week. But only 1/5th of sixth form will be off on the same day as me. This has me panicking that I’ll be on my own at sixth form for a day cause the likeliness of my friends being at school on the same day as me seems pretty low as we’re not doing the same subjects. 


I know all of this probably doesn’t seem to be a big deal but I feel like it’s a big deal and it’s two very big changes that I’ve found out very close together and will be in school in less than a week. So now I am stressed about the difficulty of work, when I’m gunna do my homework, and if I’m going to be on my own all day. 

I understand that it is easy to make friends but I feel like I have forgotten considering I haven’t seen many people for the last 6 months. And the people I have seen don’t have the same classes as me and so will most likely not be in school a day that I am.

But my position is part-time and the salary is low for the area and the benefits deductions eat up more than one-third of my pay. When I was hired, the plan was that I would have a full-time job now. Then came the pandemic, a bad economy, and a whole different short-range outlook for the office where I work. Anyway, full-time’s not happening anytime soon. 

So, I’ve sent out some inquiries and I’ve been offered a job at a less fancy place. The pay is better. The benefits are super affordable. I would like the work more and it would be more meaningful. I would have a recession-resistant role. Lay-offs would not be likely. There is no prestige with this job. Advancement opportunities are nearly nonexistent.

If I remain at Fancy Place, there are likely to be advancement opportunities in the future. There is also the real possibility of layoffs at the end of this year. A full-time position is off the table until late 2021 at the earliest. If I make it to full-time, my salary will double, the benefits will become cheap, and I could, possibly, move up. 

One last consideration: let’s not overlook vanity. My people know I work at Fancy Place. If I leave, I will have to tell them that I failed to make it work at Fancy Place. I’m fragile and petty. Please have this inform your advice. 

So, what would be the better option? Should I stay or should I go?",28Aug2020,1

854," I want to start by saying that my friend is half legally blind, but is able to see well enough to type/read and has never made mistakes like this before, but claims he has in the past.

I have been friends with him nearing 10 years and this friend has been perverted in the past, but still keeps things on a strictly friend level. (My request) I ended up getting married and asked for him to please respect my marriage after saying something jokingly perverted. He use to mention how attractive I was and I made it clear that this could not happen if the friendship were to continue. He messages me on and off through the years and a few weeks ago messaged calling me hon and sweetie. I asked him if he could please not call me pet names and just be on friendly terms. He said he understood and respected this, but made jokes about it, almost in a way to make me feel shameful for asking this. He also would also say ""So long as your Husband isn't abusing you or something."" which often grew annoying to hear.

Fast forward and today he messages me saying "" Good morning extremely platonic friend who happens to be married and stuff I don't at all fine to be a super attractive person and all of that stuff I hope you are having a great morning... Blank stare "" He later goes on to say it is a joke when I get confused. As we chat about the morning, he out of no where sends me a picture of his private area (Completely open, no clothes) and tells me not to open it, which isn't an option in messenger as it will show automatically. I instantly deleted the photo and told him that if it happened again I would be questioning our friendship.

He swears it was a photo for his Girlfriend, but seconds into our conversation he was sending his Girlfriend a pic of his private? He then says ""Least it isn't like the time I grabbed your boob when teaching you defense moves."" I want to also make it known, that he NEVER grabbed me and it was with a group of close friends who were giving me tips on self defense when on dates. (He never touched my chest) I ended up blocking him after a while, by taking advice and because I thought about how my Husband would feel and if the tables were turned.

Now I am questioning if I made the right move? Help?",28Aug2020,1
855,"Caught in a crossroads with life and work

This will be a big read, please bear with me.

It's really difficult for me to put all this into words, but I'll try my best. I graduated a few years ago with a degree in business management from a state school. I've taken on various jobs since then, mostly in sales and administrative/office management work.  I quit sales because it wasn't a good fit for me. I've taken a liking to admin work because I'm good at it and it pertains to my personality, even though working a 9-5 in general makes me depressed and anxious. Unfortunately, I was laid off from my last office management job due to the economic impact of coronavirus. It's been 2 months and my unemployment hasn't come through yet despite my unsuccessful efforts to contact the unemployment office, local senators, reporters etc. I know I'm not the only one experiencing that backlog from UI claims.

To get to the main point of my post-- my family tells me I need to find more sustainable jobs than what I've been doing that are more stable and less likely to lay me off. But the truth of the matter is, I don't want to take on that extra responsibility because work makes me miserable and depressed no matter what. And it's not like I haven't been trying to get those ""better business jobs"" for the past 3 years, using all avenues and strategies, but nothing has been working. Yet, I can't keep relying on my family for financial support whenever something goes wrong. I want more than anything to become a stay-at-home mom but that's a long-term thing. I want to raise children and serve my future husband and have an impact on society and future generations that way (even if my sister thinks I'm a loser for wanting this). Every woman I know in positions of power that leaves her children to daycare, or has to juggle work and childcare, is miserable. I've seen what's happened to these women and I don't want to become that. It's why I used to practice coding and stopped.

In terms of my interests outside of work, I love drawing and writing, but fear turning that into paid work will make me resent it.

What are my options? What can I do? I need to find more ""sustainable"" work, but i don't think *any* job is stable nowadays, except if at an established corporation if that. Massive thanks for any advice you can provide.",28Aug2020,1

857,"(UK based) I just managed to get a part time job in a supermarket, I'm currently a university student. After my first shift yesterday I've got quite a bit of back pain today - my role involves lifting crates of produce so that will be why.

Could anyone give advice on what to do? I don't want to just quit - it's hard to find a job and the pay is decent. Since crates are often stacked I can't always squat down to pick them up. 

Could I just be in pain because I haven't done this before? Should I tell the personnel manager and ask how I should lift things that are stacked? I'm a bit embarrassed because I should be grateful for a job but I'm worried about the risk to my back. I haven't stopped thinking about it all day.

858,"Let me explain a little bit. I’ve been together with my fiancé for about 3 years or so. He has a daughter who is about to turn 18. She’s awesome - she has a lot of growing up to do and needs to learn responsibility, but as a person, she’s cool as hell. Well, my fiancé and her are super close and I love the relationship they have together. It’s cute to see - however, whenever she comes to visit on some weekends, I feel like my fiancé acts like a different person. It’s been like this since we’ve been together. 

For example, I always cook, which isn’t a problem because I love it. He NEVER cooks for me - and it really doesn’t bother me most of the time but sometimes when I get home from work, it would be nice to have something made (I’ve told him this multiple times but it is what it is)... But, I was working from home and he was home too. I got on my lunch break and he wasn’t doing anything and I asked what he was going to make me for lunch... he genuinely did not want to make me anything so... I made us both lunch and went about my day. Whatever, right? But whenever his daughter is here, he’ll make her whatever she wants, whenever. I want to say it’s totally fine because I know that they hardly see each other but it’s like, where is this with me? Like, I don’t always want to cook. I feel so shitty for even complaining but it is making me feel better.

Another example, I use to cut hair for a living &amp; I’m trying to totally stop doing it for friends and family simply because I don’t want to do it anymore. So yesterday, his daughter asked me to cut her hair, I said we’ll talk about it tomorrow. Then today, right when I got off work, my fiancé says to me, she needs a haircut, just drink some wine and do it. I just like... really!? I just got off work. And I told him it bothered me that he said it and he said that it’s for our daughter, he didn’t think I would mind but I don’t think that’s even the point. I don’t even know how I feel about it. Like, I’m being irrational about it but it bothers me!

And last example... they went grocery shopping earlier and when him and I go together, he unloads and I unpack. When she is here, she will throw the bags on the counter and walk away. So I’m stuck with putting things away. But today, I told my fiancé that I wasn’t putting the things away &amp; I said that she should help. He got irritated that I said that.. there are more examples but I feel so stupid for just these - 

But it’s bothered me for so long but I have a hard time bringing it up to him because I never want to take their time away with my stupid feelings. I guess I’m just venting ... maybe just for some one to put their input on the situation or maybe some justification on the way I feel about it. I know.... people have so much more important things going on than a father/daughter relationship with a almost step mom .... but thanks for anyone who made it this far...",28Aug2020,1

I'm understandable guy, I don't say what I mean even if I'm right and I'm dying to say something so that's why I'm writing here... Perhaps someone will give me reasonable advice.

Since she's been pregnant I'm getting handjobs and that's fine by me. But she's not into it, and I have to ask her to do it and she's never in the mood. And we get into fight because I feel neglected. I'm almost getting blue balls, and she doesn't have the need to satisfy me. And if she does, she's not enjoying it like she used to before. She's doing it because I'm nagging that I need to get empty.

She's doesn't like if I do it myself, and she surely wouldn't like if she knew I watch porn so I'm so stressed out. I jerked off myself couple times and I could feel she didn't like that.  Once I jerked off myself and she was fine with it. Next times when she was giving me handjob I had hard time cumming as she wasn't really into it. It's not just that someone gives you handjob. I would like to be aroused. And she was pissed off and asked me how I can cum by myself and not when she does it. And I was left with my balls full...

And don't think I don't satisfy her. She has needs. And I fulfill them. I get into it, because I love getting her off. But after she gets off, I don't get anything. And we get into fight because I expect her to satisfy me, and she tells me that she'll do me tomorrow.

We just got into big fight. I told her that I wasn't someone to be done tomorrow, and that I want to get some attention and she got mad and again...I finished her when she didn't do me.  And it's constant stress which is getting me... Sex before pregnancy was awesome. We can do it each couple days. But now when pregnant she doesn't have any needs and if she does it's each 2,3 weeks and I can't hold it that much

I don't know how to approach this. I do have more needs then her. I can jerk off each day or two, while she can be good for a month. And I know she's not cheating me, we're spending all time together as I work from home and she's stay at home mom. 

What should I do? I would love her to give me attention I'm giving her but she doesn't get me at all... Doesn't want to talk to me. That results me jerking off when she's asleep and it's doesn't feel good...",28Aug2020,1

Two of my closest friends from high school and middle school are getting married in October. I knew about this since the beginning of the year but when the whole coronavirus thing began, I thought they would postpone the wedding to next year or something. They have not. The bride is actually holding a bridal shower in about a week. Their reception venue even cancelled on them because they aren't holding any gatherings. I thought then, for sure, they would postpone it after that. Nope, they are just having the reception in the church where they're getting married. The wedding has over 100 people confirmed to be attending. 

I am at high risk for Covid-19, (my lungs are not that great) I've been avoiding going out in public unless it's for essentials and judging from some people that are attending, a lot of people will not be social distancing or wearing masks. Also, I live in the US so you know, it's coronavirus central here. These are two friends that are very dear to me but if I catch Covid-19, it is most likely that I will die. (And if I die before Cyberpunk 2077 or FF7R pt 2 comes out, I will probably come back as a ghost and haunt everyone on Earth.)

871,"  I have multiple concerns about my work place. I work at a Casino Resort in Washington on an Indian reservation. Because my work place is on an Indian reservation I'm not sure how much they are able to get away with legally or if my concerns are unfounded.

  I am a Slot Attendant but because of Covid I'm also expected to be security and housekeeping. We do not have enough security officers or housekeepers. We do have a mask policy, but it has basically rendered useless by our exceptions. As long as you have a cigarette out or a drink, then you are able to have your face cover off. So people constantly keep on relighting cigarettes and constantly have it hang out of their mouths. Constantly walk around and having the mask off using these excuses and I can't do anything about it because of the exceptions in the policy, but they somehow want me to enforce it. I can't do it. Also our slot department follows the policy differently from security. Meaning security and the slot department have different rules concerning the guest mask policy. What kind of nonsense are they spouting *sigh*. Am I crazy that the rules shouldn't vary? I also got in trouble for pointing at my own nose while trying to enforce this monstrosity because guests complained. 

  They also want me to constantly carry cleaning wipes in a baggy and clean continuously without exception. Concerning these times I understand that they want us to clean, but the amount of cleaning they want from us is excessive. It's absolutely impossible for us Slot Attendants to accomplish what they are asking. They are really nitpicky. I personally carry the wipes in my pouch because it is painful to for my fingers. They want us to personally carry it for hours even though I have an alternative that causes me no pain. The fumes on these wipes are also really strong. It gives me massive headaches and nausea. I now wring most of the liquid into the garbage because I can't continue cleaning otherwise. This still affects me though. They want us to clean constantly with these wipes that make us sick. Another Attendant complained and was told to 'suck it up'.

  Apparently cleaning is so important to them, but they are not helping us and force it onto us. Slot Attendants are not housekeepers or security officers. We do not have authority and attending to guests and continuously cleaning are completely incompatible. We are expected to 3 different positions at the same time.

  While cleaning we are only wearing our mask and gloves. Are we even following cleaning safety protocols? Are they aloud to force so much onto our workload that is completely outside of our job description?

  Other concerns would be that the water had turned yellow multiple times during me working there. The same water is used for sinks, toilets and soda machines. During these times they still gave soda to guests and employees. A previous employee told me that she found eggs in the soda despencer. Another employee told me that the oil used to cook for employees is barely changed. When someone was attacked in our own parking lot nobody told us. I found out because of a guest. Lastly, one of the housekeepers caught Covid and I would have never known if it wasn't for the fact that it was a relative of someone I know at work.

  I make around $10 dollars currently and tips. We are all getting cut hours and now they will also give part of our tips to supervisors and techs. Is this an industry standard? This is a major cut for us. The supervisors and techs are also able to work overtime while we are not. So they are getting a raise with no added responsibilities while us Attendants are given an overwhelming amount of responsibilities and a pay cut.

879,"Hey, any suggestions or helpful comments are really appreciated.

I am a 28 year old male living in a nice European country. I just got a new awesome job after losing mine in covid . Finally being able to save some money. At the same time my friend in another much worse country lost her job, we had a 3 month relationship when I traveled there about a year ago. We still keep touch once or twice a week and i like her but as a friend. Lately it's not been any conversations. Just a quick ""hey how are"" ""good"" kinda convos. 

she told me she got a new job which suprised me due to the covid situation its hard to get a job there. It is a cam-""modeling"" job. She and a guy are having sex for money. It broke my heart, not because of jealousy or anything like that but that she had to go through those lengths to being able to survive where she lives. I heard some news about that kind of service surging now after covid in these areas she lives. When it's just some statistics on a paper I can't really relate but seeing how poverty got to her as well, it hit me like a brick wall. I don't have any problem with the profession as is. it's a job and sometimes it pays really well. I just know her and this isn't her. Her friend would be perfect for it and she seeks attention and has the personality but I don't think my friend is strong enough for this. She is the nicest person I know, hard worker and extremely innocent. 

I have this feeling like I should help her because I am the only one who can. My new job provides me with stable salary which I will start using by paying up debt and loans from desperate times in Covid. 

After that i could send her some money, 4-500$ a month. With that she can hopefully quit for now. When covid is done I can pay her flight to some european country and help her get a job and get her on her feet. She can work and help out her family from abroad and get some education. 

I don't think she has a clue about how to find work in Europe so I would like her to get some skills online while she can't work or travel and use it for later when she applies.

We are both adults, eventually covid will pass and she will find a job even thought it will never get her to be able to save for Europe where there are more posibilities for her to study. 

2. I could when the covid is over, give her 2-3000 dollars for tickets to europe, budget for a month stay(she'd have to stay with someone she knows but the budget would be for food and basic stuff). That's her one shot, after that and if she does or doens't find any she's on her own.

3. I'd send her 4-500 $ a month so she can stop work and help her focus on building a skill which she can use to apply for jobs in Europe. And then pay her flight to Europe and back if needed. 

**Another suggestion**, what's a a good skill to learn for a year to help with jobs in Europe that doesnt need a degree. Her english is good, might be better. programming? graphic designer? I'm really cluless here and suggestions are needed :) 

I just need some perspectives here, am I being crazy for caring so much about this because I feel guilty knowing i can help but not doing it.",28Aug2020,1
880,The best way I could explain it is that I feel like an actor. I know that I should feel and that I should love people but I just can’t. I’m extremely good at charming people with words of kindness but when it comes down to it I don’t care about them in the slightest. One of my recent relationships ended because I just didn’t love her. It was my first real serious relationship too since i am only 15. She self harmed a lot and I pretended to hate it. But in reality I didn’t care. If she died I wouldn’t be phased. I’m best friends with both of my brothers who are just a bit older then me but we hang out all the time. I can truly say I love them but I know I’d be lying. I’ve invisibles then dying or leaving or is having a falling out or whatever and I don’t feel anything. I want them to stay but I just know that if they didn’t stay I’d be fine. I feel like an actor with a mask on. The mask shows people that I care and I’m a good person but I don’t care at all. All I care about is my future and making it the best it can. When I do feel that I love somebody it doesn’t take long before it goes away and I’m back at square one looking behind the eyes of the mask. (Not trying to brag) I’m very good looking and smart so I tend to get a lot of women that fall in love with me. I’ve been with so many women too. But I’ve never loved any of them. Not a single one. I don’t even feel attachments to objects. I feel as if everything is replaceable even people. I don’t even know where I’m going with this anymore all I know is that I have an inability to love people and things. I really need help because I want to be normal.,28Aug2020,1
881,"Is there anyone who on here who is going through this? I started taking it in March because my ADHD is still so severe, even as a 24 year old woman, and I swore I’d try everything before Adderall and well... I did so here I am. It’s so unfortunate because it works EXTREMELY well for my concentration and what not. It’s so nice actually having my brain organized! People actually thought I was drinking all the time because of how talkative I am now, but it’s because I can finally get what I want to say out of my mouth and actually sound... coherent! Lmao. Most of the side effects are good ones! I am back to being bubbly, I’m finally organized, and actually I function lol... but the worst thing is the uncontrollable urge to gnaw at the insides of my cheeks and rub my tongue against my bottom row of teeth when I have a permanent retainer down there! It gets to a point where it feels like I’m rubbing my tongue on a knife or the pointy parts of keys! It’s gotten to the point where I don’t notice it until I notice it, ya know? And because I noticed it I do it more! I nibble on the inside of my cheeks and the very very sides of my tongue and they look and feel awful. Like a damn road full of pot holes!! Also, no I do not take too much! It’s so annoying realizing after however the hell long I’ve been sitting around with my cheeks sucked into my teeth biting down hard! It feels soooo nasty too if I stick my tongue out I can feel the ridges run against my mouth BLEEHHHH. Have any of you have experienced anything like this with Adderall??

882," This was literally just an hour ago almost so I am still very much in shocked and scared about what dealing with this will even me. Any and all advice is welcome, thank you.

I came home from work and my nephew who is very much on the spectrum babysitted for me. He does this often. I am not 100% sure if it is diagnosed as Aspergers or not, as I heard different family members say yes it is, and some saying no. But for sure he is on the spectrum.

He is high functioning. Super smart. He has never ever been shown to cause harm to anyone, in fact the opposite, he is very compassionate and caring.

But when I came home today, I walked in on him on top of my daughter, rubbing his erect penis on her private parts. I literally just dropped my bags, he turned around and got up and grabbed his pants, I told him he needed to go home right now, and he did.

I am at a loss of what to do. How to handle this.",28Aug2020,1
883,"Hi reddit this is a long one but I'll try be as concise as possible. 

Before quarantine I was supposed to have my sons birthday in London (currently i reside in Manchester) this was because it would alot easier for parents and friends to attend ( also my mum does hall decorations and has alot of connections) , my girlfriend looked for a venue as she had a specific time in mind to finish. She found a hall and had it booked ,but it was abit far away from where my family stay about 1hr. My parents then offered ( which I decline at first, but after some convincing said ok) the only condition was that the hall finishes pass 1am, I felt this was fair as it was my girlfriends sons 1st bday.

My parents only started looking for the hall 3 months before the party this was only because I put pressure on them. In the end they struggled to keep the 1 condition that we had and the other hall we had, we had then lost that day. My mother also said that we should be grateful that we are getting a hall and if we aren't happy with what she has we should start looking ourselves again. After starting all over again we couldn't find anywhere in London so we decided to move the party to Manchester where we live and my girlfriends mother said she would pay for the hall decoration and the cake to help us out. 

Important note I got annoyed that my parents (mainly my mum) were acting up so i stopped picking up there calls and communicating about the decisions I made. After a few days my dad called and I told him the party is now In Manchester 

My girlfriend messaged my sister in law ( my brothers girlfriend ) telling her that the party was now gonna be in Manchester, my sister in law had told my girlfriend that my mum wasnt happy and has been going around saying the following 

1. That it's ridiculous because we are now paying for things she would of done for free
2.her mum is only trying to buy her love that’s why she’s paying ( girlfriends mum lives abroad )
3.saying how my girl is getting more benefits than she should 
4.she doesn't like the fact my son wears African beeds (yes I'm African too btw)
5. that my girlfriend is only using me for money .... this being because I'm in abit of debt and my parents saw the papers 

My sister in law asked my girlfriend not to tell my mum and my girlfriend said she won’t tell my mum but she’ll speak to me about it and she did. 

I obviously was annoyed because it had gotten around so after a few days I called my mum and we had a heated conversation, with me telling her not to speak on what she doesn't know, and her saying since I want to be part of someone else's family so bad i should go. Threats of a slap (which is light) but her main concern was who told me etc and that I'm just dumb. Now I can admit that I was wrong for not communicating but I feel like she crossed the line.

Since that conversation I haven't spoken to my mum and she hasn't spoken to my son didn't wish him happy birthday etc but I'm due to go back home and wanted some advice on how to approach this conversation that needs to happen 


TL;DR . mother said some out of order things about my girlfriend which got back to me and lead to a heated conversation. Haven't talked since and was wondering how to approach this situation",28Aug2020,1

885,"So theres theres this girl i had a crush on for almost 2 years now. She was in the same class as i am and never really had to that much with my, because we had differnet friend groups. So anyway, i got to talk to her on and off when i walked home and through a buddy of mine, who was her childhood friend. We became friends as the time went on and we got more mature. Now that girls werent as gross anymore, talking to girls wasnt that big of a deal now and the whole class got to do more with each other. She still had her own bubble and i had mine, but from time to time she would just come over to hang with us a bit. We always were that weird group of kids that wasnt that social. Suddenly she came over much more frequent and started to talk me much more often and made me some sort of the highlight of visiting or kind of group. This was so bizarre to me, because i was the quiet weird kid with self-esteem problems and an always depressed kind of look. So this sudden attention to me really got me racing, because i never had a relationship or anything in this direction. Not even confessions or anything. After some time then, becoming closer to being good friends and usual to hang around together, I kinda caught feelings and got a lot more confident around her, being able to make jokes and stuff. Walking home gave me the time to think about, what just happened the last 6hrs and so my little dreamy mind intensefied the feeling towards her. Now being in a happy state of mind after 6yrs being depressed gave me a rush of confidence, so I have done a stupid thing on the last day of school before summer vacation. I didnt even know if she really liked me or just saw me as a friend or me just being too quick. Anyways, i thought that i could just text her a long-ass cringey text about me feelings towards her and thought i wouldnt have anything to loose, because i didnt see her for the next 6 weeks. Then she friendzone me and everything we had or might not had fell apart and avoided weird conversations for a whole year, to the part I heard rumors, that she told it a few people. Some stuff with a friend of mine happend, but i wanna get finished and get to the point. Now im sitting here, thinking i should be long over her, but i still havent. Everytime i look at her, i get excited and cant help myself get attracted to her innocent appearence and her overall happy attitude that blacks out my miserable self. Maybe i was the problem or she just really had no interest in me, but i cant move on, i feel like. Any advice?

889,"Here’s the story of how I lost my virginity, and nearly 10 years later am being accused of having raped her. 

Just a bit of background: I lost my virginity to my best friend when I was 17. We had been friends since we were 9 years old, and she lived two houses away from me. We’ll call her Liza. When we were first friends I used to bully her with another one of our friends. I have felt tremendous guilt over this and throughout our lifelong friendship regularly reminded her how sorry I am and that I know I can’t take back what I did but that I can only try to make up for it. I was mean, and it was not right. We had remained friends for years since despite this in a close but very rocky friendship.

One night when we were 17 we were drinking in my parents basement when Liza goes to the bathroom. All of a sudden I get a text from one of her best friends asking me ‘why is Liza crying saying you won’t kiss her?’ I was shocked, and confused. When Liza got out of the bathroom I questioned her about it. To be honest I never thought about Liza that way, and didn’t know she was trying to come onto me (I came out as gay about a year after this). She awkwardly laughed it off, and shortly after she headed home. 

A couple hours later we start texting each other about how we are both virgins, and that maybe we should have sex and get this whole virginity thing out of the way. I snuck out of my house, she let me into her house through the basement, and we had sex. Awkward, consensual, teenage sex. A few days later we hooked up again though this time without any penis penetration because she was on her period. I was really weirded out and confused after this. I didn’t talk to her for weeks. I was a closeted gay guy and couldn’t fathom that I just had sex with my best friend. She really took it hard that I stopped talking to her. 

We ended up reconciling and grew even closer as friends after that before parting ways for a couple of years as we headed off to college. We both came out to each other, I realized I was into guys and she realized she was into girls. After college we moved back to our hometown for a couple of years where our friendship continued to blossom. I loved her like a sister, and felt very protective of her. We ended up moving our separate ways last year, but remained close and would speak almost every day. This all lasted until earlier this year we had a falling out over something so trivial. 

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, my father passed away. I am currently 26 years old, and lost my biggest supporter and best friend. Needless to say I am taking it pretty hard. While Liza sent my family a condolence card, she had not texted me to check in and see how I am doing. This has caused me a lot of pain as someone who I thought I could always rely on was not there for me in my darkest time. Yesterday I reached out to her and thanked her for the card, but called her out on not checking in on me. I am extremely fragile at this time, maybe I shouldn’t have called her out like that but it is really how I felt. I told her had the situation been reversed, that I would be there for her no question. 

She texted me back some hours later accusing me of having raped her when we were teens, and that she endured my constant abuse for 16 years (as long as we had been friends). She then blocked me so I couldn’t even respond. I am so confused, we have often laughed and been open with others about our story of taking each others virginities. It was consensual and she even came on to me first, yet somehow almost ten years later in my darkest time she drags me through the mud and accuses me of abuse and rape. I reached out to some of our old mutual friends about it and they are in shock as well. I can’t even get any clarity on how I abused her out entire friendship, though I acknowledge my bullying when we were kids. I am the fourth guy (that I know of) she has now accused of raping her. 

I feel awful, I am so angry with her yet feel so guilty if she truly thinks I raped her. This on top of my dad dying has been beyond overwhelming. I am hurting so much. I dont have many friends and feel she really poured salt in my already gaping wound. I am a good person. I have always thought of rapists as evil, yet here I am being accused of rape. It’s very heavy, and I don’t understand why she waited until now to confront me about it if she truly feels that way.",28Aug2020,2
890,"I haven't actively crushed on someone since I was a kid. I spent most of my adolescent years suppressing any feelings of romantic interest in others due to low self-esteem (believing they might find me creepy or be made uncomfortable by my attention etc.) Now I'm in a healthier head space in terms of my self confidence but I'm still unable to allow myself these feelings. Whenever I'm presented with a romantic opportunity or others telling me their tales of love I'm unable to see anything but the potential negatives of becoming that emotionally vulnerable. I can't understand what possible positives romantic love might have because I haven't ever experienced it and have no way of relating to others descriptions of it.

This would be fine and dandy if I was aromatic but the older I get the more I find myself becoming lonely and envious of others that have breached the threshold into this hidden land. Is there a way to become more okay with emotional vulnerability? (without therapy that is)

891,So 3 months ago my ex girlfriend broke up with me and it was pretty out of a sudden for because for me it was a happy relationship. She told me she simply lost her feelings for me and found it wrong to continue a relationship without the right feelings. I’ve never insulted her afterwards so i thought I was acting fair. At the time I felt like it was just easy for her and it doesn’t matter hard for her feelings. So I wrote a few texts in which I tried to make it hard for her to get some sort of reaction which I missed before. But lately I realised how difficult it have must been for her and that she acted appropriately. So my text could’ve really hurt... we hadn’t have any contact in a while.

I definitely do not prefer online classes compared to physical. Here are a few reasons why I would prefer to work than do online school:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Online classes require a much higher amount of self discipline / attention. This is something that can be worked on but I already have tried  this with online classes in the past and failed ( see below ).
2. I've taken/signed up for online classes before and was underperforming ( to my standards ) in all of them. When classes switched last semester to online I started missing assignments and handing them in late, which I never did before. I only maintained an A because I was doing very good pre-switch.
3. Online classes mean I will be home ALL DAY. I was looking forward to staying in school or around the neighborhood to avoid being at my place, which is never alone because I ALWAYS have family here. \*\*I also do not have my own room, meaning I never have alone time\*\*. I legitimetly start feeling like I'm going crazy being home all the time which is why I was looking forward to classes,

898,"Currently I live with my fiancé and his family. Living with my own mother is unviable bc she decreases my mental health drastically; she is an alcoholic and even living away from her is hard but living with her is 10x worse. 

My pets, however, had to stay with her as my future MIL is severely allergic to dogs and cats. I have two dogs and a cat. 

My mother has caused one dog (normally 45-50lbs) to gain 20lbs and the other (normally 15-22lbs) to gain 10lbs. My cat has gained four pounds, which sounds insignificant but she is a v small cat (normally 6-7.5). On top of that, my bigger dogs’ already present health issues have been exacerbated. 

Other health issues being exacerbated aside: today he began sneezing blood. At least, that’s what my mom told me. Anyone’s guess as to how long it’s been. I’m in school so I can only visit on weekends and I do every weekend. Sunday he was fine. She didn’t call me til today and was joking around with me until she said “oh yeah big boy is sneezing and coughing and there’s blood.”

He’s been on meds for a while for his other health issues and idk if they’re causing it or other things, but she was so casual and all laughs about it. I’m crying. He’s in the vets rn (can’t go in with him bc COVID) and I have no clue if he’s okay. He’s my baby. I will be devastated if I lose him. 

My options are to move home with mom, which will be detrimental to both mine and my fiancé’s mental health but will save my dogs potentially, or to have the dogs at his family’s health at the detriment of his mothers health (her allergies are SEVERE and idk if she’d even allow it, doubtful though) or to give my beloved baby away to someone I trust (which idk if I even trust anyone enough to do that.)

Even typing the thought of giving him away kills me. I’m crying again. I don’t know what to do and neither does my fiancé. We’re at a loss.

910,"In defence of PC:

 All of my friends are going to get the PS5 but most games like CoD and Minecraft are featuring cross play between platforms.

It’s better spec wise in the long run since the PS5 will eventually be outdated spec wise and struggle to run new games while i could keep upgrading to match it.

Technically more games with an infinite amount of Indie games, with them staying or just coming to PC first.

More things to do, I could play games, watch videos/movies/TV shows, photoshop, video edit, etc.

Mods.

I’ll be able to play Xbox’s exclusives like Halo or Gears of War

Keyboard &gt; Controller

Backwards compatibility with games from the 80’s available 

Variable resolutions and refresh rates.



In defence of PS5:

I’m a big fan of Sony’s exclusives including Spider-Man and Ratchet and Clank which I know i won’t be able to play on PC.

The SSD is way faster with it being 9,000GB/S while an NVMe m.2 is 2,600GB/s.

I currently own a PS4 and I’d need to keep it if i got a PC to still play my old games

Games are better optimized for console meaning in the long run i won’t need to upgrade for a long time

The controller is incredibly impressive with tons of features I’ll never get on PC

Consoles are arguably safer from hackers and viruses.

Backwards compatibility with PS4 (We don’t know if there will be PS, PS2 or PS3 compatibility)

I prefer physical media and discs over just a digital file any day

911,"I've been with my BF for 2 years and his mom has always been very welcoming to me- makes a big effort, buys me presents, invites me to family events etc. About a year ago, she started making passive aggressive comments when I'm around like ""it's great the way Amy texts/calls her mom when she's away"", ""it's great the way Amy watches movies/goes hiking with her family"" etc. It's not the fairest comparison when I don't work at the minute, if I wasn't close with my family I'd be so bored!! This started because his mom has worked from 9am-5/6pm for the last year  and my BF works 3pm-10pm. By the time he gets home from work, she is usually in bed. He is never up before 9/10 am so he doesn't see her before work either.  He works 5 days a week, when he is off he stays at mine (we live an hour apart) or I stay at his for 2 nights. 

She claims he only has room in his life for me and my family (he gets along super well with mine and comes up to mine more than I come to theirs.  Tonight after ignoring him for 2 days, she said she is jealous of me and my family for getting his attention.  When he comes to mine, she won't text him unless he texts her first and gets mad if he doesn't. She makes him the scapegoat a lot, because his violent and downright abusive 17 year old brother has 100k subscribers on YouTube and has autism. This brother spits on my BF or chases him with a knife/hammer if he so much as talks back after the brother insults him. He never leaves his room and shouts ""fuck off!"" if you come near his room to offer food and plays games at full volume into the night, but somehow has a social life and a free pass? My BF called him ""piggy"" for hiding sweets I bought him and that's why she won't talk to my BF? Also she complained I should stay at theirs more cos he stays at mine 2/3 of the time. When Im down there she complains that we spend too much time in his bedroom (litreally if we spend more than 20 mins up there, no joke) and his younger brother complains if Im in the living room/kitchen and won't go in until Im gone? What should I do? I don't wanna visit if I cause this many problems?",28Aug2020,1

913,"(I've tried posting this on other subreddits like r/autism but no one saw them. This is something I would really like to get people's toughs about so I'm trying my luck again with other subreddits)

Twisties chips

Regular Potato chips 

French fires / hot chips

Potato wedges 

Dim Sim skins (I hate the inside!)

Fairy floss (cotton candy)

Notice something? No fruit. No vegetables. No red meat. A friend told me I'd die young if I continued like this. She's right and I think I've come to accept that. But that shouldn't be the case!

 I can only describe this as a mental barrier. I know there's nothing wrong with the food I'm scared to eat and the sight and smell of plenty of food has my mouth watering  yet I feel such a large amount of disgust and fear when I'm offered to try or even think about putting these foods near my mouth. 

I'm in my 20's and I'm still too scared to take a bite from an apple. (despite admittedly not completely disliking apple juice.)
I've come to terms with the fact that I'm too weak to break whatever mental barrier is stopping me from overcoming this fear. So I've told my mum that I want to see a hypnotherapist. Here's the thing. I WANT to be able to eat so many different foods without feeling scared and I feel like hypnotherapy would be my last shot at getting that to happen. My mum suggested we wait till the next time we see my paediatrician but with Covid that won't be happening any time soon. In fact I think she's forgotten about it.

When it comes to eating at restaurants I only ever get hot chips or wedges. Wait, didn't I list chicken schnitzel as one of the foods I like to eat. Yeah....but this woman in her 20's doesn't trust anyone but her mum to make it right for her. Funny right?

And what if they don't serve hot chips or wedges? I don't get anything. I either get McDonald's before or after we're about to go home. My dad enjoyed taking us to a Chinese restaurant and the food always smelled and looked so good. And yet there I was with not even a plate. Just sipping a can of coke. I'm an embarrassment. My dad has  made sure to admit that to me. And he's not wrong.

In primary school we would cook once a week in the school kitchen. Set up everything nice and have a big before lunchtime lunch. And of corse. I was the only one who didn't touch anything. People asked. Teachers by then were used to my behaviour. But I always felt stared at and wrong.

I loved cooking but I dreaded eating time. One time I wrote a story where someone had chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast. They sounded so yummy so of corse I wanted my character to have them. And my teacher put them down as the next thing we would cook because she hoped I would finally be able to eat something with everyone else. I felt so sad and disappointed in myself. I really liked this teacher. She was so nice. I don't think I wanted to cry at the time because if I had I would have. I bring that up because as I remembered this I started getting all teary-eyed. It really was such a sweet thing for her to do. There was vanilla ice cream tho. So in a way she did get me to eat something and join in with everyone !

Oh and here's one last story. You know how bread and butter is at the top of my list? Well it's always gotta be a specific brand of bread and butter or I won't eat it. Somehow my body knows the difference. My mouth can feel the difference. There was a while where my mum tried to use another brand of bread and pretend like it was the brand I liked but I could tell. Eating it felt wrong and made me sick. I guess we just keep the butter consistent to be safe.Truth be told I don't know when this picky mess with my bread started because I never had a problem before. The only issue I'd have is if it weren't white bread. But then one day it was like my body just latched onto a single bread brand and that was it. (Same thing kinda goes with the bread rolls as well but I think that might just be a preference)

I've of corse talked to people in real life about this and the only thing we have left to say is ""well it's because of your autism."" A part of me wishes that my parents had tried harder to make me eat more when I was little. To stop this before it became this bad. But in truth I have no memory of when my fussy eating started so I have no idea if they did try anything or not and I just realised I'm too scared to ask now. 

So its the internets turn. I've gotten this all off my chest and now...now we'll see. Maybe I'll see a comment that will make something click and help me overcome this. Just immediately make me realise ""wow I was so stupid! Why didn't I think of this? it was that easy!""

But for now I don't seem to have any health problems. My blood tests come back fine and I'm apparently healthy. (enough anyway) So I'm gonna wait till i can see my paediatrician again and suggest the hypnotherapy. Them we'll see what happens next.",28Aug2020,1
914,"So, in my senior year of high school, there was this teacher who made every class miserable for me. If you want more context, here's my r/badteachers post about it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/badteachers/comments/ihant2/over\_a\_year\_ago\_a\_teacher\_spent\_a\_year\_yelling\_at/](https://www.reddit.com/r/badteachers/comments/ihant2/over_a_year_ago_a_teacher_spent_a_year_yelling_at/) 

It's been over a year since I've graduated and I have been considering emailing her and telling her how miserable she made my last year of high school.  She can't grade me anymore or tell on me to the high school principal since I'm not in high school anymore. I've been weighing the pros and cons and I'm unsure if I should do it. Would it be a good idea to email this teacher and tell her how miserable she made me?",28Aug2020,1
915,"Very recently, my mother and father divorced. My mother was seeing another man. Although, that wasn’t the only reason. Their relationship had been in shambles for over 20 years. It started rocky and ended rocky. The final straw was the infidelity. Both of them are to blame. My mother and father both did awful things to each other. Their arguments would be terrible and neither one of them are the victims. 

My father’s side of the family, understandably, doesn’t like my mother. But recently they’ve started to say horrible things about my mom. My mom continued to see this man which at first I had a problem with, but I have come to terms with it. I haven’t forgiven her, but I still love her and our relationship is fine. I didn’t like the man at first, but he has been excited to meet me and he feels guilty and horrible so I’m willing to give him a chance. 

My mother, due to COVID, needed extra money too and invited an old friend of her’s to room with her while my siblings and I are staying with family a few states over for the summer. (We got stuck after one of us came down with COVID, but were heading home soon and the roommate is leaving too)

Now, I’m very interested in Wicca. My mother’s roommate’s brother has been a witch for over 30 years and he knows a lot about it so obviously I was over the moon. (I don’t like the roommate much either because of past issues with him, but he has worked on himself so I also wanted to give him a chance) 

When my mother told me about that, I was excited and told my aunt, uncle, and grandmother about it. It didn’t go well and the proceeded to throw insults about the roommate due to his past addiction problem and told me things he did in the past. Not even to me or anyone else, but to himself. I was crushed because 1. My family immediately got upset. I know they were looking out for me, but still. And 2. I learned horrible things I shouldn’t have.

Later I told my aunt and uncle that I was willing to give the boyfriend a chance and again, they looked upset and kinda brushed it off. I understood and didn’t say anything. 

I also told my grandmother that I wanted to give the roommate and the boyfriend a chance and I was told that it wasn’t a good idea and she told me another story about the roommate and my mother. (nothing romantic or sexual, but there was a drunken argument that almost lead to violence) I was horrified and it painted an awful picture of my mother to me and now I want nothing to do with the roommate which I feel guilty about.

My whole trip I’ve heard jabs and petty insults about my mother from my father’s side. My mother’s side of the family have not said one thing about the divorce or my father.

I don’t know what to do. I feel so miserable when I think about the future. I can’t even tell my aunt exciting things unless I don’t mention the boyfriend or roommate. I’ve started to refer to them as work friends which has made it better but I hate how I can’t just talk to them. How do I get them to stop? I’m worried about the affect it’ll have on my little sister.",28Aug2020,1

917,"My wife is currently pregnant. During her scan at 22 weeks, the doctor talked to her about her anxiety, and asked when it started. My wife said it started 6 years ago during an abusive relationship with her ex. Then the doctor asked if her ex was still her partner, my wife responded “no, I’m married to someone else and very happy”.  
Flash forward to yesterday (now 24 weeks pregnant) when the midwife questions the fact that it says my wife has an abusive partner.  
We are now concerned that even though my wife has clarified this is not the case, and asked the midwife to amend the notes, that this may result in the involvement of social services when baby comes along.  
My wife has been stressing about this all day - obviously not the best thing to do when pregnant, and we’re not sure what to do.

918,"So I'll say this first: yes it's probably bullshit It probably doesn't mean anything and I should probably get over it. Buuuuuuut there's always that small chance... So I (23M) am currently engaged (21F) and we've been together almost 3 years. We applied for our first apartment about 2 hours north of where I live ( because that's where she lives) we haven't been accepted yet but the landlord said we were first In line and the apartment was available on September 11th (today is August 28th) We have had tons of issues. Mostly her attitude and her picking fights and never admitting she's wrong. If she does, its followed by attitude and why my always wrong behavior justifies her overreacting. It's not always bad we have alot of good moments but she picks alot of stupid fights and over reacts and makes everything my fault. Anyway, I have this co worker (22F) who just broke up wit her boyfriend. Before that happened they were having lots of relationship issues and she was venting to me about it and I did the same about mine to her. She said if her relationship failed, she had a job lined up in New York and I said i missed New York and loved it there and would love to go back since my family is from there.  She also talked to me about some of her depression issues and told me she almost committed suicide during her weekend. We both talked about leaving the job were at and finding somewhere else since we're both pretty sick of all the same shit. Well anyways, 3 cases where I got a type of feeling or... Sign from my own mind. I had 2 dreams about her back to back, night after night. One wasn't overly sexual, then the next one was. A month before, I smoked alot of weed and was pretty stoned... I was high as a kite laying down staring at my ceiling while day dreaming. In this day dream I was listening to Juicy by Notorious B.I.G while driving at night, it was raining and I had the window rolled down a little bit. While driving I was singing along to the song while awkward white boy dancing just to be goofy. I looked over in the passenger seat and it was my co worker looking at me and laughing at me being goofy. I looked back up and realized that this day dream was in new York.  I don't know if I'm just being a fuckboy or what but I've confused myself. I'm nervous to bring anything up to her about it because I don't want to ruin the trust we have and don't want to make things awkward...",28Aug2020,1
919,"A few months ago, I broke up with my then bf and decided to just stay friends. At the time, I was compeletely honest about wanting to be friends. But you know the saying that love blinds you. After awhile I started to realize I don’t really want to be friends with him. Usually, Ill be friends with almost anyone but here are a few issues I was seeing:

- He doesnt really have much in common with me. He goes to the same school and thats about it. 

- He doesn’t have his own interests different from mine either. He seems to just be on social media all the time. This makes it near impossible to have a conversation.

- Hes constantly depressed and that makes up a big chunk of our conversations. I knew this before but im only realizing its problematic rn. I have nothing against depressed people but its just too much for me. I have explained this very issue to him but it didnt seem to help much.

Ive known him for over a year now, and dated him for like eight months. I think its common courtesy to offer him an explanation but I dont want to be insulting.

924,"Long story short, last night one of my friends said that he’d attempted suicide multiple times. We had a brief heart to heart, but went back to our usual dynamic of joking around before I we both had to go home for the night. 

When I got in my car I just drove around for a while and cried. I had no idea that he’d ever felt like that, he’s one of the most upbeat people in my friend group and I wouldn’t have been able to handle it if he had succeeded. I almost got to that point last year as well, but right now I’m the happiest I’ve ever been.

925,"I’m a dog bather at a pet shop. They have sort of an internship program where they send bathers to become professional stylists. 

The program is very much used as blackmails of sorts though. If you arrive late, miss a shift, do something that pisses off someone, they threaten you with not sending you. 

3 months after hiring me they were going to test me (which I had no doubt Id pass) and the same they asked me to come in for a full shift instead of my half shift. I had been throwing up all night and had a fever, so I told my boss the only reason I hadn’t called in sick was because I wanted to take the test, which I felt confident in passing even though I was sick. 

My boss told me that if I can’t do a full shift then I can’t do the test either and postponed it. I repeated myself saying the test was the only reason that I hadn’t called in sick so if I didn’t have the test anymore I would have to call in. 

My boss said I lacked commitment and canceled my test indefinitely. I was heartbroken. I told a groomer in confidence that maybe I shouldn’t go to the program if they were going to use it against me like that. The groomer told my boss’ boss.

Months later they hired a new bather since we had a spot open and right away she started shit talking me to everyone saying she’d go before me. Everyone dislikes her and told her I’d go first because I’ve been there longer. Even my boss. 

The new bather threw a shit fit and went to my boss’ boss, no idea what she said but my boss told me she really pushed for me but in the end her boss made the decision to send her first. 

I went to talk with my boss’ boss but she said that because of my “hot and cold-ness about the program they wanted to see if I actually wanted to go and would send me for sure... in a very very long time”


Cue COVID. Everyone was off work for 5 months. My boss’ boss quit and it’s a different person now, someone who seems much more nicer. The new bather is still disliked by everyone, is doing a really bad job with the dogs and is incredibly rude with customers. I asked my boss the chances of going before her and she told me they’re very high as the other bather not ready yet. 

The program though has been suspended due to covid so basically I’m holding on to see if they do want to send me. I don’t know what to do. I LOVE this job and even though it’s a shitty process, it’s the fastest, cheapest way of becoming a dog groomer.",28Aug2020,1
927,"So a friend of mine from middle school, we keep in touch like how you do with childhood friends on Facebook, but not really any closer than that. 

She became a realtor sometime back and made it her signature thing to bake cookies for each closing. The issue is, she posts it to Facebook as a sort of advertising, but a good portion of them spell out these people’s addresses (like 500 Linden Avenue, or whatever). And they’re accessible to all friends of each party. 

Now I have minor bona fides in the security/military realm, but would not consider myself any expert on personal security. This SEEMS dangerous, right? It seems compounded - perhaps my own biases - when many of these people have kids or are single women. I dunno, I want to approach this in a way, if I do choose to speak to her, that shows my honest-to-goodness intent, but I also don’t want to seem like a prick.

939,"I work at a job where I interact with a lot of people of varying backgrounds (race, religions, political ideologies, and socioeconomically status). Before I entered this field, I already was a pretty reserved person. I get along well with everybody but don't really let anyone in partly through some childhood stuff. I have friends and colleagues but I don't really reach out to hang out or check in. I still do stuff (i.e. grab lunch or play online games with people once a week or so) but I kind of come to terms that I'm just a solitary person. 

But since starting this field, it's kind of been exacerbated. People lie all of the time to try to get stuff out of me (I don't want to get into specifics but i'm in a position where people want me to sign off on stuff for them). I naturally don't have much faith in people in general but it's gotten to a point where when I see any stranger, I just don't expect them to be a good person at all. I don't think this is a good thing. But all of my experiences from work and volunteer (which I do as a hobby) tell me otherwise. I don't want to become a person that just hates others but I feel that a few years down the line I will be. What can I do?",28Aug2020,1

[I love to decorate my house like this](https://luxuries-eco-lights.myshopify.com/products/rgb-led-strip), and I like the idea of shopping at a non-big-box retailer. But before I buy, does anyone have advice for actually mount such a strip?

Can I test speakers at Walmart or somewhere?

943,"I am Eastern European and the best friend is from an Islamic, Central Asian country. We have been friends for ten years and have (or had) a very supportive and symbiotic friendship. As you can probably imagine, we have a lot of fond memories together but I think we have reached the point where we now must grow apart.

Before I get into the core of the story, I will explain that a month ago our friendship developed into a romance, which he eventually stopped as he would never be able to marry me (due to my nationality and religion). He explained that our friendship was worth more than 1-2 years of dating and he didn’t want to waste our time. I saw this as fair, we decided to stop seeing each other so that our feelings would pass and we could (hopefully) become friends in the future. Admittedly, I was not very convinced by this as he’s had feelings for me for a year now and this made me question the foundations of our friendship (I.e. is he doing nice things for me out of romantic love or is he really just that much of a good friend to me?). But, whatever.

So yeah, at this point we’re not friends but we’ve been speaking more and more, and I find out that he is now seeing a girl from the same country/religion as him, who he really likes. I was shocked but only because he hasn’t really dated before - but not jealous or angry at him in any way. I was dating other people at this point too. He keeps it short and says that she’s nice but it’s still early days and we switch conversation.

A few days later, I upload photographs from a friends gathering (in the last slide, he is by the grill and in some group photos with our friends) which he quickly asks me to take down in case the girls brother, who he follows on Instagram, sees. Apparently he is already suspicious of our friendship from stalking my profile. My friend did not tell him the truth and wanted me to delete traces of our friendship from social media to get in her family’s good books.

He also deleted all my comments from his profile and his likes on my photos. This infuriated me because I felt like a dirty secret, the part of his undercover life that he is ashamed of, and above all, it made me realise that our fun and wacky experiences and occasional partying were just an adventure he undertook before starting a traditional life and family.

I decided to cut him off because, even as a friend, I will never be fully integrated in his life. He knows my entire family, all my friends and can go anywhere with me. He wouldn’t even go into restaurants with me to dine in, in case his parents friends or someone from his community saw him with a white woman.

I decided to cut him out because I know this is just the beginning of many incidents to come and I don’t want to be in a friendship where I feel hidden in anymore. The same thing could happen 18 months, where I’m not invited to his wedding, where he is no longer allowed to meet me. I told him that it’s best that we end our friendship here and to remove all my family and friends from his following because I have given him too much access.

I guess I am asking for advice, if I am acting reasonably, and if you would do the same.

We are no longer talking and I feel okay about it. Sorry for the long post and thank you for reading.

TL;DR I cut my best friend off because we seen fundamentally incompatible culturally. Wat do",28Aug2020,2
944,"There's been a few things that have concerned me recently about their relationship and if you want the full backstory I have an earlier post on the Relationship Advice page that goes in depth. The gist of it is that I remarried about 4 and a half years ago to a man with a now 25 year old son. Him and my daughter have always been close but I've had a few worries about how their relationship has developed recently. She's very physical with him and while I haven't seen anything that's strictly inappropriate go on between them I am worried about the potential being there.

I'm a bit reassured by most of the responses I received in my earlier post but I do need to sit down with my daughter and talk to her about what is appropriate and what isn't appropriate both in regards to her relationship with him and his with her as well as any other relationships with adults in her life.

Anyone gone through something like this before?",28Aug2020,1
945,"This is a throwaway because he stalks my main reddit. 

There’s this guy I’m friends with, I’m 20 and he’s 28, which isn’t a crazy age gap, but it’s significant at this age. He’s nice, we used to just play video games together and I was ok with that, but over the course of our friendship he’s gotten a little strange, scary even.

I’d given this guy my mailing info a while back because he got me a birthday present, and like the stupid naive child I am I didn’t think twice about it. We live in the same state, he might as well be a distant neighbor, nothing to worry about, right? That’s what I told myself to rationalize it anyway. I was scared of saying no, so I made yes make sense. I still feel so stupid because of it.

This guy has started sending me more and more gifts, he keeps telling me how beautiful and funny and sweet and smart I am over and over, and joking about “our future kids” and how my siblings and parents are going to be his “in-laws” someday. He’s also made a lot of jokes about my sexuality in particular, as well as making assumptions about it that are unfair. I don’t want to specify because they’re pretty vulgar.

Just for clarification, I have some past traumas with relationships, I’ve been sexually assaulted multiple times and verbally abused and manipulated, I’ve only had two boyfriends but it’s enough that I’m taking an extremely long break from relationships. He knows that, and yet he still keeps trying to “buy” me.

He’s starting to make me extremely uncomfortable and scared. I’ve told him I don’t want a relationship because of my trauma, and he’s been “understanding” I guess, but he also slips in a little “but you should at least give me a chance to prove myself” every now and then.

He doesn’t know I’m 20, to be fair. I assume he thinks I’m 24 or 25 because he asks me about my favorite alcoholic beverages a lot or if I’ve ever wanted kids. He’s gotten really intense lately, talking to me like we’re dating and expecting me to feel the same no matter how many times I remind him I don’t want a relationship.

I’m not attracted to him at all. Not in the slightest. He really isn’t my type, romantically anyway, but he’s been a good friend and I don’t have a solid reason to be afraid of him, I can’t tell if it’s something he’s doing or if I’m just letting my past get in the way of our friendship. Is this normal behavior for people who like someone? To just spend loads of money on them no matter how many times they demand you stop?

The idea of being in a relationship with him, or anyone really, gives me severe anxiety. He just isn’t getting the hint, and I can’t just block him either because he knows where I live. I fucked up, and now I’m terrified...

I’m coming here hoping someone who’s been through the same thing has advice on what I should do next. If this isn’t relevant, I’ll accept my fate and let the mods or bots take this down. TIA",28Aug2020,1

As anyone who's worked in retail can tell you, it sucks. Recently our assistant manager left and he was very could at running everything. Our staff pool is limited to almost entirely to people with drug/alcohol problems as there is no one else applying for a job here.

I hate it here so much, I dread every day but if I quit especially in the current state of the world I'm not sure if I could get another job.

952,"Hello Reddit, 

I am a 20-year-old lesbian college student. I have a very complicated situation. I got very close to one of my female professors  (she is 30 years older than me) and we became very good friends. Eventually, I grew feelings for her. She then confessed to me that she also had feelings and our romance soon began. 

I was always under the impression that my lover would leave her husband. I thought she didn't love him. Why else would she cheat on him? Also, she told me she never felt guilty while being with me. But, when I kept pressing the question on when she will tell her husband and when we can be together in public she kept silent. Then she confessed to me that ""I love the both of you."" 

Remember I'm 20 years old. I'm not wise at all. I guess I should've known that a woman twice my age would never want to actually be with a broke college student. Her husband was rich, she had a family, and she actually did love the man she married (even if it wasn't the passionate love she had with me).

But even with this knowledge, I stayed with her because I thought that this was as good as love gets for me. I live in a very homophobic household. I'm used to being a secret. I thought that I wasn't worth being anyone's real partner because I was just some dyke who should just simply be happy that I had someone to have romantic relations with. 

I began to self-harm constantly. I banged my head with my hands often when I felt sad. I was losing my mind. I didn't realize this relationship would have such a toll on me. One day at my lover's house, I had a breakdown. I could see her husband everywhere. I saw his pictures, his clothes, his books, his towels. This was his house. And I was an invader. I didn't belong there. I started to scream hysterically. I ran into his walk-in closet and started throwing out all his clothes and shoes. But my lover grabbed me and threatened to call the police on me if I didn't stop. 

This all happened recently. I realized that I'll just go crazier the more I stay with her. I'm trying to put my foot down and say I need to love myself and see that I am more worthy. However, I still slip back into old habits and find myself texting her sometimes. Because I loved that woman with all my heart. And, I know she loved me back in her own selfish ways (my love may have been selfish too). 

My head still hurts from all the self-harm. I'm seeking therapy. I lost some of my precious youth with someone I thought would always do what's best for me. My lover is still married. She still has her job as a professor at my University. She still has her family. She doesn't have any bruises on her head. She had 0 consequences for what she did to me. 

I am not very good at standing up for myself. Should I tell my University what happened? Should I tell her husband what happened? 

I actually have tried to contact her husband on Facebook once but I think I got blocked. I don't think anyone will believe me. And Idk if I'm just looking for revenge. I just feel like I dealt with so much pain for our sins. And she left with good memories. 

What should I do?",28Aug2020,1
953,"So I went to a neurologist a little over a year ago, he flirted with me a lot but I never really reciprocated. He texts me often and I don't really often respond. Now he texted me again and I mentioned that I'm really stressed rn because I'm behind on rent with 200 and a friend trashed my place when I let her stay there for a month. 
He then said he's always got work for me if needed (he proposed me a studentjob a year ago already) and then said ""don't worry, we'll take care of it"" I said ""thanks that's sweet :)"" because I didn't really wanna go into it so responded a bit vague. 

NOW *THE* MESSAGE
He messaged me then saying "" if you are able to, you should come by and then we'll discuss everything and I'll make sure you can also relax a bit, okay?"" I said ""will let you know then ☺️"" because again, I didn't really wanna go into it. Then he said ""I'm free the whole day tomorrow if you feel like making a little trip"" and here I *kinda* folded and said ""can I let you know tomorrow?""  He responded ""Yes, no problem at all. Now that I'm alone it will be better for me to have nice company on a saturday too.

Should I see this as a way of him saying he'll genuinely help me out, or is this an older man's way of manipulating a girl into coming over? I have to pay rent QUICK or my landlord will kick me out, and on top of that nobody will let me rent another place when seeing I was behind on rent with my previous place. Should I text him I'm coming by tomorrow? He is funny and I personally think he's attractive, but he's also way older so attractive or not, I do feel a bit intimidated.",28Aug2020,1

I live in a government housing apartment with about a dozen other apartments around mine. I went to about 3 of them and offered a reward of $600 to try to see if it turns up. I only had about $400 in my wallet but also had my ID, SS card, and some other important things hard or impossible to replace. I also already filed a police report, although they seemed not to care much and told me I could come back in a week to get a copy of the report and get a new ID and SS card. However, I still want to try and get my other stuff back that is also in the wallet instead of giving up. It matters more to me than the money.

956,"This is a throwaway account because it's something that is very personal. 

Anyway, a little backstory.

When I was young-ish (I think I was around 8-9), I hurt my best friend really badly (and I mean that she could have ended up in a hospital - thankfully, she didn't). The reason why, and I definitely don't want this to come across as an excuse (because I don't deserve an excuse because I hurt her so much), was because I saw that she hurt my close friend's sibling so I wanted to chase her away.

I seriously never planned her to get hurt - I believed that I could scare her and she'd run away, but I did something that I would regret for the rest of my life.
Now it's already been more than 10 years and I've finally decided to properly apologize. I know that whatever I say won't make her pain go away and that I absolutely do not deserve to be forgiven for what I did. I don't expect her to ever forgive me because I was still a bad person just a few years ago. But I want to apologize because I feel that she deserves at least that, I want to show her that I respect her and actually feel sorry about what I did.

I plan on sending her a message tomorrow to ask if we can meet up so I can apologize in person. I don't think that saying it over messages will get my feelings across properly.

So, basically, what I want to ask is: How do I properly apologize to a friend I hurt so much without any excuses, in a way that properly acknowledges her suffering?
And how do I show that I am willing to work on myself to become a better person so that I never hurt her or anyone again? How do I show my friend that I've actually changed?

I am sorry for the long post or broken English, it's not my native language. If you need more information, please feel free to ask me. And, if you yourself are a victim or someone who has hurt a close friend, please tell me what I can do to properly apologize and/or what I shouldn't do.

TL;DR: When I was younger, I physically (and probably emotionally) hurt my best friend and, after years of regret, decided to finally apologize. How do I properly apologize and show that I have grown as a person and would never repeat the same mistake?",28Aug2020,1
